The contribution of the ac conductance on the measurements allows the calculation of the interface traps density and the relevant time constant. The experimental data can be analysed using either a model based on the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination statistics or via the tunnelling process and recent results allowed both descriptions to be applied on various insulator/semiconductor structures. In the present investigation, the interface states for several MIS devices on a variety of thin film insulators deposited on Si substrates were studied. These devices included structures such as aC/Si, aC: H/Si, CN/Si and BaTiO 3/Si. Admittance spectroscopy took place and the SRH-based models as well as the tunnelling-based models were used \u2026",

The polymeric precursor gel was redissolved into glacial acetic acid to improve the wetting property of the spinning solution to the Si substrates (2.5-in. diameter). The morphology, composition, thickness, and refractive index of the films were investigated using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and ellipsometry. The films are found to be polycrystalline. They exhibit uniformity over the whole wafer in regard to thickness, composition, and absence of surface features. The capacitors constructed with the BTO films on Si were further investigated by electrical characterizations. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements reveal a leakage current due to a Poole-Frenkel mechanism. The energy \u2026",

Quantum noise is stochastically generated in quantum systems as decoherence, or during gate operations. The simulation is allowed for a single data block made of qubits. A simple quantum error correction protocol runs with a selected quantum error correction code and the module estimates the probability that the code will fail to work under particular noise regimes. The error correction protocol is described and the estimation method is analysed. The adopted module is integrated into QuCirDET maintaining its independence from the interface. The design tool can be used to create and test decoding schemes under different quantum codes.",

The estimation method is based on the success rate that the infrared patterns transmitted from two constant positions is received by the moving target. Several aspects of the reception such as the number of the expected, scrambled or out of order patterns that are recognised are considered. They are all playing an important role in determining the coordinates of the target. An ultra low cost system architecture based on commercial components is presented. A proper carrier filter of 1 MHz centre frequency is also studied in order to achieve fast coordinate estimation. The accuracy of the position estimation algorithm is also discussed with respect to the effect of the grid node distance.",

The modelling of the new devices needs to take into account the effects that the new dielectrics have on the MOS device performance. In this paper, we examine such effects in terms of both capacitance and leakage current effects. First, we investigate the role of the parasitic capacitances appearing at the MOS device due to either material related processes or metallization. These capacitances are modelled accordingly in order to derive the device characteristics. Then, leakage currents are taken into account and the whole device is simulated using a 90 nm technology based on the BSIM4 model equations, suitably modified to account for these effects. The application of such devices on memory circuits is examined in order to take \u2026",

The simulation results showed that, compared to the other examined works, the proposed circuit achieves reduction in power dissipation as high as 88% and reduction in power delay product, up to 93.0% while having the smallest transistor count.

In this work, the behavior of charge noise and spin noise for a fundamental logic unit of four qubit embedded in an AlAs/GaAs heterostructure is reported based on the modeling and simulation approach in the atomic level to provide a more in-depth analysis and evaluation of quantum noise.

The electrical measurements showed that the films deposited under a positive bias (#1) were insulators, while those with a negative one (#2) were semiconductors. Then, EPR spectra were taken in order to clarify the role the inter-atomic bonding formation can play on the electrical properties of the films. The results showed that the sp2\u2013sp3 ratio was 25:58 and 65:25, respectively, for the #1 and #2 films.

The support of this new memory is based on the automated generation of intra\u2010encoders that are adjacent to the memory fields. A test circuit, consisting of 16 memory fields, is developed in order to prove the correct operation of this new memory.

            "Abstract": "In this paper a technique for a quantum computer architecture is demonstrated using the discrete energy levels of an impurity doped semiconductor to represent the quantum computational basis. External signals are used to perform quantum logical gates and recombination mechanisms are suitably modelled in order to demonstrate quantum information processing. The physical mechanism which performs the logical equivalent of the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is presented along with a mechanism obtaining an output with a similar statistical behavior with the Hadamard Gate. The computational basis was checked for errors when used for solving a quantum algorithm. Hence, using suitable simulation on a silicon structure, the computational errors that degrade the quantum information processing are considered and computed. These error results are found to be fairly small.",

Nanostructuring can enhance the performance of functional materials and provides them with unique properties. Exceptional qualities of nanostructured materials compared to the bulk include: (i) increased surface-to-volume ratio, which provides more surface area for both chemical and physical interactions, (ii) significantly altered surface energies that allow tuning and engineering of the materials properties, as atomic species near the surface have different bond structures than those embedded in the bulk, and (iii) quantum confinement effects, due to the inherently small size of nanostructured materials, that significantly influences, charge transport, electronic band structure and optical properties.",

Using this method and dependent on the deposition conditions four classes of hot-wire (hw) tungsten oxide films were synthesized: i) stoichiometric (hwWO3), ii) oxygen deficient (sub-stoichiometric, hwWOx with x < 3), iii) stoichiometric and hydrogen doped (hwWO3:H), and iv) sub-stoichiometric and hydrogen doped (hwWOx:H). Due to the pulsed injection of O2 the W wire re-oxidizes during deposition thus creating WO3 vapors continuously, so films deposited by this method do not suffer by thickness limitations and, moreover, exhibit high porosity.

To overcome the problem of instant noise that appears despite the effective system shielding, we employ a number of rules that take into consideration the previous position estimations. These rules are based on the fact that the speed of the target is always limited and its track is smooth most of the time. The test for the rules was made by running a series of experiments on the sensors system, and as a result, we verified that the maximum absolute error in the experimental results \u2026",

This paper introduces a new 64-bit priority encoder based in a static-dynamic parallel priority lookahead architecture and a newly designed 4-bit PE cell.

The amount of error due to decoherence is estimated as a function of the input size and a lower bound for that size is given for which the proposed circuit can calculate in an error free mode, provided that in our simulated system the decoherence times for a single qubit (t\u03d5) predicted by Kane are applied. The numerical values are t\u03d5 = 103 sec, and for the error fidelity e = 10\u20105, which are within the limits of the values proposed by the Kane computer. Hence, in our case, compatibility between QCAs and Kane implementation is shown to be feasible. (\u00a9 2008 WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag GmbH & \u2026",

Improved current densities, luminances and efficiencies were achieved as a result of improved electron injection and transport at its interface with Al. The observed electron injection improvement is attributed to the lowering of the effective cathode interfacial barrier due to the occupation of gap states with electrons after partial reduction.",

The area of this plane can be up to 15m2, further expandable if multiple transmitters are used. The position estimation method is based on comparing the number of infrared patterns received to the expected ones in a specific time interval (success rate). Using this method, no signal strength or time of flight has to be precisely measured, leading to an ultra low cost architecture. A proper topology of the infrared transmitters that optimally cover the desired area is discussed. The history of movements of the target is utilized in order to reject false estimations. The error achieved is below the half of the grid node distance. (5 pages)",

            "Abstract": "Estimating the position of a robot, a vehicle or a person in an indoor area is a significant issue for a number of applications in Robotics, Automation and Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing. Several approaches have already been proposed in order to locate indoors the position of a moving target. These approaches rely on a wide range of media including RF signals, lasers, ultrasound, magnetic fields, visible light, infrared beams, speedometers etc. A combination of heterogeneous approaches is often adopted (Borenstein et al., 1996) in order to increase the accuracy of the position estimation. Cameras are widely used in a number of robotics applications (Jin et al, 2004);(Porta & Krose, 2006);(Clerentin et al, 2005);(Kzecka et al, 2005);(Gramegna et al, 2004);(Arras et al, 2001). The views captured by these cameras are processed in order to locate scale invariant landmarks that indicate the position of the robot in a familiar area (Tovar et al, 2006). Moreover, the function of the human eyes can be imitated by a pair of cameras focusing at the same direction (Seet al, 2002). The shape, the depth and the distance of the surrounding objects may be estimated by comparing the images retrieved by these cameras. It is obvious that both the computational and the architectural cost of such a solution is high. Laser scanning is often used in conjunction with the image processing techniques mentioned above (Miura et al, 2006);(Clerentin et al, 2005);(Victorino et al, 2003);(Arras et al, 2001);(Thrun, 2001).

            "Abstract": "A high-performance and energy-efficient 256-bit CMOS priority encoder is presented and realized on transistor level using 32 nm predictive technology. The new circuit is designed with a full custom approach and incorporates 2 novel logic styles: the Multiple-Output Monotonic CMOS (M2CMOS) and the Dynamic Inversion technique (DI). The achieved performance is in the order of O(log2(N)), with respect to the input size. A simulation-based comparative analysis concludes that, compared to the conventional design, the proposed circuit achieves up to 57% improvement in delay, 8% improvement in energy consumption and 39% improvement in EDP, while maintaining 20% smaller transistor count.",

First the single-electron NAND behaviour is studied and then the energy performance of the circuit is examined. The whole design and simulation is made using a Monte-Carlo based tool. The results proved that the circuits were behaving as NAND gates, while the free energy study of the system and the stability diagram verified the correct functioning of the circuit.",

            "Abstract": "Up to date, MOSFETs have been made through well established techniques that use SiO2 as the gate dielectric and the related design issues are well established. The need to scale down device dimensions allowed researchers to seek for alternative materials, in order to replace SiO2 as the gate dielectric. The implementation of such MOS devices in memory or logic circuits needs to take into account the effects that the use of the new gate dielectrics has on parameters such as the threshold voltage and the drain current. Hence, parameters such as the high dielectric constant values, extra oxide charges and process related defects at the physical level must be taken into account during the device design. As far as circuit applications are concerned, these changes may substantially affect the required performance. This paper presents and provides proposals about the issue of replacing commonly used parameters \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The location of the position of a moving target on a grid plane is studied in this paper. The estimation method is based on encountering the number of infrared patterns that arrive to the target as expected, unexpected or out of order. Since the position of the target is not determined by an analog signal intensity, no high precision sensors and measurements are required and the coordinate estimation can be carried out by a pair of transmitters and a pair of sensors on the moving target. The speed of the estimation is adjustable according to the desired accuracy. An error of less than 5% can be reached in most of the covered area. The presented system can be used in a number of automation, robotics, virtual reality and ubiquitous applications.",

            "Abstract": "In this letter, the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method and the ray-tracing (RT) technique are systematically revisited and compared as potential tools that can reliably characterize new protocols for emerging nanonetwork applications. To this aim, a set of efficient simulation schemes for the precise prediction of the reception quality in various communication scenarios is presented. In particular, each algorithm involves a similar configuration with a realistic transmitter/receiver model and multiple obstacles sized up to some micrometers. The proposed analysis reveals that, unlike conventional assessments, the RT approach can be successfully employed at nanoscale dimensions, with increasing accuracy at higher frequencies, as a tool for fast received-energy estimations, since its results are in acceptable agreement with the respective FDTD data. These significant deductions are, finally, substantiated by a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This brief introduces a mixed-logic design method for line decoders, combining transmission gate logic, pass transistor dual-value logic, and static complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS). Two novel topologies are presented for the 2-4 decoder: a 14-transistor topology aiming on minimizing transistor count and power dissipation and a 15-transistor topology aiming on high power-delay performance. Both normal and inverting decoders are implemented in each case, yielding a total of four new designs. Furthermore, four new 4-16 decoders are designed by using mixed-logic 2-4 predecoders combined with standard CMOS postdecoder. All proposed decoders have full-swinging capability and reduced transistor count compared to their conventional CMOS counterparts. Finally, a variety of comparative spice simulations at 32 nm shows that the proposed circuits present a significant improvement in power \u2026",

The application of them is considered for a popular branch of bioinformatics which analyzes massive amounts of sequence data for genes and proteins. More specific, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is studied under the more general term of local sequence alignment. The steps of this algorithm are totally reformed and powered by the quantum mechanics computing theory. The proposed method is based on R. Sch\u00fctzhold's pattern recognition quantum algorithm. A binary and unstructured data set is formed after the comparison of the sequences under alignment which is used by R. Sch\u00fctzhold's algorithm to identify and locate potential patterns. It is achieved with the aid of a spatial light modulator. The adopted quantum algorithm exhibits an exponential speed-up in \u2026",
