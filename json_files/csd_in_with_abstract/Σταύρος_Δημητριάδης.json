Using a one-factor design with a script and a control condition, students worked in small groups on a series of computer science problems requiring both domain-specific and domain-general knowledge. The scripted groups carried out peer reviews of their draft solutions. Scripted group members spent more time developing their solutions and reported a higher subjective learning outcome than control group members. Scripted groups acquired also significant domain-general knowledge on peer reviewing; however, there were no substantial differences with respect to the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge (as compared to control groups). Overall, the study provides evidence that students in computer \u2026",

However, studies on MOOCs\u2019 efficiency frequently report on the high dropout rates of enrolled students, and the lack of productive social interaction to promote the quality of MOOC-based learning. Conversational agents (CAs), on the other hand, appear to be a promising artificial intelligence (AI) technology with the potential of acting as catalysts of students\u2019 social interaction, a factor known to beneficially affect learning at many levels. Within this context the \u201ccolMOOC\u201d project has proposed and developed an agent-based tool and methodology for integrating flexible and teacher-configurable CAs along with relevant learning analytics services in MOOCs platforms, aiming to promote peer learning interactions. This chapter concisely presents the overall rationale of the project, the agent-based tools developed, and provides reflections on the first project outcomes emerging from four different pilot MOOCs offered so far. Early conclusions analyze the challenges for integrating a teacher-configured agent-chat service in MOOCs, provide helpful guidelines for efficient task design, and highlight promising evidence on the learning impact of participating in agent-chat activities.",

Learners who collaboratively argue about a subject are expected to acquire both knowledge and argumentation skills. However research indicates that we need to support both argument construction and collaboration. A form of support is employing computerized collaboration scripts to engage students in argumentation and regulate their activities. Such scripts have been proved to help students develop specific skills like the construction of single arguments or the argumentation sequence. Being an external support collaboration scripts should withdraw after students have internalized the skills they are supposed to, in order to be able to practice the acquired skills in similar tasks. To investigate the effect of scripting and fading on fostering argumentation skills we have built iArguea prototype web-based argumentation environment. In iArgue students are engaged in a jigsaw-type collaboration activity guided by a script that may gradually fade. The results from a preliminary expert-based evaluation were used to improve system design and propose for consideration ideas that could be taken into account when designing argumentation systems.",

To address this issue, they propose the MAPIS3 software architecture to efficiently manage the key problem in tool orchestration, which is the efficient data transfer among various tools used in e-collaboration activities. To evaluate their proposal, they present a case study of a flexible e-collaboration scenario that cannot be implemented automatically with any known architectures or tools. This scenario entails transfer and processing of students' collaboration data emerging originally in a chat tool to an IMS-LD compatible application (\u201cplayer\u201d) and, finally, to a Moodle installment forum. The overall implementation was evaluated both from the developer's and the student's perspective. Results indicate that seamless data flow establishing tool orchestration can \u2026",

Researchers suggest that micro-scripts should also withdraw (fade out) allowing students to practice their skills; however, studies that explore the impact of fading are scarce in the current literature. In order to explore the influence of fading on argumentation-based learning outcomes, we implemented two experimental research studies, using iArgue, a web-based argumentation tool. In our studies we implemented fading and also peer-monitoring as an additional technique to enhance domain-specific learning outcomes. The results from both studies revealed the value of this latter technique as students implementing peer-monitoring outperformed those in the control and the fading groups in knowledge acquisition.

Recently, on the basis of the classroom discourse framework of Academically Productive Talk (APT), a flexible form of conversational agent support has emerged employing APT-based intervention methods so as to stimulate pedagogically beneficial conversational interactions among learning partners. This paper investigates the impact of an APT-based Linking Contributions (LC) intervention mode implemented by a conversational agent in the context of a collaborative activity in higher education. This type of agent interventions encourages students to explicitly externalize their reasoning on important domain concepts building upon the contributions of their partners. Forty-three \u2026",

This prototype web-based system, named MentorChat, aims to induce learning-generating cognitive activity by prompting online learners' discussions. We evaluated the effect of the conversational agent on student learning in a collaborative context by conducting an experimental lab study. Two conditions were contrasted: (1) students who discussed online and provided an answer to a key domain issue guided only by a collaboration script (control condition), and (2) students who, along with the collaboration script, were prompted by the agent during their discussion, to elaborate on key domain concepts (treatment). Our findings suggest a positive learning effect of the treatment condition. They also indicate that the agent unsolicited prompts can improve \u2026",

An adaptable interface can appear as a reactive, coactive, proactive or enactive interface depending on the specific learning demands. Such an interface can also function as a metacognitive tool, enhancing users' understanding of the different modes of the instructional process depending on the varied socio-cognitive contextual factors. We present our very first theoretical considerations pertaining to such an integrative design framework and show how they can be applied in the algorithm visualization domain.",

However, although MOOCs have been reported as an efficient and important educational tool, there is a number of issues and problems related to their educational impact. More specifically, there is an important number of drop outs during a course, little participation, and lack of students\u2019 motivation and engagement overall. This may be due to one-size-fits-all instructional approaches and very limited commitment to student-student and teacher-student collaboration.

            "Abstract": "This chapter presents the conceptual framework, the research rationale and preliminary outcomes of an innovative research agenda that explores the use of tangible interface and robot programming tasks as a method for providing cognitive training to patients with memory dysfunctions. The main argument of this approach is that when programming tasks and relevant tangible systems are used for cognitive training they activate and practice users' logical-analytical and visuospatial skills, which may have beneficial impact on patients' cognitive performance in daily activities. The chapter also presents preliminary outcomes from a pilot study where eleven patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment participated in a robot programming training session using the PROTEAS prototype tangible interface. Results (both qualitative and quantitative) revealed a significant negative correlation between patients'\u201cTask \u2026",

This article aims to interpret the impact of analyzing learning data for tertiary education. The article describes a semester-long mixed methods study for 63 students enrolled in a Greek technical university laboratory, retrieving data from the learning management system (LMS). We applied minimal LA guidance in the experimental group and no LA guidance in the control group. The research questions are as follows: Can a student-facing learning analytics approach at minimal level guidance improve students' LMS access and learning performance levels? Are the students' LMS access, discussion forums, and submitted assignments, critical predictors for students' course grades? What are students' opinions about learning analytics as a tool for data-driven decision-making strategy? The study followed the do-analyze-change-reflect LA model. The data collected included students' time spent on LMS, exercises, and discussion posts, while the dependent variable was the course grade. Results indicate that it increased the students' LMS access and satisfaction when we applied LA but not their final grade. Future research could apply higher effort interventions and stronger teacher guidance to provide insights into student performance, engagement, and satisfaction.",

Half of the dyads (treatment group) were supported by a domainspecific adaptive intervention in the form of reminding prompts, while the rest of the dyads (control group) were supported by an informationally equivalent fixed form of support. Our main hypothesis was that the adaptive intervention would lead to better individual and group learning outcomes compared to the fixed one. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that (a) students in the treatment group outperformed those in the control group in domain knowledge acquisition,(b) dyads in the treatment group accomplished tasks more efficiently than the control dyads, and (c) dyads in the \u2026",

Open card sorting is a widely-used method to create information architectures based on users' groupings of the content. However, little is known about the method's cross-study reliability: Does it produce consistent content groupings for similar profile participants involved in different card sort studies? This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the method's cross-study reliability. Six card sorts involving 140 participants were conducted: three open sorts for a travel website, and three for an eshop. Results showed that participants provided highly similar card sorting data for the same content. A rather high agreement of the produced navigation schemes was also found. These findings provide support for the cross-study reliability of the open card sorting method.",

In the First study, the FS protocol was compared against the widely used assigned-pair (AP) one, where students work in instructor-defined dyads. In the Second study, further issues of the FS approach were evaluated, with our attention focused on students who, due to the freedom element of the protocol, do not receive reviews. Both studies paint a very promising picture of free-selection. However, several issues were also raised on how to effectively apply such a protocol.

The objective of the authors\u2019 effort is to improve the learning conditions when AV systems are used as online learning tools, avoiding situations where unguided collaboration may result in suboptimal peer interaction. Results from two studies are reported, where university students collaborated online following the steps of a reciprocal peer tutoring script and using two different AV systems to visualize their solutions on specific algorithm-related learning tasks. Discourse analysis based on an appropriately extended IBIS model and further statistical analysis indicate that the use of the collaboration script enhances the task-related peer interaction and consequently the intrinsic feedback that peers \u2026",

Furthermore, it provides high level system architecture to highlight key aspects of the technology infrastructure and the functionality of the software system. The rationale of the approach follows the tenets of several converging theoretical perspectives emphasizing the value of learners' dialogue and constructive argumentation as knowledge building processes during collaborative activities. The MOOC teacher (domain expert) is expected to play a key role by entering in the system conceptual links that guide the agent to make relevant questioning interventions. Thus, the agent tool is mediating group-teacher interactions in a MOOC environment aiming to increase the transactive quality of peer dialogue. The paper \u2026",

Collaboration scripts are didactic scenarios that guide and support the collaborative learning activity while adaptive collaboration scripting is the idea that computer-supported collaboration scripts can be adapted during run time, to provide learning experiences tailored to individual and group characteristics. An adaptation pattern is described as a well-defined adaptation process that can be initiated by the system when specific conditions are identified during script implementation. In order to model the proposed method twelve postgraduate students were engaged in a pyramid-type collaboration script and the analysis of the learning experience provided the basis for identifying a number of possible adaptation patterns. The paper discusses also next steps for advancing the design and evaluation of adaptation patterns in systems for scripted collaboration.",

In order to investigate how and when adaptive interventions in CSCL settings are effective, we implemented two experimental research studies, using a freely available open source tool (LAMS), trying to identify the effectiveness of a particular adaptive domain-specific support strategy. In both studies, treatment student groups were supported by a domain-specific adaptive intervention, where control groups were supported by \u201cfixed\u201d support methods. The results from both studies revealed that treatment students outperformed those in the control group in domain knowledge acquisition.

By rooting this question in a generational tension Hannah Arendt in her seminal essay The Crisis in Education presents us with a practical and theoretical challenge. It is the challenge of reconciling ourselves with the world and with the challenge of having brought a new generation into the world. She does however leave us very few clues as to how it might be lived out in practice, the psychological and practical elements of the educational process if you will.",

In our work we present a next step in our pattern-based approach demonstrating how educators' ideas can provide the basis for adaptation patterns which, in turn, can be implemented using IMS-LD. We analyze what is necessary for implementing an adaptation pattern and discuss the benefits of the pattern-based approach.

This workshop is the second in a series that began on 2009 with the successful organization of the 1st IWASCL in the context of INCoS-2009 conference in Barcelona, Spain. This year the 2nd edition of the workshop is organized again in conjunction with the INCoS conference in Thessaloniki, Greece. The focus of the workshop is on adaptive systems for collaborative learning. Lately, a significant research interest has emerged on how to integrate adaptive and intelligent methods in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) systems to successfully support groups of learners. Adaptive and intelligent support emerges as an important aspect in CSCL since research has consistently emphasized that free collaboration conditions fail to engage all team members in productive learning interactions and, conversely, excessively imposed non-adaptive (\u201cfixed\u201d) guidance may \u2026",

The research addressed questions in CSCL including\u2013among others-how groups and individuals learn through peer interaction using specific tools, how small groups interact and develop shared meanings over time, how teachers orchestrate collaborative learning activities in the classroom with the support of technology, how institutions change and create new conditions for teaching and learning, and even how the opportunities for learning change as society adopts new models for education. Following the constructivistic and socio-cultural approaches in learning, numerous CSCL tools have been designed, developed and tested over the years. Although they can be classified in various ways, the distinction between systemic and dialogic types of tools and approaches is adopted in this paper \u2026",

However, current research strongly emphasizes the need for game-relevant pedagogical approaches that foster learners\u2019 essential knowledge construction and development of transferable skills. From another perspective, during the last twenty, or so, years technology-enhanced learning has witnessed the advent of the computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) domain. Collaborative learning refers to a variety of educational practices in which peer interactions are considered as the key factor in learning, while the term \u201ccomputer-supported\u201d refers to using technology tools to facilitate, support and guide interactions among both remotely located students (online interactions) and/or co-located students (face-to-face interactions). Relevant research stresses the fact that freely collaborating students usually fail to engage in productive learning interactions when left without teachers\u2019 consistent support and scaffolding. As a remedy it has been proposed that teachers support learners by implementing specific didactic scenarios (collaboration scripts) which trigger and guide peer interaction. Collaboration scripts aim to engage students by providing explicit collective workflow description and guidance (for example, by assigning student roles) during the collaborative activity. This work suggests that scripted collaboration offers a promising pedagogical framework for efficient game design and game-based learning. To substantiate this claim the paper first reviews \u2026",

However, there are also voices calling for attention on the issue of sacrificing the \u201cfun and creativity of free collaboration\u201d to attain effectiveness. Computer-supported scripting has been criticized for its loss of flexibility and also the danger of \u201cover-scripting\u201d the collaborative activity. The need has also been emphasized to differentiate between flexibility loss that is due to pedagogical design and undesired constraints of computerbased scripting techniques. At the same time, suggestions for more adaptive and intelligent forms of CSCL scripting are already on the table.

            "Abstract": "Research in the field of Second Language Acquisition has repeatedly highlighted the importance of conversational interactions between students working together in small groups. Particularly, peer dialogue can play a vital role in intellectual development and language acquisition. Thus, we argue that the use of a conversational agent, designed to advance peer interaction and cognitive activity, would enhance learning outcomes related to language learning. In this work, we describe the design of a web-based collaborative system that utilizes a configurable conversational agent, which facilitates and triggers the learners' discussion. We also present an exploratory case study that was conducted in an English language school. Our analysis indicates a positive effect regarding the usability and user acceptance of the system.",

The pedagogical rationale of this idea is to bring together and reap the benefits of two important learning design approaches, namely adaptation of the learning environment and scripted collaborative learning. In this chapter we analyze some of the major pedagogical and technical issues related to the design and development of systems for adaptive collaboration scripting (ACS systems). At pedagogical level, we provide methodological steps on how to build systems for adaptive collaboration scripting, explaining why it is important to distinguish between \u201cintrinsic\u201d and \u201cextrinsic\u201d aspects of the script.

Collaboration scripts are didactic scenarios that prescribe learners\u2019 interactions in collaborative settings. A script comprises a number of phases and each phase specifies the activity that learners have to perform, the composition of the group, the distribution of the activity, the mode of interaction and the phase duration. Scripts can also be positioned along various design dimensions, such as their granularity, coercion degree and locus of control. The presented ontology is being developed with the purpose of formalizing scripts in order to promote their reusability and portability between various computer-supported learning platforms. We discuss design decisions and illustrate how this ontology could be beneficial when embedded in a knowledge-based system that supports collaborative learning.",

Quantitative and qualitative analysis were based on Fun Toolkit survey, interviews, computer logs, and video records. Usability analysis focused on retention, error rate, and \u2026",

In this chapter, the MAPIS3 software architecture is suggested as a flexible solution to manage the key problem in tool orchestration, which is the efficient data transfer among various tools used in e-collaboration activities. The proposal is assessed by two case studies of flexible e-collaboration scenarios that cannot be implemented automatically with any known architectures or tools. These scenarios entail transfer and transformation of students' collaboration data through an IMS-LD compatible \u201cplayer.\u201d The data emerge originally to a specific tool and are transferred to another tool. The overall implementations were evaluated from the developers', the instructors', and the students' perspectives. Results indicate that MAPIS3 supports seamless data flow among tools \u2026",

Fifty senior university students participated in a project-based course with two key organizational features: first, a web system (PEGASUS) was developed to help students identify their learning styles and distribute them to heterogeneous groups. Second, group facilitation meetings were introduced as a technique to help students reflect on their weak/strong traits and employ appropriate roles in their group. The study research questions focused mainly on students\u2019 attitudes regarding the learning style-based group formation approach. By applying qualitative research method students\u2019 views were recorded about the impact of styles awareness and group heterogeneity on group collaboration and possible benefits and drawbacks related to the style-based grouping approach \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Argumentative knowledge construction is an important component of critical thinking. Learners who collaboratively argue about a subject can potentially develop domain knowledge and have the opportunity to use evidence critically in order to make sense of the subject under consideration. Moreover learners have to take into account claims and evidence of each other during argumentation and in this way they develop mental models for argument construction and sequence. However, research indicates that learners tend to be inconsistent in distinguishing claims and theories from evidence that support them. Furthermore they rarely know how to efficiently construct knowledge through argumentation. In this regard, the use of collaboration scripts can assist learners to understand and participate in argumentative discourse while facilitating the process of argumentative knowledge construction. Unfortunately, this need for scripting argumentation is poorly reflected in the design of computer-based environments which mostly do not incorporate scripts. This paper provides a unifying view of the functional characteristics of existing argumentation tools and also analyzes the major features of collaboration scripts. Furthermore the paper presents a proposed system architecture for a computer-based tool that supports argumentative knowledge construction integrating also collaboration scripts for guiding students\u2019 individual and group work. The architecture provides a coarse-grained description of the system components and describes user facilities that need to be considered in a script-based system.",

            "Abstract": "The advent of computer technology offers the opportunity for developing multimodal, dynamic and interactive representations of knowledge which are expected to significantly enhance learning. This chapter presents an overview of the pedagogical effectiveness of the algorithm visualization systems, which make use of dynamic visual representations for supporting the instruction in the domain of computer algorithms. The author highlights the most important conceptual and methodological advances in the field, analyzing the properties of the representations that are usually displayed by such systems and presenting significant research results concerning their pedagogical efficiency. Available studies indicate that it is not the quality of the graphical display (\u201cwhat the students see\u201d) but students\u2019 engagement in active learning situations with algorithm visualization systems (\u201cwhat the students do\u201d), that substantially affects the learning outcomes. Moreover, it seems that a significant level of learning is achieved when algorithm visualization systems are integrated in instructional settings which follow the constructivist paradigm. In this case students are guided not simply to view experts\u2019 visualizations and interact with them but also to construct their own and present them to peers, thus initiating fruitful knowledge building conversations. In this way algorithm visualization systems are better conceptualized as \u201cconstruction supporting\u201d tools than simply as \u201cknowledge conveyors\u201d. Towards enhancing this role of the software it seems that \u201clow-tech and fidelity\u201d AV construction systems may be quite adequate for supporting students\u2019 engagement in essential \u2026",

Within this area, Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) have a prominent position for two major reasons:(a) their ability to incorporate novel technologies and (b) their ability to provide intuitive computer interfaces for youngsters. In particular infants and children of nursery school age are more used to tangible objects than to software elements. A consequence of the above is that innovation in the TUI arena produces interesting prototypes that very often evolve into commercial products. Therefore, an analysis of TUI innovation ideas and their implementations, combined with attempts to use them in commercial activities related to children fun and education, will show how modern \u2026",

Two groups of students studied learning material using a web environment designed for supporting case-based learning. The first group followed a non-scaffolded individual mode of study while students in the second group were guided by a collaboration script to work (in dyads) on the case material. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences in the learning outcomes of the two groups. Qualitative analysis (based on students' interviews and field observations) revealed that students' self-organization resulted to a broad range of actual script implementation ranging from full conformance to partial violation of the script guidelines.

Adaptive collaboration scripting is the idea that collaboration scripts can be adapted during run time in several of their aspects, to provide learning experiences tailored to individual and group characteristics. In order to build systems that support this type of adaptation, one needs to implement adaptation models that consider both the user characteristics (at individual and/or group level) and the script features. Especially for the latter, it is important to distinguish between ldquointrinsicrdquo and ldquoextrinsicrdquo aspects of the script, identifying what aspects should be considered as non-adaptable core script features and what aspects are negotiable and adaptable.

We start by identifying a pervasive underlying distinction into dyadic and triadic views of representation which triggers the question of the role of culture and context in the study of the construction and the interpretation of digital representations. Three issues are discussed in more depth: learning with a multiplicity of digital representations, adjusting the representational density of digital representations and externalizing symbolic processing to the computer. Based on these issues, we conjecture that the future of digital learning might require bringing together a variety of spheres of representational practice, namely those of domain experts, teachers and learners, as well as those of researchers and developers in the field \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The use of case-based learning environments (CBLEs) is expected to benefit students by guiding them to study contextually rich real world situations. However, efficient design approaches are needed to support students\u2019 processing of the complex material embedded in a CBLE. In this work we argue that, in designing technology-enhanced CBLEs, scripts and narrative can be regarded as effective external representations, in that they support learning from multimedia cases by fostering students\u2019 context awareness. As an application case, we present the design of e-CASE (Context Awareness Supporting Environment), a CBLE supporting instruction in the domain of software project development.",

The scope of the document is twofold:(a) To set the conceptual framework and present in an organized manner the basic theoretical issues (concepts and methods) of the research field, and (b) To analyze representative cases, highlighting the way that these theoretical issues apply in the design of multimedia instructional software/artifacts. The document comprises eleven (11) chapters. The chapters introduce the reader both to the abstracted and elaborate knowledge of the domain and to the discussion of how theoretical concepts fruitfully apply in the design process. Chapter 1 is strongly theory oriented presenting a core of well established theoretical issues (concepts and methods). All other chapters extend this core either by elaborating the theoretical considerations (such as chapters 2, 3) or by focusing on the pedagogical benefits resulting from domain and instructional approach specific representations (chapters 4, 5, 6), or by making a theoryinformed analysis of the representations that are employed in various multi-representational instructional systems (chapters 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).",

Students of an elementary school were divided into three study groups ('Control','Selecting', and'Writing') that implemented activities based on the same teacher guidance while prompted to provide responses of different modalities. The purpose was to engage students in the development of computational thinking skills, focusing on the basic skills of abstraction, generalization, algorithm, modularity, and debugging. These skills were evaluated at different phases during the activity, using different modality (selection, written, and oral) assessment tools. The results suggest that (1) prompting and eliciting thoughts in the form of written or selected answers proves to be a beneficial strategy, and (2) the two groups,\u2018Writing'and \u2018Selecting', reach the same level of CT skills \u2026",

An exploratory study is presented featuring 56 undergraduate computer science students, who interacted with a conversational agent in the context of an online course. The study investigates the practicability of using configurable conversational agents to provide collaborative learning support and serves as an opportunity to compare two intervention strategies: (a) converging agent interventions, presented in the form of tips relating closely to the topic of the activity and (b) diverging agent interventions, which do not relate directly to the activity topic and pose new domain-relevant questions.

Based on field research evidence, four principles are suggested and discussed, namely \u201cScript Appropriation\u201d, \u201cRole as Script Configuration Cue\u201d, \u201cCoercion on Explicitness\u201d and \u201cTask to foster Transactivity\u201d principles. The key conceptualization set forth by these principles is that: (a) learners\u2019 implementation of a script is a socially negotiated process; (b) a role assigned to a student may also affect other partners\u2019 internal script induction/configuration; (c) teachers\u2019 interventions to coerce students on being explicit and implement \u2018transactivity fostering\u2019 tasks may have a significant impact on learning outcomes.
