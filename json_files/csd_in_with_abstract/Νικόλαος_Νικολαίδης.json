First, we develop a mathematical framework so as to determine hardware camera requirements (specifically, focal length), on a representative case study, ie, orbiting a still or moving target. Second, we examine the on-board software requirements in order to successfully achieve autonomous target following. To this end, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art realtime 2D visual trackers in videos captured by commercial drones. Overall, it was found that state-of-the-art 2D visual trackers are dependable and fast enough to be used in drone cinematography, particularly when combined with periodic target re-detection. A proposed variant of the Staple tracker achieved the best balance between real-time performance and tracking accuracy, on a dataset composed of 31 sports videos recorded by commercial drones.",

A copyright protection method that is based on hiding an \u2018invisible\u2019 signal, known as digital watermark, in the image is presented in this paper. Watermark casting is performed in the spatial domain by slightly modifying the intensity of randomly selected image pixels. Watermark detection does not require the existence of the original image and is carried out by comparing the mean intensity value of the marked pixels against that of the pixels not marked. Statistical hypothesis testing is used for this purpose. Pixel modifications can be done in such a way that the watermark is resistant to JPEG compression and lowpass filtering.

Two approaches for blind robust watermarking of audio signals are presented in this chapter. Both approaches use chaotic maps for the generation of the watermark signals and a correlation-based watermark detection procedure. The first method is a zero-bit method that embeds high-frequency chaotic watermarks in the low frequencies of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) domain, thus achieving reliable detection and robustness to a number of attacks. The second method operates on the temporal domain and robustly embeds multiple bits of information in the host signal.

Its only requirement is that both decomposition factors are nonnegative. To approximate the original data, the minimization of the NMF objective function is performed in the Euclidean space, where the difference between the original data and the factors can be minimized by employing  L 2 -norm. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the NMF algorithm by translating the objective function into a Hilbert space (also called feature space) under nonnegativity constraints.

In this sense, the watermarking techniques form a subset of information hiding techniques, which also include cases where the hidden information is not related to the host medium. This chapter reviews the main application domains of watermarking. Properties and classification schemes of watermarking techniques are presented followed by the basic functional modules of a watermarking scheme.

A 3D deformable surface model is used to approximate the image intensity and the introduced discrete transform is an intermediate step of the explicit surface deformation governing equations. The proposed transform is applied to lossy image compression and the obtained results are compared to those of a DCT-based compression scheme.",

The final data representation is a linear combination of the projections of all data representations.

Semantic visual information about humans, more specifically face occurrences in video frames, along with a generative probabilistic model, namely the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are used for this purpose. The latent variables, namely the video topics are modeled as a mixture of distributions of faces in each video. The method also involves a clustering approach based on Scale Invariant Features Transform (SIFT) for clustering the detected faces and adapts the bag-of-words concept into a bag-of-faces one, in order to ensure exchangeability between topics distributions. Experimental results, on three different data sets, provide low misclassification rates of the order of 2% and false rejection rates of 0%.

Synchronization mismatch is detected based on the motion inconsistencies of feature points between the stereoscopic channels in a short time frame. Stereoscopic window violation is detected, using connected component analysis, when objects hit the vertical frame boundaries while being in front of the virtual screen.

AVDP was designed by having mainly single channel videos in mind. Thus, in order to utilize it for the description of stereoscopic video and multichannel audio content, a number of implementation decisions, that cater to the particularities of such content (storage of stereoscopic quality information, relations between entities in the various channels etc) had to be taken and will be presented in this contribution. Examples of using AVDP to describe the results of analysis algorithms on stereo video and multichannel audio content will be presented. Additionally, several Classification Schemes used in the proposed framework will be discussed, since some terms may be useful in other applications. Finally, the contribution will include a discussion on possible extensions/modifications of the MPEG-7 standard or the AVDP profile to better cover the needs of stereoscopic and mutiview content description.

The strength of audio signal modifications is limited by the necessity to produce an output signal that is perceptually similar to the original one.

The watermark signal is generated using a key, i.e., a single number known only to the copyright owner. Watermark embedding depends on the audio signal amplitude and frequency in a way that minimizes the audibility of the watermark signal. The embedded watermark is robust to common audio signal manipulations like MPEG audio coding, cropping, time shifting, filtering, resampling, and requantization.",

Dense trajectories are used to represent the depth video data. Skeletal data are represented by vectors of skeleton joints positions and their forward differences in various temporal scales. The extracted features are encoded using either Bag of Words (BoW) or Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) approaches. Finally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification. Experiments were performed on three datasets, namely MSR Action3D, MSR Action Pairs and Florence3D in order to measure the performance of the methods. The proposed approaches outperform all state of the art action recognition methods that operate on depth video/skeletal data in the most challenging and fair experimental setup of the MSR Action3D dataset.

This displacement information is obtained in a preprocessing step, where object displacement is estimated via feature extraction and matching. In parallel, disparity information is extracted and utilized in the same framework.

A ternary watermark is embedded in the 3D model using geometric deformations of the vertices, without altering the vertex topology. Prior to embedding and detection the model is rotated and translated so that its center of mass and its principal axis coincide with the origin and the z-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. This transformation grants the method robustness to translation and rotation. Robustness to scaling is achieved by restricting the vertex deformations to occur only along the r coordinate of the corresponding (r,, \u03c6) spherical coordinates system. Simulation results indicate the ability of the proposed method to deal with the aforementioned attacks giving more than satisfactory results.",

A novel set of multiplicative update rules is proposed, which is independent from any kind of learning rate parameter, provides computational efficiency compared to the conventional batch training approach and is easy to implement.

A GVF-snake was used in order to find the silhouette of the user. From the silhouette features like position where the person is standing, the position of the fingertip, and the position of the shoulder are extracted, tracked and used to construct a feature vector for each video frame. This vector is fed to properly trained multi-class support vector machines (SVM) in order to obtain the 2D position of the target point on the screen. Two different camera setups with different feature vector configurations are proposed and tested.

NMS aims to prune the number of overlapping detected candidate regions-of-interest (ROIs) on an image, in order to assign a single and spatially accurate detection to each object. The default NMS algorithm (GreedyNMS) is fairly simple and suffers from severe drawbacks, due to its need for manual tuning. A typical case of failure with high application relevance is pedestrian/person detection in dense human crowds, where GreedyNMS doesn't provide accurate results. This paper proposes an efficient deep neural architecture for NMS in the person detection scenario, by capturing relations of neighbouring ROIs and aiming to ideally assign precisely one detection per person. The presented Seq2Seq-NMS architecture assumes a sequence-to-sequence formulation of the NMS problem, exploits the Multihead Scale \u2026",

Copyright protection is achieved by embedding an \"invisible\" signal, known as digital signature, in the digital image.

Signature detection is done by comparing the mean intensity value of the marked pixels against that of the not marked pixels. Statistical hypothesis testing is used for this purpose. The signature can be designed in such a way that it is resistant to JPEG compression and lowpass filtering. This is done by minimizing the energy content of the signature signal in higher frequencies. Experiments on real image data verify the effectiveness of the method.",

Autonomous UAV function-alities are already being employed to a degree, in a manner structured mainly around visual target tracking. From a cinematographic point of view, the desired shot type (i.e., Close-Up, Long Shot, etc.) is the most important factor affecting the artistic result. Achieving a specific shot type depends on the target-to-camera distance and the camera focal length. However, the interaction between UAV/camera motion trajectory (e.g., Orbit, Chase, etc.) and the visual tracker requirements constrains the range of feasible shot types at each time instance.

Our aim is to provide means of using AVDP in such a way that 3D video content can be correctly and consistently described. Since, AVDP semantics do not include ways for dealing with 3D video content, a new semantic framework within AVDP is proposed. Finally, we show some examples of using AVDP to describe the results of semantic analysis algorithms on stereo video content.",

Facial video segment classification is subsequently performed using the state-of-the-art classification algorithms. Experimental results on one publicly available V-VAD dataset denote the effectiveness of the proposed method, since it achieves better generalization performance in unseen users, when compared to the recently proposed state-of-the-art methods.

For this purpose, content-based systems can be an efficient alternative to watermarking. Rather than imperceptibly embedding a signal, content-based systems rely-on image similarity. Certain content-based systems use adaptive classifiers to detect replicas. In such systems, a suspect image is tested against every original, which can become computationally prohibitive as the number of original images grows. In this paper, we propose using R-tree indexing to decrease the necessary number of comparisons and rapidly select the most likely originals. Experimental results show that the proposed system performs very satisfactorily and that up to 99.3% of the originals can be discarded before applying the binary classifiers.",

In this work, semantic shot selection based on the narrative prominence of movie characters in both the visual and the audio modalities is investigated, without the need for additional data such as a script. The output is a movie summary that only contains video frames from selected movie shots. Selection is controlled by a user-provided shot retention parameter, that removes key-frames/key-segments from the skim based on actor face appearances and speech instances.

In such schemes, a fragile signal that is sensitive to manipulations is embedded in the image, so that it becomes undetectable after any modification of the original work. Most algorithms focus either on the ability to retrieve the original work after watermark detection (invertibility) or on detecting which image parts have been altered (localization). Furthermore, the majority of fragile watermarking schemes suffer from robustness flaws. We propose a new technique that combines localization and invertibility. Moreover, watermark dependency on the original image and the non-linear watermark embedding procedure guarantees that no malicious attacks will manage to create information leaks.",

The proposed method constructs a pose correspondence matrix to represent the similarity between poses and utilizes an intuitive method for estimating a similarity score between two motion capture sequences, based on the structure of the correspondence matrix. The second algorithm is based on a Bag of Words model (BoW), where histograms are extracted from motion sequences, based on the frequency of occurrences of characteristic poses.

The scope of this work is to define requirements for a system aimed at supporting a real professional production based on an ideal multi-drone system. The rationale of this choice is that at this stage MULTIDRONE wants to produce a complete overview of the challenges, limits, constraints and possibilities offered by the implied technologies (eg, autonomous flight systems, computer vision, automated control, efficient human-in-the-loop tools, integration with media production tools and processes) and put them in the context of real industrial processes and use cases.

The algorithm employs Local Steering Kernel features and 2-dimensional color-disparity histograms for object texture description. The proposed framework requires no information about the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the stereo camera system. Therefore, it can be applied on 3D video content captured by commercial stereo cameras, as well as 3D movies and 3D TV programs. Experiments showed that the proposed method is effective in tracking objects under partial occlusion and changes in the object view angle.",

Twelve cows were examined once a month from the second week after insemination throughout gestation. Further daily examination starting from day 4 ante partum until partum was performed in seven of them. All images were captured from the pregnant uterus horn (major curvatura). The mean measurement out of 3 images taken was used. At the time of examination blood samples were collected and P4 and E1, 2 concentrations were determined (RIA). Special software for image analysis (ECHOVET 2.0) was used for image elaboration. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA and Pearson\u2019s correlation of the means across time. P4 and E1, 2 concentrations were found similar to those described in literature. Significant changes were noticed throughout the study in the defined echostructure variables: Mean Grey Value (MGV), Contrast (CON) and Homogeneity (HOMO)(all P< 0.001). P4 concentrations were positively correlated with MGV and CON (R= 0.78 and R= 0.79, respectively) and negatively correlated with HOMO (R=-0.73). E1, 2 concentrations were negatively correlated with MGV and CON (R=-0.72 and R=-0.68, respectively) and positively with HOMO (R= 0.73). Results from the present study suggest that echostructure values can be used for the detection of changes in the endometrium during pregnancy and that these changes have an association with P4 and E1, 2 concentrations.",

Research on video summarization has mainly relied on global clustering or local (frame-by-frame) saliency methods to provide automated algorithmic solutions for key-frame extraction. This work presents a method based on selecting as key-frames video frames able to optimally reconstruct the entire video. The novelty lies in modelling the reconstruction algebraically as a Column Subset Selection Problem (CSSP), resulting in extracting key-frames that correspond to elementary visual building blocks. The problem is formulated under an optimization framework and approximately solved via a genetic algorithm.

For this purpose, we investigate the effective coupling of multidimensional indexing and machine learning approaches and we aim to achieve replica detection through the training of classifiers with distortions expected in a replica. Visual descriptors are indexed using an R-tree based multidimensional structure for fast image retrieval. Cases unsuccessfully handled by the R-tree are resolved by a multiclass classifier operating on the transformed feature space that results from the application of linear discriminant \u2026",

This paper introduces a new technique for watermarking city maps by altering a basic parameter of a road segment, namely its width to length ratio. A watermark is embedded in the map using an appropriate quantization of this ratio. The watermarked map retains its visual quality since the quadrilateral shape of the buildings and their alignment with road boundaries are maintained. The proposed approach performs blind detection through correlation of the detected watermark with the watermark under investigation and is robust against several attacks such as rotation, translation, uniform scaling and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).",

Then, these heatmaps are back-projected onto the 3D terrain of the navigation environment. The projected crowd heatmaps are fused by exploiting a Bayesian filtering approach that favors newer crowd observations over older ones.

Both statistical and structural pattern recognition domain techniques are applied. Tracking is performed by representing the image intensity by a\u00a6 \u00a7 deformable surface model and then, exploiting a by-product of explicit surface deformation governing equations in order to find and track salient image features. The presented system can detect and track multiple human faces and handle tracking failures (eg due to occlusions).

This is in contrast with frame-based video object detection, where the goal is to find the location of the object of interest in the scene without using its motion information. An obvious advantage of object tracking over object detection is that, in the case of multiple objects, the former can often provide automatic object labelling as they move over time. Additionally, one of the motivations behind object tracking is that object detection is frequently computationally slow or prone to detection errors. Even in the case that object detection is the final goal, tracking can significantly reduce the search region within a frame and, hence, the computations required. The output of an object \u2026",

Although these techniques are closely related to each other since they impose certain common non-negative constraints, the decomposition process of each algorithm involves a different objective function. While NMF approximates in the best possible way the data matrix by the product of its decomposition factors imposing only nonnegative constraints, LNMF adds more constraints on the basis images to reduce the redundant information between them and to enlarge their sparseness degree. DNMF imposes more constraints on the coefficients in order to take into account class information. In this paper these methods are used in the context of face recognition to extract features from two image databases (YALE and ORL). Extracted features are further classified by two metric-based classifiers, namely Maximum Correlation Classifier (MCC) and Cosine Similarity Measure (CSM). Besides, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are also used for classification. Experiments show that when these algorithms are applied along with the aforementioned classifiers, to face recognition task they lead to quite different results, their performance being data dependent.",

            "Abstract": "The increasing computational complexity of label propagation-based facial image annotation when applied on multimedia data whose cardinality increases over the time (e.g., when analyzing video or movie content on-line), can be reduced by using an incremental approach. In this paper, a method for incremental label propagation on facial images is described. The similarity matrix is incrementally constructed by employing the kd-tree nearest neighbor algorithm. Furthermore, the matrix inversion, which is included in the label propagation solution, is calculated with a block-wise inversion formula involving the Woodbury matrix identity. Experiments show significant computational savings when the incremental approach is applied on a dataset of three full length movies. Moreover, the classification accuracy was improved in most cases.",

Identification of the position of each camera with respect to the subject's body is achieved by a procedure based on morphological operations and the proportions of the human body. Binary body masks from frames of all cameras, consistently arranged through the previous procedure, are concatenated to produce the so-called multi-view binary mask. These masks are rescaled and vectorized to create feature vectors in the input space. Fuzzy vector quantization is performed to associate input feature vectors with movement representations and linear discriminant analysis is used to map movements in a low dimensionality discriminant feature space. Experimental results show that the method can achieve very satisfactory recognition rates.",

The analysis involves theoretical evaluation of the system detection reliability, when a correlator detector is used. The effect of distortions (lowpass filtering, noise corruption of the watermarked data) on the detection reliability is also theoretically investigated. The system is modeled in a communication framework considering the signal as interference and converting the addressed problem to the detection of the underlying watermark signal. The aim of the paper is two-fold:(i) to introduce the n-way Bernoulli shift generated chaotic watermarks and theoretically contemplate their properties with respect to detection reliability and (ii) to theoretically establish their potential superiority against the widely used (pseudo-) random watermarks. An important property of Bernoulli watermarks is their controllable spectral/correlation properties that renders them ideal for a variety of applications. Bernoulli watermarks can be generated with lowpass spectral properties to withstand lowpass attacks. When no distortions are to be inflicted, white spectrum Bernoulli watermarks can be generated so that their performance converges to that of random watermarks. Experimental verification of the theoretical analysis results has been performed as well.",

We use the bag-of-words concept, (bag-of-faces in our case) in order to ensure exchangeability of the latent variables (e.g. topics). The video topics are modeled as a mixture of distributions of faces in each video. This generative probabilistic model has already been used in the case of text modeling with good results.

The proposed technique also uses connected components evaluation on the thresholded gradient image in order to discover connected regions of sufficient size for landing. Moreover, man-made structures and vegetation areas are detected and excluded from the potential landing sites.

In this paper, we propose four algorithms that exploit available stereo disparity information, in order to detect disturbing stereoscopic effects, namely, stereoscopic window violations, bent window effects, uncomfortable fusion object objects, and depth jump cuts on stereo videos. After detecting such issues, the proposed algorithms characterize them, based on the stress they cause to the viewer's visual system. Qualitative representative examples, quantitative experimental results on a custom-made video data set, a parameter sensitivity study, and comments on the computational complexity of the algorithms are provided, in order to assess the \u2026",

We have developed an indexing and retrieval method that uses the pre-extracted output of face detection and recognition to perform fast semantic indexing and retrieval of video segments.

Its goal is to drastically prune the number of overlapping detected candidate regions-of-interest (ROIs) and replace them with a single, more spatially accurate detection. The default algorithm (Greedy NMS) is fairly simple and suffers from drawbacks, due to its need for manual tuning. Recently, NMS has been improved using deep neural networks that learn how to solve a spatial overlap-based detections rescoring task in a supervised manner, where only ROI coordinates are exploited as input. In this paper, neural NMS performance is augmented by feeding the network additional information extracted from the appearance of each candidate ROI. This information captures statistical properties regarding the spatial distribution of interest-points detected within the corresponding image region. Thus, the deviation in 2D \u2026",

A family of chaotic maps, namely the skew tent map family, is used to verify the theoretical analysis. Skew tent chaotic sequences are compared against the widely used pseudorandom sequences, indicating the superiority of the former in watermarking applications. The minimum number of samples required for reliable watermark detection is also investigated. Experiments using audio data are conducted to verify the theoretical analysis results.",

Kernel k-Means is a state of the art clustering algorithm, which employs the kernel trick, in order to perform clustering on a higher dimensionality space, thus overcoming the limitations of classic k-Means regarding the non linear separability of the input data. Kernel k-Means typically computes the kernel matrix, which contains the results of the kernel function for every possible sample combination.

This demand has been lately addressed by the emergence of a variety of watermarking methods. Such methods target towards hiding in the original data an imperceptible and undetectable signal which conveys information about the host medium (owner or authorized user, transaction or product ID, etc). For a review of existing schemes and a detailed discussion on the main requirements of a watermarking scheme, the interested reader may consult [5, 9].The field of nonlinear dynamics which has its roots in the work of French mathematician H. Poincar\u00e9 (1854\u20131912) is dealing with the study of the systems whose time evolution equations are of nonlinear nature. Under certain conditions, some nonlinear systems give rise to chaos, that is, a complex, aperiodic, and apparently random behavior. However, neither is the random and complex behavior of chaotic systems the result of uncontrolled external factors, namely, noise, nor is it necessarily attributed to the complexity of the system; most chaotic systems are deterministic in nature and can be described by very simple equations. Chaotic behavior can result, for example, from the iterative application of an appropriate nonlinear scalar map f (\u00b7):",

This is what gives it its semantic richness, as semantic content can vary enormously over the duration of a video sequence.

The basic concepts and principles that are involved in the temporal segmentation of digital video are derived from the art of creating motion pictures. There, directors andfilm editors perceptually segment their motion pictures into a hierarchy of scenes and shots.

Particular emphasis is given to the circular median filter, for which some interesting properties are derived. We also use estimators of circular dispersion to introduce edge detectors for angular signals. Three variations for the extension of quasirange to circular data are proposed, and expressions for their output PDF are derived. These \"circular\" quasiranges have good and user-controlled properties as edge detectors in noisy angular signals. The performance of the proposed edge operators is evaluated on angular edges, using certain quantitative criteria \u2026",

For this purpose, content-based image protection can be an efficient alternative to watermarking. Rather than imperceptibly embedding a signal, content-based systems rely on image similarity. Certain content-based systems use binary classifiers to detect replicas, each classifier being fine-tuned to a particular original. However, since a suspect image has to be tested against every original, such a comparison becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of original images grows. In this paper, we propose an indexing method to efficiently prune the number of comparisons with the originals in the database. For this purpose, a multidimensional indexing structure, namely R-trees, is incorporated to rapidly select the most likely originals. Experimental results showed that up to 97% of the database can be discarded before applying the binary classifiers.",

The high speed of the detector is a crucial parameter in many face detection applications, eg the face recognition. To this end the Central Two-step AdaBoost detector is presented which defines a cascade of the extended weak classifiers that accelerates the detection speed to a high degree.",

Although the term watermarking has slightly different meanings in the literature, one definition that seems to prevail is the following [1]: Watermarking is the practice of imperceptibly altering a piece of data in order to embed information about the data. The above definition reveals two important characteristics of watermarking. First, information embedding should not cause perceptible changes to the host medium (sometimes called cover medium or cover data). Second, the message should be related to the host medium. In this sense, the watermarking techniques form a subset of information hiding techniques. The latter ones also include cases where the hidden information is not \u2026",

First K-means clustering is applied on training data to discover the most representative patterns on joints positions or orientation angles (dynemes) and their forward differences (F-dynemes). Each frame is then assigned to one of these patterns and the frequency of occurrence histograms for each movement are constructed in a bag-of-words fashion. Person identity recognition is done through a nearest neighbor classifier. The proposed method is experimentally tested on a number of datasets of motion capture data, with very good results.",

The basic way to perform these two tasks is to characterize each video segment with a unique representation called a signature. Using semantic information for the construction of the signatures is a good way to ensure robustness in retrieval and fingerprinting. Here a ubiquitous semantic feature, namely the existence and identity of human faces, will be used to construct the signature.

We then proceed in deriving a statistical algorithm that utilizes this fact for the efficient characterization of visual speech and silence in video sequences.

            "Abstract": "During the past years, camera-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized aerial cinematography, allowing easy acquisition of impressive footage. In this context, autonomous functionalities based on machine learning and computer vision modules are gaining ground. During live coverage of outdoor events, an autonomous UAV may visually track and follow a specific target of interest, under a specific desired shot type, mainly adjusted by choosing appropriate focal length and UAV/camera trajectory relative to the target. However, the selected UAV/camera trajectory and the object tracker requirements (which impose limits on the maximum allowable focal length) affect the range of feasible shot types, thus constraining cinematography planning. Therefore, this paper explores the interplay between cinematography and computer vision in the area of autonomous UAV filming. UAV target-tracking \u2026",

Statistical properties of watermark sequences generated by piecewise-linear Markov maps are exploited for both additive and multiplicative watermark embedding. Correlation/spectral properties of such sequences are easily controllable, a fact that reflects on the watermarking system performance. A family of chaotic maps, namely the skew tent map family, is used in temporal and transform-domain watermarking schemes. The chaotic watermarking framework is applied successfully to audio signals, demonstrating its superiority with respect to both robustness and inaudibility.",

In this paper, we use visual information to aid speaker clustering and we introduce a new video-based feature, called actor presence that can be used to enhance audio-based speaker clustering. We tested the proposed method in three full length stereoscopic movies, i.e. a scenario much more difficult than the ones used so far, where there is no certainty that speech segments and video appearances of actors will always overlap.

The algorithm may need several thousands of iterations to obtain cost function minimization. We provide a way to significantly improve the speed of the algorithm convergence by constructing initial basis images that meet the sparseness and orthogonality requirements and approximate the final minimization solution.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we motivate the use of class-specific nonlinear subspace methods for face verification. The problem of face verification is considered as a two-class problem (genuine versus impostor class). The typical Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) gives only one or two projections in a two-class problem. This is a very strict limitation to the search of discriminant dimensions. As for the FLDA for N class problems (N > 2) the transformation is not person specific. In order to remedy these limitations of FLDA, exploit the individuality of human faces and take into consideration the fact that the distribution of facial images, under different viewpoints, illumination variations and facial expression is highly complex and non-linear, novel kernel discriminant algorithms are used. The new method was tested in the face verification problem using single and multiple view datasets and found to outperform other commonly \u2026",

The present work focuses on the special case of 3D videos and the implication of their use. Various improvements are introduced including the use of stereo over mono videos, the use of double spectral clustering over spectral clustering and the use of multiple representative images per trajectory for more robust trajectory representation. Extended experiments have been conducted in three 3D full feature commercial films which revealed the power of stereo face clustering in comparison with single channel face clustering.",

For this purpose, a simple blind copyright protection watermarking system is considered. The analysis involves theoretical evaluation of the system detection reliability, when a correlator detector is used. The system is modeled in a communication framework considering the signal as interference and converting the addressed problem to the detection of the underlying watermark signal. The aim of the paper is twofold:(i) to introduce the n-way Bernoulli shift generated chaotic watermarks and theoretically contemplate their properties with respect to detection reliability and (ii) to theoretically establish their potential superiority against the widely used (pseudo-) random watermarks. An important property of Bernoulli watermarks is their controllable spectral/correlation properties that render them ideal for a variety of applications. Experimental verification of the theoretical analysis results has been performed as well.",

In this paper, algorithms that take into account the 3D information available in 3DTV content and analyze it in order to derive semantic descriptions that can be used for its search and retrieval are presented. A framework for the storage of the derived descriptions in a structured way as well as the main requirements and characteristics of a database system that can accommodate and index such metadatata and allow users to perform search and retrieval are also described.

First, we develop a mathematical framework so as to determine hardware camera requirements (specifically, focal length), on a representative case study, i.e., orbiting a still or moving target. Second, we examine the on-board software requirements in order to successfully achieve autonomous target following. To this end, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art realtime 2D visual trackers in videos captured by commercial drones. Overall, it was found that state-of-the-art 2D visual trackers are dependable and fast enough to be used in drone cinematography, particularly when combined with periodic target re-detection. A proposed variant of the Staple tracker achieved the best balance between real-time performance and tracking accuracy, on a dataset \u2026",

Vector representation and manipulation in polar coordinates greatly facilitates the accomplishment of the previous task. Based on angular estimators of location, the authors introduce a number of \"circular\" filters, i.e. filters for angular input data. These filters include circular mean, median and a-trimmed mean filters. Emphasis is given to a circular median filter for which the approximate output pdf as well as other interesting properties are derived. The effectiveness of angular estimators of location in noise filtering is studied in simulations involving color images. Simulation results clearly indicate that circular filters can be used effectively to remove noise when the estimation of color hue is of primary importance.< >",
