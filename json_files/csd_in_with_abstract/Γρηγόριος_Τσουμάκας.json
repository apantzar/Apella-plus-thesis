However in many real-world applications, objects may belong to more than one class at the same time. For example an article on the Greek debt crisis could among others belong to the following classes of a financial newspaper\u2019s taxonomy: Greece, Eurozone, Economy and Markets. Such data are called multi-label. Early research on learning from multi-label data focused on automated document categorization (McCallum 1999; Schapire and Singer 2000), motivated by the need for low-cost annotation of large document collections maintained by news agencies, academic publishers and intellectual property organizations. As our ability to collect and store large amounts of digital content increased in recent years due to technological advances, so did the need for automated annotation of such content, leading \u2026",

The land is the ultimate source of wealth and the foundation on which civilization is constructed. Inappropriate land use, leads to destruction of the land resource, poverty and other social problems, and even to the destruction of civilization. To avoid such phenomena, land evaluation is employed, for rational land use planning and appropriate and sustainable use of natural and human resources (Rossiter, 1994). The management of land use is an interdisciplinary activity that relies on large amounts of information from different sources. Land evaluators need to collect information from soil surveyors, climatologists and census takers on land resource. They also need the expert knowledge of soil scientists, agronomists and economists on land use. In addition, land evaluators must select and apply the most appropriate \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In critical situations involving discrimination, gender inequality, economic damage, and even the possibility of casualties, machine learning models must be able to provide clear interpretations for their decisions. Otherwise, their obscure decision-making processes can lead to socioethical issues as they interfere with people's lives. In the aforementioned sectors, random forest algorithms strive, thus their ability to explain themselves is an obvious requirement. In this paper, we present LionForests, which relies on a preliminary work of ours. LionForests is a random forest-specific interpretation technique, which provides rules as explanations. It is applicable from binary classification tasks to multi-class classification and regression tasks, and it is supported by a stable theoretical background. Experimentation, including sensitivity analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, is also performed to demonstrate the efficacy of our contribution. Finally, we highlight a unique property of LionForests, called conclusiveness, that provides interpretation validity and distinguishes it from previous techniques.",

From these proteins only a fraction has been experimentally analyzed in order to detect their structure and hence their function in the corresponding organism. The reason is that experimental determination of structure is labor-intensive and quite time-consuming. Therefore there is the need for automated tools that can classify new proteins to structural families. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of several algorithms that learn such classification models from data concerning patterns of proteins with known structure. In addition, several approaches that combine multiple learning algorithms to increase the accuracy of predictions are evaluated.

Topics range from specific persons, products, and companies that can be easily categorized based on keywords, to more general semantic concepts, such as environment or economy. Building multi-label classifiers for the automated annotation of articles into topics can support the work of human annotators by suggesting a list of all topics by order of relevance, or even automate the annotation process for media and/or categories that are easier to predict.

            "Abstract": "Birds have been widely used as biological indicators for ecological research. They respond quickly to environmental changes and can be used to infer about other organisms (e.g., insects they feed on). Traditional methods for collecting data about birds involves costly human effort. A promising alternative is acoustic monitoring. There are many advantages to recording audio of birds compared to human surveys, including increased temporal and spatial resolution and extent, applicability in remote sites, reduced observer bias, and potentially lower cost. However, it is an open problem for signal processing and machine learning to reliably identify bird sounds in real-world audio data collected in an acoustic monitoring scenario. Some of the major challenges include multiple simultaneously vocalizing birds, other sources of non-bird sound (e.g., buzzing insects), and background noise like wind, rain, and motor vehicles.",

As the learner is allowed to interactively choose the data from which it learns, it is expected that the learner will perform better with less training. The active learning approach is appropriate to machine learning applications where training labels are costly to obtain but unlabeled data is abundant. Although active learning has been widely considered for single-label learning, this is not the case for multi-label learning, where objects can have more than one class labels and a multi-label learner is trained to assign multiple labels simultaneously to an object.

RvC initially automatically discretizes the number of defects into a number of fault classes, then learns a model that predicts the fault class of a software system. Finally, RvC transforms the class output of the model back into a numeric prediction. This approach includes uncertainty in the models because apart from a certain number of faults, it also outputs an associated interval of values, within which this estimate lies, with a certain confidence. To evaluate this approach we perform a comparative experimental study of the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms in a software dataset.

Then, we rank the candidates based on their position in the text and the distance between the corresponding local vectors and the main distribution's center.

To this end, we propose a framework to categorize new descriptors based on their current relation to older descriptors. Based on the proposed classification scheme, we quantify, analyse and present the different types of new descriptors introduced in MeSH during the last fifteen years. The results show that only about 25% of new MeSH descriptors correspond to new emerging concepts, whereas the rest were previously covered by one or more existing descriptors, either implicitly or explicitly. Most of them were covered by a single existing descriptor and they usually end up as descendants of it in the current hierarchy, gradually leading towards a more fine-grained MeSH vocabulary. These insights about the dynamics of the thesaurus are useful for the retrospective study of scientific articles annotated with MeSH, but could also be used to inform the policy of updating the thesaurus in the future.",

This is accomplished through the implementation of the k nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm on top of a highly adjustable planner, called HAP. Learning data are produced by running HAP offline on several problems from multiple domains using all value combinations of its parameters. When the adaptive planner HAPnn is faced with a new problem, it locates the k nearest problems, using a set of measurable problem characteristics, retrieves the performance data for all parameter configurations on these problems and performs a mul-ticriteria combination, with user-specified weights for plan length and planning time. Based on this combination, the configuration with the best performance is then used in order to solve the new problem. Comparative experiments with the statistically best static configurations of the planner show that HAPnn manages to adapt successfully to unseen problems, leading to an increased planning performance.",

In single-label classification tasks, groups are differentiated based on the value of the target variable. In multi-label learning tasks, however, where there are multiple target variables, it is not clear how stratified sampling could/should be performed. This paper investigates stratification in the multi-label data context. It considers two stratification methods for multi-label data and empirically compares them along with random sampling on a number of datasets and based on a number of evaluation criteria. The results reveal some interesting conclusions with respect to the utility of each method for particular types of multi-label datasets.",

Malicious robots threaten the security, privacy and performance of the web, while non-malicious ones are involved in analytics skewing. The latter constitutes an important problem for large websites with unique content, as it can lead to false impressions about the popularity and impact of a piece of information. To deal with this problem, we present a novel web robot detection approach for content-rich websites, based on the assumption that human web users are interested in specific topics, while web robots crawl the web randomly. Our approach extends the typical representation of user sessions with a novel set of features that capture the semantics of the content of the requested resources. Empirical results on real-world data from the web portal of an academic publisher, show that the proposed semantic features lead to improved web robot \u2026",

However, some of the algorithms that learn from multi-label data, can only output a score for each label, so they cannot be readily used in applications that require bipartitions. In addition, several of the recent state-of-the-art multi-label classification algorithms, actually output a score vector primarily and employ one (sometimes simple) thresholding method in order to be able to output bipartitions. Furthermore, some approaches can naturally output both a score vector and a bipartition, but whether a better bipartition can be obtained through thresholding has not been investigated. This paper contributes a theoretical and empirical comparative study of existing thresholding methods, highlighting their importance for obtaining bipartitions of high quality.",

One efficient and flexible strategy to deal with this problem is to employ sampling techniques before training a multi-label learning model. Although existing multi-label sampling approaches alleviate the global imbalance of multi-label datasets, it is actually the imbalance level within the local neighbourhood of minority class examples that plays a key role in performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel measure to assess the local label imbalance of multi-label datasets, as well as two multi-label sampling approaches, namely Multi-Label Synthetic Oversampling based on Local label imbalance (MLSOL) and Multi-Label Undersampling based on Local label imbalance (MLUL). By considering all informative labels, MLSOL creates more diverse and better labeled synthetic instances \u2026",

These partial summaries are then combined in order to produce a final complete summary. With this approach we can decompose the problem of long document summarization into smaller and simpler problems, reducing computational complexity and creating more training examples, which at the same time contain less noise in the target summaries compared to the standard approach. We demonstrate that this approach paired with different summarization models \u2026",

It then trains a multi-label classifier from the data of each cluster. Given a new test instance, the framework first finds the nearest cluster and then applies the corresponding model. Empirical results using two clustering algorithms, four multi-label classification algorithms and three image annotation data sets suggest that the proposed approach can improve the performance and reduce the training time of standard multi-label classification algorithms, particularly in the case of large number of labels.",

The importance of this problem is also enforced by its multi-label nature and the fine-grained character of the examined class-descriptors, factors that demand a lot of human resources. In this work, we alleviate these issues through retrieving insights from a source of information about those descriptors present in MeSH in order to create a weakly-labeled train set.

            "Abstract": "Entity Linking (EL) seeks to align entity mentions in text to entries in a knowledge-base and is usually comprised of two phases: candidate generation and candidate ranking. While most methods focus on the latter, it is the candidate generation phase that sets an upper bound to both time and accuracy performance of the overall EL system. This work's contribution is a significant improvement in candidate generation which thus raises the performance threshold for EL, by generating candidates that include the gold entity in the least candidate set (top-K). We propose a simple approach that efficiently embeds mention-entity pairs in dense space through a BERT-based bi-encoder. Specifically, we extend (Wu et al., 2020) by introducing a new pooling function and incorporating entity type side-information. We achieve a new state-of-the-art 84.28% accuracy on top-50 candidates on the Zeshel dataset, compared to the previous 82.06% on the top-64 of (Wu et al., 2020).

In this paper, we focus on the problem of recurring contexts, a special sub-type of concept drift, that has not yet met the proper attention from the research community. In the case of recurring contexts, concepts may re-appear in future and thus older classification models might be beneficial for future classifications. We propose a general framework for classifying data streams by exploiting stream clustering in order to dynamically build and update an ensemble of incremental classifiers. To achieve this, a transformation function that maps batches of examples into a new conceptual representation model is proposed. The clustering algorithm is \u2026",

This paper proposes a deep-learning-based approach to discovering semantic relationships in literary texts (19th century Greek Literature) facilitating the analysis, organization and management of collections through the automation of metadata extraction. Moreover, we provide a new annotated dataset used to train our model. Our proposed model, REDSandT_Lit, recognizes six distinct relationships, extracting the richest set of relations up to now from literary texts. It efficiently captures the semantic characteristics of the investigating time-period by finetuning the state-of-the-art transformer-based Language Model (LM) for Modern Greek in our corpora. Extensive experiments and comparisons with existing models on our dataset reveal that REDSandT_Lit has superior performance (90% accuracy), manages to capture infrequent relations (100%F in long-tail relations) and can also correct mislabelled sentences. Our results suggest that our approach efficiently handles the peculiarities of literary texts, and it is a promising tool for managing and preserving cultural information in various settings.",

Despite modern technologies used in drug screening, experimental identification of drug-target interactions is an extremely demanding task.

Multi-output learning models in particular have drawn the attention of the scientific community due to their high predictive performance and computational efficiency. These models are based on the assumption that all the labels are correlated with each other. However, this assumption is too optimistic.

Multi-label training examples are constructed by evaluating whether ensemble members are accurate or not on the original training set via cross-validation. We show that classification accuracy is maximized when learning algorithms that optimize example-based precision are used in the multi-label classification task.

            "Abstract": "Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) via reliable computational methods is an effective and efficient way to mitigate the enormous costs and time of the drug discovery process. Structure-based drug similarities and sequence-based target protein similarities are the commonly used information for DTI prediction. Among numerous computational methods, neighborhood-based chemogenomic approaches that leverage drug and target similarities to perform predictions directly are simple but promising ones. However, most existing similarity-based methods follow the transductive setting. These methods cannot directly generalize to unseen data because they should be re-built to predict the interactions for new arriving drugs, targets, or drug-target pairs. Besides, many similarity-based methods, especially neighborhood-based ones, cannot handle directly all three types of interaction prediction. Furthermore, a large amount of missing interactions in current DTI datasets hinders most DTI prediction methods. To address these issues, we propose a new method denoted as Weighted k Nearest Neighbor with Interaction Recovery (WkNNIR). Not only can WkNNIR estimate interactions of any new drugs and/or new targets without any need of re-training, but it can also recover missing interactions. In addition, WkNNIR exploits local imbalance to promote the influence of more reliable similarities on the DTI prediction process. We also propose a series of ensemble methods that employ diverse sampling strategies and could be coupled with WkNNIR as well as any other DTI prediction method to improve performance.

The main challenges in this problem are the limited number of literature books and resources of that age and the quality of the source text.

            "Abstract": "One of the most promising lines of research towards discovering global predictive models from physically distributed data sets is local learning and model integration. Local learning avoids moving raw data around the distributed nodes and minimizes com-munication, coordination and synchronization cost. However, the in-tegration of local models is not a straightforward process. Majority Voting is a simple solution that works well in some domains, but it does not always offer the best predictive performance. Stacking on the other hand, offers flexibility in modelling, but brings along the problem of how to train on sufficient and at the same time in-dependent data without the cost of moving raw data around the distributed nodes. In addition, the scalability of Stacking with respect to the number of distributed nodes is another important issue that has not yet been substantially investigated. This paper presents a framework for constructing a global predictive model from local classifiers that does not require moving raw data around, achieves high predictive accuracy and scales up efficiently with respect to large numbers of distributed data sets. of distributed nodes is another important issue that has not yet been substantially investigated.

Candidate keyphrases are based on words that are outliers of this dominant distribution.

Typically, in a transfer learning procedure the agent learns a behavior in a source task, and it uses the gained knowledge in order to speed up the learning process in a target task. Reinforcement Learning algorithms are time expensive when they learn from scratch, especially in complex domains, and transfer learning comprises a suitable solution to speed up the training process. In this work we propose a method that decomposes the target task in several instances of the source task and uses them to extract an adviced action for the target task. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach in the robotic soccer Keepaway domain. The results demonstrate that the proposed method helps to reduce the training time of the target task.",

            "Abstract": "Data streams containing objects that are (or can be) associated with more than one label at the same time are ubiquitous. In spite of its important applications, classification of streaming multi-label data is largely unexplored. Existing approaches try to tackle the problem by transferring traditional single-label stream classification practices to the multi-label domain. Nevertheless, they fail to consider some of the unique properties of the problem such as within and between class imbalance and multiple concept drift. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-label stream classification approach that employs two windows for each label, one for positive and one for negative examples. Instance-sharing is exploited for space efficiency, while a time-efficient instantiation based on the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is also proposed. Finally, a batch-incremental thresholding technique is proposed to further deal with the class imbalance problem. Results of an empirical comparison against two other methods on three real world datasets are in favor of the proposed approach.",

Semantic indexing and search of biomedical articles in MEDLINE/PubMed are based on semantic subject annotations with MeSH descriptors that may correspond to several related but distinct biomedical concepts. Such semantic annotations do not adhere to the level of detail available in the domain knowledge and may not be sufficient to fulfil the information needs of experts in the domain. To this end, we propose a new method that uses weak supervision to train a concept annotator on the literature available for a particular disease. We test this method on the MeSH descriptors for two diseases: Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

Enriching the trust between these systems and people will accelerate this integration process. Many medical and retail banking/finance applications use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict certain aspects of new instances. Tree ensembles, like random forests, are widely acceptable solutions on these tasks, while at the same time they are avoided due to their black-box uninterpretable nature, creating an unreasonable paradox. In this paper, we provide a methodology for shedding light on the predictions of the misjudged family of tree ensemble algorithms. Using classic unsupervised learning techniques and an enhanced similarity metric, to wander among transparent trees inside a forest following breadcrumbs, the interpretable essence of tree ensembles arises. An interpretation provided by these systems using our approach, which we call \"LionForests\", can be a simple, comprehensive rule.",

It contributes a new pruning approach that uses the Q-learning algorithm in order to approximate an optimal policy of choosing whether to include or exclude each classifier from the ensemble. Extensive experimental comparisons of the proposed approach against state-of-the-art pruning and combination methods show very promising results. Additionally, we present an extension that allows the improvement of the solutions returned by the proposed approach over time, which is very useful in certain performance-critical domains.",

We propose the coupling of an incremental feature ranking method and an incremental learning algorithm that can consider different subsets of the feature vector during prediction (what we call a feature based classifier), in order to deal with the above problem. Experimental results with a longitudinal database of real spam and legitimate emails shows that our approach can adapt to the changing nature of streaming data and works much better than classical incremental learning algorithms.",

The transformation of the initial dataset into a smaller one with the same genetic information is a crucial task and it is performed through feature selection. Biologists evaluate features using methods originating from the field of population genetics. Although several studies have been performed in order to compare the existing biological methods, there is a lack of comparison between methods originating from the biology field with others originating from the machine learning. In this study we present some early results which support that biological methods perform slightly better than machine learning methods.",

One efficient strategy to deal with this problem is to employ resampling techniques before training the classifier. Existing multilabel sampling methods alleviate the (global) imbalance of multi-label datasets. However, performance degradation is mainly due to rare subconcepts and overlapping of classes that could be analysed by looking at the local characteristics of the minority examples, rather than the imbalance of the whole dataset. We propose a new method for synthetic oversampling of multi-label data that focuses on local label distribution to generate more diverse and better labeled instances. Experimental results on 13 multi-label datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a variety of evaluation measures, particularly in the case of an ensemble of classifiers trained on repeated samples of the original data.",

The computational efficiency and predictive performance of LP is challenged by application domains with large number of labels and training examples. In these cases, the number of classes may become very large and at the same time many classes are associated with very few training examples. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes breaking the initial set of labels into a number of small random subsets, called labelsets and employing LP to train a corresponding classifier. The labelsets can be either disjoint or overlapping depending on which of two strategies is used to construct them. The proposed method is called RAkEL (RAndom k labELsets), where k is a parameter that specifies the size \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Real world prediction problems often involve the simultaneous prediction of multiple target variables using the same set of predictive variables. When the target variables are binary, the prediction task is called multi-label classification while when the target variables are realvalued the task is called multi-target regression. Although multi-target regression attracted the attention of the research community prior to multi-label classification, the recent advances in this field motivate a study of whether newer state-of-the-art algorithms developed for multilabel classification are applicable and equally successful in the domain of multi-target regression. In this paper we introduce two new multitarget regression algorithms: multi-target stacking (MTS) and ensemble of regressor chains (ERC), inspired by two popular multi-label classification approaches that are based on a single-target decomposition of the multi-target problem and the idea of treating the other prediction targets as additional input variables that augment the input space. Furthermore, we detect an important shortcoming on both methods related to the methodology used to create the additional input variables and develop modified versions of the algorithms (MTSC and ERCC) to tackle it. All methods are empirically evaluated on 12 real-world multi-target regression datasets, 8 of which are first introduced in this paper and are made publicly available for future benchmarks. The experimental results show that ERCC performs significantly better than both a strong baseline that learns a single model for each target using bagging of regression trees and the state-of-the-art multi-objective random \u2026",

Titles and abstracts are dense in keyphrases, but often miss important aspects of the articles, while full-texts on the other hand are richer in keyphrases but much noisier. To address this trade-off, we propose the use of extractive summarization models on the full-texts of scholarly documents.

It has linear complexity with respect to the number of labels, but does not take into account label correlations and may fail to accurately predict label combinations and rank labels according to relevance with a new instance. Stacking the models of BR in order to learn a model that associates their output to the true value of each label is a way to alleviate this problem. In this paper we propose the pruning of the models participating in the stacking process, by explicitly measuring the degree of label correlation using the phi coefficient. Exploratory analysis of phi shows that the correlations detected are meaningful and useful. Empirical evaluation of the pruning approach shows that it leads to substantial reduction of the computational cost of stacking and occasional improvements in predictive performance.",

In particular we focus on discovering two kinds of relationships among the labels. The first one concerns pairwise positive entailment: pairs of labels, where the presence of one implies the presence of the other in all instances of a dataset. The second concerns exclusion: sets of labels that do not coexist in the same instances of the dataset. These relationships are represented as a deterministic Bayesian network. Marginal probabilities are entered as soft evidence in the network and through probabilistic inference become consistent with the discovered knowledge. Our approach offers robust improvements in mean average precision compared to the standard binary relevance approach across all 12 datasets involved in our \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Computational prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) reduces the number of candidate drugs to be verified by the tedious and costly experimental approach and expedites the drug discovery process. The most challenging task for computational DTI prediction methods is to predict interactions between new drugs and new targets due to the unavailability of interacting information for both new drugs and new targets. Although there are several methods that could predict interactions in new drug-target pairs, the accuracy of their predicting results is not adequate. To improve the performance of existing approaches, we propose three ensemble DTI prediction strategies that could accompany any DTI prediction method. The proposed ensemble approaches consist of several DTI prediction models learned on training subsets which have been defined by different sampling strategies. Experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets and the obtained results indicate that the local imbalance-aware sampling strategy is the most effective.",

This work introduces a novel method for generating LDA predictions on unobserved data, given a model trained by CGS, by employing the full distribution of word tokens over topics, in a fashion similar to the one followed by CVB0 (a variant of CVB). We perform extensive empirical comparisons of our prediction method with the predictions generated by CGS and CVB0 on real-world data for both standard unsupervised LDA and Prior LDA, one of the supervised variants of LDA for multi-label data. The results show a consistent advantage of our method over CGS under all experimental conditions, and over CVB0 under the majority of conditions.",

Furthermore, some approaches can naturally output both a score vector and a bipartition, but whether a better bipartition can be obtained through thresholding has not been investigated. This paper contributes a theoretical and empirical comparative study of existing thresholding methods, highlighting their importance for obtaining bipartitions of high quality.",

Most of the labels in multi-label data sets are associated with a small number of training examples, much smaller compared to the size of the data set. Class imbalance poses a key challenge that plagues most multi-label learning methods. Ensemble of Classifier Chains (ECC), one of the most prominent multi-label learning methods, is no exception to this rule, as each of the binary models it builds is trained from all positive and negative examples of a label. To make ECC resilient to class imbalance, we first couple it with random undersampling. We then present two extensions of this basic approach, where we build a varying number of binary models per label and construct chains of different sizes, in order to improve the exploitation of majority examples with approximately the same computational budget.

This work evaluates eight feature selection algorithms in text benchmark datasets.

We experimented with two different datasets, one with a considerable size, comparable to what the pharmaceutical companies use in their day-to-day operations and a much smaller dataset that is widely used by other researchers in the area of drug-target interaction prediction (gold standard datasets).

The analysis of SHM has offered critical insight into the physiology and pathology of B cells, leading to strong prognostication markers for clinical outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most frequent adult B-cell malignancy. In this paper we present a methodology for integrating multiple immunogenetic and clinocobiological data sources in order to extract features and create high quality datasets for SHM analysis in IG receptors of CLL patients. This dataset is used as the basis for a higher level integration procedure, inspired form social choice theory. This is applied in the Towards Analysis, our attempt to investigate the potential ontogenetic transformation of genes belonging to specific stereotyped CLL subsets towards other genes or \u2026",

Available locus ranking programs have been accused of providing upwardly biased results (concerning the predicted accuracy of the chosen set of markers for population assignment), cannot handle high-dimensional datasets, and some of them are computationally intensive. The toolbox for ranking and evaluation of SNPs (TRES) is a collection of algorithms built in a user-friendly and computationally efficient software that can manipulate and analyze datasets even in the order of millions of genotypes in a matter of seconds.

            "Abstract": "Class imbalance is an intrinsic characteristic of multi-label data. Most of the labels in multi-label data sets are associated with a small number of training examples, much smaller compared to the size of the data set. Class imbalance poses a key challenge that plagues most multi-label learning methods. Ensemble of Classifier Chains (ECC), one of the most prominent multi-label learning methods, is no exception to this rule, as each of the binary models it builds is trained from all positive and negative examples of a label. To make ECC resilient to class imbalance, we first couple it with random undersampling. We then present two extensions of this basic approach, where we build a varying number of binary models per label and construct chains of different sizes, in order to improve the exploitation of majority examples with approximately the same computational budget. Experimental results on 16 multi-label datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in a variety of evaluation metrics.",

Single-label classification and regression cannot model this multiplicity. Therefore, this work focuses on multi-label classification approaches, where a piece of music may simultaneously belong to more than one class. Seven algorithms are experimentally compared for this task. Furthermore, the predictive power of several audio features is evaluated using a new multi-label feature selection method. Experiments are conducted on a set of 593 songs with six clusters of emotions based on the Tellegen-Watson-Clark model of affect. Results show that multi-label modeling is successful and provide interesting insights into the predictive quality of the algorithms and features.",

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale analysis of journal self-citations while taking into consideration the similarity between a publication and its references. Specifically, we look into PubMed Central articles published since 1990 and compute similarities of article-reference pairs using sentence embeddings.

The company provided us with a dataset of vehicle classifieds which is a subsidiary of their large scale data. Each classified in the dataset contains the vehicle\u2019s images and a set of classified features regarding the vehicle characteristics. The goal is to create a machine learning model that will be able to predict the vehicle\u2019s type by taking a vehicle image as input (eg classify a vehicle in an image as a Pickup/Truck or a Van).The first step of our work was content based information retrieval from the existing images to attain the feature vectors. More specifically, for the feature extraction process, we used an Imagenet pre-trained VGG16 neural network and we extracted the feature vectors from the network\u2019s fully connected layer. We then synthesized the final dataset consisting of the feature vectors and the target vehicle category class for every classified. We performed principal component analysis on the features of the resulting dataset, in order to reduce their dimensionality, giving us the ability to visualize the data and accelerate the training process. We created 3 instances of our dataset. One with 2 classes, one with 3 and the last one with all twelve classes that are present in the dataset. We then trained a classifier with the transformed data and we evaluated our results with the stratified 10-fold cross validation method.",

            "Abstract": "In this thesis, we present an approach to explain the decisions of black box models for text classification. To this end, we build on the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm, which is a standard reference in the literature. LIME works by generating a neighborhood of samples around an instance for which we require an explanation. When it comes to text classification, LIME is only able to generate neighbors by randomly removing words or bi-grams from a given text. As a result, the synthetic data generated may not result into semantically meaningful textual sentences. In order to improve the generated neighborhood, we use a variational auto encoder that is able to generate neighbors of the initial instance which are close to it semantically, by randomly tweaking the latent space. Then we use these sentences along with their respective labels taken by the respective black box model in order to train a decision tree classifier from which we can then extract the exemplars as a final explanation. We conduct an experimental evaluation of the approach on two datasets and two black box models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to produce accurate explanations.",

The proposed randomized learning method integrates the concepts of random subspace, bagging and random k-label sets ensemble learning methods to form an approach to classification of multi-label data. It applies the random subspace method to feature space, label space as well as instance space at the same time. The devised subset selection procedure is executed iteratively. Each multi-label classifier is trained using the randomly selected subsets. At the end of the iterations, the ensemble MLC classifiers are constructed. The proposed method is implemented and its performance is evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the examined counterparts in most occasions when tested on six multi-label datasets from different domains. It is shown that the developed method possesses a general usability in dealing with various multi-label classification problems. Therefore, the triple random ensemble learning method is recommended for application to image to text translation system, which is based on the positive outcome of predictive performance of TREMLC on scene image dataset.",

We also study how the average number of local image descriptors extracted per image affects the performance and show that by controlling this number we are able to adjust the trade off between feature extraction time and search accuracy.

Meta-Learning, a successful approach for distributed data mining, is in this paper extended to handle the imprecision and uncertainty of the local models and the vagueness that characterizes the meta-learning process. The proposed approach, Fuzzy Meta-Learning uses a fuzzy inductive algorithm to meta-learn a global model from the degrees of certainty of the output of local classifiers. This way more accurate models of collective knowledge can be acquired from data with application both to inherently distributed databases and parts of a very large database.

MLD\u201909 is devoted to multi-label learning, which is an emerging and promising research topic of machine learning. In multi-label learning, each example is associated with multiple labels simultaneously, which therefore encompasses traditional supervised learning (single-label) as its special case. Multi-label learning is related to various machine learning paradigms, such as classification, ranking, semi-supervised learning, active learning, multi-instance learning, dimensionality reduction, etc. Initial attempts on multi-label learning date back to 1999 with works on multi-label text categorization. In recent years, the task of learning from multi-label data has been addressed by a number of methods adapted from various popular learning techniques, such as neural networks, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods, ensemble methods, etc. More impressively, multi-label learning has manifested its effectiveness in a diversity of real-world applications, such as image/video annotation, bioinformatics,",

            "Abstract": "In drug discovery, identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) via experimental approaches is a tedious and expensive procedure. Computational methods efficiently predict DTIs and recommend a small part of potential interacting pairs for further experimental confirmation, accelerating the drug discovery process. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) that emphasizes the accuracy of top-ranked pairs and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) that heavily punishes the existence of low ranked interacting pairs are two widely used evaluation metrics in the DTI prediction task. However, the two metrics are seldom considered as losses within existing DTI prediction methods. This paper proposes two matrix factorization methods that optimize AUPR and AUC, respectively. The two methods utilize graph regularization to ensure the local invariance of training drugs and targets in the latent feature space, and leverage the optimal decay coefficient to infer more reliable latent features of new drugs and targets. Experimental results over four updated benchmark datasets containing more recently verified interactions show the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of the corresponding evaluation metric they optimize.",

Such methods use different directions for searching this space and different measures for evaluating the available actions at each state. Some use the training set for subset evaluation, while others a separate validation set. This paper abstracts the key points of these methods and offers a general framework of the greedy ensemble selection algorithm, discussing its important parameters and the different options for instantiating these parameters.",

            "Abstract": "Online hate speech is a newborn problem in our modern society which is growing at a steady rate exploiting weaknesses of the corresponding regimes that characterise several social media platforms. Therefore, this phenomenon is mainly cultivated through such comments, either during users' interaction or on posted multimedia context. Nowadays, giant companies own platforms where many millions of users log in daily. Thus, protection of their users from exposure to similar phenomena for keeping up with the corresponding law, as well as for retaining a high quality of offered services, seems mandatory. Having a robust and reliable mechanism for identifying and preventing the uploading of related material would have a huge effect on our society regarding several aspects of our daily life. On the other hand, its absence would deteriorate heavily the total user experience, while its erroneous operation might raise several ethical issues. In this work, we present a protocol for creating a more suitable dataset, regarding its both informativeness and representativeness aspects, favouring the safer capture of hate speech occurrence, without at the same time restricting its applicability to other classification problems. Moreover, we produce and publish a textual dataset with two variants: binary and multi-label, called `ETHOS', based on YouTube and Reddit comments validated through figure-eight crowdsourcing platform. Our assumption about the production of more compatible datasets is further investigated by applying various classification models and recording their behaviour over several appropriate metrics.",

The purpose of the Lazy Adaptive Multicriteria Planning (LAMP) system is to configure a planner in an optimal way, concerning two quality metrics (ie execution speed and plan quality), for a given problem according to user-specified preferences. The training data are produced by running the planner under consideration on a set of problems using all possible parameter configurations and recording the planning time and the plan length. When a new problem arises, LAMP extracts the values for a number of domain-expert specified problem features and uses them to identify the \u0430 nearest problems solved in the past. The system then performs a multicriteria combination of the performances of the retrieved problems according to user-specified weights that specify the relative importance of the quality metrics and selects the configuration with the best score. Experimental results show that LAMP improves the performance of the default configuration of two already well-performing planning systems in a variety of planning problems.",

            "Abstract": "There are two main paradigms in combining different classification algorithms: Classifier Selection and Classifier Fusion. The first one selects a single model for classifying a new instance, while the latter combines the decisions of all models. The work presented in this paper stands in between these two paradigms aiming to tackle the disadvantages and benefit from the advantages of both. In particular, this paper proposes the use of statistical procedures for the selection of the best subgroup among different classification algorithms and the subsequent fusion of the decision of the models in this subgroup with simple methods like Weighted Voting. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach, Selective Fusion, improves over simple selection and fusion methods, leading to performance comparable with the state-of-the-art heterogeneous classifier combination method of Stacking, without the \u2026",

The adaptation is guided by a rule-based system that sets planner configuration parameters based on measurable characteristics of the problem instance. The knowledge of the rule system has been acquired through a rule induction algorithm. Specifically, the approach of propositional rule learning was applied to a dataset produced by results from experiments on a large number of problems from various domains, including those used in the three International Planning Competitions. The validity of our methodology is assessed through thorough experimental results that demonstrate the boost in performance of the planning system in problems of both known and unknown domains.",

In this project, we apply biclustering for biomarker detection on real asthma datasets. Data: The datasets that we work with are 4. The first consists of clinical information for subjects that can be organized in 5 categories: general, blood, lung function, sputum, biopsy. The second and third contain gene expression and DNA methylation data, respectively. The last one includes micro RNA expression data.Methods: We use a biclustering method, called\u2019FABIA: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition\u2019. FABIA is a generative multiplicative model which is based on linear dependencies between gene expression and conditions to form biclusters. t-SNE algorithm is also used for the visualization of the data in 2 dimensions. We run FABIA algorithm multiple times and we rank the resulting biclusters. For the evaluation of the biclusters, 4 quality measures are being used. The first, information content, shows the amount of information each bicluster contains about the data. The next ones are the variance and mean squared residue (MSR). The fourth quality measure is the virtual error, which shows the tendency that genes follow under a set of conditions.Results: After applying FABIA multiple times on the datasets and getting the biclusters, we choose to examine only the robust ones. We consider a bicluster as robust if it has average overlap percentage more than 80% over the runs. These biclusters gave us combinations of particular features from the first dataset that may \u2026",

Our approach can be understood as adapting the soft clustering methodology of Collapsed Variational Bayes (CVB0) to CGS parameter estimation, in order to get the best of both techniques. Our estimators can straightforwardly be applied to the output of any existing implementation of CGS, including modern accelerated variants. We perform extensive empirical comparisons of our estimators with those of standard collapsed inference algorithms on real-world data for both unsupervised LDA and Prior-LDA, a supervised variant of LDA for multi-label classification. Our results show a consistent advantage of our approach over traditional CGS under all experimental conditions, and over CVB0 inference in the majority of conditions. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of averaging over multiple samples in LDA parameter estimation, and the use of efficient computational techniques to do so.",

The availability of a source of continuous, cheap, and reliable energy is of foremost economic importance. Electric load forecasting is an important tool used to ensure that the energy supplied by utilities meets the consumers needs. To this end, a staff of trained personnel is needed to carry out this specialized function. Load forecasting is always defined as basically the science or art of predicting the future load on a given system, for a specified period of time ahead. These predictions may be just for a fraction of an hour ahead for operation purposes, or as much as 20 years into the future for planning purposes. The purpose of this master thesis is to create accurate machine learning models for short-term electric load demand forecasting in short-term horizon (for 1 day ahead) for the Greek Electric Network Grid.

The Web-based adaptive planning system consists of two modules that can work independently. The first one is called HAP-WS and is the Web service interface to the domain independent planner HAP (Highly Adjustable Planner) that can be customized through the adjustment of several parameters, either manually or automatically. In the manual mode, the user itself adjusts planner parameters giving explicitly the values. In the automatic mode, the second subsystem, called LAMP-WS, computes the values of the planning parameters of HAP. LAMP-WS is the Web service interface to the learning system LAMP (Lazy Adaptive Multicriteria Planning) that can automatically configure a planning system using instance-based learning on past performance data of that system. The two subsystems are implemented as independent Web services, which can be used stand-alone and reside in different servers in potentially different geographical locations.",

We examine the performance of this method in comparison with the Oracle selecting the best classifier for the test set and show that 10-fold cross-validation has problems in detecting the best classifier. We then extend ES by applying a statistical test to the 10-fold accuracies of the models and combining through voting the most significant ones. Experimental results show that the proposed method, Effective Voting, performs comparably with the state-of-the-art method of Stacking with Multi-Response Model Trees without the additional computational cost of meta-training.",

Despite their success, there are still important open issues, such as the limited engagement and trust of users in the whole process. In order to overcome these issues, we reconsider the task of summarization from a human-centered perspective. We propose to integrate a user interface with an underlying DL model, instead of tackling summarization as an isolated task from the end user. We present a novel system, where the user can actively participate in the whole summarization process. We also enable the user to gather insights into the causative factors that drive the model\u2019s behavior, exploiting the self-attention mechanism. We focus on the financial domain, in order to demonstrate the efficiency of generic DL models for domain-specific applications.

AI-powered systems are monitoring and deciding about sensitive economic and societal issues. The future is towards automation, and it must not be prevented. However, this is a conflicting viewpoint for a lot of people, due to the fear of uncontrollable AI systems. This concern could be reasonable if it was originating from considerations associated with social issues, like gender-biased, or obscure decision-making systems. Explainable AI (XAI) is recently treated as a huge step towards reliable systems, enhancing the trust of people to AI. Interpretable machine learning (IML), a subfield of XAI, is also an urgent topic of research. This paper presents a small but significant contribution to the IML community, focusing on a local-based, neural-specific interpretation process applied to textual and time-series data. The proposed methodology introduces new approaches to the presentation of feature importance based interpretations, as well as the production of counterfactual words on textual datasets. Eventually, an improved evaluation metric is introduced for the assessment of interpretation techniques, which supports an extensive set of qualitative and quantitative experiments.",
