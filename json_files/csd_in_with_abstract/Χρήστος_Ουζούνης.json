            "Abstract": "Previous methods of detecting the taxonomic origins of arbitrary sequence collections, with a significant impact to genome analysis and in particular metagenomics, have primarily focused on compositional features of genomes. The evolutionary patterns of phylogenetic distribution of genes or proteins, represented by phylogenetic profiles, provide an alternative approach for the detection of taxonomic origins, but typically suffer from low accuracy. Herein, we present rank-BLAST, a novel approach for the assignment of protein sequences into genomic groups of the same taxonomic origin, based on the ranking order of phylogenetic profiles of target genes or proteins across the reference database. The rank-BLAST approach is validated by computing the phylogenetic profiles of all sequences for five distinct microbial species of varying degrees of phylogenetic proximity, against a reference database of 243 fully \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The problem of adaptive mutagenesis is examined under the assumption that selection occurs through the interaction of cognate mRNA and protein molecules, a phenomenon that has been considered to lead to differential mRNA decay (Kyrpides & Ouzounis, 1993, J. theor. Biol.163, 373-392). Based on the stereochemical hypothesis, we speculate that the origin of this process relies on an extended form of molecular interactions. This mechanism, termed reverse interpretation, predicts the selective amplification of successful molecular forms with the capability of their immortalization through reverse transcription, in a manner that resembles, but is not equivalent to, reverse translation. Finally, we argue that the proposed mechanism conforms with the Darwinian view of evolutionary change, if variability is considered to be a property of molecular and not cellular populations.",

Despite the apparent fatigue of the linguistic use of the term itself, bioinformatics has grown perhaps to a point beyond recognition. We explore both historical aspects and future trends and argue that as the field expands, key questions remain unanswered and acquire new meaning while at the same time the range of applications is widening to cover an ever increasing number of biological disciplines. These trends appear to be pointing to a redefinition of certain objectives, milestones, and possibly the field itself.",

We therefore measured modules of serum pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines in combination with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in COVID-19 patients admitted to tertiary care.  Using machine learning and employing unsupervised hierarchical clustering, agnostic to severity, we identified three distinct immunotypes that were shown post-clustering to predict very different clinical courses such as clinical improvement or clinical deterioration. Immunotypes did not associate chronologically with disease duration but rather reflect variations in the nature and kinetics of individual patient9s immune response. Here we demonstrate that immunophenotyping can stratify patients to high and low risk clinical subtypes, with distinct cytokine and antibody profiles, that can predict severity progression and guide personalized therapy.",

Through various interactions with specific proteins and mRNA cis-regulatory elements, ribosomal proteins exert unforeseen control over translation and cellular homeostasis. Moreover, perturbation of their expression levels results in the development of diseases with highly tissue-specific symptoms, commonly known as ribosomopathies.

The most interesting of these include a DNA polymerase of type X previously only found in mammalia, a new regulatory domain common to eukaryotes and prokaryotes (PILB), a methyltransferase, an acetolactate synthase and a GAL4-type transcriptional activator (see Table). In addition, we have determined that 25 of the chromosome III proteins have homologues of known threedimensional structure. Adding it all up, as many as 42% of all proteins of yeast chromosome III have a known or probable function and 13% have an indirectly known threedimensional structure. Of the remaining 58% of unknown function, about one third have one or more probable transmembrane segments (see Figure).",

            "Abstract": "Bioinformatics can be loosely defined as the collection, classification, storage, and analysis of biochemical and biological information using computers and mathematical algorithms. Although no single person or group started the field wholly on their own, Temple Smith, Ph. D., a professor at Boston University, is generally credited with coining the term. Bioinformatics represents a marriage of biology, medicine, computer science, physics, and mathematics, fields of study that have historically existed as mutually exclusive disciplines. Concurrently, bioinformatics has vaulted into the public\u2019s eye in lay newspapers and magazines, most notably in the area of (personalized) DNA sequencing. The combined result is that bioinformatics is being heralded as a panacea to the current limitations in the clinical management of cancer. While certainly over optimistic in some regards, this designation is not without promise particularly in the area of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The focus of this book is to: i) to provide a historical and technical perspective on the analytical techniques, methodologies, and platforms used in bioinformatics experiments, ii) to show how a bioinformatics approach has been used to characterize various cancer-related processes, and iii) to demonstrate how a bioinformatics approach is being used to bridge basic science and the clinical arena to positively impact patient care and management.",

The origins of reactions and thus entire pathways are inferred using a simple taxonomic classification scheme that describes the evolutionary course of events towards the lineage of interest. We investigate the evolutionary history of the human metabolic network extracted from a metabolic database, construct a network of interconnected pathways and classify this network according to the taxonomic categories representing eukaryotes, metazoa and vertebrates. It is demonstrated that lineage-specific innovations correspond to reactions and pathways associated with key phenotypic changes during evolution, such as the emergence of cellular organelles in eukaryotes, cell adhesion cascades in metazoa and the biosynthesis of complex cell-specific biomolecules in vertebrates. This phylogenetic view of metabolic networks puts gene innovations within an evolutionary context, demonstrating how the emergence of a phenotype in a lineage provides a platform for the development of specialized traits.",

A stark clinical contrast exists between physiological LVH and pathological cardiac remodeling in response to diseases such as hypertension, but little is known about the precise molecular mechanisms driving physiological adaptation. In this study, the first large-scale analysis of publicly available genome-wide expression data of several in vivo murine models of physiological LVH was carried out using network analysis. On evaluating 3 million gene co-expression patterns across 141 relevant microarray experiments, it was found that physiological adaptation is an evolutionarily conserved processes involving preservation of the function of cytochrome c oxidase, induction of autophagy compatible with cell survival, and coordinated regulation of angiogenesis. This analysis not only identifies known biological pathways involved in physiological LVH, but also offers novel insights into the molecular basis of this phenotype by identifying key networks of co-expressed genes, as well as their topological and functional properties, using relevant high-quality microarray experiments and network inference.",

Half of the metabolic enzymes have homologs in all domains of life, representing families involved in some of the most fundamental cellular processes. We thus show for the first time and in a comprehensive way that metabolism is conserved at the enzyme level. In addition, our analysis suggests that despite the sequence conservation and the extensive phylogenetic distribution of metabolic enzymes, their groupings into biochemical pathways are much more variable than previously thought.",

With the development of highthroughput methods that allow the acquisition of numerous experimental data, the dataset of identified protein-protein interactions is growing quickly. Whereas model organisms such as yeasts are well suited for this kind of methods, experimental data related to human protein interactions remain relatively poor. This is yet a key factor to improve understanding of diseases and pharmaceutical developments.In order to fill this gap, several predictive computational methods have been implemented. They rely on different characteristics that can be used to infer human protein interactions from other kind of information: protein interactions in other species are used to predict human protein interactions on the basis of orthologs [1]; co-expressed proteins are grouped in functional clusters; gene fusion events may reflect the possibility of interactions between two proteins that were fused on one transcript in organisms located upward the evolution tree; phylogenetic profile analysis attempt to gather proteins that seems to be linked along the evolutionnary process to perform specific biological processes [2].",

            "Abstract": "Iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, bind to mRNAs harboring iron responsive elements and control their expression. IRPs may also perform additional functions. Thus, IRP1 exhibited apparent tumor suppressor properties in a tumor xenograft model. Here we examined the effects of IRP2 in a similar setting. Human H1299 lung cancer cells or clones engineered for tetracycline-inducible expression of wild type IRP2, or the deletion mutant IRP2\u039473 (lacking a specific insert of 73 amino acids), were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. The induction of IRP2 profoundly stimulated the growth of tumor xenografts, and this response was blunted by addition of tetracycline in the drinking water of the animals, to turnoff the IRP2 transgene. Interestingly, IRP2\u039473 failed to promote tumor growth above control levels. As expected, xenografts expressing the IRP2 transgene exhibited high levels of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1); however, the expression of other known IRP targets was not affected. Moreover, these xenografts manifested increased c-MYC levels and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. A microarray analysis identified distinct gene expression patterns between control and tumors containing IRP2 or IRP1 transgenes. By contrast, gene expression profiles of control and IRP2\u039473-related tumors were more similar, consistently with their growth phenotype. Collectively, these data demonstrate an apparent pro-oncogenic activity of IRP2 that depends on its specific 73 amino acids insert, and provide further evidence for a link between IRPs and cancer biology.",

Only 44 enzyme classes are found to contain false positives, while the remaining 28 enzyme classes are not represented. We also show cases where the re-annotation procedure results in partial overlaps for those few enzyme classes where a certain inconsistency might appear between homologous proteins, mostly due to function specificity.

There are notions that some protein-coding ribosomal genes vary in their roles across species, particularly vertebrates, through the involvement of some in a number of genetic diseases. Based on extensive sequence comparisons and systematic curation, we establish a reference set for ribosomal proteins (RPs) in eleven vertebrate species and quantify their sequence conservation levels. Moreover, we correlate their coordinated gene expression patterns within up to 33 tissues and assess the exceptional role of paralogs in tissue specificity. Importantly, our analysis supported by the development and use of machine learning models strongly proposes that the variation in the observed tissue-specific gene expression of RPs is rather species \u2026",

Given features that can be computed from the amino-acid sequence in a straightforward fashion (such as pI, molecular weight, and amino-acid composition), the technique allows us to answer questions such as: Is the protein an enzyme? If so, in which Enzyme Commission (EC) class does it belong? Our approach uses machine learning (ML) techniques to induce classifiers that predict the EC class of an enzyme from features extracted from its primary sequence. We report on a variety of experiments in which we explored the use of three different ML techniques in conjunction with training datasets derived from PDB and from Swiss {Prot. We also explored the use of several different feature sets. Our method is able to predict the first EC number of an enzyme with 74% accuracy (thereby assigning the enzyme to one of six broad categories of enzyme function), and to predict the second EC number of an enzyme with 68% accuracy (thereby assigning the enzyme to one of 57 subcategories of enzyme function). This technique could be a valuable complement to sequence-similarity searches and to pathway-analysis methods.",

Filensin can be divided into an NH2-terminal domain (head) of 38 amino acids, a middle domain (rod) of 279 amino acids, and a COOH-terminal domain (tail) of 438 amino acids. The head domain contains a di-arginine/aromatic amino acid motif which is also found in the head domains of various intermediate filament proteins and includes a potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site. By multiple alignment to all known IF protein sequences, the filensin rod, which is the shortest among IF proteins, can be subdivided into three subdomains (coils 1a, 1b, and 2).

            "Abstract": "The entire publicly available set of 37 genome sequences from the bacterial order Chlamydiales has been subjected to comparative analysis in order to reveal the salient features of this pangenome and its evolutionary history. Over 2,000 protein families are detected across multiple species, with a distribution consistent to other studied pangenomes. Of these, there are 180 protein families with multiple members, 312 families with exactly 37 members corresponding to core genes, 428 families with peripheral genes with varying taxonomic distribution and finally 1,125 smaller families. The fact that, even for smaller genomes of Chlamydiales, core genes represent over a quarter of the average protein complement, signifies a certain degree of structural stability, given the wide range of phylogenetic relationships within the group. In addition, the propagation of a corpus of manually curated annotations within the discovered core families reveals key functional properties, reflecting a coherent repertoire of cellular capabilities for Chlamydiales. We further investigate over 2,000 genes without homologs in the pangenome and discover two new protein sequence domains. Our results, supported by the genome-based phylogeny for this group, are fully consistent with previous analyses and current knowledge, and point to future research directions towards a better understanding of the structural and functional properties of Chlamydiales.

            "Abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease characterised by chronically elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, leading to aberrant keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Although certain clinical phenotypes, such as plaque psoriasis, are well defined, it is currently unclear whether there are molecular subtypes that might impact on prognosis or treatment outcomes. We present a pipeline for patient stratification through a comprehensive analysis of gene expression in paired lesional and non-lesional psoriatic tissue samples, compared with controls, to establish differences in RNA expression patterns across all tissue types. Ensembles of decision tree predictors were employed to cluster psoriatic samples on the basis of gene expression patterns and reveal gene expression signatures that best discriminate molecular disease subtypes. This multi-stage procedure was applied to several published psoriasis studies and a comparison of gene expression patterns across datasets was performed. Overall, classification of psoriasis gene expression patterns revealed distinct molecular sub-groups within the clinical phenotype of plaque psoriasis. Enrichment for TGFb and ErbB signaling pathways, noted in one of the two psoriasis subgroups, suggested that this group may be more amenable to therapies targeting these pathways. Our study highlights the potential biological relevance of using ensemble decision tree predictors to determine molecular disease subtypes, in what may initially appear to be a homogenous clinical group.

To obtain such predictions we have made an exhaustive search for gene fusion events within 24 available completely sequenced genomes. Each genome was used as a query against the remaining 23 complete genomes to detect gene fusion events. Using an improved, fully automatic protocol, a total of 7,224 single-domain proteins that are components of gene fusions in other genomes were detected, many of which were identified for the first time. The total number of predicted pairwise functional associations is 39,730 for all genomes. Component pairs were identified by virtue of their similarity to 2,365 multidomain composite proteins. We also show for the first time that gene fusion is a complex evolutionary process with a number of contributory factors, including paralogy, genome size and phylogenetic distance. On average, 9% of genes in a given genome appear to code for single-domain, component proteins predicted to be functionally associated. These proteins are detected by an additional 4% of genes that code for fused, composite proteins. These results provide an exhaustive set of functionally associated genes and also delineate the power of fusion analysis for the prediction of protein interactions.",

            "Abstract": "Motivation Separation of protein sequence regions according to their local information complexity and subsequent masking of low complexity regions has greatly enhanced the reliability of function prediction by sequence similarity. Comparison with alternative methods that focus on compositional sequence bias rather than information complexity measures have shown that removal of compositional bias yields at least as sensitive and much more specific results. Besides the application of sequence masking algorithms to sequence similarity searches, the study of the masked regions themselves is of great interest. Traditionally, however, these have been neglected despite evidence of their functional relevance. Results Here we demonstrate that compositional bias seems to be a more effective measure for the detection of biologically meaningful signals. Typical results on proteins are compared to results for sequences that have been randomized in various ways, conserving composition and local correlations for individual proteins or the entire set. It is remarkable that low-complexity regions have the same form of distribution in proteins as in randomized sequences, and that the signal from randomized sequences with conserved local correlations and amino acid composition almost matches the signal from proteins. This is not the case for sequence bias, which hence seems to be a genuinely biological phenomenon in contrast to patches of low-complexity.",

The eukaryotic members of this family contain a C-terminal extension similar to a bacterial transcriptional activator (TenA), thus pointing to a fusion event that took place during cellular evolution. The C-terminal domain is absent from M. jannaschii. The significance of this observation is two-fold: first, this is a case where a fusion protein contains two domains with an unusual phylogenetic distribution, and second, the TenA domain is a rare case of a gene family involved in transcription present both in bacteria and eukaryotes.",

Herein, we focus on the diversification of the transforming growth factor-(TGF-) pathway\u2013one of the fundamental and versatile metazoan signal transduction engines. Results After an investigation of 33 genomes, we show that the emergence of the TGF-pathway coincided with appearance of the first known animal species. The primordial pathway repertoire consisted of four Smads and four receptors, similar to those observed in the extant genome of the early diverging tablet animal (Trichoplax adhaerens). We subsequently retrace duplications in ancestral genomes on the lineage leading to humans, as well as lineage-specific duplications, such as those which gave rise to novel Smads and receptors in teleost fishes. We conclude that the diversification of the TGF-pathway can be parsimoniously explained according to the 2R model, with additional rounds of duplications in teleost fishes. Finally, we investigate duplications followed by accelerated evolution which gave rise to an atypical TGF-pathway in free-living bacterial feeding nematodes of the genus Rhabditis. Conclusion Our results challenge the view of well-conserved developmental pathways. The TGF-signal transduction engine has expanded through gene dupli",

Initially, a reference set of transcription-associated proteins (TAPs) consisting of sequences functioning in all aspects of the transcriptional process, and originating from the three domains of life, was used to query the genomes. TAP-families were detected by sequence clustering of the TAPs and their archaeal homologues, and through extensive database searching, these families were assigned a function. The phylogenetic origins of archaeal genes matching hidden Markov model profiles of protein domains associated with transcription, and those encoding the TAP-homologues, showed there is extensive lineage-specificity of proteins that function as regulators of transcription: most of these sequences are present solely in the Euryarchaeota, with nearly all of them homologous to bacterial DNA-binding proteins. Strikingly, the hidden Markov model profile searches revealed that archaeal chromatin and histone-modifying enzymes also display extensive taxon-restrictedness, both across and within the two phyla.",

[Percolation of annotation errors in a database of protein sequences (2002)] developed a probabilistic framework for exploring the consequences of this percolation of errors through protein databases, and applied their theory to a simple database model.

The genomes of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli are analyzed, and all genes are classified into nine major functional classes, corresponding to important cellular processes. To study gene order relationships and genome organization in the two bacteria, we performed statistics on neighboring pairs of genes. To estimate the significance of the observations, a statistical model based on binomial distributions has been developed. Significant patterns of gene order are observed within, as well as between, the two bacterial genomes: Functionally related genes tend to be neighbors more often than do unrelated genes. Some of these groups represent well-known operons, but additional gene clusters are identified. These clusters correspond to genomic elements that \u2026",

Using the log-odds formalism, the preference for all twenty amino acids to be conserved or participate in binding (or active) sites is examined. It appears that while there is a tendency for functional residues to be conserved, the two preference scales do not coincide. Remarkable differences between amino acid types emerge from this comparative study. The current approach is expected to lead towards a better understanding of functional site architecture in proteins.",

Comparisons with alternative methods that focus on compositional sequence bias rather than information complexity measures have shown that removal of compositional bias yields at least as sensitive and much more specific results. Besides the application of sequence masking algorithms to sequence similarity searches, the study of the masked regions themselves is of great interest. Traditionally, however, these have been neglected despite evidence of their functional relevance. Results: Here we demonstrate that compositional bias seems to be a more effective measure for the detection of biologically meaningful signals. Typical results on proteins are \u2026",

The N-terminal domain (ChiN domain, amino acids 24\u2013137) has an immunoglobulin-like fold. This ChiN domain is structurally similar to fibronectin type III domains (FnIII domains), which exist in other chitinases, but does not share any sequence similarity with them.Results: Structure comparisons of the ChiN domain and FnIII domains confirm the similar fold, but fail to establish any sequence similarity. Sequence searches and comparisons between ChiN and FnIII domain sequences show a remarkable difference between the two domains in chitinases from an evolutionary point of view. A low temperature structure of chitinase A shows that the ChiN module is flexible with respect to the catalytic body of the protein.Conclusions: We postulate that the ChiN and FnIII domains evolved independently in \u2026",

The majority of enveloped viruses, exemplified by influenza virus, require an acid pH for fusion 1. After virion attachment to a specific cell surface receptor and endocytosis, the endosomal membrane and the virion membrane fuse as a result of activation of the viral fusion protein by the acid environment of the endosome.

            "Abstract": "Fast and accurate detection of plant species and their hybrids using molecular tools will facilitate the assessment and monitoring of local biodiversity in an era of climate and environmental change. Herein, we evaluate the utility of the plastid trnL marker for species identification applied to Mediterranean pines (Pinus spp.). Our results indicate that trnL is a very sensitive marker for delimiting species biodiversity. Furthermore, High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis was exploited as a molecular fingerprint for fast and accurate discrimination of Pinus spp. DNA sequence variants. The trnL approach and the HRM analyses were extended to wood samples of two species (Pinus nigra and Pinus sylvestris) with excellent results, congruent to those obtained using leaf tissue. Both analyses demonstrate that hybrids from the P. brutia (maternal parent) \u00d7 P. halepensis (paternal parent) cross, exhibit the P. halepensis profile, confirming paternal plastid inheritance in Group Halepensis pines. Our study indicates that a single one-step reaction method and DNA marker are sufficient for the identification of Mediterranean pines, their hybrids and the origin of pine wood. Furthermore, our results underline the potential for certain DNA regions to be used as novel biological information markers combined with existing morphological characters and suggest a relatively reliable and open taxonomic system that can link DNA variation to phenotype-based species or hybrid assignment status and direct taxa identification from recalcitrant tissues such as wood samples.",

            "Abstract": "The key event in prion pathogenesis is the structural conversion of the normal cellular protein, PrP C, into an aberrant and partially proteinase K resistant isoform, PrP Sc. Since the minimum requirement for a prion disease phenotype is the expression of endogenous PrP in the host, species carrying orthologue prion genes, such as fish, could in theory support prion pathogenesis. Our previous work has demonstrated the development of abnormal protein deposition in sea bream brain, following oral challenge of the fish with natural prion infectious material. In this study, we used a prion-infected mouse neuroblastoma cell line for the expression of three different mature fish PrP proteins and the evaluation of the resistance of the exogenously expressed proteins to proteinase K treatment (PK), as an indicator of a possible prion conversion. No evidence of resistance to PK was detected for any of the studied recombinant proteins. Although not indicative of an absolute inability of the fish PrPs to structurally convert to pathogenic isoforms, the absence of PK-resistance may be due to supramolecular and conformational differences between the mammalian and piscine PrPs.

Despite the low sequence identity, it is unambiguously shown that the core histone fold shares a common evolutionary history. Archaean histones and the two CBF families show a remarkable variability in contrast to eukaryotic core histones. Conserved residues shared between families are identified, possibly being responsible for the functional versatility of the core histone fold. The H4 subfamily is most similar to archaean proteins and may be the progenitor of the other core histones in eukaryotes.

Beyond social measures and biomedical research, it is important to assess the seasonality of the epidemic to inform strategies, with limited available data in the short period of time between the March equinox and the June solstice. While the effect of multiple factors is being investigated, little attention has been paid to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a key parameter of seasonal forcing. We review the effects of UV radiation, proposing it as a potential element of seasonality, and provide evidence from the current literature and scant, yet revealing, observations. Explicit consideration should be given to UV radiation for the seasonality of Covid-19 at high latitudes and altitudes, based on the SARS and MERS epidemics and coronavirus diseases, and not just the \u2018warmer days\u2019 of summer.",

Here we show that supervised, sensitive database searches with Orf3a detect weak, yet significant and highly specific similarities to the M proteins of coronaviruses. The similarity profiles can be used to derive low-resolution three-dimensional models for M proteins based on Orf3a as a structural template. The models also explain the emergence of Orf3a from M proteins and suggest a recent origin across the coronavirus lineage, enunciated by its restricted phylogenetic distribution.

Given features that can be computed from the amino-acid sequence in a straightforward fashion (such as pI, molecular weight, and amino-acid composition), the technique allows us to answer questions such as: Is the protein an enzyme? If so, in which Enzyme Commission (EC) class does it belong? Our approach uses machine learning (ML) techniques to induce classifiers that predict the EC class of an enzyme from features extracted from its primary sequence. We report on a variety of experiments in which we explored the use of three different ML techniques in conjunction with training datasets derived from PDB and from Swiss-Prot. We also explored the use of several different feature sets. Our method is able to predict the first EC number of an enzyme with 74% accuracy (thereby assigning the enzyme to one of six broad categories of enzyme function), and to predict the second EC number of an enzyme with 68% accuracy (thereby assigning the enzyme to one of 57 subcategories of enzyme function).

Larger genomes were found to harbour more transcription factors per gene than smaller ones. In addition, free-living bacteria (with a few exceptions) are clearly enriched for transcription factors, beyond the expected proportion based on their genome size.

We have detected 524 such cases, of which 113 regions appear to code for proteins present in archaeal or other species, while the remaining 411 regions are mostly start/stop definition conflicts. Of the 113 protein coding regions, only 21 code for proteins with homologues of known function. The number of novel coding sequences identified herein amounts to 1.5% of the total genome entries, while the conflicting cases represent an additional 5%. The observed differences between the four complete archaeal genomes seem to reflect \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Motivation: In computational biology, various data formats for a multitude of complex biological data types have arisen. Specifically, databases of metabolic pathways have been developed based on different internal data models. Thus, access and manipulation of those data has become critical to facilitate access to these resources. Adoption of common formats with regard to metabolic pathway representation along with the development of software tools supporting that common format has become imperative. One of the most widely accepted standards for biological pathway data exchange is BioPAX [1]. We cite the most important tools that utilize the BioPAX format and we also present a new tool that extends its functionality. Methods: BioPAX is a collaborative effort to develop a standard biological pathway data exchange language and format. It is an open file format under the LGPL license and covers a large \u2026",

Bairoch, pers. communication), and then describe the complementary nature of the work of the two groups. Early in 1992, we undertook the task of analyzing the recently sequenced chromosome III ORFs from yeast [Oliver, SG et al., Nature 357, 38461. Apart from verifying the initial results, we were able to identify 17 more ORFs with homology to proteins of known function [Bork, P. et al., Nature 358, 2871. The complete work was published with some delay (Bork, P et al., Protein Sci. 1, 1677-16901. The identification of a gene with strong similarity to NitS from nitrogen-fixing bacteria came as a surprise (see also Science 256, 730). We felt that we should investigate the matter further, and our analysis showed that NifS is homologous to various pyridoxal-S-phosphate-dependent enzymes. This result was obtained in the summer of 1992, and the manuscript was written before the end of that year. When the Mehta and Christen paper appeared early in 1993 [Mehta, PK and Christen, P., Eur. J. Biochem. 211,373-3761, we responded immediately as we submitted the final version of our manuscript by citing the observation of Mehta and Christen, as confirming our results. We believe that both papers make a contribution in complementary ways. On the methodological side, the two publications are complementary to each other. Our method is an iterative profile search as implemented by Gribskov [Gribskov, M., Gene 119, 107-l 1 l] with an additional \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the early days of the human genome project (HGP), during the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was skepticism that the genome project would produce biologically meaningful information. The reality is that bioinformatics has allowed us to extract far more biology from sequenced genomes than any published predictions in the early 1990s. Thanks to the efforts of many researchers in several subfields of bioinformatics, we can now process a sequenced genome through a series of computations to produce a quantitative metabolic flux model. Thus, surprisingly, bioinformatics has achieved what might have been held up as a holy grail of the field, before the goal was even articulated.In the early days of the human genome project (HGP), during the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was skepticism that the genome project would produce biologically meaningful information (Cantor, 1990). Yes, the HGP would produce plenty of data, but how would we extract meaning from all those bytes? Back then, the sum of nucleotide sequences in GenBank was only 37 megabases (Watson, 1990). How would we convert billions upon billions of interleaved A, C, G, and T into biology? In 1990 it was suggested that the cost of finding genes in the human genome would be prohibitive because gene-finding would have to be performed experimentally (Weis, 1990), and even in a 1993 plan for the HGP, gene finding was listed in the experimental part of the plan, not the computational section (Collins and Galas, 1993). Finding genes within the genome and determining their functions were viewed as hard problems (Rowen, et al., 1997).",

Sixteen known cases are presented in an attempt to delineate any common features of these enzymes. Apart from their ancient nature, as judged by their wide distribution and their participation in fundamental biochemical pathways, it appears that these enzymes do not share any structural or functional characteristics.

Following this view, LCRs can also be defined as regions showing composition bias. In this critical review, we focus on the definition of sequence complexity of LCRs and their connection with structure. We present statistics and methodological approaches that measure low complexity (LC) and related sequence properties. Composition bias is often associated with LC and disorder, but repeats, while compositionally biased, might also induce ordered structures. We illustrate this dichotomy, and more generally the overlaps between different properties related to LCRs, using examples.

It was isolated by an enrichment method using pyrene as sole carbon and energy source and is capable of degrading a wide range of PAH substrates including pyrene, fluoranthene, fluorene, anthracene and acenapthene. Here we describe the genomic features of this organism, together with the complete sequence and annotation. The genome consists of a 5,547,747 bp chromosome and two plasmids, a larger and a smaller one with sizes of 211,864 and 23,681 bp, respectively. In total, 5,588 genes were predicted and annotated.",

The assembly and maintenance of these complexes is facilitated by endomembrane coatomers, long suspected to be divergently related on the basis of structural and more recently phylogenomic analysis. By performing supervised walks in sequence space across coatomer superfamilies, we uncover subtle sequence patterns that have remained elusive to date, ultimately unifying eukaryotic coatomers by divergent evolution. The conserved residues shared by 3,502 endomembrane coatomer components are mapped onto the solenoid superhelix of nucleoporin and COPII protein structures, thus determining the invariant elements of coatomer architecture. This ancient structural motif can be considered as a universal \u2026",

This deterministic identification of patterns has provided us with vistas of the so-called\" Sequence space\", a much larger, but ill-defined set. The observed patterns, henceforth named seqlets, form a finite number of descriptors for this complex space and can be effectively used to describe almost every naturally occurring protein. Seqlets can be considered as building blocks of protein molecules that are a sufficient but not necessary condition for function or family equivalence memberships; thus, seqlets can either defined can serve the family signatures or cut across molecular families and undetected sequence \u2026",

Whole-genome amplification of DNA from these samples could, potentially, overcome these limitations. However, little is known about the artefacts introduced by amplification of FFPE-derived DNA with regard to genotyping, and subsequent copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses. Using a ligation adaptor amplification method, we present data from a total of 22 Affymetrix SNP 6.0 experiments, using matched paired amplified and non-amplified DNA from 10 LCM FFPE normal and dysplastic oral epithelial tissues, and an internal method control. An average of 76.5% of SNPs were called in both matched amplified and non-amplified DNA samples, and concordance was a promising 82.4%. Paired analysis for copy number, LOH, and both combined, showed that copy number changes were reduced in amplified DNA, but were 99.5% concordant when detected, amplifications were the changes most likely to be \u2018missed\u2019, only 30% of non-amplified LOH changes were identified in amplified pairs, and when copy number and LOH are combined \u223c50% of gene changes detected in the unamplified DNA were also detected in the amplified DNA and within these changes, 86.5% were concordant for both copy number and LOH status.

However, the germination process affects the physical properties of \u03b2-glucosidase in terms of charge and apparent molecular weight. Analysis of developing barley grains shows that the enzyme is synthesized two weeks before maturation and is stored in the endosperm of the dry dormat seed. Partial amino acid sequencing of the purified \u03b2-glucosidase demonstrates significant similarity between the barley enzyme and \u03b2-glycosidases that belong to family 1 of glycosyl hydrolases.",

Genome sequencing projects   have led to a rapid increase in protein sequence information, but reliable,   experimentally verified, information on protein function lags a long way   behind.   To address this deficit, functional annotation in protein databases is often   inferred by sequence similarity to homologous, annotated proteins,   with the attendant possibility of error.   Now, the functional annotation in these homologous proteins may itself   have been acquired through sequence similarity to yet other proteins,   and it is generally not possible to determine how the    functional annotation of any given protein has been acquired.    Thus the possibility of chains of misannotation arises, a process we term   \u2018error percolation\u2019.    With some simple assumptions, we develop a dynamical probabilistic model for   these \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Although studies have shown that urban environments and mass-transit systems have distinct genetic profiles, there are no systematic studies of these dense, human/microbial ecosystems around the world. To address this gap in knowledge, we created a global metagenomic and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) atlas of urban mass transit systems from 58 cities, spanning 3,741 samples and 4,424 taxonomically-defined microorganisms collected for from 2015-2017. The map provides annotated, geospatial details about microbial strains, functional genetics, antimicrobial resistance, and novel genetic elements, including 10,928 novel predicted viral species. Urban microbiomes often resemble human commensal microbiomes from the skin and airways, but also contain a consistent \u201ccore\u201d of 61 species which are predominantly not human commensal species. Conversely, samples may be accurately (91.4%) classified to their city-of-origin using a linear support vector machine over taxa. These data also show that AMR density across cities varies by several orders of magnitude, including many AMRs present on plasmids with specific cosmopolitan distributions. Together, these results constitute a high-resolution global metagenomic atlas, which enables the discovery of new genetic components of the built human environment, highlights potential forensic applications, and provides an essential first draft of the global AMR burden of the world\u2019s cities.",

            "Abstract": "With the completion of the genome sequence of Methanococcus jannaschii (Bult et al., 1996), computational analysis has revealed a number of interesting predicted functions for this organism. Although the success rate of the initial prediction was< 40%, due to a conservative attitude towards possible over-interpretation (Venter, 1996), additional efforts to annotate the sequence follow, contributing a significant increase of functional assignments through a combination of different methods (Kyrpides et al., 1996). In our continuing effort to annotate the gene products for each complete genome (Casari et al., 1995), we have analyzed the full genomic sequence of M. jannaschii, and predicted gene function by sequence similarity. We use GeneQuiz, a system for large-scale sequence analysis (Scharf et al., 1994), which exploits the combination of a number of predictive methods with a rule-based engine that increases the success of predictions thanks to a collection of heuristics and a number of benchmarking cycles (Casari et al., 1996). We have maintained a strong interest in the study of Archaea (Ouzounis and Sander, 1992; Ouzounis et al., 1995), and the analysis of the M. jannaschii genome was greatly anticipated. The scope of this communication is 3-fold:(i) to compare the performance of the GeneQuiz system against the laboriously derived (but highly accurate) manual annotation of the previous attempts;(ii) to discuss some of the cases where GeneQuiz has succeeded or failed;(iii) to assure potential users of the results that the quality of the analysis is high, despite the peculiar biochemical and phylogenetic disposition of this organism.

SHM analysis was performed for all 1290 CLL sequences in this cohort with less than 100% identity to germ line. At the cohort level, SHM patterns were typical of a canonical SHM process. However, important differences emerged from the analysis of certain subgroups of CLL sequences defined by: (1) IGHV gene usage, (2) presence of stereotyped heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences, and (3) mutational load. Recurrent, \u201cstereotyped\u201d amino acid changes occurred across the entire IGHV region in CLL subsets carrying stereotyped HCDR3 sequences, especially those expressing the IGHV3-21 \u2026",

To elucidate the mechanism of an inflammatory reaction, we have developed a mathematical model for immune cell interactions via the specific, dose-dependent cytokine production rates of cell populations. The model describes the criteria required for normal and pathological immune system responses and suggests that alterations in the cytokine production rates can lead to various stable levels which manifest themselves in different disease phenotypes. The model predicts that pairs of interacting immune cell populations can maintain homeostatic and elevated extracellular cytokine concentration levels, enabling them to operate as an immune system switch. The concept described here is developed in the context of psoriasis, an immune-mediated disease, but it can also offer mechanistic insights into other inflammatory pathologies as it explains how interactions between immune cell populations can lead to disease phenotypes.",

There have been several approaches toward this goal in general and ancestral genome content reconstruction in particular, both at the gene content [1] and, recently, at the pathway content level [2].Methods: A key aspect in the attempt to deduce the evolutionary history of a specific biological pathway is the definition of the target genomes.

Here we have analysed the entire genome of Drosophila melanogaster using fusion analysis and two additional constraints that improve the reliability of the predictions, viz. low sequence similarity and low degree of paralogy of the component proteins involved in a fusion event. Imposing these constraints, the total number of unique component pairs is reduced from 18 654 to a mere 220 cases, which are expected to represent some of the most reliably detected functionally associated proteins. Using additional information from sequence databases, we have been able to detect pairs of functionally associated proteins with important functions in cellular and developmental pathways, such as spermatogenesis and programmed cell death.

Researchers and funders alike must make daily judgments on how to best spend their limited time and money\u2013judgments that are becoming increasingly difficult as the volume of scholarly communication increases. Not only does the number of scholarly papers continue to grow, it is joined by new forms of communication from data publications to microblog posts. To deal with incoming information, scholars have always relied upon filters. At first these filters were manually compiled compendia and corpora of the literature. But by the mid-20th century, filters built on manual indexing began to break under the weight of booming postwar science production. Garfield [1] and others pioneered a solution: automated filters that leveraged scientists own impact judgments, aggregating citations as \u2018\u2018pellets of peer recognition.\u2019\u2019[2]. These citation-based filters have dramatically grown in importance and have become the tenet of how research impact is measured. But, like manual indexing 60 years ago, they may today be failing to keep up with the literature\u2019s growing volume, velocity, and diversity [3]. Citations are heavily gamed [4\u20136] and are painfully slow to accumulate [7], and overlook increasingly important societal and clinical impacts [8]. Most importantly, they overlook new scholarly forms like datasets, software, and research blogs that fall outside of the scope of citable research objects. In sum, citations only reflect formal acknowledgment and thus they provide only a partial picture of the science system [9]. Scholars may discuss, annotate \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We have previously shown that the detection of gene fusion events can contribute towards the elucidation of functional associations of proteins within entire genomes. Here we have analysed the entire genome of Drosophila melanogaster using fusion analysis and two additional constraints that improve the reliability of the predictions, viz. low sequence similarity and low degree of paralogy of the component proteins involved in a fusion event. Imposing these constraints, the total number of unique component pairs is reduced from 18 654 to a mere 220 cases, which are expected to represent some of the most reliably detected functionally associated proteins. Using additional information from sequence databases, we have been able to detect pairs of functionally associated proteins with important functions in cellular and developmental pathways, such as spermatogenesis and programmed cell death.

In this paper, we describe GeneTrace, an efficient linear-time algorithm that allows the reconstruction of evolutionary history of individual protein families as well as the complete gene content of ancestral species. The performance of the method was validated with a simulated evolution program called SimulEv. Our results indicate that given a set of correct phylogenetic profiles and a correct species tree, ancestral gene content can be reconstructed with sensitivity and selectivity of more than 90%. SimulEv simulations were also used to evaluate performance of the reconstruction of gene content-based phylogenetic trees, suggesting that these trees may be accurate at the terminal branches but suffer from long branch \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has required nonpharmaceutical interventions, primarily physical distancing, personal hygiene and face mask use, to limit community transmission, irrespective of seasons. In fact, the seasonality attributes of this pandemic remain one of its biggest unknowns. Early studies based on past experience from respiratory diseases focused on temperature or humidity, with disappointing results. Our hypothesis that ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels might be a factor and a more appropriate parameter has emerged as an alternative to assess seasonality and exploit it for public health policies. Using geographical, socioeconomic and epidemiological criteria, we selected twelve North-equatorial-South countries with similar characteristics. We then obtained UV levels, mobility and Covid-19 daily incidence rates for nearly the entire 2020. Using machine learning, we demonstrated that UV radiation strongly associated with incidence rates, more so than mobility did, indicating that UV is a key seasonality indicator for Covid-19, irrespective of the initial conditions of the epidemic. Our findings can inform the implementation of public health emergency measures, partly based on seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as the pandemic unfolds into 2021. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Phylogenetic profiles express the presence or absence of genes and their homologs across a number of reference genomes. They have emerged as an elegant representation framework for comparative genomics and have been used for the genome-wide inference and discovery of functionally linked genes or metabolic pathways. As the number of reference genomes grows, there is an acute need for faster and more accurate methods for phylogenetic profile analysis with increased performance in speed and quality. We propose a novel, efficient method for the detection of genomic idiosyncrasies, i.e. sets of genes found in a specific genome with peculiar phylogenetic properties, such as intra-genome correlations or inter-genome relationships. Our algorithm is a four-step process where genome profiles are first defined as fuzzy vectors, then discretized to binary vectors, followed by a de-noising step, and finally a comparison step to generate intra- and inter-genome distances for each gene profile. The method is validated with a carefully selected benchmark set of five reference genomes, using a range of approaches regarding similarity metrics and pre-processing stages for noise reduction. We demonstrate that the fuzzy profile method consistently identifies the actual phylogenetic relationship and origin of the genes under consideration for the majority of the cases, while the detected outliers are found to be particular genes with peculiar phylogenetic patterns. The proposed method provides a time-efficient and highly scalable approach for phylogenetic stratification, with the detected groups of genes being either similar to their own genome \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The onset of genome sequencing has brought about significant changes in the way biological data are accumulated and has radically transformed the process of biological discovery. Before the availability of complete genome sequences from unicellular or multicellular organisms, biological observations were conducted predominantly by means of an experiment that generally focused on the study of a single gene or gene product. With the entire genetic inventory of organisms available, molecular biologists and biochemists are faced with the task of analyzing the actions and interactions of hundreds or thousands of molecular components. This enormous task is feasible due to an impressive collection of sophisticated data-mining and-analysis tools that biologists depend on as well as an ever-increasing acceptance of computational analyses of their system of study. The ultimate goal of such analyses is to produce precise molecular models to support and justify detailed maps of biochemical functions and interactions at the cellular level.Given a newly sequenced genome, a series of computational analyses are typically performed to detect and functionally characterize the pieces of the cellular machinery (1). Once genes have been identified and translated, proteins are compared against databases of protein sequences or structures. Given the evolutionary links between organisms, if a suitably homologous protein of known function is identified, many features can be transferred to the new, previously uncharacterized sequence (2). The primary sequence of a protein largely determines its secondary structure features as well as its three \u2026",

This set of strain-specific genes was compared with the sets obtained with other computational approaches of direct genome comparison as well as experimental data from microarray analysis. A considerable number of novel function assignments is possible using database-driven sequence annotation, although the function of the majority of the identified genes remains unknown. Using whole-genome clustering, it is also possible to detect species-specific genes by comparing the two H.pylori strains against the genome sequence of Campylobacter jejuni. It is interesting that the majority of strain-specific genes appear to be species specific. Finally, we introduce a novel approach to gene position analysis by employing measures \u2026",

Yet, all phylogenetic reconstructions so far have presented microbial trees rather than networks. Here, we present a first attempt to reconstruct such an evolutionary network, which we term the \u201cnet of life.\u201d We use available tree reconstruction methods to infer vertical inheritance, and use an ancestral state inference algorithm to map HGT events on the tree. We also describe a weighting scheme used to estimate the number of genes exchanged between pairs of organisms. We demonstrate that vertical inheritance constitutes the bulk of gene transfer on the tree of life. We term the bulk of horizontal gene flow between tree nodes as \u201cvines,\u201d and demonstrate that multiple but mostly tiny vines interconnect the tree. Our results strongly suggest that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has spread across the world during early 2020, with unforeseen consequences. Beyond social measures and biomedical research, it is important to assess the seasonality of the epidemic to inform strategies, with limited available data in the short period of time between the March equinox and the June solstice. While the effect of multiple factors is being investigated, little attention has been paid to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a key parameter of seasonal forcing. We review the effects of UV radiation, proposing it as a potential element of seasonality, and provide evidence from the current literature and scant, yet revealing, observations. Explicit consideration should be given to UV radiation for the seasonality of Covid-19 at high latitudes and altitudes, based on the SARS and MERS epidemics and coronavirus diseases, and not just the \u2018warmer days\u2019 of summer.",

            "Abstract": "One of the most evident achievements of bioinformatics is the development of methods that transfer biological knowledge from characterised proteins to uncharacterised sequences. This mode of protein function assignment is mostly based on the detection of sequence similarity and the premise that functional properties are conserved during evolution. Most automatic approaches developed to date rely on the identification of clusters of homologous proteins and the mapping of new proteins onto these clusters, which are expected to share functional characteristics. Here, we inverse the logic of this process, by considering the mapping of sequences directly to a functional classification instead of mapping functions to a sequence clustering. In this mode, the starting point is a database of labelled proteins according to a functional classification scheme, and the subsequent use of sequence similarity allows defining the membership of new proteins to these functional classes. In this framework, we define the Correspondence Indicators as measures of relationship between sequence and function and further formulate two Bayesian approaches to estimate the probability for a sequence of unknown function to belong to a functional class. This approach allows the parametrisation of different sequence search strategies and provides a direct measure of annotation error rates. We validate this approach with a database of enzymes labelled by their corresponding four-digit EC numbers and analyse specific cases. The performance of this method is significantly higher than the simple strategy consisting in transferring the annotation from the highest scoring \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The mechanisms of stress tolerance in sessile animals, such as molluscs, can offer fundamental insights into the adaptation of organisms for a wide range of environmental challenges. One of the best studied processes at the molecular level relevant to stress tolerance is the heat shock response in the genus Mytilus. We focus on the upstream region of Mytilus galloprovincialis Hsp90 genes and their structural and functional associations, using comparative genomics and network inference. Sequence comparison of this region provides novel evidence that the transcription of Hsp90 is regulated via a dense region of transcription factor binding sites, also containing a region with similarity to the Gamera family of LINE-like repetitive sequences and a genus-specific element of unknown function. Furthermore, we infer a set of gene networks from tissue-specific expression data, and specifically extract an Hsp class-associated network, with 174 genes and 2,226 associations, exhibiting a complex pattern of expression across multiple tissue types. Our results (i) suggest that the heat shock response in the genus Mytilus is regulated by an unexpectedly complex upstream region, and (ii) provide new directions for the use of the heat shock process as a biosensor system for environmental monitoring.",

We have chosen 13 functional classes and three superclasses (ENERGY, COMMUNICATION and INFORMATION) as global descriptors of protein function. Compositional comparison of the three complete genomes reveals that functional classes are ubiquitous yet diverse in the three domains of life. Proteins related with ENERGY processes are generally represented in all three domains, while those related with COMMUNICATION represent the most distinctive functional feature of each single domain \u2026",

So far, mainly complete genomes have been used to reconstruct the  biochemical pathways and their associated interactions. However,  a large number of low coverage genomes, as well as other sources of  partial genomic data, are currently available for many organisms. In  order to be able to use incomplete data for metabolic reconstruction,  the inherent properties of this procedure need to be investigated.  In this short note, we describe the robustness and predictive power  of metabolic reconstructions using partial information from  Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

With the current advances in genomics and proteomics, it has become imperative to explore the impact of gene evolution as reflected in the metabolic signature of each genome (Zhang et al.(2006)). To this end a methodology is presented, which applies a clustering algorithm to genes from different species participating in the same pathway. Methods: The algorithm accepts as input a KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto (2000)) pathway map identifier mapID, and list of n genome identifiers that consist the target data set. By retrieving the ki genes (i= 1... n) from each genome that participate in mapID, n blastable databases are constructed. In the next step, n\u00d7\u2211 n i= 1 ki blast searches are performed, leading eventually to a matrix P [\u2211 n i= 1 ki][n], where each row is an n-bit vector that denotes the \u2026",

During genome history, the genes are frequently rear-ranged, duplicated, lost, or transferred horizontally between genomes. These events appear to be stochastic, yet they are under selective constraints resulting from the functional interactions between genes. These genomic constraints form the basis for a variety of techniques that employ systematic genome comparisons to predict functional associations among genes. The most powerful techniques to date are based on conserved gene neighborhood, gene fusion events, and common phylogenetic distributions of gene families.

Cases of self-regulation of the stability of various messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are re-evaluated here, and a general hypothesis for the origins and the mechanism of this process is presented. It is proposed that post-transcriptional autoregulation and mRNA stability are closely associated processes that might represent a general class of gene regulation mechanisms, with special regard to mRNA-protein cognate interactions. Generalizing from known examples, autoregulation is here considered to induce the decay of certain messenger RNAs through a yet undiscovered mechanism. Autoregulation via cognate interactions might be the vestigial process of a primitive world, where protein-nucleic acid interactions originated.

The performance of the system is evaluated with different cases of real-world interaction networks, including the Drosophila cell cycle control.

One attribute of genome structure is chromosome organisation in terms of gene localisation and orientation.

The description of genome organisation was pioneered with the study of the distribution of genes of the Escherichia coli partial genetic map before the full genome sequence was known. Deploying powerful techniques from circular statistics and signal processing, we revisit the issue of gene localisation and orientation using 89 complete microbial chromosomes from the eubacterial and archaeal domains.

To elucidate the mechanism of an inflammatory reaction, we have developed a mathematical model for immune cell interactions via the specific, dose-dependent cytokine production rates of cell populations. The model describes the criteria required for normal and pathological immune system responses and suggests that alterations in the cytokine production rates can lead to various stable levels which manifest themselves in different disease phenotypes. The model predicts that pairs of interacting immune cell populations can maintain homeostatic and elevated extracellular cytokine concentration levels, enabling them to operate as an immune system switch. The concept described here is developed in the context of psoriasis, an immune-mediated disease, but it can also offer mechanistic insights into other inflammatory pathologies as it explains how interactions between immune cell populations can lead to disease phenotypes. \u00a9 2010 Valeyev et al.",

Supervised sequence space walks unravel identity levels that drop below 10% and yet exhibit subtle conservation patterns in this novel superfamily, characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich topology. We document the high accuracy of the sequence space walk process in detail and characterize the subgroups of the superfamily in sequence space by systematic annotation of gene and taxon groups.

In view of the ongoing projects that sequence the complete genomes of several Archaea, this work forms a testable prediction when the genome sequences become available.

Given features that can be computed from the amino-acid sequence in a straightforward fashion (such as pI, molecular weight, and amino-acid composition), the technique allows us to answer questions such as: Is the protein an enzyme? If so, in which Enzyme Commission (EC) class does it belong? Our approach uses machine learning (ML) techniques to induce classifiers that predict the EC class of an enzyme from features extracted from its primary sequence. We report on a variety of experiments in which we explored the use of three different ML techniques in conjunction with training datasets derived from PDB and from Swiss-Prot. We also explored the use of several different feature sets. Our method is able to predict the first EC number of an enzyme with 74% accuracy (thereby assigning the enzyme to one of six broad categories of enzyme function), and to predict the second EC number of an enzyme with 68% accuracy (thereby assigning the enzyme to one of 57 subcategories of enzyme function). This technique could be a valuable complement to sequence-similarity searches and to pathwayanalysis methods.",

            "Abstract": "The life cycle of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for the most deadly form of human malaria, requires specialized protein expression for survival in the mammalian host and insect vector. To identify components of processes controlling gene expression during its life cycle, the malarial genome\u2014along with seven crown eukaryote group genomes\u2014was queried with a reference set of transcription-associated proteins (TAPs). Following clustering on the basis of sequence similarity of the TAPs with their homologs, and together with hidden Markov model profile searches, 156 P. falciparum TAPs were identified. This represents about a third of the number of TAPs usually found in the genome of a free-living eukaryote. Furthermore, the P. falciparum genome appears to contain a low number of sequences, which are highly conserved and abundant within the kingdoms of free-living eukaryotes, that \u2026",
