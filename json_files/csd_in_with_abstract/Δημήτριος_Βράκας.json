The proposed system unifies heterogeneous wireless sensor networks under a Semantic Web Service middleware. Two complementary and mutually exclusive rule-based approaches for enforcing energy-saving policies are proposed: a reactive agent based on production rules and a deliberative agent based on defeasible logic. The system was deployed at a Greek University, showing promising experimental results (at least 4% daily savings). Although the percentage of energy savings may seem low, the greatest merit of the method is ensuring that no energy is wasted by constantly enforcing the policies.",

Due to the fact that deep learning caught great attention in the last decade, numerous techniques using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been developed to accomplish this task. Whereas most of the current research focuses on achieving better performance, the goal of this paper is to design a computationally light deep neural network based on attention mechanism. A thorough analysis shows how the proposed model is implemented and compares the performance of two different attention layers in the problem of energy disaggregation. The novel architecture achieves fast training and inference with minor performance trade-off when compared against other computationally expensive state-of-the-art models.",

            "Abstract": "One of the most promising trends in Domain Independent AI Planning, nowadays, is state\u2013space heuristic planning. The planners of this category construct general but efficient heuristic functions, which are used as a guide to traverse the state space either in a forward or a backward direction. Although specific problems may favor one or the other direction, there is no clear evidence why any of them should be generally preferred. This paper proposes a hybrid search strategy that combines search in both directions. The search begins from the Initial State in a forward direction and proceeds with a weighted A* search until no further improving states can be found. At that point, the algorithm changes direction and starts regressing the Goals trying to reach the best state found at the previous step. The direction of the search may change several times before a solution can be found. Two domain-independent heuristic functions based on ASP/HSP planners enhanced with a Goal Ordering technique have been implemented. The whole bi-directional planning system, named BP, was tested on a variety of problems adopted from the recent AIPS-00 planning competition with quite promising results.",

The purpose of the Lazy Adaptive Multicriteria Planning (LAMP) system is to configure a planner in an optimal way, concerning two quality metrics (ie execution speed and plan quality), for a given problem according to user-specified preferences. The training data are produced by running the planner under consideration on a set of problems using all possible parameter configurations and recording the planning time and the plan length. When a new problem arises, LAMP extracts the values for a number of domain-expert specified problem features and uses them to identify the \u0430 nearest problems solved in the past. The system then performs a multicriteria combination of the performances of the retrieved problems according to user-specified weights that specify the relative importance of the quality metrics and selects the configuration with the best score.

This paper demonstrates multimedia and Web-based enhancement with the design and construction of a port, a large-scale civil engineering project. The main purpose was to create an educational tool that brings into the classroom a \u201creal-life\u201d design and construction problem, including the construction field, operation of equipment, and details of construction methods. This enables civil engineering students to better understand the details of the planning, design, and construction of a complicated project. Furthermore, through the use of evaluation tests, feedback on the students\u2019 understanding of the case study can be provided to both the students and the educator. This application can be expanded beyond an academic environment for use as a learning \u2026",

Essential steps in achieving Web service composition include the translation of the Web service composition problem into a solver-ready planning domain and problem, followed by the acquisition of solutions, and the translation of the solutions back to Web service terms. The solutions to the problem, that is, the descriptions of the desired composite service, are obtained by means of external domain-independent planning systems, they are visualized and finally evaluated. Throughout the entire process, the system exploits semantic information extracted from the semantic descriptions of the available Web services and the corresponding ontologies, in order to perform composition under semantic awareness and relaxation.",

The tool\u201f s aim is twofold: to enable users manually create descriptions in a visual manner, providing a complete alternative to coding, and to semi-automate the process by matching elements and concepts and suggesting annotations. A state-of-the-art survey has been carried out to reveal critical requirements and compare Iridescent to existing tools. Usage scenarios demonstrate how Iridescent enhances the authoring process and in turn enables Intelligence eg in an Ambient Intelligence environment.

The planners of this category construct general but efficient heuristic functions, which are used as a guide to traverse the state space either in a forward or a in backward direction. Although specific problems may favor one or the other direction, there is no clear evidence why any of them should be generally preferred. This paper proposes a hybrid search strategy that combines search in both directions. The search begins from the Initial State in a forward direction and proceeds with a weighted A* search until no further improving states can be found. At that point, the algorithm changes direction and starts regressing the Goals trying to reach the best state found at the previous step. The direction of the search may change several times before a solution can be found. Two domain-independent heuristic functions based on ASP/HSP planners enhanced with a Goal Ordering technique have been implemented. The whole bi-directional planning system, named BP, was tested on a variety of problems adopted from the recent AIPS-00 planning competition with quite promising results. The paper also discusses the subject of domain analysis for state-space planning and proposes two methods for the elimination of redundant information from the problem definition and for the identification of independent sub-problems.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive planning system, called HAP RC, which automatically fine-tunes its planning parameters according to the morphology of the problem in hand, through a combination of Planning, Machine Learning and Knowledge-Based techniques. The adaptation is guided by a rule-based system that sets planner configuration parameters based on measurable characteristics of the problem instance. The knowledge of the rule system has been acquired through a rule induction algorithm. Specifically, the approach of propositional rule learning was applied to a dataset produced by results from experiments on a large number of problems from various domains, including those used in the three International Planning Competitions. The improvement of the adaptive system over the original planner is assessed through thorough experiments in problems of both known and unknown domains.",

Due to the fact that deep learning caught great attention in the last decade, numerous techniques using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been developed to accomplish this task. Whereas most of the current research focuses on achieving better performance, the goal of this paper is to design a computationally light deep neural network based on attention mechanism. A thorough analysis shows how the proposed model is implemented and compares the performance of two different attention layers in the problem of energy disaggregation. The novel architecture achieves fast training and inference with minor performance trade-off when compared against other computationally expensive state-of-the-art models.",

In contrast to other pooling operations, which use arbitrary criteria for feature selection, it is based on the principle of maximum entropy. The designated deep neural network shows comparable performance with other state-of-the-art models, while it has less than half the size of them.",

Recent research developments have used deep neural networks and outperformed previous methods based on Hidden Markov Models. On the other hand deep learning models are computationally heavy and require huge amounts of data. The main objective of the current paper is to incorporate the attention mechanism into neural networks in order to reduce their computational complexity. For the attention mechanism two different versions are utilized, named Additive and Dot Attention. The experiments show that they perform on par, while the Dot mechanism is slightly faster. The two versions of self-attentive neural networks are compared against two state-of-the-art energy disaggregation deep learning models. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture achieves faster or equal training and inference time and with minor performance drop depending on the device or the dataset.",

Semantics can significantly improve software reuse and discovery and allow the automatic composition of Web Services in order to produce large scale applications. The use of VLEPpO for the automatic composition of Web Services is proposed. VLEPpO is a visual programming tool for designing planning problems using visual elements and simple mouse operations. In the tool the user simply defines the properties of the available Web Services and the global goals of the application. Then VLEPpO automatically forms the description as a planning problem, solves it by calling an appropriate planning system and exports the solution either to a Web Service execution monitoring system or to a UDDI registry.",

A distinctive feature of the system is that throughout the entire process, it achieves semantic awareness by exploiting semantic information extracted from the OWL-S descriptions of the available atomic web services and the corresponding ontologies. This information is then used in order to enhance the planning domain and problem. Semantic awareness facilitates approximations when searching for suitable atomic services, as well as modification of the produced composite service. The alternatives for modification include the replacement of a certain atomic service that takes part in the composite service by an equivalent or a semantically relevant service, the replacement of an atomic service through planning, or the \u2026",

Although specific problems may favor one or the other direction, there is no clear evidence why any of them should be generally preferred. This paper presents Hybrid\u2010AcE, a domain\u2010independent planning system that combines search in both directions utilizing a complex criterion that monitors the progress of the search, to switch between them. Hybrid AcE embodies two powerful domain\u2010independent heuristic functions extending one of the AcE planning systems.

Access control is preferable over inference control in terms of efficiency, but it fails to offer confidentiality in the presence of inference channels. We argue that during the design phase of a data schema and the definition of user roles, inference channels should be considered. An approach is introduced that can be integrated into a risk assessment exercise to assist in determining the roles and/or attributes that lower the risks associated with information disclosure from inference. The residual risk from the remaining inference channels could be treated by well known inference control mechanisms.",

The method innovates in that it parallelizes the application of the available operators to the current state and the evaluation of the successor states using the heuristic function. In order to achieve better load balancing and a lift in the scalability of the algorithm, the operator set is initially enlarged, by grounding the first argument of each operator. Additional load balancing is achieved through the reordering of the operator set, based on the expected amount of imposed work. ODMP is effective for heuristic planners, but it can be applied to planners that embody other search strategies as well. It has been applied to GRT, a domain-independent heuristic planner, and CL, a heuristic planner for simple logistics problems, and has been thoroughly tested on a set of logistics problems \u2026",

With the rise of Internet of things, running energy disaggregation models on the edge is more and more essential for privacy concerns and economic reasons. However, current NILM solutions use data-hungry deep learning models that can recognize only one device and are impossible to run on a device with limited resources. This research investigates in-depth multi-label NILM systems and suggests a novel framework which enables a cost-effective solution. It can be deployed on an embedded device, and thus, privacy can be preserved. The proposed system leverages dimensionality reduction using Signal2Vec, is evaluated on two popular public datasets and outperforms another state-of-the-art multi-label NILM system.",
