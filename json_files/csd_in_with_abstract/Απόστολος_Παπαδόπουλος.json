            "Abstract": "Modern applications requiring spatial network processing pose several interesting query optimization challenges. Spatial networks are usually represented as graphs, and therefore, queries involving a spatial network can be executed by using the corresponding graph representation. This means that the cost for executing a query is determined by graph properties such as the graph order and size (i.e., number of nodes and edges) and other graph parameters. In this paper, we present novel methods to estimate the number of nodes and edges in regions of interest in spatial networks, towards predicting the space and time requirements for range queries. The methods are evaluated by using real-life and synthetic data sets. Experimental results show that the number of nodes and edges can be estimated efficiently and accurately, with relatively small space requirements, thus providing useful information to the query \u2026",

A point p1 dominates p2 if p1 is as good as p2 in all attributes and is strictly better in at least one. Existing works address the problem in settings where data objects are multidimensional points. However, there are domains where we only have access to the distance between two objects. In cases like these, attributes reflect distances from a set of input objects and are dynamically generated as the input objects change. Consequently, prior works from the literature can not be applied, despite the fact that the dominance relation is still meaningful and valid. For this reason, in this work, we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries over distance-based dynamic asttribute vectors, defined over a metric space. We propose four progressive algorithms that utilize the properties of the underlying metric space to efficiently solve the problem, and present an extensive, comparative evaluation on both synthetic and real world data sets.",

The authors propose an efficient and effective graph manipulation technique that can be used in graph-based similarity search. Given a query graph G/sub q/ (V,E), they would like to determine fast which are the graphs in the database that are similar to G/sub q/ (V,E), with respect to a similarity measure. First, they study the similarity measure between two graphs. Then, they discuss graph representation techniques by means of multidimensional vectors. It is shown that no false dismissals are introduced by using the vector representation. Finally they illustrate some representative queries that can be handled by their approach, and present experimental results, based on the proposed graph similarity algorithm.

            "Abstract": "Similarity queries are fundamental operations that are used extensively in many modern applications, whereas disk arrays are powerful storage media of increasing importance. The basic trade-off in similarity query processing in such a system is that increased parallelism leads to higher resource consumptions and low throughput, whereas low parallelism leads to higher response times. Here, we propose a technique which is based on a careful investigation of the currently available data in order to exploit parallelism up to a point, retaining low response times during query processing. The underlying access method is a variation of the R*-tree, which is distributed among the components of a disk array, whereas the system is simulated using event-driven simulation. The performance results conducted, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms by factors a previous branch-and-bound algorithm and a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to the problem of nearest neighbor query processing in declustered spatial databases. Recently a branch-and-bound nearest neighbor finding (BB-NNF) algorithm has been designed to process nearest neighbor queries in R-trees. However, this algorithm is strictly serial (branch-and-bound oriented) and its performance degrades, during processing of a nearest neighbor query, if applied to a parallel environment, since it does not exploit any kind of parallelization. We develop an efficient query processing strategy for parallel nearest neighbor finding (P-NNF), assuming a shared nothing multi-processor architecture, where the processors communicate via a network. In our method, the relevant sites are activated simultaneously. In order to achieve this goal, statistical information is used. The efficiency measure is the response time of a given query.

In this work, we study trajectory similarity by attacking the problem taking an information retrieval perspective. Trajectories are first decomposed by using a grid and each trajectory is mapped to a multidimensional space where Latent Semantic Analysis is applied. Distance measures like Euclidean distance or cosine distance are applied to process similarity queries (range queries, k-NN queries). Performance evaluation results, based on real-life data sets, show the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

Examples include stocks, seismic signals, audio, and so forth. Similarity search in time series databases is an important research direction. Several methods have been proposed to provide efficient query processing in the case of static time series of fixed length. Research in this field has focused on the development of effective transformation techniques, the application of dimensionality reduction methods, and the design of efficient indexing schemes. These tools enable the process of similarity queries in time series databases. In the case where time series are continuously updated with new values (streaming time series), the similarity problem becomes even more difficult to solve, since we must take into consideration the new values of the series. The dynamic nature of streaming time series precludes \u2026",

Some example applications are: (i) analysis of microarray data in bioinformatics, (ii) pattern discovery in a large graph representing a social network, (iii) analysis of transportation networks, (iv) community discovery in Web data. The basic approach followed by existing methods is to apply mining techniques on graph data to discover important patterns, such as subgraphs that are likely to be useful. However, in some cases the number of mined patterns is large, posing difficulties in selecting the most important ones. For example, applying frequent subgraph mining on a set of graphs the system returns all connected subgraphs whose frequency is above a specified (usually user-defined) threshold. The number of discovered patterns may be large, and this number \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Network exploration is an important research direction with many applications. In such a setting, the network is, usually, modeled as a graph G, whereas any structural information of interest is extracted by inspecting the way nodes are connected together. In the case where the adjacency matrix or the adjacency list of G is available, one can directly apply graph mining algorithms to extract useful knowledge. However, there are cases where this is not possible because the graph is hidden or implicit, meaning that the edges are not recorded explicitly in the form of an adjacency representation. In such a case, the only alternative is to apply a sequence of edge probing queries asking for the existence or not of a particular graph edge. However, checking all possible node pairs is costly (quadratic on the number of nodes). Thus, our objective is to execute as few edge probing queries as possible, since each such query is \u2026",

The book aims to present fundamental as well as some advanced issues in the area in a precise, but easy-to-follow, manner. Dominance is an intuitive concept that can be used in many different ways in diverse application domains. The concept of dominance is based on the values of the attributes of each object. An object \ud835\udc5d dominates another object \ud835\udc5e if \ud835\udc5d is better than \ud835\udc5e. This goodness criterion may differ from one user to another. However, all decisions boil down to the minimization or maximization of attribute values. In this book, we will explore algorithms and applications related to dominance-based query processing. The concept of dominance has a long history in finance and multi-criteria optimization. However, the introduction of the concept to the database community in 2001 inspired many \u2026",

Nowadays, a significant number of applications require the manipulation of time evolving data and therefore the study of continuous query processing has recently attracted the interest of the data management community. The goal of continuous query processing is to continuously evaluate long-running queries by using incremental algorithms and thus to avoid query evaluation from scratch, if possible. In this paper, we examine the characteristics of important preference queries, such as skyline, top-k and top-k dominating and we review algorithms proposed for the evaluation of continuous preference queries under the sliding window streaming model.",

In this work, we study the problem of distributed skyline computation and propose an adaptive algorithm towards controlling the degree of parallelism and the required network traffic. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, our algorithm handles efficiently diverse preferences imposed on attributes. The key idea is to partition the data using a grid scheme and for each query to build on-the-fly a dependency graph among partitions which can help in effective pruning. Our algorithm operates in two modes: (i) full-parallel mode, where processors are activated simultaneously or (ii) cascading mode, where processors are activated in a cascading manner using propagation of intermediate results, thus reducing network traffic and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Spatial data management has been an active area of intensive research for more than two decades. In order to support spatial objects in a database system several issues should be taken into consideration such as: spatial data models, indexing mechanisms, efficient query processing, cost models. One of the most influential access methods in the area is the R-tree structure proposed by Guttman in 1984 as an effective and efficient solution to index rectangular objects in VLSI design applications. Since then, several variations of the original structure have been proposed towards: providing more efficient access, handling objects in high-dimensional spaces, supporting concurrent accesses, supporting I/O and CPU parallelism, efficient bulk-loading. It seems that due to the modern demanding applications and after the academia has paved the way, recently the industry recognized the use and necessity of R-trees. The simplicity of the structure and its resemblance to the B-tree, allowed developers to easily incorporate the structure into existing database management systems in order to support spatial query processing. In this paper we provide an extensive survey of the R-tree evolution, studying the applicability of the structure and its variations to efficient query processing, accurate proposed cost models, and implementation issues like concurrency control and parallelism. Based on the observation that \u2018space is everywhere\u2019, we anticipate that we are in the beginning of the era of the \u2018ubiquitous R-tree\u2019in an analogous manner as B-trees were considered 25 years ago.",

Given a dominance relationship in a dataset, a skyline query returns the objects that cannot be dominated by any other objects. Skyline queries were studied extensively in multidimensional spaces, in subspaces, in metric spaces, in dynamic spaces, in streaming environments, and in time-series data. Several algorithms were proposed for skyline query processing, such as window-based, progressive, distributed, geometric-based, index-based, divide- and-conquer, and dynamic programming algorithms. Moreover, several variations were proposed to solve application-specific problems like k-dominant skylines, top-k dominating queries, spatial skyline queries, and others. As the number of objects that are returned in a skyline query may become large, there is also an extensive study for the cardinality of \u2026",

We propose a method for continuous range query processing for different types of queries, characterized by mobility of objects and/or queries which follow paths in an underlying spatial network. The method assumes an available 2D indexing scheme for indexing spatial network data. An appropriately extended R*-tree provides matching of queries and objects according to their locations on the network or their network routes. The method introduces an additional prerefinement step which generates main memory data structures to support efficient, incremental reevaluation of continuous range queries in periodically performed refinement steps.",

In such a case the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement policy is not powerful enough to guarantee efficiency, because it does not take into consideration important parameters of the structure, such as the portion (area) of the dataspace that each page occupies. Of course, the time period passed since the last reference of a page is still an important factor. Therefore, we combine several factors, in order to derive a more powerful caching algorithm. Experiments based on real and synthetic datasets, show that the new replacement algorithm performs better than LRU in many cases and also supports tuning.",

The structure is dynamic and adapts gracefully to its contents under insertions and deletions. A single record retrieval costs two disk accesses at most (upper bound), whereas range queries and partial-match queries are also executed efficiently. The Grid File can be thought of as a generalization of dynamic hashing (eg, extendible hashing) in multiple dimensions.",

In this paper, we are concerned with the development of novel classification algorithms that can efficiently handle noise. To attain this, we recognize an analogy between k nearest neighbors (kNN) classification and user-based collaborative filtering algorithms, as they both find a neighborhood of similar past data and process its contents to make a prediction about new data. The recent development of item-based collaborative filtering algorithms, which are based on similarities between items instead of transactions, addresses the sensitivity of user-based methods against noise in recommender systems. For this reason we focus on the item-based paradigm to provide improved robustness, compared to kNN algorithms, against noise for the problem of classification. We propose two new item-based algorithms, which are experimentally evaluated with kNN. Our results show that, in terms of precision, the proposed methods outperform kNN classification by up to 15%, whereas compared to other methods like the C4. 5 system, improvement exceeds 30%.",

More specifically, given a set of objects the problem is to return the suspicious objects that deviate significantly from the typical behavior. As in the case of clustering, the application of different criteria leads to different definitions for an outlier. In this work, we focus on distance-based outliers: an object x is an outlier if there are less than k objects lying at distance at most R from x. The problem offers significant challenges when a stream-based environment is considered, where data arrive continuously and outliers must be detected on-the-fly. There are a few research works studying the problem of continuous outlier detection. However, none of these proposals meets the requirements of modern stream-based applications for the following \u2026",

Simply stated, the core decomposition of a network (graph) assigns to each graph node v, an integer number c(v) (the core number), capturing how well v is connected with respect to its neighbors. This concept is strongly related to the concept of graph degeneracy, which has a long history in graph theory. Although the core decomposition concept is extremely simple, there is an enormous interest in the topic from diverse application domains, mainly because it can be used to analyze a network in a simple and concise manner by quantifying the significance of graph nodes. Therefore, there exists a respectable number of research works that either propose efficient algorithmic techniques under different settings and graph types or apply the concept to another problem or scientific area.

            "Abstract": "In many real-world applications, the corresponding graphs are inherently associated with uncertainty, which can be due to various reasons, such as uncertainty introduced by the data-collection process or for privacy-preserving reasons. For example, in the case of protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) in the domain of biology, each node corresponds to a specific protein and the edges capture information about the interaction of two proteins. Since in many cases those interactions are indicated either by noisy laboratory experiments or by prediction algorithms based on features of the proteins (instead of being actually observed), a level of uncertainty is introduced in the edges of the graph. This uncertainty can be captured by the model of uncertain or probabilistic graphs, where each edge is associated with a probability of existence. In this work, we are interested in a widely applied graph analytics tool, namely the one of k-core decomposition [4]. Let H be a subgraph of graph G. Subgraph H is defined to be a k-core of G, denoted by Gk, if it is a maximal connected subgraph of G in which all vertices have degree at least k. Based on that, vertex i has core number coreG (i)= k, if it belongs to a k-core but not to any (k+ 1)-core. Due to its simplicity and computational efficiency, the k-core decomposition has been applied in many domains, including community detection and identification of influential spreaders in social networks. Then, the following questions arise, which also describe the goals of this work: how to define the concept of core decomposition in uncertain graphs and how to efficiently compute it?

In its simplest form, a reachability query is defined by a pair of nodes (u, v) and a graph G, and detects if there is a path from u to v. This paper addresses a specific case of reachability on multi-labeled distributed graphs, where the query is parameterized by a set of source nodes S, a set of target nodes T and a set of constraints C on the edge labels. We conduct a performance evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, using multiple instances of Neo4j servers (as workers) running simultaneously. The results show that the number of workers, the network density and the number of cross-edges have a significant impact on the overall performance. Moreover, we observe that the proposed approach is scalable and can be used to solve label-constrained distributed set reachability queries \u2026",

In streaming time series the problem is more challenging due to the dynamic nature of the data.

Each streaming time series is transformed to a vector by means of the Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) technique. The PLA vector comprises pairs of values (timestamp, trend) denoting the starting time of the trend and the type of the trend (either UP or DOWN) respectively. A distance metric for PLA vectors is introduced. We propose split and merge criteria to continuously update the clustering information. Moreover, the proposed method handles outliers.

The dominance score of an object p is simply the number of objects dominated by p, based on minimization or maximization preferences on the attribute values. Each object (tuple) is represented as a point in a multidimensional space, and therefore, the number of attributes equals the number of dimensions. The top-k dominating query combines the dominance concept of skyline queries with the ranking function of top-k queries and can be used as an important tool in multi-criteria decision making systems. In this work, we focus on the 2-dimensional space and present, for the first time, novel algorithms for top-k dominating query processing in main memory with non-trivial asymptotic guarantees. In particular, we focus on both the semi-dynamic case (only insertions are allowed) and the fully-dynamic case (insertions and deletions are supported). We perform a detailed cost analysis regarding the worst-case complexity of preprocessing, the worst-case complexity for the query cost and the worst-case and amortized complexity for updates (insertions and deletions) focusing on the RAM computation model. Our solutions require space linear with the number of points, which is very important especially for modern applications which manipulate massive datasets. In addition, we discuss the case of the word-RAM computation model, where slightly better results are obtained.",

One of the most widely employed criteria for determining whether an element is an outlier is based on the number of neighboring elements within a fixed distance (R), against a fixed threshold (k). Such outliers are referred to as distance-based outliers and are the focus of this work. In this demo, we show both an extendible framework for outlier detection algorithms and specific outlier detection algorithms for the demanding case where outlier detection is continuously performed over a data stream. More specifically: i) first we demonstrate a novel flavor of an open-source publicly available tool for Massive Online Analysis (MOA) that is endowed with capabilities to encapsulate algorithms that continuously detect outliers and ii) second \u2026",

CDR data are a rich geo-referenced source of user behaviour information. In this work, we perform an analysis of CDR data for the city of Milan that originate from Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge. A set of graphs is generated from aggregated CDR data, where each node represents a centroid of an RBS (Radio Base Station) polygon, and each edge represents aggregated telecom traffic between two RBSs. To explore the community structure, we apply a modularity-based algorithm. Community structure between days is highly dynamic, with variations in number, size and spatial distribution. One general rule observed is that communities formed over the urban core of the city are small in size and prone to dynamic change in spatial distribution, while communities formed in the suburban areas are larger in size and more consistent with respect to their spatial distribution. To evaluate the dynamics of change in community structure between days, we introduced different graph based and spatial community properties which contain latent footprint of human dynamics. We created land use profiles for each RBS polygon based on the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service Urban Atlas data set to quantify the correlation and predictivennes of human dynamics properties based on land use. The results reveal a strong correlation between some properties and land use which motivated us to further explore this topic.

The user is then presented with the entire skyline set, which may be in several cases overwhelming, therefore requiring manual inspection to come up with the most informative data points. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel approach in selecting the k most diverse skyline points, ie, the ones that best capture the different aspects of both the skyline and the dataset they belong to. We present a novel formulation of diversification which, in contrast to previous proposals, is intuitive, because it is based solely on the domination relationships among points.

An important query type in such an environment is the nearest-neighbor query, which asks for the k closest objects of a query object during a time interval [t/sub s/, t/sub e/]. However, there are cases where the (k+1)-th nearest-neighbor is requested after the execution of the k-NN query. In such a case, either the query must be evaluated again, or we can exploit the previous result and use an incremental method to determine the new answer. We focus on the second alternative and present efficient incremental algorithms that outperform the trivial method which is based on complete re-execution of the query. In addition, we study the problem of keeping the query result consistent in the presence of object insertions, deletions and updates which are very common in a dynamic moving-object environment.",

The number of skyline items depend heavily on both the data distribution, the data population and the dimensionality of the data set. In this work, we provide a dominance-based analysis and querying scheme that aims at alleviating the skyline cardinality problem, trying to introduce ranking on the items. The proposed scheme can be used either as a mining or as a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In contrast to regular queries that are evaluated only once, a continuous query remains active over a period of time and has to be continuously evaluated to provide up to date answers. We propose a method for continuous range query processing for different types of queries, characterized by mobility of objects and/or queries which all follow paths in an underlying spatial network. The method assumes an available 2D indexing scheme for indexing spatial network data. An appropriately extended R\u2217-tree, that primarily is used as an indexing scheme for network segments, provides matching of queries and objects according to their locations on the network or their network routes. The method introduces an additional pre-refinement step which generates main-memory data structures to support efficient, incremental reevaluation of continuous range queries in periodically performed refinement steps.",

The recent development of item-based collaborative filtering algorithms, which are based on similarities between items instead of transactions, addresses the sensitivity of user-based methods against noise in recommender systems.

The analysis of such data can convey knowledge in prominent applications, and mining groups of moving objects turns out to be a valuable mean to model their movement. Existing approaches pay particular attention in groups where objects are close and move together or follow similar trajectories by assuming that movement cannot change over time. Instead, we observe that groups can be of interest also when objects are spatially distant and have different but inter-related movements: objects can start from different places and join together to move towards a common location. To take into account inter-related movements, we have to analyze the objects jointly, follow their respective movements and consider changes of movements over time. Motivated by this, we introduce the notion of communities and propose a computational solution to discover them. The method is structured in three steps. The first step performs a feature extraction technique to elicit the inter-related movements between the objects. The second one leverages a tree-structure in order to group objects with similar inter-related movements. In the third step, these groupings are used to mine communities as groups of objects which exhibit inter-related movements over time. We evaluate our approach on real data-sets and compare it with existing algorithms.",

Several methods have been proposed in order to provide algorithms for efficient query processing in the case of static time series of fixed length. In streaming time series the similarity problem is more complex, since the dynamic nature of streaming data make these methods inappropriate. In this paper, we propose a new method to evaluate similarity range queries in streaming time series. The method is based on the use of a multidimensional access method, the R*-tree, which is used to store features of the time series extracted by means of the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform). We take advantage of the incremental computation of the DFT and equip the R*-tree with a deferred update policy in order to improve maintenance costs. The experimental evaluation based on synthetic random walk time series and on real stock market data shows that significant performance improvement is achieved in comparison to the sequential scanning of the database.",

More specifically, given a set of objects the problem is to return the suspicious objects that deviate significantly from the typical behavior. As in the case of clustering, the application of different criteria lead to different definitions for an outlier. In this work, we focus on distance-based outliers: an object x is an outlier if there are less than k objects lying at distance at most R from x. The problem offers significant challenges when a stream-based environment is considered, where data arrive continuously and outliers must be detected on-the-fly.

User ratings are not expected to be independent, as users follow trends of similar rating behavior. In terms of Text Mining, this is analogous to the formation of higher-level concepts from plain terms. In this paper, we propose a novel CF algorithm which uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to detect rating trends and performs recommendations according to them. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation, with two real data sets, and produce results that indicate its superiority over existing CF algorithms.",

Although bulk-loading techniques for access methods have been studied in the spatial database literature, parallel bulk-loading has not been addressed in a parallel spatial database context. Therefore, we study the problem of parallel bulk-loading, assuming that an R-tree like access method need to be constructed, from a spatial relation that is distributed to a number of processors. Analytical cost models and experimental evaluation based on real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the index construction time can be reduced considerably by exploiting parallelism. I/O costs, CPU time and communication costs are taken into consideration in order to investigate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

Within the proposed framework we adapt several existing algorithms for searching in P2P networks. Detailed experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed framework and the comparison between similarity searching algorithms.",

            "Abstract": "Skyline queries have emerged as an expressive and informative tool, with minimal user input and thus, they have gained widespread attention. However, previous research works tackle the problem from an efficiency standpoint, ie, returning the skyline as fast as possible, leaving it to the user to manually inspect the entire skyline result. Clearly, this is impractical, even with a few dozen points. The techniques addressing this issue are computationally expensive, mapping to NP-Hard problems or having exponential complexity O (2d) with respect to data dimensionality d. Moreover, the result is a set, lacking any quality-based ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel IR-style ranking mechanism for skyline points, based on the renowned tf-idf weighting scheme. We present efficient algorithms to compute the quality of a skyline point according to our technique, and induce a total ordering of the skyline set. Finally, we empirically evaluate the efficiency of our method with real-life and synthetic data sets.",

A single \u2018voice\u2019may consist of more than one synchronous notes that are perceived as belonging to the same auditory stream; in this sense, the proposed algorithm, may separate a given musical work into fewer voices than the maximum number of notes in the greatest chord (eg a piece consisting of four or more concurrent notes may be separated simply into melody and accompaniment). This is paramount, not only in the study of auditory streaming per se, but also for developing MIR systems that enable pattern recognition and extraction within musically pertinent \u2018voices\u2019(eg melodic lines).

Traditional access methods that continuously update the data are considered inefficient, due to the significant update costs. In this paper we present IDC-Index, an efficient technique for similarity query processing in streaming time sequences, which is based on a multidimensional access method enhanced with a deferred update policy and an incremental computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is used as a feature extraction method. The method manages to reduce the number of false alarms examined and therefore achieves high answers/candidates ratio.

However, there are cases where this is not possible because the graph is \\textit{hidden} or \\textit{implicit}, meaning that the edges are not recorded explicitly in the form of an adjacency representation. In such a case, the only alternative is to pose a sequence of \\textit{edge probing queries} asking for the existence or not of a particular graph edge. However, checking all possible node pairs is costly (quadratic on the number of nodes). Thus, our objective is to pose as few edge probing queries as possible, since each such query is expected to be costly.

Our proposal fills this gap and studies transferring state-of-the-art techniques in Apache Flink, a modern platform for intensive streaming analytics. We thoroughly present the technical challenges encountered and the alternatives that may be applied. We show speed-ups up to 117 (resp. 2076) times over a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks present the advantages of increased size of the overall database offered by a the network nodes, fault-tolerance support to peer failure, and workload distribution. Music file storage and exchange has long abandoned the traditional centralised server-client approach for the advantages of P2P networks. In this paper, we examine the problem of searching for similar acoustic data over unstructured decentralised P2P networks. As distance measure, we utilise the time warping. We propose a novel algorithm, which efficiently retrieves similar audio data. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the absence of overhead in unstructured P2P networks and minimises the required traffic for all operations with the use of an intelligent sampling scheme. Detailed experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to an existing baseline algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) Systems have been studied extensively for more than a decade to confront the \u201cinformation overload\u201d problem. Nearest-neighbor CF is based either on common user or item similarities, to form the user\u2019s neighborhood. The effectiveness of the aforementioned approaches would be augmented, if we could combine them. In this paper, we use biclustering to disclose this duality between users and items, by grouping them in both dimensions simultaneously. We propose a novel nearest-biclusters algorithm, which uses a new similarity measure that achieves partial matching of users\u2019 preferences. We apply nearest-biclusters in combination with a biclustering algorithm \u2013 Bimax \u2013 for constant values. Extensively performance evaluations on two real data sets is provided, which show that the proposed method improves the performance of the CF process substantially. We attain more \u2026",

In this work, we study the discovery of the top-k dense subgraphs in a set of graphs. After the investigation of the problem in its static case, we extend the methodology to work with dynamic graph collections, where the graph collection changes over time. Our methodology is based on lower and upper bounds of the density, resulting in a reduction of the number of exact density computations. Our algorithms do not rely on user-defined threshold values and the only input required is the number of dense subgraphs in the result (k). In addition to the exact algorithms, an approximation algorithm is provided for top-k dense subgraph discovery, which trades result accuracy for \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Large network analysis is a very important topic in data mining. A significant body of work in the area studies the problem of node similarity. One way to express node similarity is to associate with each node the set of 1-hop neighbors and compute the Jaccard similarity between these sets. This information can be used subsequently for more complex operations like link prediction, clustering or dense subgraph discovery. In this work, we study algorithms to monitor the result of a similarity join between nodes continuously, assuming a sliding window accommodating graph edges. Since the arrival of a new edge or the expiration of an existing one may change the similarity between several node pairs, the challenge is to maintain the similarity join result as efficiently as possible. Our theoretical study is validated by a thorough experimental evaluation, based on real-world as well as synthetically generated \u2026",

In this paper, we formulate the problem of mining the next most correlated graph in a graph database given the top-k correlated graphs, with respect to a query graph q. In order to solve the above problem, we take advantage of the search tree, produced by the top-k graphs. However, the search tree poses significantly difficulties, due to its size. Mainly relied on the TopCor algorithm, we make use of the algorithm's findings and rules, we derive two termination conditions and we devise a new algorithm to address the above problem, iTopCor. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm with respect to TopCor, especially when the data set is large or when many sub graph isomorphism tests are involved.",

However, by increasing the number of attributes, the probability that a tuple dominates another one is reduced significantly. To attack this problem, k-dominant skylines have been proposed, relaxing the definition of domination. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous monitoring of k-dominant skylines, where multiple queries are running concurrently. The proposed method divides the space in pairs of attributes. For each pair, we compute skyline tuples and we exploit them to eliminate candidates tuples of the queries and we combine the partial results. The proposed scheme uses only simple domination checks and it is applicable to the streaming case as well as to ad-hoc insertions and deletions. Experiments, based on different data distributions, show the efficiency of the proposed scheme in comparison to existing methods.",

To this end, several new data models and standards have been proposed. In this chapter, after providing an overview of these efforts, an important gap in both the literature and practice is identified, namely, to adopt a formalized procedure to assess the healthcare infrastructure in terms of privacy and cybersecurity risks, which is an essential step toward establishing trust in sharing and processing medical records across health institutions. To fill this gap, a conceptual model is introduced, which is materialized in the context of",

            "Abstract": "Online auctions are quickly becoming one of the leading branches of e-commerce. Unfortunately, online auctions attract many fraudulent activities. Reputation systems are crucial for guaranteeing fairness of trade and reliability of service. Currently used reputation systems offer little protection from malevolent contractors. In this paper we present a new method for mining the reputation of sellers in online auctions. We devise two independent measures that assess reliability and questionability of sellers in parallel, leading to the concept of positive and negative reputation. To compute these measures we construct an S-graph which reflects the social linkage between sellers and buyers. We use both explicit and implicit feedbacks provided by auction participants, carefully identifying missing feedbacks that have been purposefully left out. Based on reputation estimates the community of online auction participants can detect misbehaving contractors and counteract fraud. Thus, the application of social information about reputation of contractors can be perceived as recommendations. Experimental evaluation of our proposal proves the feasibility and usefulness of the presented approach.",

            "Abstract": "Keyword extraction is an important document process that aims at finding a small set of terms that concisely describe a document's topics. The most popular state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches belong to the family of the graph-based methods that build a graph-of-words and use various centrality measures to score the nodes (candidate keywords). In this work, we follow a different path to detect the keywords from a text document by modeling the main distribution of the document's words using local word vector representations. Then, we rank the candidates based on their position in the text and the distance between the corresponding local vectors and the main distribution's center. We confirm the high performance of our approach compared to strong baselines and state-of-the-art unsupervised keyword extraction methods, through an extended experimental study, investigating the properties of the local representations.",

            "Abstract": "A desirable feature in spatio-temporal databases is the ability to answer future queries, based on the current data characteristics (reference position and velocity vector). Given a moving query and a set of moving objects, a future query asks for the set of objects that satisfy the query in a given time interval. The difficulty in such a case is that both the query and the data objects change positions continuously, and therefore we can not rely on a given fixed reference position to determine the answer. Existing techniques are either based on sampling, or on repetitive application of time-parameterized queries in order to provide the answer. In this paper we develop an efficient method in order to process nearest-neighbor queries in moving-object databases. The basic advantage of the proposed approach is that only one query is issued per time interval. The time-parameterized R-tree structure is used to index the \u2026",

To uncover the set of edges, multiple edge probing queries must be executed by evaluating a function f(u, v) that returns either true or false, if nodes u and v are connected or not respectively. Evidently, the graph can be revealed completely if all possible  probes are executed for a graph containing n nodes. However, the function f() is usually computationally intensive and therefore executing all possible probing queries result in high execution costs. The target is to provide answers to useful queries by executing as few probing queries as possible. In this work, we study the problem of discovering the top-k nodes of a hidden bipartite graph with the highest degrees, by using distributed algorithms.

In such a scaled datasets there are relations between entities which are hidden, so we have to follow an optimal approach to produce exact results. We are using a first phase triangulation method to estimate an initial bound of triangles an edge participates followed by a second iterative phase estimating the optimal minimum valid bound of triangles within sub-graphs for each edge. The overhead to produce dense neighborhoods of connected edges is actually pretty closed to the process finding cliques within a graph. We have implemented our algorithms in a MapReduce parallel framework a powerful tool ideal for our requirements.

A skyline query computes the items that are not dominated, whereas a top-k dominating query returns the k items with the highest domination score. To enable query optimization, it is important to estimate the expected number of skyline items as well as the maximum domination value of an item. In this article, the authors provide an estimation for the maximum domination value under the dinstinct values and attribute independence assumptions. The authors provide three different methodologies for estimating and calculating the maximum domination value and the authors test their performance and accuracy. Among the proposed \u2026",

In streaming time series the problem is more challenging, taking into account the fact that new values arrive for the series, probably in very high rates. Therefore, effective and efficient methods are required in order to classify a streaming time series based on its trend. Since new values are continuously arrive for each stream, the classification is performed by means of a sliding window which focuses on the last values of each stream. Each streaming time series is transformed to a vector by means of a Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) technique. The PLA vector is a sequence of symbols denoting the trend of the series (either UP or DOWN), and it is constructed incrementally.

An interesting research problem is to combine the streaming environment with massively parallel systems to provide scalable stream-based algorithms. However, none of the previously proposed techniques refer to a massively parallel setting. Our proposal fills this gap and studies transferring state-of-the-art techniques in Apache Flink, a modern platform for intensive streaming analytics.

However, they are characterized by several limitations, such as (1) they lack progressiveness (they report the k best items at the end of the processing), (2) they require a multi-dimensional index or they build a grid-based index on-the-fly, which suffers from performance degradation, especially in high dimensionalities, and (3) they do not support vertically decomposed data.

In this paper, we focus on the cases where the items of a large domain correlate with each other in a way that small worlds are formed, that is, the domain is clustered into groups with a large number of intra-group and a small number of inter-group correlations. This property appears in several real-world cases, e.g., in bioinformatics, e-commerce applications, and bibliographic analysis, and can help to significantly prune the search space so as to perform efficient association-rule mining. We develop an algorithm that partitions the domain of items according to their correlations and we describe a mining algorithm that carefully combines partitions to improve the efficiency.

Examples of such emerging application domains are: Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Multimedia Information Systems, CAD/CAM, Time-Series Analysis, Medical Information Sstems, On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP), and Data Mining. These applications pose diverse requirements with respect to the information and the operations that need to be supported. From the database perspective, new techniques and tools therefore need to be developed towards increased processing efficiency. This monograph explores the way spatial database management systems aim at supporting queries that involve the space characteristics of the underlying data, and discusses query processing techniques for nearest neighbor queries. It provides both basic concepts and state-of-the-art results in spatial databases and parallel processing research, and studies numerous applications of nearest neighbor queries.",

User ratings are not expected to be independent, as users follow trends of similar rating behavior. In terms of Text Mining, this is analogous to the formation of higher-level concepts from plain terms. In this paper, we propose a novel CF algorithm which uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to detect rating trends and performs recommendations according to them. Our results indicate its superiority over existing CF algorithms.",

            "Abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) systems are gaining widespread acceptance in recommender systems and e-commerce applications. These systems combine information retrieval and data mining techniques to provide recommendations for products, based on suggestions of users with similar preferences. Nearest-neighbor CF process is influenced by several factors, which were not examined carefully in past work. In this paper, we bring to surface these factors in order to identify existing false beliefs. Moreover, by being able to view the \"big picture\" from the CF process, we propose new approaches that substantially improve the performance of CF algorithms. For instance, we obtain more than 40% percent increase in precision in comparison to widely-used CF algorithms. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation, with several real data sets, and produce results that invalidate some existing beliefs and illustrate \u2026",

In this work, we focus on efficient range query processing techniques in the Apache Spark engine, which is the state-of-the-art solution for big data management and analytics. We aim at developing a Spark-based indexing scheme that supports range queries in such large-scale decentralized environments and scale well w.r.t. the number of nodes and the data items stored. Towards this goal, there have been solutions in the last few years, which however turn out to be inadequate at the envisaged scale, since the classic linear or even the logarithmic complexity (for point queries) is still too expensive, whereas range query processing is even more demanding.

            "Abstract": "Top-k dominating queries use an intuitive scoring function which ranks multidimensional points with respect to their dominance power, i.e., the number of points that a point dominates. The k points with the best (e.g., highest) scores are returned to the user. Both top-k and skyline queries have been studied in a streaming environment, where changes to the data set are very frequent. In such an environment, continuous query processing techniques are required toward efficient monitoring of query results, since periodic query re-execution is computationally intensive, and therefore, prohibitive. This work contains the first study of continuous top-k dominating queries over data streams. In comparison to continuous top-k and skyline queries, continuous top-k dominating queries pose additional challenges. Three exact algorithms (BFA, EVA, ADA) are studied, and among them ADA, which is enhanced with additional \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Learning node representations is a crucial task with a plethora of interdisciplinary applications. Nevertheless, as the size of the networks increases, most widely used models face computational challenges to scale to large networks. While there is a recent effort towards designing algorithms that solely deal with scalability issues, most of them behave poorly in terms of accuracy on downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim at studying models that balance the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. In particular, we propose ${\\rm N{\\small ode}S{\\small ig}}$, a scalable embedding model that computes binary node representations. ${\\rm N{\\small ode}S{\\small ig}}$ exploits random walk diffusion probabilities via stable random projection hashing, towards efficiently computing embeddings in the Hamming space. Our extensive experimental evaluation on various graphs has demonstrated that the proposed model achieves a good balance between accuracy and efficiency compared to well-known baseline models on two downstream tasks.",

The collected information may be used to facilitate users' needs with recommendations related to their past preferences. Many recommendation models were introduced in the literature, which learn by the history of users and provide recommendations for Points-of-Interest. Unfortunately, most of them ignore the relation existing among the temporal properties, the spatial attributes and the periodicity of the check-ins. In this work, we present a novel methodology, named JLGE, that combines all aforementioned factors into one unified approach which facilitates POI recommendations. In particular, the model jointly learns the embeddings of six informational graphs i.e., two unipartite (user-user and POIPOI) and four bipartite (user-location, user-time, location-user, and \u2026",

Initially, we consider grouping of pairs of requests only, and give two algorithms with exponential and linear complexity. Then, we generalize the linear method, grouping more than two requests per group. We evaluate these methods under different LRU buffer sizes, measuring the cache misses per query. We present experimental results based on real and synthetic data. The results show that careful query scheduling can improve substantially the overall performance of multiple range query processing.",

Classification models are built by using underlying data. In principle, the models built with more data yield better results. However, the relationship between the available data and the performance is not well understood, except that the accuracy of a classification model has diminishing improvements as a function of data size. In this paper, we present an approach for an early assessment of the extracted knowledge (classification models) in the terms of performance (accuracy), based on the amount of data used. The assessment is based on the observation of the performance on smaller sample sizes. The solution is formally defined and used in an experiment. In experiments we show the correctness and utility of the approach.",

Skyline and top-k dominating queries are examples of such techniques. A skyline query computes the objects that are not dominated, whereas a top-k dominating query returns the k objects with the highest domination score. To enable query optimization, it is important to estimate the expected number of skyline objects as well as the maximum domination value of an object. In this paper, we provide an estimation for the maximum domination value for data sets with statistical independence between their attributes. We provide three different methodologies for estimating and calculating the maximum domination value, and we test their performance and accuracy. Among the proposed estimation \u2026",

Our goal is to further study this problem from a different perspective related to the questions of the cause of belongingness to a community. To this end, we apply the framework of causality and responsibility developed by Halpern and Pearl [11]. We provide an algorithm-semi-agnostic framework for computing causes and responsibility of belongingness to a community. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first work that examines causality in community detection. Furthermore, the proposed framework is easily adaptable to be also used in other network processing operations apart from community detection.",

An important preference-based query is the top-k dominating query, which reports the k most important objects according to their domination capabilities (score). In this paper, we address the following issues to tackle two limitations of previously proposed approaches: (i) we allow dominating queries to be expressed in a subset of the available dimensions and (ii) we provide the necessary techniques to enable continuous processing of multiple queries. We use a grid-based indexing scheme to facilitate efficient search and update operations, avoiding expensive reorganization costs. In addition, several optimizations are proposed to enhance efficiency. Performance evaluation results, based on real-life and synthetic data sets, show the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme.",

The most popular measures are the Pearson correlation and cosine similarity. In this paper, we identify existing fallacies in the calculation of these measures. We propose a novel approach, which addresses the problem and substantially improves the accuracy of CF results. Moreover, we propose an evaluation procedure that produces reliable conclusions about the performance of nearest-neighbor CF algorithms.

            "Abstract": "In several applications, data objects move on pre-defined spatial networks such as road segments, railways, and invisible air routes. Many of these objects exhibit similarity with respect to their traversed paths, and therefore two objects can be correlated based on their motion similarity. Useful information can be retrieved from these correlations and this knowledge can be used to define similarity classes. In this paper, we study similarity search for moving object trajectories in spatial networks. The problem poses some important challenges, since it is quite different from the case where objects are allowed to move freely in any direction without motion restrictions. New similarity measures should be employed to express similarity between two trajectories that do not necessarily share any common sub-path. We define new similarity measures based on spatial and temporal characteristics of trajectories, such that the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Anomaly detection is one of the major data mining tasks in modern applications. An element that shows significant deviation from the \"usual\" behavior is marked as an outlier. This means that this element either corresponds to noise or it requires more careful examination because it may be important. Also, many clustering algorithms are very sensitive to outliers. In any case, outliers must be identified and explored further, meaning that efficient outlier mining techniques are required. In this paper, we focus on distributed density-based outlier detection over multi-dimensional data streams. In particular, we focus on the approximation method for computing the Local Correlation Integral (LOCI) of multi-dimensional points. Each object p is assigned a score score(p) which represents the outlier score of p. Thus, one can select the top-k elements from the dataset that have the highest outlier scores. Our proposal has been implemented in Apache Spark using Scala and experiments have been conducted in a physical cluster running Apache Hadoop 2.7 and Apache Spark 2.4.0. Performance evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable and therefore it can be used to mine outliers in large distributed datasets.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, we focus on distance-based outliers in a metric space, where the status of an entity as to whether it is an outlier is based on the number of other entities in its neighborhood. In recent years, several solutions have tackled the problem of distance-based outliers in data streams, where outliers must be mined continuously as new elements become available. An interesting research problem is to combine the streaming environment with massively parallel systems to provide scalable stream-based algorithms. However, none of the previously proposed techniques refer to a massively parallel setting. Our proposal fills this gap and investigates the challenges in transferring state-of-the-art techniques to Apache Flink, a modern platform for intensive streaming analytics. We thoroughly present the technical challenges encountered and the alternatives that may be applied, of which a micro-clustering-based one is \u2026",

In this paper, we aim at capturing the intrinsic dissimilarities of image descriptors in large image collections, i.e., to detect dissimilar (or else diverse) images without defining an explicit similarity or distance measure. Towards this goal, we adopt skyline processing techniques for large image databases, based on their high-dimensional descriptor vectors. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in the use of skyline techniques empowered by state-of-the-art hashing schemes to enable effective data partitioning and indexing in secondary memory, towards supporting large image databases. The proposed approach is evaluated experimentally by using three real-world image datasets. Performance evaluation results demonstrate that images lying on the skyline have significantly different characteristics, which depend on the type of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Classification based on k-nearest neighbors (kNN classification) is one of the most widely used classification methods. The number k of nearest neighbors used for achieving a high accuracy in classification is given in advance and is highly dependent on the data set used. If the size of data set is large, the sequential or binary search of NNs is inapplicable due to the increased computational costs. Therefore, indexing schemes are frequently used to speed-up the classification process. If the required number of nearest neighbors is high, the use of an index may not be adequate to achieve high performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that the execution of the nearest neighbor search algorithm can be interrupted if some criteria are satisfied. This way, a decision can be made without the computation of all k nearest neighbors of a new object. Three different heuristics are studied towards enhancing the \u2026",

Well-defined semi-metric measures are proposed to compute the similarity between the nodes of the graph, and the clustering is based on the resulted similarity values. The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step, which is optional, a ranking of all the nodes of the graph is performed by using application specific criteria (if any). In the second step, a specific node is selected and the similarity values from this node to all other nodes are computed and maintained into a similarity list. In the third step, from the resulted similarity list values, the first cluster is constructed from the nodes that have a sufficient similarity score. The last two steps, are repeated, until all the nodes of the graph have been clustered. This methodology was tested in real-world data sets and provides promising \u2026",

In this work, we focus on the problem of clustering streaming time series, based on the sliding window paradigm. More specifically, we use the concept of alpha-clusters in each time instance separately. A subspace alpha-cluster consists of a set of streams, whose value difference is less than a in a consecutive number of time instances (dimensions). The clusters can be continuously and incrementally updated as the streaming time series evolve. The proposed technique is based on a careful examination of pair-wise stream similarities for a subset of dimensions and then, it is generalized for more streams per cluster.
