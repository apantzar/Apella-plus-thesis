            "Abstract": "Distance-based outlier detection techniques is a wide-spread methodology for anomaly detection. Despite their effectiveness, a main limitation is that they heavily rely on the dataset and the parameters chosen in order to establish the right status of each data point. These parameters typically include, but are not limited to, the neighborhood radius and threshold. In continuous streaming environments, the need for real-time analysis does not permit for an algorithm to be restarted multiple times with different parameters until the right combination is specified. This gives rise to the need for one technique that combines an arbitrary number of parameterizations with the use of minimal yet sufficient computer resources. In this work we both compare the state-of-the-art techniques for handling multiple queries in distance-based outlier detection algorithms and we propose a novel technique for multi-parameter distance \u2026",

More specifically, we deal with the problem of dynamic, intraquery load balancing in parallel database queries across heterogeneous nodes in a way that takes into account the inherent cost of adaptations and thus avoids both overreacting and deciding when to adapt in a completely heuristic manner. The latter may lead to serious performance degradation in several cases, such as periodic and random imbalances. We follow a control theoretical approach to this problem; more specifically, we propose a multiple-input multiple-output feedback linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller, which captures the tradeoff between reaching a balanced state and the cost inherent in such adaptations.

The default values allow developers to quickly deploy their applications but leave the question as to whether performance can be improved open. In this work, we investigate the impact of the most important tunable Spark parameters with regards to shuffling, compression and serialization on the application performance through extensive experimentation using the Spark-enabled Marenostrum III (MN3) computing infrastructure of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

The presented solutions are cost-based, i.e., they employ quantitative metadata and cost models. The advantage of this approach is that business processes can benefit from recent advances in data-intensive workflow optimization similarly to the manner they nowadays benefit from additional data analytics areas, e.g., in the area of process mining. Concrete use cases are presented that are capable of demonstrating that even in small, more conservative cases, the benefits are significant.

In this paper, we study the efficient implementation of theta\u2010join queries between two relations using the CUDA framework. Theta\u2010joins are notoriously slow and thus can benefit from massively parallel execution. However, their GPU\u2010based implementation significantly differs from hash\u2010 and sort\u2010based equality joins and needs to be carefully crafted. The implementation is driven by two main objectives. The first relates to the attainment of high efficiency in the parallelization through data reuse, which relates to the minimization of accesses to the slow global memory.

            "Abstract": "Monitoring the execution of a query plan is the activity concerned with the collection of information that becomes available from the completed or on-going parts of the execution. Monitoring can be classified in three categories according to the transmission of data and messages that are related to the monitoring procedure. First, monitoring can be performed at the level of physical operators that comprise the query plan. In that case, no data is conveyed, and consequently, there is no communication overhead. Second, monitoring may require a set of operators of the query plan on a node to communicate with each other. In that case, the communication overhead can remain very low. Third, operators or sets of operators on different nodes may send data to each other in order to monitor aspects of the query plan. The third case applies to situations in which the query plan is executed in a parallel or distributed setting. In the last two cases, the monitoring incurs communication overhead. In all cases there is a CPU overhead. In order to have a complete view about the quality of the execution of the query plan, apart from the query plan, the execution environment needs to be monitored as well (which can be seen as a fourth case of monitoring). In this report, the focus is on the first case of monitoring, in which no data is conveyed. The improvements in the quality of the derived information when monitoring falls in the other two categories are also discussed.The structure of the report is as follows: In the second section, how monitoring fits into the context of query processing is discussed.

The main role of cost models is to produce the time needed to run the query on a specific machine. In a multi-cloud environment, this is insufficient in two aspects: firstly, the machines employed are not defined a-priori, and secondly, time estimates need to be complemented with monetary cost information, because both the economic cost and the performance are of primary importance. This work addresses these two shortcomings and aims to serve as the first proposal for a bi-objective query cost model that is suitable for queries executed over resources provided by potentially multiple cloud providers.

We show that our approach is adequate to capture both a wide-range of arbitrary data transformations, which cannot be supported by traditional relational operators, and the precedence constraints between the various stages in the flow.

In this work, we focus on distance-based outliers: an object x is an outlier if there are less than k objects lying at distance at most R from x. The problem offers significant challenges when a stream-based environment is considered, where data arrive continuously and outliers must be detected on-the-fly.

While there has been a number of works that index the historical data in a time-centric manner (ie according to the time instance an update event occurs), in this work, we focus on the less-explored vertex-centric storage approach (ie according to the entity in which an update event occurs). We demonstrate that the design choices for a vertex-centric model are not trivial, by proposing two different modelling and storage models that leverage NoSQL technology and investigating their tradeoffs. More specifically, we experimentally evaluate the \u2026",

This is a new problem that has attracted significant interest recently, due to the urgent need for providers to provide reliable, customized and QoS guaranteed computing dynamic environments for end-users as agreed in contracts on the basis of certain Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Honoring SLAs is a multi-faceted problem that may involve optimal use of the available resources, optimization of the system's performance and availability or maximization of the provider's revenue and it poses a significant challenge for researchers and system administrators due to the volatile, huge and unpredictable Web environments where these computing systems reside.

The latter may lead to serious performance degradation in several cases, such as periodic and random imbalances. We follow a control theoretical approach to this problem; more specifically, we propose a multiple-input multiple-output feedback linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller, which captures the tradeoff between reaching a balanced state and the cost inherent in such adaptations. Our approach, apart from benefitting from and being characterized by a solid theoretical foundation, exhibits better performance than state-of-the-art heuristics in realistic situations, as verified by thorough evaluation.",

            "Abstract": "We elaborate on the ingredients of a model-driven approach for the dynamic provisioning of cloud resources in an autonomic manner. Our solution has been experimentally evaluated using a NoSQL database cluster running on a cloud infrastructure. In contrast to other techniques, which work on a best-effort basis, we can provide probabilistic guarantees for the provision of sufficient resources. Our approach is based on the probabilistic model checking of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) at runtime. We present:(i) the specification of an appropriate MDP model for the provisioning of cloud resources,(ii) the generation of a parametric model with system-specific parameters,(iii) the dynamic instantiation of MDPs at runtime based on logged and current measurements and (iv) their verification using the PRISM model checker for the provisioning/deprovisioning of cloud resources to meet the set goals (This research has been co-financed by the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program \u201cEducation and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: Thales.

In this work, we deal with a problem encountered when complex Spark workflows run on top of geographically dispersed nodes, either data centers or individual machines. There have been proposals that optimize the execution of such workflows in terms of the aggregate traffic generated or the latency (which is due to data transmission), or both metrics. However, the state-of-the-art solutions that target both objectives are either significantly sub-optimal or suffer from high optimization overhead. In this work, we address this limitation. The main solutions that we propose are both efficient and effective; based on either the extremal optimization or the greedy algorithm design paradigm, they can yield significant improvements having an optimization \u2026",

To this end, several new data models and standards have been proposed. In this chapter, after providing an overview of these efforts, an important gap in both the literature and practice is identified, namely, to adopt a formalized procedure to assess the healthcare infrastructure in terms of privacy and cybersecurity risks, which is an essential step toward establishing trust in sharing and processing medical records across health institutions.

            "Abstract": "Knowledge and data management is a key topic in Grid computing. Today and in the near future, data, information, and knowledge are critical elements in the application of Grids in several sectors of our society. As Grids become pervasive in human activities, the management of data and the derivation and manipulation of knowledge play an increasingly significant role in enabling high-level applications in wired and wireless settings where Grids are used as enabling platforms, engines and tools for complex information systems. Our view is that the Grid should be effectively exploited for deploying data-driven and knowledge-based services and applications. To support this class of applications, tools and services for data and knowledge management are vital, so that, in the coming years the Grid will be used as a platform for implementing and deploying geographically dispersed data intensive applications, distributed knowledge discovery systems and knowledge management platforms. This white paper is provided by the Institute on Knowledge and Data Management (KDM) of the CoreGRID NoE. The work originates from work done by the Institute members and its aim is to present the current state of the art with respect to Grid data and knowledge management and provide the context of the related research activities, focusing on the areas of Grid storage, information processing and data mining.",

The performance requirements refer to strict latency limits on the query response time. The security requirements are derived from the need to address two specific kinds of threats that exist in cloud databases, namely data leakage, mainly due to malicious activities of actors hosted on the same physical machine, and data loss after one or more node failures. A key feature of our approach is that we account for multiple cloud providers offering resources of different characteristics. We explain that usually there is a trade-off between performance and security requirements and we derive a model checking approach to drive runtime decisions that strike a user-defined balance between them taking into account the infrastructure heterogeneity.

However, the movement of query processing into non-dedicated environments means that it is necessary to take account of the partial information and unstable conditions that characterise autonomous, shared, distributed settings. Thus, query processing on grid platforms needs to be adaptive, revising evaluation strategies at query runtime in response to the evolving environment, such as changes to machine load and availability. To address this challenge, adaptive techniques are described that: (i) balance load across plan partitions supporting intra-operator parallelism; (ii) remove bottlenecks in pipelined plans supporting inter-operator \u2026",

Such outliers are referred to as distance-based outliers and are the focus of this work. In this demo, we show both an extendible framework for outlier detection algorithms and specific outlier detection algorithms for the demanding case where outlier detection is continuously performed over a data stream.

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, Web Services (WSs) play an increasingly important role in Web data management solutions, since they offer a practical solution for accessing and manipulating data sources spanning administrative domains. Nevertheless, they are notoriously slow and transferring large data volumes across WSs becomes the main bottleneck in such WS-based applications. This paper deals with the problem of minimizing at runtime, in a self-managing way, the datatransfer cost of a WS encapsulating a data source. To reducethe transfer cost, the data volume is typically divided intoblocks. In this case, response time exhibits a quadratic-like, non-linear behavior with regards to the block size; as such, minimizing the transfer cost entails finding the optimum block size. This situation is encountered in several systems, such as WS Management Systems (WSMSs) for DBMS-like data management over wide area service \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Grid computational resources, as well as being heterogeneous, may also exhibit unpredictable, volatile behaviour. Therefore, query processing on the Grid needs to be adaptive in order to cope with evolving resource characteristics, such as machine load and availability. To address this challenge in a Grid environment, the non-adaptive OGSA-DQP1 system described in [1] has been enhanced with adaptive capabilities.",

            "Abstract": "Over the past few years, there has been a rapid increase of data originating from evolving networks such as social networks, sensor networks and others. A major challenge that arises when handling such networks and their respective graphs is the ability to issue a historical query on their data, that is, a query that is concerned with the state of the graph at previous time instances. While there has been a number of works that index the historical data in a time-centric manner (i.e. according to the time instance an update event occurs), in this work, we focus on the less-explored vertex-centric storage approach (i.e. according to the entity in which an update event occurs). We demonstrate that the design choices for a vertex-centric model are not trivial, by proposing two different modelling and storage models that leverage NoSQL technology and investigating their tradeoffs. More specifically, we experimentally \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Advances in network technologies and the emergence of grid computing have both increased the need and provided the infrastructure for computation and data intensive applications to run over collections of heterogeneous and autonomous nodes. In the context of database query processing, existing parallelisation techniques cannot operate well in grid environments because the way they select machines and allocate tasks compromises partitioned parallelism. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a low-complexity, practical resource selection and scheduling algorithm that enables queries to employ partitioned parallelism, in order to achieve better performance in a grid setting.",

This paper argues: (i) that DQP can be important in the Grid, as a means of providing high-level, declarative languages for integrating data access and analysis; and (ii) that the Grid provides resource management facilities that are useful to developers of DQP systems. As well as discussing and illustrating how DQP technologies can be deployed within the Grid, the paper describes a prototype implementation of a DQP system running over Globus.",

This paper summarises the work thus far on the XMAP data integration framework and query reformulation algorithm and on middleware with regard to Grid query processing services, namely OGSA-DQP. Furthermore, it presents an architecture for data integration-enabled query processing on the Grid, which combines the two aforementioned pieces of work and provides an extended set of e-Services. These services allow users to submit queries over a single database and receive the results from multiple databases that are semantically correlated with the former one.

However, another cross-cutting property of Big Data is volatility. In database technology, volatility is addressed with the help of adaptive query processing (AQP), which has become the dominant paradigm for executing queries in dynamic and/or streaming environments. As the characteristics of the runtime environment may vary significantly along time, AQP techniques employ a three-phase adaptivity loop to process the input queries, comprising feedback collection, analysis and re-optimization. In the monitoring phase, the standard approach is to collect feedback in a fixed-size sliding window. However, several problems arise when the techniques adopt a fixed-size sliding window for maintaining runtime collected feedback. In this work, we tackle this limitation and \u2026",

This work aims to make a deep dive into the parallelism configuration and shed light on the behavior of parallel spark jobs.

We first propose analytical models for expressing the running time as a function of the number of machines employed. We then take another step, namely to present novel algorithms for configuring dynamic partitioning with a view to minimizing resource consumption without sacrificing running time beyond a user-defined limit. The problem we target is NP-hard. To tackle it, we propose a greedy approach after introducing the notions of dependency graphs and of the benefit from modifying the degree of partitioning \u2026",

This paper explores one aspect of service-based computing and data management, viz., how to integrate query processing technology with a service-based Grid. The paper describes in detail the design and implementation of a service-based distributed query processor for the Grid.

            "Abstract": "Anomaly detection is one of the major data mining tasks in modern applications. An element that shows significant deviation from the \"usual\" behavior is marked as an outlier. This means that this element either corresponds to noise or it requires more careful examination because it may be important. Also, many clustering algorithms are very sensitive to outliers. In any case, outliers must be identified and explored further, meaning that efficient outlier mining techniques are required. In this paper, we focus on distributed density-based outlier detection over multi-dimensional data streams. In particular, we focus on the approximation method for computing the Local Correlation Integral (LOCI) of multi-dimensional points. Each object p is assigned a score score(p) which represents the outlier score of p. Thus, one can select the top-k elements from the dataset that have the highest outlier scores. Our proposal has been implemented in Apache Spark using Scala and experiments have been conducted in a physical cluster running Apache Hadoop 2.7 and Apache Spark 2.4.0. Performance evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable and therefore it can be used to mine outliers in large distributed datasets.",

            "Abstract": "Self-managing solutions have recently attracted a lot of interest from the database community. The need for self-* properties is more evident in distributed applications comprising heterogeneous and autonomous databases and functionality providers. Such resources are typically exposed as Web Services (WSs), which encapsulate remote DBMSs and functions called from within database queries. In this setting, database queries are over WSs, and the data transfer cost becomes the main bottleneck. To reduce this cost, data is shipped to and from WSs in chunks; however the optimum chunk size is volatile, depending on both the resources' runtime properties and the query. In this paper we propose a robust control theoretical solution to the problem of optimizing the data transfer in queries over WSs, by continuously tuning at runtime the block size and thus tracking the optimum point. Also, we develop online system identification mechanisms that are capable of estimating the optimum block size analytically. Both contributionsare evaluated via both empirical experimentation in a real environment and simulations, and have been proved to be more effective and efficient than static solutions.",

Apart from proposing concrete efficient solutions for this combinatorial problem, we advocate to take a critical stand on the broadly spread claim that transferring distributed data to a single or fewer places is too costly. In our proposal, we judiciously reduce the participation of some data centers in the flow execution, and we show that, in a wide range of settings, this yields significant benefits.

To this end, we propose a specific approach to coupling performance control with congestion control features, in order to consider both performance and memory overflow issues in an integrated manner. The performance results with real data show that we can combine these controllers effectively and efficiently, so that no memory overflow occurs at the expense of negligible performance degradation.",

            "Abstract": "Self-managing solutions have recently attracted a lot of interest from the database community. The need for self-* properties is more evident in distributed applications comprising heterogeneous and autonomous databases and functionality providers. Such resources are typically exposed as Web Services (WSs), which encapsulate remote DBMSs and functions called from within database queries. In this setting, database queries are over WSs, and the data transfer cost becomes the main bottleneck. To reduce this cost, data is shipped to and from WSs in chunks; however the optimum chunk size is volatile, depending on both the resources' runtime properties and the query. In this paper we propose a robust control theoretical solution to the problem of optimizing the data transfer in queries over WSs, by continuously tuning at runtime the block size and thus tracking the optimum point. Also, we develop online system \u2026",

This service supports the compilation and evaluation of queries that combine data obtained from multiple services on the Grid, including Grid Database Services (GDSs) provided by OGSA-DAI project. Not only does OGSA-DQP support integrated access to multiple Grid services, it is itself implemented as a collection of interacting Grid services. Thus, OGSA-DQP is an example of a Grid service with a significant amount of aggregated functionality that, in addition, illustrates how Grid service orchestrations can be used to perform reasonably complex, data-intensive parallel computations. OGSA-DQP prototype has been released and it is downloadable from www. ogsadai. org. uk/dqp/.

When such queries are processed in a volatile and unpredictable setting, as is the typical case today, continuous workload re-assignments need to take place to ensure that the workload allocated to each participating machine reflects its actual capabilities, so that the query response time is minimized. The main challenge is to continuously adapt the load balancing policy, while considering the inherent control cost. The problem is modeled as a constrained optimization problem and, in this work, we present an efficient and effective MPC-based solution, which improves upon previous work.",

We provide an algorithm-semi-agnostic framework for computing causes and responsibility of belongingness to a community. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first work that examines causality in community detection.

This article deals with the problem of minimizing at runtime, in a self-managing way, the total response time of a call to a database exposed to a volatile environment, like the Grid, as a WS. Typically, in this scenario, response time exhibits a concave, nonlinear behavior depending on the client-controlled size of the individual requests comprising a fixed size task. In addition, no accurate profiling or internal state information is available, and the optimum point is volatile. This situation is encountered in several systems, such as WS Management Systems (WSMS) for DBMS-like data management over wide \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Business process redesign (BPR) is an organizational initiative for achieving competitive multi-faceted advantages regarding business processes, in terms of cycle time, quality, cost, customer satisfaction and other critical performance metrics. In spite of the fact that BPR tools and methodologies are increasingly being adopted, process innovation efforts have proven ineffective in delivering the expected outcome. This paper investigates the eligibility of BPMN process models towards the application of redesign methods inspired by data-flow communities. In previous work, the transformation of a business process model to a directed acyclic graph (DAG) has yielded notable optimization results for determining average performance of process executions consisting of ad-hoc processes. Still, the utilization encountered drawbacks due to a lack of input specification, complexity assessment and normalization of the BPMN model and application to more generic business process cases. This paper presents an assessment mechanism that measures the eligibility of a BPMN model and its capability to be effectively transformed to a DAG and be further subjected to data-centric workflow optimization methods. The proposed mechanism evaluates the model type, complexity metrics, normalization and optimization capability of candidate process models, while at the same time allowing users to set their desired complexity thresholds. An indicative example is used to demonstrate the assessment phases and to illustrate the usability of the proposed mechanism towards the advancement and facilitation of the optimization phase. Finally, the authors review BPMN \u2026",

This is mainly due to the fact that the impact of parallelism, and more specifically, the impact of concurrent task execution on the running time is not adequately modeled in current cost models. The contribution of this work is twofold. Firstly, we propose an advanced cost model that aims to reflect the response time of a data flow that is executed in parallel more accurately. Secondly, we show that existing optimization solutions are inadequate and develop new optimization techniques targeting the proposed cost model. We focus on the single multi-core machine environment \u2026",

Current state-of-the-art adaptive techniques continuously reoptimize filter orderings utilizing statistics that are collected during the execution of the query, however, both the up-to-date and the out-of-date collected statistical data may be considered with the consequence of not always taking effective reoptimization decisions. In this work, we propose a technique for adaptive filter ordering that tries to lift the burden of out-of-date statistical data after detecting changes in the filter drop probabilities. To this end, we propose a novel drop probability change detection algorithm. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed technique can yield significant performance improvements while \u2026",

As such, predicting the actual communication latencies is of high interest. The current state-of-the-art solutions to the problem of estimating the latency among distributed nodes comprise algorithms that tend to build upon the notion of network coordinates (NCs). Since network conditions change continuously, NCs need to be updated very frequently and, thus, are prone to oscillations. We present a variant of the pioneer NC algorithm, called Vivaldi, which encapsulates a change detection mechanism to prohibit NCs updates unless the network conditions change significantly. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, to assess the impact of change detection and, second, to evaluate the NC algorithms in a realistic service-based \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Distributed and heterogeneous environments present significant challenges to complex software systems, which must operate in the context of continuously changing loads, with partial or out-of-date information on resource capabilities. A distributed query processor (DQP) can be used to access and integrate data from distributed sources, as well as for combining data access with data analysis. However in heterogeneous environments, statically constructed query plans may commit a query evaluator to following significantly suboptimal strategies. As such, there is considerable interest in using adaptive query processors (AQPs) in such settings to provide self-optimizing behaviour. However, with many possible adaptive strategies available, it is important that AQPs can be constructed in a systematic and efficient manner. This paper outlines an approach to the development of AQPs in which adaptive behaviour is \u2026",

In this work, we focus on generic theta joins in a massively parallel environment, such as MapReduce and Spark. Theta joins are notoriously slow due to their inherent quadratic complexity, even when their selectivity is low, e.g., 1%. The main performance bottleneck differs between cases, and is due to any of the following factors or their combination: amount of data being shuffled, memory load on reducers, or computation load on reducers. We propose an ensemble-based partitioning approach that tackles all three aspects. In this way, we can save communication cost, we better respect the memory and computation limitations of reducers and overall, we reduce the total execution time. The key idea behind our partitioning is to cluster join key values following two techniques, namely matrix re-arrangement and agglomerative clustering \u2026",

This renders our technique applicable directly onto the sensor data, as it is produced in a modern factory setting.

We target the problem of allocating flow activities to specific heterogeneous and interdependent execution engines while minimizing the flow execution cost. To date, the state-of-the-art is limited to simple heuristics. Although the problem is intractable, we propose practical anytime solutions that are capable of outperforming those simple heuristics and yielding allocation plans in seconds even when optimizing large flows on ordinary machines.

More specifically, given a set of objects the problem is to return the suspicious objects that deviate significantly from the typical behavior. As in the case of clustering, the application of different criteria leads to different definitions for an outlier. In this work, we focus on distance-based outliers: an object x is an outlier if there are less than k objects lying at distance at most R from x. The problem offers significant challenges when a stream-based environment is considered, where data arrive continuously and outliers must be detected on-the-fly. There are a few research works studying the problem of continuous outlier detection.

We introduce a novel CPU-GPU co-process scheme, which performs initial filtering and indexing on the CPU and delegates final verification to the GPU. Further, we show that this scheme improves upon the state-of-the-art in both the CPU and GPU standalone solutions in several cases.",

Current database technology fails to allow organisations to comply with the requirements of the new data protection legislation. In this paper, a complete set of the DBMS operability requirements is presented, in order to support the EU Directive. These requirements affect the database facilities to identify individuals and for audit trail, the security and processing mechanisms of the DBMSs, and the kind of data that needs to be stored.

Elton uses Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as the underlying modeling framework, and encapsulates state-of-the-art horizontal scaling policies that offer different trade-offs between performance and monetary deployment cost. Its main novelty is that it employs probabilistic model checking to allow for both efficient elasticity decisions and analysis of scaling actions and serves as a case study about the benefits of model checking in online decision making and analysis.",

Finally, the paper presents a roadmap for the integration system implementation aiming at constructing an extended set of services that will allow users to submit queries over a single database and receive the results from multiple databases that are semantically correlated with the former one.",

For each stage, a cloud provider may make a bid in the form of a continuous function in the time delay-monetary cost domain. The goal is to compute the optimal combination of bids according to how much a user is prepared to pay for the total time delay to execute the analysis task.

The optimization of pipelined plans over services differs from traditional optimization significantly, since execution takes place in parallel and thus the query response time is determined by the slowest node in the plan, which is called the bottleneck node. Although polynomial algorithms have been proposed for several variants of optimization problems in this setting, the fact that communication links are typically heterogeneous in wide-area environments has been largely overlooked.

The contribution of this paper is the presentation of a search engine that is capable of retrieving images based on their keyword annotation with the help of an ontology, or based on the image content to find similar images, or on both these strategies. To this end, the search engine is composed of two different subsystems, a low-level image feature analysis and retrieval system and a high-level ontology-based metadata structure. The novel feature is that the two subsystems can co-operate during the evaluation of a single query in a hybrid fashion. The system has been evaluated and experimental results on real cultural heritage collections are presented.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing has become the leading paradigm for deploying large-scale infrastructures and running big data applications, due to its capacity of achieving economies of scale. In this work, we focus on one of the most prominent advantages of cloud computing, namely the on-demand resource provisioning, which is commonly referred to as elasticity. Although a lot of effort has been invested in developing systems and mechanisms that enable elasticity, the elasticity decision policies tend to be designed without guaranteeing or quantifying the quality of their operation. This work aims to make the development of elasticity policies more formalized and dependable. We make two distinct contributions. First, we propose an extensible approach to enforcing elasticity through the dynamic instantiation and online quantitative verification of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) using probabilistic model checking. Second, we propose concrete elasticity models and related elasticity policies. We evaluate our decision policies using both real and synthetic datasets in clusters of NoSQL databases. According to the experimental results, our approach improves upon the state-of-the-art in significantly increasing user-defined utility values and decreasing user-defined threshold violations.",

In this work, we deal with a special case, where the data are conceptually split in contiguous overlapping regions. This scenario is encountered in several streaming applications, such as those employing nearest neighbor queries. We propose (i) an architecture for allowing such adaptations in Flink and (ii) specific data repartitioning techniques. We apply our proposal to a specific use case, namely continuous distancebased outlier detection. Our experimental evaluation provides insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the approach.",

Taking into consideration that most of the \u201ckiller\u201d applications require a graph-based representation (e.g., the Web, social network management, protein-protein interaction networks), efficient query processing and analysis techniques are required, not only because these graphs are massive but also because the operations that must be supported are complex, requiring significant computational resources. In many cases, each graph edge e is annotated by a probability value p(e), expressing its existential uncertainty. This means that with probability p(e) the edge will be present in the graph and with probability  the edge will be absent. This gives rise to the concept of probabilistic graphs (also known as uncertain graphs). Formally, a probabilistic graph  is a triplet (V, E, p \u2026",

This survey focuses on data-centric workflows (or workflows for data analytics or data flows), where a key aspect is data passing through and getting manipulated by a sequence of steps. The large volume and variety of data, the complexity of operations performed, and the long time such workflows take to compute give rise to the need for optimization. In general, data-centric workflow optimization is a technology in evolution. This survey focuses on techniques applicable to workflows comprising arbitrary types of data manipulation steps and semantic inter-dependencies between such steps.

This is mainly due to the fact that the impact of parallelism, and more specifically, the impact of concurrent task execution on the running time is not adequately modeled. In this work, we propose a cost modeling solution that aims to accurately reflect the response time of a data flow that is executed in parallel. We focus on the single multi-core machine environment provided by modern business intelligence tools, such as Pentaho Kettle, but our approach can be extended to massively parallel and distributed settings.

Such computations can be effectively expressed and evaluated as database queries, when they involve integration of data from remote databases and calls to analysis tools. In this way, they can benefit from implicit, transparent to the user parallelisation across multiple computational resources that the Grid makes available, and from well-established optimisation techniques. However, Grid resources, as well as being heterogeneous, may also exhibit unpredictable, volatile behaviour. Thus, query processing on the Grid needs (i) to be capable of taking account of the resource heterogeneity; and (ii) to be adaptive, in order to cope with evolving resource characteristics, such as machine load and availability.

            "Abstract": "Analyzing big data with the help of automated data flows attracts a lot of attention because of the growing need for end-to-end processing of this data. Modern data flows may consist of a high number of tasks and it is difficult for flow designers to define an efficient execution order of the tasks manually given that, typically, there is significant freedom in the valid positioning for some of the tasks. Several automated execution plan enumeration techniques have been proposed. These solutions can be broadly classified into three categories, each having significant limitations: (i) the optimizations are based on rewrite rules similar to those used in databases, such as filter and projection push-down, but these rules cover only the flow tasks that correspond to extended relational algebra operators. To cover arbitrary tasks, the solutions (ii) either rely on simple heuristics, or (iii) they exhaustively check all orderings \u2026",
