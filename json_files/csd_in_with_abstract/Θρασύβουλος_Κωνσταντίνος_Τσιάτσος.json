The data were collected using the semi-structured interview and the results showed that teleconferencing could be a strong complementary tool to support flexible learning as well as distance education, by enhancing the interaction among learners. All the interviewees consider teleconference as a\" helpful assistant\" in the educational process and suggested that the educators should be well prepared before the tele-lecture, as well as prepare and guide the learners in order to conduct a smooth teleconferencing session. From the interviews, several advantages and disadvantages of the teleconference\u2019s use as an educational tool emerged. The main advantages consist of the independence of space and time while conducting learning sessions, the easy access to and sharing of educational content, the interaction between educator and learners as well as among the learners and the reduced transportations along with time saving. On the other hand, some important disadvantages refer to the participants being unfamiliar with technology, lack of technological support, limited network resources causing disconnections and adding stress to participants, the uncertainty of the participants regarding the effectiveness of teleconference in education and the lack of face-to-face communication.",

Its aim is twofold:(a) the development of the prototype of a flexible and adaptable computer game, and (b) the evaluation of this prototype, as to its usability and technical aspects. The particular computer game was created in an attempt to facilitate the teaching of mathematics, a subject that is often regarded as complicated by students of all ages. Apart from the game, an administration website was also constructed, so that the educator can configure the game, without that requiring any programming skills. More specifically, the educator can use the administration website in order to alter several of the games parameters, such as the content and total number of its questions. The game was evaluated in real school settings, both through a pilot study with 12 students and a longterm intervention with 37 students that lasted 14 weeks. The results indicated that the students opinion about the game was positive, and suggest that with some extensions the game could be used as an effective learning tool. Finally, some corresponding conclusions and future improvements to the game are being discussed on the basis of the findings.",

            "Abstract": "During the last years Open and Distance Learning (ODL) methods that utilise network resources and services are gaining wide acceptance. An increasingly number of enterprises uses ODL for training their employees. Interestingly enough not all the enterprises that want to and can use ODL are doing so. The role of PTTs is important in here. PTTs can provide not only the connections necessary for the implementation of ODL services but the ODL services themselves, thus making the process of adopting ODL easier for the enterprises. In Greece the main PTT organisation, as part of its strategy to offer integrated telematics services in various areas, designed and currently operates a pilot network offering ODL services. The services offered include among others Synchronous Distance Education, Asynchronous Distance Education, Co-operative Learning etc. The network utilises ISDN links to connect the users of the ODL services (either trainers or trainees) to a central site. This site is used to interconnect the users among themselves, and to host the services and any educational material needed. The ODL services can be offered either over ISDN services or over the Internet (using TCP/IP services and applications). In the first case the central site utilises a Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). In the second case the ISDN lines are used to the implement the connections to the Internet, and the central site utilises a powerful server. Each user may access the ODL service using an ISDN enabled personal computer. Small groups of users that wish to participate from the same location can be accommodated using larger displays. The ODL services (and the \u2026",

The sizes of the virtual worlds and the tremendous number of users that DVEs are called to support require additional bandwidth and computational resources. For handling these growing requirements a lot of work has been done both to the direction of alternative architectural solutions as well as to techniques and algorithms for handling the limitations of these environments. For supporting large-scale DVEs, extended infrastructure is needed in terms of both hardware and software. However, both researchers and application designers do not always have access to such extended infrastructure and the assessment and evaluation of developed techniques becomes extremely difficult. To this direction, this paper presents a simulation modelling tool for networked servers DVEs that could be used by designers for simulating the performance of their approaches under different scenarios.",

One of the issues faced by the teachers is that they do not have the opportunity of practicing Greek traditional dances before they teach them in a class of students. Therefore, there is a specific need for the teachers of physical education to recall the Greek traditional dances that they should teach in Primary Education schools. Furthermore, the pupils want to attend many times the performance of a dance in order to learn how to dance Greek traditional dances. The only means to support the teachers are (a) books which describe the Greek traditional dances in, a rather abstruse, symbolic language and (b) face-to-face seminars, which are not suitable for wide scale training due to time and cost \u2026",

This paper initially discusses the potential of 3D networked virtual environments for supporting collaborative learning and presents the assets of such systems. Furthermore, the paper reviews the features of five such software applications, through the comparison of the tools and services they offer. These include tools for supporting communication, sharing applications, organizing and coordinating the teaching process and for interacting with the virtual environment through an avatar. Based on that comparison, we justify our choice of platform and discuss design and implementation issues. Finally, future work regarding the assessment of the virtual environment is discussed.",

            "Abstract": "Doping is a threat to sport worldwide. Doping not only exists in professional sport, but also affects recreational athletes who increasingly use performance-enhancing drugs. As anti-doping authorities largely rely on detection, deterrence, and prevention to tackle doping use, the main tool for prevention is education. So far, educational interventions have largely used traditional teaching approaches such as face-to-face courses and online courses. The present study examines the usability of a serious game against doping (the GAME) as an alternative approach to traditional anti-doping education. In addition, this study will investigate its ease and users\u2019 enjoyment while playing the serious game. Participants in the evaluation were 21 undergraduate students who played the GAME and then were asked to respond to a questionnaire evaluating GAME\u2019s usability, ease and users\u2019 enjoyment. Concerning the usability and ease of GAME, the results demonstrated the high usability and ease of GAME. The findings related to the evaluation of users\u2019 enjoyment were also positive. Overall, players were largely satisfied with their gaming experience, rating the GAME as easy to understand and learn and very satisfying. The next step is to deploy the GAME in greater audiences and evaluate its effectiveness in changing beliefs and knowledge about doping.",

This paper presents a case study of promoting learnercenteredness in a post graduate University course by integrating a group-activity support system (PEGASUS) that helps students and teachers to identify their learning and teaching styles. Additionally, the system can suggest optimal group formation in order to foster improved conditions for student collaboration. Integrating PEGASUS in the context of a University course is expected to increase students and teacher self-awareness and initiate productive discussions on the impact of learning styles both on individual and collaborative learning.

            "Abstract": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide a powerful means for informal online learning that is already popular, engaging great numbers of students all over the world. However, studies on MOOCs\u2019 efficiency frequently report on the high dropout rates of enrolled students, and the lack of productive social interaction to promote the quality of MOOC-based learning. Conversational agents (CAs), on the other hand, appear to be a promising artificial intelligence (AI) technology with the potential of acting as catalysts of students\u2019 social interaction, a factor known to beneficially affect learning at many levels. Within this context the \u201ccolMOOC\u201d project has proposed and developed an agent-based tool and methodology for integrating flexible and teacher-configurable CAs along with relevant learning analytics services in MOOCs platforms, aiming to promote peer learning interactions. This chapter concisely presents the overall rationale of the project, the agent-based tools developed, and provides reflections on the first project outcomes emerging from four different pilot MOOCs offered so far. Early conclusions analyze the challenges for integrating a teacher-configured agent-chat service in MOOCs, provide helpful guidelines for efficient task design, and highlight promising evidence on the learning impact of participating in agent-chat activities.",

Virtual clinics and patients are already used for case study and role play in both undergraduate and continuing education levels. Dental education can also take advantage of the virtual world\u2019s pedagogical features in order to give students the opportunity to interact with virtual patients (VPs) and practice in treatment planning.Objective: The objective of this study was to design and evaluate a virtual patient as a supplemental teaching tool for pediatric dentistry.Methods: A child VP, called Erietta, was created by utilizing the programming and building tools that online virtual worlds offer. The case is about an eight-year old girl visiting the dentist with her mother for the first time. Communication techniques such as Tell-Show-Do and parents\u2019 interference management were the basic elements of the educational scenario on which the VP was based. An evaluation of the simulation was made by 103 dental students in their fourth year of study. Two groups were formed: an experimental group which was exposed to the simulation (n= 52) and a control group which did not receive the simulation (n= 51). At the end, both groups were asked to complete a knowledge questionnaire and the results were compared.Results: A statistically significant difference between the two groups was found by applying a t test for independent samples (P<. 001), showing a positive learning effect from the VP. The majority of the participants evaluated the aspects of the simulation very positively while 69%(36/52) of the simulation group expressed their preference for \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The presented paper examines the students\u2019 adoption of the use of a cost-effective biofeedback system for anxiety awareness in parallel to examination activities. Human anxiety is classified by evaluating bio-signals related to skin conductance, skin temperature and heart rate. The participants of the research were 44 students who were taking examinations in the form of synchronous online tests in the classroom for one of their courses. At first, the usability of the biofeedback system was examined using the system usability scale (SUS). The statistical analysis indicated that the examined system usability is quite satisfactory. Then, the study attempted to investigate the relationships between the students\u2019 technology readiness personality dimensions, perceptions of usability, and the usefulness of the presented system by exploiting the technology readiness and acceptance model (TRAM). The results showed that the students\u2019 optimism and attitude towards using the system are significant factors that affect the model\u2019s relationships. The examined relationships are presented via a path model.",

            "Abstract": "The amount of information which can be stored in the human brain is limited and dependent on memory capacity. Over the last few years there has been a trend in training cognitive skills, not only to prevent cognitive decline, which is inevitable as a person grows older, but also to increase or at least preserve mental abilities that will allow a person to function at a higher cognitive level. Memory is one of those key aspects among cognitive skills that has a significant role in a person\u2019s mental performance. Specifically, focus is given to Working Memory (WM), as evidence has shown that it can be increased by applying targeted interventions. An intervention program like this is the main object of this current paper. Using a Serious Game (SG), we designed and created a video game which targets WM training. Its effectiveness was tested and evaluated through an evaluation process where forty people participated in a seven-week training program. Post-results showed that participants had an increase in their WM performance, especially those who had lower scores at the pre-test, while those with high pre-test scores just preserved their initial status. Additionally, all participants agreed that the game is fun and enjoyable to play and that it helps them to increase WM performance. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Partitioning constitutes one of the most critical challenges a distributed virtual environment needs to handle and is related to the efficient assignment of the existing entities of the virtual world to the available resources of the system. The efficient partitioning arises from the need of high consistency maintenance among participating users' view, as virtual reality applications are characterized by the high degree of realism they aim to achieve. To the direction of partitioning algorithms, a lot of work has been done, which has been more intense due to the evolution of network technologies and the familiarization of users with virtual reality systems. This paper presents a partitioning approach, which is based on the degree of interaction of each virtual object and the behavior of the participating users, in terms of moving trends, which is usually directed by the actions they can perform on the surrounding objects.

Given the distributed nature of these environments, the main problems they need to overcome are the efficient distribution of workload among the servers and the minimization of the communication cost. In this direction, a lot of work has been done and numerous relevant techniques and algorithms have been proposed. The majority of these approaches mainly focus on user entities and their interactions. However, most of actual DVE systems include additional and non-dynamic elements, denoted as objects, whose presence can affect users\u2019 behavior. This paper introduces virtual objects\u2019 attributes and proposes two approaches that exploit these attributes in order to handle workload assignment and communication cost in DVE systems.

In this paper we present the main issues in the design of a platform to support the distant education process using networked virtual environments. We also introduce the term Educational Virtual Environments and their basic requirements. According to these requirements of the educational virtual environments we propose both a suitable architecture and a protocol for the interaction between the components of this architecture.",

            "Abstract": "BACKGROUND:Cognitive disorders such as dementia are common among older adults admitted to general hospitals. They can complicate treatment leading to longer hospitalization and worse outcomes. They often remain underdiagnosed as the busy routine of the hospital does not enable efficient screening and available screening instruments are not suitable for the hospital environment. Computerized cognitive testing (CCT) has been proposed as an efficient screening method as it can be employed by nonspecialists, such as nurses while featuring automatic scoring and interpretation of results.OBJECTIVE:This study validated a newly developed questionnaire for measuring the attitudes of Greek nurses towards computerized dementia screening. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS:The questionnaire was validated in a sample of 212 undergraduate psychology students and subsequently administered to a sample of 19 nurses working in a general hospital. Reliability of the questionnaire was calculated using Cronbach's alpha (= 0.762). Factor analysis revealed the existence of a single factor (acceptability-feasibility) that accounted for 33.73% of variance with an eigenvalue of 3.036.RESULTS:The total score of all the items loading on the single factor (acceptability-feasibility) was calculated. Scores ranged between 10 and 40 with the average score for the validation group being 29.33 (SD\u00e2= 4.89) and the average score for the nurses' group being 29.50 (SD\u00e2= 3.20).DISCUSSION:The questionnaire has acceptable reliability. Results indicate that acceptability-feasibility is high in both groups and there were no statistically significant differences \u2026",

Intangible cultural heritage is considered by the Member States of UNESCO in relation to the tangible World Heritage focusing on intangible aspects of culture. Terpsichore project aims to, analyse, design, research, train, implement and validate an innovative framework for low cost digitisation, modelling, archiving, e-preservation and presentation of ICH content related to traditional dances, in a wide range of users. The Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was involved in the performance of Greek traditional dances and the three-dimensional capturing. We performed three-dimensional recordings at the Laboratory of \u201cMotor Behaviour and Adapted Physical Activity\u201d. For data capturing, we used the Vicon 3D recording system. Six traditional Greek dances from different regions of Greece were performed and captured. The results of the three-dimensional capturing of movement showed that the assessment of foots\u2019 movement through markers gives us the ability to identify Greek traditional dances. Finally, we distributed data from the recordings to the project partners in order to further analyse them for the fulfilment of the project objectives. With the completion of Terpsichore project, a bundle of services will have been created, including virtual and augmented reality applications, interactive maps, presentation and learning of traditional European dances \u2026",

Firstly, anti-doping education should be based on state-of-art learning pedagogies that will enable effective engagement, learning and retention of the learned material. Secondly, currently there is a lack of such a systematic approach for evaluating the behavior change outcomes of anti-doping educational interventions. Thirdly, there is a lack of other known anti-doping educational interventions that promote a positive approach to doping prevention. Finally, anti-doping educational interventions should incorporate the learning process in the context of new learning technologies that can also facilitate behavior change outcomes.The aim of this study is to present highlight the importance of anti-doping \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the last 30 years, there has been an increase of professionalism in sports and with this, the interest in the scientific approach to training and recovery of elite athletes has increased (Kellmann et al. 2018). The elite sports organizations such as championship teams and sports federation teams mainly aim at high performance in the competition (Mayer and Thiel 2018). The situations for high performance have changed spectacularly. Athletes need to give more time to training and competition and continue to respond to some limitations such as studying, spending time with their family or friends and having a quality of life (Burlot et al. 2018). Athletes\u2019 workload has increased reaching full-time occupation including training hours, competition, travel time and study requirements. Depending on the type of sport, elite sports career may last 5 to 10 years (Alfermann and Stambulova 2007). In this vein, athletes aiming to better prepare for future employment have to keep a balance between their studies and their sports career (Aquilina 2013). Most studies about athletic career, examined career development, professional transitions, and especially the retirement after sports career (Stambulova et al. 2009, 2020). Current research reveals the need for a holistic approach, highlighting that athletes have to deal with several transitions in sport, their studies and their psycho-social development (Debois et al. 2014; Wylleman and Lavallee 2004) and to reach this holistic approach the research in dual career for athletes is essential and represents a growing area of study (Condello et al. 2019; Aquilina and Henry 2010; Burnett 2010).",

            "Abstract": "Although conversational agent technology has matured over time, there is still a need for research on how agents can appropriately add value to real-world technological learning environments. This paper presents an ongoing research effort towards the design of low-cost, reusable conversational agents that deliver unsolicited interventions during online chat-based activities. These interventions aim at helping learners sustain a productive peer dialogue in the context of online courses. We expect this work to enlighten researchers, conversational interface designers and bot developers on the potential of conversational agents in serving as automated facilitators of synchronous collaborative learning in MOOCs.",

The participants of the study were 89 students in tertiary education consisting of 73 male students and 16 female students and their ages ranged from 18 to 20. The intervention lasted 5 weeks and took place in the context of a computer science course in collaboration with a professor. The research design that was implemented in this study was based on the \u201cOne\u2010Shot\u201d model. The game that was used as a treatment belonged to the category of the treasure hunt quiz games. The game was dynamic and therefore the educator was able to customize parameters and content using an administration panel. The goal of the game for students was to find hidden objects that contain multiple choice questions and then answer them correctly. The results from the data analysis showed that there was a statistically significant correlation between the performance of the students on the game and their performance on the final paper\u2010based examination.",

However, although MOOCs have been reported as an efficient and important educational tool, there is a number of issues and problems related to their educational impact. More specifically, there is an important number of drop outs during a course, little participation, and lack of students\u2019 motivation and engagement overall. This may be due to one-size-fits-all instructional approaches and very limited commitment to student-student and teacher-student collaboration.

One of the main objectives of the ASPAD project is to transform traditional paper\u2010based cognitive exercises in an electronic form by developing advanced software exercises. Following this objective, we have designed and developed a series of computer\u2010based cognitive exercises. Computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation has been a rather promising method to improve cognitive performances in AD patients. It has been reported that cognitive exercises can improve cognition or at least slow down the progression of cognitive decline in patients. The computer\u2010based cognitive exercises have been proved more effective than the classic exercises of mental stimulation especially because they can bee adaptive and flexible according the patient\u2019s difficulties or to the patient\u2019s performance. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed exercises in the ASPAD project, 61 patients (from Day Care Centers for patients with AD) have participated in 48 solving exercises sessions. Preliminary results concerning the difficulties that the patients have faced during the sessions could provide the basis to improve the user interface and user experience elements of the exercises. In this paper, we present briefly (a) the main types of the cognitive exercises based on their user interface and user experience elements,(b) statistics relating the average exercise \u2026",

The rationale of the approach follows the tenets of several converging theoretical perspectives emphasizing the value of learners' dialogue and constructive argumentation as knowledge building processes during collaborative activities. The MOOC teacher (domain expert) is expected to play a key role by entering in the system conceptual links that guide the agent to make relevant questioning interventions. Thus, the agent tool is mediating group-teacher interactions in a MOOC environment aiming to increase the transactive quality of peer dialogue. The paper \u2026",

Previous studies included only self-reported data to measure students' satisfaction and learning experience on SPOCs. There is also little longitudinal research on how SPOC-supported blended learning affects students' academic performance. This paper presents a SPOC on Introduction to Programming and explores its learning effectiveness, perceived course quality, perceived educational experience, and platform usability for on-campus Computer Science students.

It's an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Caregivers mainly face the problems such as (a) psychological pressure in a daily basis, (b) lack of knowledge and/or training about caring the patients and (c) lack of knowledge about the consequences of dementia in patients' behavior. These issues reveal the demand both for the support and the training for caregivers. Following this direction, we developed a web based framework to provide distant support for caregivers who are not able to participate in face to face sessions. This framework integrates services (i.e. teleconferencing, content management, learning management) and tools (such \u2026",

The percept of sound is a major counterpart for the eyesight, since it describes the location, the momentum and the attitude towards the listener, of each surrounding entity. The sound can offer precision of spatial perception that cannot be achieved by the eye itself. Thus the support of 3D surround sound of high fidelity is mandatory for a 3D Virtual platform. The evolution of Internet telephony led to the introduction of new session establishment and management protocols. The most important of them, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), is a robust, lightweight reliable and fast application-layer control (signaling) protocol that is highly adopted for creating, modifying and terminating sessions. This protocol can be of extreme importance in establishing audio sessions for multi-user platforms. This paper presents the work done for developing a SIP 3D spatial audio server for a multi-user virtual environments platform, called EVE, in order to support 3D spatial audio.",

The main purpose of this paper is the presentation of the design and development of the configurable online two-dimensional (2D) game \u201cVolcanic Riddles\u201d. This particular game was designed in cooperation with educators, in order to support the teaching of Mathematics in primary school and the first grades of secondary school. The game is configurable in the sense that the (non-programmer) educator can easily alter several of its parameters, such as the content and total number of the game\u2019s questions or images, via an administration website. Furthermore, the educator can choose which of the game's specific challenges wants to adapt according to the students' needs and level, and thus reuse the game in various educational contexts throughout the school year. Special attention was given so that the administration website is user-friendly and does not require any programming or scripting knowledge from the user. Regarding the game, basic features of educational games were incorporated in order to enhance its educational value and effectiveness. More specifically, this paper presents the steps followed for the implementation of the game, its technical aspects, as well as the first impressions and evaluation results after it was piloted in the field using real pupils and teachers.

            "Abstract": "This paper presents the design of a learning analytics dashboard, utilizing learning traces that emerge from conversational MOOC activities. These chat-based activities encourage students to collaborate in dyads, with the support of a conversational agent, in order to answer open-ended questions, set by the course instructor. Taking into account the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of the agent-based support provided during this kind of online activities, we aspire to share a series of variables, metrics and use cases, which can be valuable for practitioners and researchers looking forward to initiate the development of a learning analytics dashboard that encompasses aspects of both peer-to-peer and human-to-bot conversational interactions.",

However, current research strongly emphasizes the need for game-relevant pedagogical approaches that foster learners\u2019 essential knowledge construction and development of transferable skills. From another perspective, during the last twenty, or so, years technology-enhanced learning has witnessed the advent of the computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) domain. Collaborative learning refers to a variety of educational practices in which peer interactions are considered as the key factor in learning, while the term \u201ccomputer-supported\u201d refers to using technology tools to facilitate, support and guide interactions among both remotely located students (online interactions) and/or co-located students (face-to-face interactions). Relevant research stresses the fact that freely collaborating students usually fail to engage in productive learning interactions when left without teachers\u2019 consistent support and scaffolding. As a remedy it has been proposed that teachers support learners by implementing specific didactic scenarios (collaboration scripts) which trigger and guide peer interaction. Collaboration scripts aim to engage students by providing explicit collective workflow description and guidance (for example, by assigning student roles) during the collaborative activity. This work suggests that scripted collaboration offers a promising pedagogical framework for efficient game design and game-based learning. To substantiate this claim the paper first reviews \u2026",

Continuous enhancements in computer technology and the current widespread computer literacy among the public have resulted in a new generation of users (less so in developing countries) that expect increasingly more from their e-learning experiences. To keep up with such expectations, e-learning systems have gone through a radical change from the initial text-based environments to more stimulating multimedia systems (Monahan, McArdle & Bertolotto, in press). Generally a collaborative virtual environment (CVE) can be defined as a computer-based, distributed, virtual space or set of places.

Human anxiety is classified by evaluating biosignals related to skin conductance, skin temperature, and heart rate. The first aim of this study is to check the presented system performance. Thus, we test the convergent validity of the system regarding self-report measures of anxiety. Moreover, the system is validated against a commercial tool of anxiety detection. Fifteen (15) postgraduate students took part in the relevant psychometric test. The convergent validity of the system is found to be satisfactory. The second aim of this study is to identify the participant\u2019s personality dimensions according to Technology Readiness Index (TRI) which affects their academic performance and their real-time anxiety, as provided by the biofeedback device, during academic examinations. Thirty-five (35) postgraduate students, who were taking examinations in the form of synchronous online tests in the classroom for one of their lessons, took part in this stage of the research. The examined relationships are presented via a path model showing mainly that insecurity causes academic performance to decline, which in turn has a significant negative effect with increasing anxiety.

            "Abstract": "The article discloses a study on the identification of multidisciplinary master degree majors, which interest potential employers and students in Russia. Results of the initial phase of the research project conducted at Tomsk Polytechnic University are presented. The study focuses on collecting raw data from two categories of respondents: potential employers (industry representatives) and potential master students (4th year bachelor students of engineering majors, TPU). The respondents underline the demand for double major master programs and rate reasons for studying two majors. The study proposes particular pairs of master programs that should be harmonized on the latter stages of the project. The importance of the research lies at the root of communicating modern issues and requirements of industry and society with the responses provided by universities, ie the quality and relevance of students\u2019 professional training.",

OpenDelos is an online video editing and publishing platform for MOOCs implemented in the context of this project. The main goal of this paper is to investigate users' acceptance of OpenDelos platform as an online video editing and publishing platform for MOOCs. The evaluation methodology is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The five dimensions of the studied model are based on external variables (sex, age, web experience, educational level), perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), attitude towards using (ATU) and behavior intension (BI). According to the confirmed derived model, presented in this paper, all the initially mentioned hypotheses were verified.",
