Depending on the nature of the available data and the task at hand Deep Learning Analytics techniques can be divided into two broad categories: (a) unsupervised learning techniques and (b) supervised learning techniques. In this chapter we provide an extensive overview over both categories. Unsupervised learning methods, such as Autoencoders, are able to discover and extract the information from the data without using any ground truth information and/or supervision from domain experts. Thus, unsupervised techniques can be especially useful for data exploration tasks, especially when combined with advanced visualization techniques. On the other hand, supervised learning techniques are \u2026",

For this purpose, we adopt dense trajectories descriptors along with a Bag of Words (BoW) model to represent the motion depicted in the videos. Subsequently, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for classification. In order to evaluate the performance and the adequacy of the aforementioned framework for the dance recognition task, we performed experiments for three different classification setups: 1) Greek folk dances vs other activities (including different dance genres), 2) six different dance genres and 3) Greek vs Balkan folk dances. The aforementioned experiments exhibited satisfactory results, with successful recognition rates higher than 89.74%.",

However, face recognition methods often require complex Machine Learning algorithms to be effective, making them inefficient for direct utilization in UAVs and other machines with low computational resources. In this paper, we propose a method of training Autoencoders (AEs) where the low-dimensional representation is learned in a way such that the various classes are more easily discriminated. Results on the ORL and Yale datasets indicate that the proposed AEs are capable of producing low-dimensional representations with enough discriminative ability such that the face recognition accuracy achieved by simple, lightweight classifiers surpasses even that achieved by more complex models.",

            "Abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods are capable of transferring the knowledge encoded in a large and complex teacher into a smaller and faster student. Early methods were usually limited to transferring the knowledge only between the last layers of the networks, while latter approaches were capable of performing multi-layer KD, further increasing the accuracy of the student. However, despite their improved performance, these methods still suffer from several limitations that restrict both their efficiency and flexibility. First, existing KD methods typically ignore that neural networks undergo through different learning phases during the training process, which often requires different types of supervision for each one. Furthermore, existing multi-layer KD methods are usually unable to effectively handle networks with significantly different architectures (heterogeneous KD). In this paper we propose a novel KD method that works by modeling the information flow through the various layers of the teacher model and then train a student model to mimic this information flow. The proposed method is capable of overcoming the aforementioned limitations by using an appropriate supervision scheme during the different phases of the training process, as well as by designing and training an appropriate auxiliary teacher model that acts as a proxy model capable of\" explaining\" the way the teacher works to the student. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using four image datasets and several different evaluation setups.",

Although the term watermarking has slightly different meanings in the literature, one definition that seems to prevail is the following [1]: Watermarking is the practice of imperceptibly altering a piece of data in order to embed information about the data. The above definition reveals two important characteristics of watermarking. First, information embedding should not cause perceptible changes to the host medium (sometimes called cover medium or cover data). Second, the message should be related to the host medium. In this sense, the watermarking techniques form a subset of information hiding techniques. The latter ones also include cases where the hidden information is not \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) is one of the most challenging emerging applications of deep learning. Providing powerful attention mechanisms is crucial for VQA, since the model must correctly identify the region of an image that is relevant to the question at hand. However, existing models analyze the input images at a fixed and typically small resolution, often leading to discarding valuable fine-grained details. To overcome this limitation, in this work we propose a reinforcement learning-based active perception approach that works by applying a series of transformation operations on the images (translation, zoom) in order to facilitate answering the question at hand. This allows for performing fine-grained analysis, effectively increasing the resolution at which the models process information. The proposed method is orthogonal to existing attention mechanisms and it can be combined with most existing VQA \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Universal Neural Style Transfer (NST) methods are capable of performing style transfer of arbitrary styles in a style-agnostic manner via feature transforms in (almost) real-time. Even though their unimodal parametric style modeling approach has been proven adequate to transfer a single style from relatively simple images, they are usually not capable of effectively handling more complex styles, producing significant artifacts, as well as reducing the quality of the synthesized textures in the stylized image. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose a novel universal NST approach that separately models each sub-style that exists in a given style image (or a collection of style images). This allows for better modeling the subtle style differences within the same style image and then using the most appropriate sub-style (or mixtures of different sub-styles) to stylize the content image. The ability of the proposed approach to a) perform a wide range of different stylizations using the sub-styles that exist in one style image, while giving the ability to the user to appropriate mix the different sub-styles, b) automatically match the most appropriate sub-style to different semantic regions of the content image, improving existing state-of-the-art universal NST approaches, and c) detecting and transferring the sub-styles from collections of images are demonstrated through extensive experiments.",

We focus on evolving the constructed similarity graphs, by applying a fitness function (also called objective function), based on some of the most commonly used clustering criteria. The construction of the initial population is based on nearest neighbour graphs, some variants of them and some arbitrary ones, represented as matrices. Each one of these matrices is transformed properly in order to form a chromosome and be used in the evolutionary process.

The idea is to extend the NMF algorithm in order to extract features that enforce not only the spatial locality, but also the separability between classes in a discriminant manner. The first method employs discriminant analysis in the features derived from NMF. In this way, a two-phase discriminant feature extraction procedure is implemented, namely NMF plus Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The second method incorporates the discriminant constraints inside the NMF decomposition. Thus, a decomposition of a face to its discriminant parts is obtained and new update rules for both the weights and the basis images are derived. The introduced methods have been applied to the problem of frontal face verification using the well-known XM2VTS database. Both \u2026",

To this end, we employ the Bag-of-Features model to efficiently extract compact representations from any layer of a DL model that is then combined with an efficient linear regressor to match the final representation of the model (without having to feedforward the whole computational graph). The proposed method is agile and can be directly used with any pretrained DL model, while it is end-to-end differentiable, allowing for further fine-tuning the models towards having multiple early exits. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using five face verification/recognition datasets.",

Multimodal, depth-aware modifications to standard methods are being proposed and studied, both for video description and for video representation, that indirectly incorporate scene geometry information derived from stereo disparity.

The classification process is decomposed into multiple two-class classification problems, a choice that is analytically justified, and unique sets of features are extracted for each classification problem. Specifically, for each two-class problem, an iterative feature selection process that utilizes a class separability measure is employed to create salient feature vectors (SFVs), where each SFV is composed of a selected feature subset. Subsequently, two-class discriminant analysis is applied on the SFVs to produce salient discriminant hyper-planes (SDHs), which are used to train the corresponding two-class classifiers. To properly integrate the two-class classification results and produce the FEC decision, a computationally efficient and fast classification scheme is developed.

S-LDA builds upon the notion of similarity and allows for exploiting higher-order statistics, while being notably robust to outliers. However, optimizing S-LDA`s objective requires the calculation of the pairwise similarities between all the training data. This quickly becomes a significant burden and limits the ability of the method to scale to larger datasets.

First, an objective function that measures the clustering ability of the histogram space, ie, the space where the extracted histogram vectors lie after being encoded using the dictionary, is defined using the similarity graph of the spectral representation of the data. Then, the learned dictionary is optimized in order to minimize this objective and achieve better clustering solutions. That way, the histogram space is used as an intermediate space that helps to unwrap the manifold of the data. The ability of the proposed method to improve the spectral clustering is demonstrated using several clustering criteria and two image datasets, the 15-scene dataset and the Corel image dataset. The better clustering ability of the learned representation is also confirmed by evaluating the clustering \u2026",

When the number of samples grows too big, however, it is extremely time-consuming to compute the entire kernel matrix and it is impossible to store it in the memory of a single computer. The algorithm of Approximate Kernel k-Means has been proposed, which works using only a small part of the kernel matrix. The computation of the kernel matrix, even a part of it, remains a significant bottleneck of the process. Some types of kernel, however, can be computed using matrix multiplication. Modern CPU architectures and computational optimization methods allow for very fast matrix multiplication, thus those types of kernel matrices can be computed much faster than others.",

            "Abstract": "Recently, artificial neural networks have been gaining momentum in the field of gravitational wave astronomy, for example in surrogate modelling of computationally expensive waveform models for binary black hole inspiral and merger. Surrogate modelling yields fast and accurate approximations of gravitational waves and neural networks have been used in the final step of interpolating the coefficients of the surrogate model for arbitrary waveforms outside the training sample. We investigate the existence of underlying structures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders. We demonstrate that when the coefficient space is compressed to only two dimensions, a spiral structure appears, wherein the spiral angle is linearly related to the mass ratio. Based on this finding, we design a spiral module with learnable parameters, that is used as the first layer in a neural network, which learns to map the input space to the coefficients. The spiral module is evaluated on multiple neural network architectures and consistently achieves better speed-accuracy trade-off than baseline models. A thorough experimental study is conducted and the final result is a surrogate model which can evaluate millions of input parameters in a single forward pass in under 1ms on a desktop GPU, while the mismatch between the corresponding generated waveforms and the ground-truth waveforms is better than the compared baseline methods. We anticipate the existence of analogous underlying structures and corresponding computational gains also in the case of spinning black hole binaries.",

Such graphs usually number several million nodes, i.e., they can be characterized as Big Data. Graph clustering is an important analysis tool for other graph related tasks, such as compression, community discovery and recommendation systems, to name a few. We propose a novel extension to a graph clustering algorithm, that attempts to cluster a graph, through the optimization of selected terms of the graph weight/adjacency matrix Discrete Cosine Transform.",

The proposed method is also combined with a spatial image segmentation technique that exploits the natural symmetry of the human face to further reduce the size of the extracted representation. It is experimentally demonstrated using one large-scale face recognition dataset, the YouTube Faces Database, as well as two smaller datasets, that the proposed technique can increase the retrieval precision, while reducing the encoding time by almost two orders of magnitude.",

The successful annotation of video and image content facilitate a successful indexing and retrieval in search databases. In this work we study a variety of possible shot type characterizations that can be assigned in a single video frame or still image. Possible ways to propagate these characterizations to a video segment (or to an entire shot) are also discussed. A method for the detection of Over-the-Shoulder shots in 3D (stereo) video is also proposed.",

This task has been mainly studied on audiovisual data from meetings, news broadcasts or talk shows. In this paper, we use visual information to aid speaker clustering and we introduce a new video-based feature, called actor presence that can be used to enhance audio-based speaker clustering. We tested the proposed method in three full length stereoscopic movies, i.e. a scenario much more difficult than the ones used so far, where there is no certainty that speech segments and video appearances of actors will always overlap.

However, deep supervised image hashing techniques are developed, to a great extent, heuristically often leading to suboptimal results.

The proposed method is adapted to the needs of large-scale hashing and information retrieval leading to a novel information-theoretic measure, the Quadratic Spherical Mutual Information (QSMI).

The similarity of an action volume with representative action volumes is exploited in order to map it to a lower-dimensional feature space that preserves the action class properties. Discriminant learning is, subsequently, employed for further dimensionality reduction and action class discrimination.

A pseudorandom watermarking signal is cast in the 3D mesh object by deforming its vertices geometrically, without altering the vertex topology. Prior to watermark embedding and detection, the object is rotated and translated so that its center of mass and its principal component coincide with the origin and the z-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. This geometrical transformation ensures watermark robustness to translation and rotation. Robustness to uniform scaling is achieved by restricting the vertex deformations to occur only along the r coordinate of the corresponding (r, /spl theta/, /spl phi/) spherical coordinate system.

The success of these approaches slowly led to the belief that image retrieval and classification are just slightly different variations of the same problem. However, recent evidence suggests that learning highly discriminative representation for a (limited) set of training classes removes valuable information from the representation, potentially harming both the in-domain, as well as the out-of-domain retrieval precision. In this paper, we propose a regularized discriminative deep metric learning method that aims to not only learn a representation that allows for discriminating between different classes, but it is also capable of encoding the latent generative factors separately for each class, overcoming this limitation. This allows for modeling the in-class variance and, as a result, maintaining the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Time-series forecasting has various applications in a wide range of domains, e.g., forecasting stock markets using limit order book data. Limit order book data provide much richer information about the behavior of stocks than its price alone, but also bear several challenges, such as dealing with multiple price depths and processing very large amounts of data of high dimensionality, velocity, and variety. A well-known approach for efficiently handling large amounts of high-dimensional data is the bag-of-features (BoF) model. However, the BoF method was designed to handle multimedia data such as images. In this paper, a novel temporal-aware neural BoF model is proposed tailored to the needs of time-series forecasting using high frequency limit order book data. Two separate sets of radial basis function and accumulation layers are used in the temporal BoF to capture both the short-term behavior and the long \u2026",

For each such task, a unique set of features is identified that is enhanced, in terms of its ability to help produce a proper separation between the two specific classes. The selection of these sets of features is accomplished by making use of a class separability measure that is utilized in an iterative process. Fisher's linear discriminant is employed in order to produce the separation between each pair of classes and train each two-class classifier. In order to combine the classification results from all two-class classifiers, the `voting' classifier-decision fusion process is employed.

However, they are becoming increasingly larger, using millions of parameters, while they are restricted to handling images of fixed size. In this paper, a quantization-based approach, inspired from the well-known Bag-of-Features model, is proposed to overcome these limitations. The proposed approach, called Convolutional BoF (CBoF), uses RBF neurons to quantize the information extracted from the convolutional layers and it is able to natively classify images of various sizes as well as to significantly reduce the number of parameters in the network. In contrast to other global pooling operators and CNN compression techniques the proposed method utilizes a trainable pooling layer that it is end-to-end differentiable, allowing the network to be trained using regular back-propagation and to achieve greater distribution shift invariance than competitive methods. The ability of the proposed method to reduce the parameters of the network and increase the classification accuracy over other state-of-the-art techniques is demonstrated using three image datasets.",

Subsequently, we obtain the feature representations of the last convolutional layer using the max pooling operation, and we retrain the weights of the convolutional layers in a fully unsupervised fashion, aiming to produce more efficient compact image descriptors which improve the retrieval performance both in terms of time and precision.

The development of an application capable to identify human eating and drinking activity can be really useful in a smart home environment targeting to extend independent living of older persons in the early stages of dementia. In this paper a novel method aiming at eating and drinking activity recognition is presented. Activities are considered as a sequence of human body poses forming 3D volumes, in which the third dimension refers to time. Fuzzy Vector Quantization is performed to associate the 3D volume representation of an activity video with 3D volume prototypes and Linear Discriminant Analysis is used to map activity representations in a low dimensional discriminant feature space. In this space a simple Nearest Centroid classification procedure leads to very satisfactory classification results.",

However, despite the success of these approaches on many challenging financial forecasting tasks, it is not always straightforward to employ DL-based approaches for highly volatile and non-stationary time financial series. To this end, in this paper, an adaptive input normalization layer that can learn to identify the distribution from which the input data were generated and then apply the most appropriate normalization scheme is proposed. This allows for promptly adapting the input to the subsequent DL model, which can be especially important, given recent findings that hint at the existence of critical learning periods in neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed method operates on a sliding window over the time series allowing for overcoming non-stationary issues that often arise. It is worth noting that the main difference with \u2026",

Correlation/spectral properties of such sequences are easily controllable, which is a fact that reflects on the watermarking system performance. A family of chaotic maps, namely the skew tent map family, is used to verify the theoretical analysis. Skew tent chaotic sequences are compared against the widely used pseudorandom sequences, indicating the superiority of the former in watermarking applications. The minimum number of samples required for reliable watermark detection is also investigated. Experiments using audio data are conducted to verify the theoretical analysis results.",

The performance of the morphological dynamic link architecture is evaluated in terms of the receiver operating characteristic in the M2VTS face image database.

This face recognition methodology employs dynamic training in order to implement a person-specific iterative classification process. This process employs discriminant clustering, where, by making use of an entropy-based measure, the algorithm adapts the coordinates of the discriminant space with respect to the characteristics of the test face. As a result, the training space is dynamically reduced to smaller spaces, where linear separability among the face classes is more likely to be achieved.

            "Abstract": "Data clustering is an unsupervised learning task that has found many applications in various scientific fields. The goal is to find subgroups of closely related data samples (clusters) in a set of unlabeled data. Kernel k-Means is a state of the art clustering algorithm. However, in contrast to clustering algorithms that can work using only a limited percentage of the data at a time, Kernel k-Means is a global clustering algorithm. It requires the computation of the kernel matrix, which takes O (n 2 d) time and O (n 2) space in memory. As datasets grow larger, the application of Kernel k-Means becomes infeasible on a single computer, a fact that strongly suggests a distributed approach. In this paper, we present such an approach to the Kernel k-Means clustering algorithm, in order to make its application to a large number of samples feasible and, thus, achieve high performance clustering results on very big datasets.

Car racing simulation is an active research field where new advances in aerodynamics, consumption and engine power are modelled and tested.

Additionally, the resulted neural-networks controllers are evolved in order to adapt and increase their performance to a given racing track using genetic algorithms. The proposed bots are implemented and tested on several tracks of the open racing car simulator (TORCS) providing smoother driving behaviour than the corresponding rule-based bots and increased performance using the evolutionary adaptation.",

To this end, an explicitly trained attention model for VQA is proposed in this paper. The proposed method utilizes attention-oriented word embeddings that allows efficiently learning the common representation spaces. Furthermore, multiple attention models of varying complexity are employed as a way of realizing a mixture of experts attention model, further improving the VQA accuracy over a single attention model.

This led to the development of various methods for analyzing and forecasting the behaviour of financial assets, ranging from traditional quantitative finance to more modern machine learning approaches. However, the volatile and unstable behavior of financial markets forbids the accurate prediction of future prices, reducing the performance of these approaches. In contrast, in this paper we propose a novel price trailing method that goes beyond traditional price forecasting by reformulating trading as a control problem, effectively overcoming the aforementioned limitations. The proposed method leads to developing robust agents that can withstand large amounts of noise, while \u2026",

To this end, we adapt the pretrained model and we retrain it on the dataset so that each image representation comes closer in terms of Euclidean distance to its nearest relevant representations and moves away from the irrelevant ones.

In the so-called dyneme space, the sparse posture representations of a movement are combined to represent the movement as a single point in that space, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is further employed to increase movement type discrimination and compactness of representation. This method allows for simple Mahalanobis or cosine distance comparison of movements, taking implicitly into account time shifts and internal speed variations, and, thus, aiding the design of a real-time movement recognition algorithm.",

This matrix is then referenced to calculate the distance between an element and a cluster center, as per classic k-Means.

During the procedure, partial sums of components create a sequence of reconstructed images which starts with a crude approximation of the facial region that recursively becomes finer. More specifically, a feature vector is created at each node of a sparse grid superimposed on the facial area by concatenating the gray level values of the reconstructed images at the grid node position. When a candidate person claims the identity of a reference person, a variant of dynamic link matching, the so-called morphological signal decomposition\u2014dynamic link architecture, is applied to yield a matching error between the reference grid and a variable grid that is built over the facial image region of the candidate person \u2026",

However, its performance severely deteriorates, when it is applied to the IBERMATICA database that has been recorded under conditions simulating a real access-control to an automatic teller machine.

In addition, such multi-class classification problems are usually formed by a considerable number of classes. This makes the application of the popular one-versus-rest binary classifiers fusion scheme adopted by most state-of-the-art approaches difficult. In this paper, in order to overcome the high computational cost of multi-class non-linear classification approaches, we adopt an ensemble of approximate non-linear one-class classifiers. To this end, we propose a new scalable solution for the Least Squares One-Class Support Vector Machine classifier by following an approximate kernel approach. We evaluated the proposed method in big data visual classification problems, where it is shown that it is able to achieve satisfactory performance \u2026",

The proposed long-term 2D tracking algorithm solves exactly this problem, by detecting occlusions from the 2D tracker responses.

The proposed approach reduces the problem of synchronizing N non-overlapping sequences to the problem of robustly estimating a single line from a set of appropriately-generated points in RN+ 1. This line describes all temporal relations between the N sequences and the moving target.

This demand has been lately addressed by the emergence of a variety of watermarking methods. Such methods target towards hiding in the original data an imperceptible and undetectable signal which conveys information about the host medium (owner or authorized user, transaction or product ID, etc). For a review of existing schemes and a detailed discussion on the main requirements of a watermarking scheme, the interested reader may consult [5, 9].The field of nonlinear dynamics which has its roots in the work of French mathematician H. Poincar\u00e9 (1854\u20131912) is dealing with the study of the systems whose time evolution equations are of nonlinear nature. Under certain conditions, some nonlinear systems give rise to chaos, that is, a complex, aperiodic, and apparently random behavior. However, neither is the random and complex behavior of chaotic systems the result of uncontrolled external factors, namely, noise, nor is it necessarily attributed to the complexity of the system; most chaotic systems are deterministic in nature and can be described by very simple equations. Chaotic behavior can result, for example, from the iterative application of an appropriate nonlinear scalar map f (\u00b7):",

However, existing KT methods are tailored towards classification tasks and they cannot be used efficiently for other representation learning tasks. In this paper we propose a novel probabilistic knowledge transfer method that works by matching the probability distribution of the data in the feature space instead of their actual representation. Apart from outperforming existing KT techniques, the proposed method allows for overcoming several of their limitations providing new insight into KT as well as novel KT applications, ranging from KT from handcrafted feature extractors to cross-modal KT from the textual modality into the representation extracted from the visual modality of the data.",

            "Abstract": "Person identification based on gait recognition has been extensively studied in the last two decades, while information appearing in different action types (like bend) has been recently exploited to this end. However, in most application scenarios it is sufficient to recognize the performed activity, whereas the ID of persons performing activities is not important. Since the same human body representations, e.g., body silhouettes, can be employed for both tasks, there is a need to automatically create privacy preserving representations. We have applied 2D Gaussian filtering to obfuscate the human body silhouettes that implicate information about the person ID. We have experimentally showed how the use of filtering affects the person identification and action recognition performance in different camera setups formed by an arbitrary number of cameras. In addition, the discriminative ability of different activities is examined \u2026",

Furthermore, BoCF is consistent with color constancy statistical approaches and can be interpreted as a learning-based extension of many statistical approaches. To further improve the illumination estimation accuracy, we propose a novel attention mechanism for the BoCF model with two variants based on self-attention.

This is often not possible in practical applications, such as person verification, where the lack of sufficient training samples causes improper estimation of a linear separation hyper-plane between the two classes. To overcome this shortcoming a novel algorithm that can handle the verification problem more efficiently than traditional LDA is presented. The dimensionality of the samples is reduced by breaking them down, thus creating subsets of smaller dimensionality feature vectors, and applying discriminant analysis on each subset. The resulting discriminant weight sets are themselves weighted under a normalization criterion, making the discriminant functions continuous in this sense.

However, their performance crucially depends on the employed normalization scheme, while they are usually unable to efficiently handle non-stationary features without first appropriately pre-processing them. These limitations impact the performance of deep learning models, especially when used for forecasting financial time series, due to their non-stationary and multimodal nature. In this paper we propose a data-driven adaptive normalization layer which is capable of learning the most appropriate normalization scheme that should be applied on the data. To this end, the proposed method first identifies the distribution from which the data were generated and then it dynamically shifts and scales them in order to facilitate the task at hand.

Although it is common-knowledge that appearance-based methods are sensitive to image registration errors, there is no systematic experiment reported in the literature. As a result of these experiments, the training set enrichment with translated, scaled and rotated images is proposed for confronting the low robustness of these techniques in facial expression recognition.

The aim is to acquire the frontal images of a person in order to achieve better results in later face or facial expression recognition. For this purpose, we utilize a relatively new subspace learning technique, Clustering based Discriminant Analysis (CDA) against two well-known in the literature subspace learning techniques for dimensionality reduction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We also concisely describe spectral clustering which is proposed in this work as a preprocessing step to the CDA algorithm. As classifiers, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor the Nearest Centroid and the novel Nearest Cluster Centroid classifiers. Experiments conducted on the XM2VTS database, demonstrate that PCA+CDA outperforms PCA, LDA and PCA+LDA in Cross \u2026",

A class is represented by an optimized class vector, enhancing class discrimination in the resulting feature space. An iterative optimization scheme is proposed to this end, where both the optimal nonlinear data projection and the optimal class representation are determined in each optimization step.

            "Abstract": "Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) reveal a common way to model multi-class classification problems. According to this state of the art technique, a multi-class problem is decomposed into several binary ones. Additionally, on the ECOC framework we can apply the subclass technique (sub-ECOC), where by splitting the initial classes of the problem we create larger but easier to solve ECOC configurations. The multi-class problem's decomposition is achieved via a discriminant tree creation procedure. This discriminant tree's creation is controlled by a triplet of thresholds that define a set of user defined splitting standards. The selection of the thresholds plays a major role in the classification performance. In our work we show that by optimizing these thresholds via particle swarm optimization we improve significantly the classification performance. Moreover, using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as classifiers we \u2026",

To deal with the internal covariate shift that occurs when extracting histograms from convolutional features as well as to incorporate informations from the multiple levels of the neural hierarchy, we propose and use a novel densely connected architecture where histograms from multiple layers are concatenated to produce the final representation.

A ternary watermark is embedded in the 3D model using geometric deformations of the vertices, without altering the vertex topology. Prior to embedding and detection the model is rotated and translated so that its center of mass and its principal axis coincide with the origin and the z-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. This transformation grants the method robustness to translation and rotation. Robustness to scaling is achieved by restricting the vertex deformations to occur only along the r coordinate of the corresponding (r,, \u03c6) spherical coordinates system. Simulation results indicate the ability of the proposed method to deal with the aforementioned attacks giving more than satisfactory results.",

More specifically we use UAV footage to recognize certain types of athletes, belonging to a subset of an original athlete class, utilizing only a handful of recorded images of this athlete subclass. We examine the effects of such methods on image recognition accuracy while proposing a novel approach for accuracy optimizations. The overall task is evaluated on actual cycling race UAV footage.",

In the clustering step that follows a new discriminant space is defined by processing this subset and both the test and training data are projected to this space. This process is repeated until one final cluster is selected and the most similar, to the test face, face class contained is set as the identity match.

As a result, using DRL methods for such tasks require devoting significant effort for hyper-parameter tuning, as well as for designing the appropriate input pre-processing schemes. The latter is especially important, given the non-stationary nature of financial data, along with the ability of DRL agents to easily overfit the data, limiting their generalization abilities.

Experiments on traditional dance dataset and on other various multidimensional datasets were conducted using both internal and external clustering criteria as evaluation methods, which provided encouraging results.",

The most discriminant features of a person's face are found and a deformable model is placed in the spatial coordinates that correspond to these discriminant features. The discriminant deformable models, for verifying the person's identity, that are learned through this procedure are elastic graphs that are dense in the facial areas considered discriminant for a specific person and sparse in other less significant facial areas. The discriminant graphs are enhanced by a discriminant feature selection method for the graph nodes in order to find the most discriminant jet features. The proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of elastic graph matching in frontal face verification",

These methods are capable of transferring arbitrary styles in a style-agnostic manner by employing the appropriate feature transformations. Despite their apparent effectiveness when used to transfer a single style from relatively simple images, they are usually not capable of effectively handling more complex styles, producing artifacts, as well as reducing the quality of the synthesized textures in the stylized image. In this paper, we propose a novel universal style transfer method that separately models each sub-style that exists in a given style image, overcoming these limitations to a great extent. In this way, the proposed method is capable of detecting and semantically matching the sub-styles that exist both in the content and style images, improving the style transfer quality and reducing artifacts over state-of-the-art NST approaches \u2026",

However, early exits in many cases suffer from significant limitations, which often prohibit their practical application, especially when placed on convolutional layers with narrow receptive fields.

Approximate kernel-based learning approaches have been proposed in order to reduce the time and space complexities of kernel methods, while achieving satisfactory performance.

This gives rise to the proposed Bag-of-Embedded Words (BoEW) model that can efficiently represent text documents overcoming the limitations of previously predominantly used techniques, such as the textual Bag-of-Words model. The proposed method extends the regular BoF model by a) incorporating a weighting mask that allows for altering the importance of each learned codeword and b) by optimizing the model end-to-end (from the word embeddings to the weighting mask).

In this paper, we tackle face de-identification using Deep Autoencoders, by finetuning the encoder to perform face de-identification. We present various methods to finetune the encoder in both a supervised and unsupervised fashion to preserve facial attributes, while generating new faces which are both visually and quantitatively different from the original ones.

The contribution of each graph-regularized kernel to the SVM classification problem, is estimated automatically. Thereby, the solution of the proposed modified SVM optimization problem lies in a regularized space, where data similarity is expressed by a linear combination of multiple single-graph regularized kernels.

In this paper, a hypothesis is proposed and empirically tested, namely that more salient data points can be obtained by attempting to restrain reconstruction error separately for each original data point.

            "Abstract": "Active vision approaches hold the credentials for improving the accuracy of Deep Learning (DL) models for many challenging visual analysis tasks and varying environmental conditions. However, active vision approaches are typically closely tied to the underlying hardware, slowing down their adoption, while they typically increase the latency of perception systems, since sensory data must be recaptured. In this work, we propose a pseudo-active data refinement method that works by appropriately refining the sensory input, without having to reacquire the sensor data through traditional camera control approaches. The proposed method is fully differentiable and can be trained for the task at hand in an end-to-end fashion, while it can be directly deployed in a wide variety of systems, tasks and conditions. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated across a variety of tasks using two \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models can be used to tackle time series analysis tasks with great success. However, the performance of DL models can degenerate rapidly if the data are not appropriately normalized. This issue is even more apparent when DL is used for financial time series forecasting tasks, where the nonstationary and multimodal nature of the data pose significant challenges and severely affect the performance of DL models. In this brief, a simple, yet effective, neural layer that is capable of adaptively normalizing the input time series, while taking into account the distribution of the data, is proposed. The proposed layer is trained in an end-to-end fashion using backpropagation and leads to significant performance improvements compared to other evaluated normalization schemes. The proposed method differs from traditional normalization methods since it learns how to perform normalization for a given task \u2026",

In parallel, important work has been accomplished on Graph Embedding (GE), which is a general framework unifying several subspace learning techniques. In this paper, GE has been extended in order to integrate subclass discriminant information resulting to the novel Subclass Graph Embedding (SGE) framework. The kernelization of SGE is also presented. It is shown that SGE comprises a generalization of the typical GE including subclass DR methods. In this context, the theoretical link of SDA and CDA methods with SGE is established. The efficacy and power of SGE has been substantiated by comparing subclass DR methods \u2026",

We demonstrate the ability of the proposed method, abbreviated as EO-BoW, to improve the retrieval performance by providing extensive experiments on two multi-class image datasets. The BoW model can be applied to other domains as well, so we also evaluate our approach using a collection of 45 time-series datasets, a text dataset, and a video dataset. The gains are three-fold since the EO-BoW can improve the mean Average Precision, while reducing the encoding time and the database storage \u2026",

In this paper, we propose replacing the linear hyperplane decision boundary of a neuron with a curved, paraboloid decision boundary. Thus, the decision boundary of the proposed paraboloid neuron is given by the equation (h T  x + h 0 ) 2  - ||x - p|| 2 2  = 0, where h and h 0  denote the parameters of the directrix and p denotes the coordinates of the focus.

The goal is to find subgroups of closely related data samples (clusters) in a set of unlabeled data. A classic clustering algorithm is the so-called k-Means. It is very popular, however, it is also unable to handle cases in which the clusters are not linearly separable. Kernel k-Means is a state of the art clustering algorithm, which employs the kernel trick, in order to perform clustering on a higher dimensionality space, thus overcoming the limitations of classic k-Means regarding the non linear separability of the input data. Kernel k-Means typically computes the kernel matrix, which contains the results of the kernel function for every possible sample combination. This matrix can be viewed as the weight matrix of a full graph, where the samples are the vertices and the edges are weighed according to the similarity \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose an extension of the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm for Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Neural network training that incorporates Dropout and DropConnect regularization in its optimization process. We show that both types of regularization lead to the same solution for the network output weights calculation, which is adopted by the proposed DropELM network. The proposed algorithm is able to exploit Dropout and DropConnect regularization, without computationally intensive iterative weight tuning. We show that the adoption of such a regularization approach can lead to better solutions for the network output weights. We incorporate the proposed regularization approach in several recently proposed ELM algorithms and show that their performance can be enhanced without requiring much additional computational cost.",

            "Abstract": "Bag-of-Features (BoF)-based models have been traditionally used for various computer vision tasks, due to their ability to provide compact semantic representations of complex objects, eg, images, videos, etc. Indeed, BoF has been successfully combined with various feature extractions methods, ranging from handcrafted feature extractors to powerful deep learning models. However, BoF, along with most of the pooling approaches employed in deep learning, fails to capture the temporal dynamics of the input sequences. This leads to significant information loss, especially when the informative content of the data is sequentially distributed over the temporal dimension, eg, videos. In this paper we propose a novel stateful recurrent quantization and aggregation approach in order to overcome the aforementioned limitation. The proposed method is inspired by the well-known Bag-of-Features (BoF) model, but employs a stateful trainable recurrent quantizer, instead of plain static quantization, allowing for effectively encoding the temporal dimension of the data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using three video action recognition datasets.",

The analysis involves theoretical evaluation of the system detection reliability, when a correlator detector is used. The effect of distortions (lowpass filtering, noise corruption of the watermarked data) on the detection reliability is also theoretically investigated. The system is modeled in a communication framework considering the signal as interference and converting the addressed problem to the detection of the underlying watermark signal. The aim of the paper is two-fold:(i) to introduce the n-way Bernoulli shift generated chaotic watermarks and theoretically contemplate their properties with respect to detection reliability and (ii) to theoretically establish their potential superiority against the widely used (pseudo-) random watermarks. An important property of Bernoulli watermarks is their controllable spectral/correlation properties that renders them ideal for a variety of applications. Bernoulli watermarks can be generated with lowpass spectral properties to withstand lowpass attacks. When no distortions are to be inflicted, white spectrum Bernoulli watermarks can be generated so that their performance converges to that of random watermarks. Experimental verification of the theoretical analysis results has been performed as well.",

It has also importance for the provision of improved home care in cases of disabled persons or persons suffering from certain diseases that have high social impact. In this context, the development of computer vision systems capable to identify human eating and drinking activity can be really useful in order to prevent undernourishment/malnutrition and dehydration in a smart home environment targeting to extend independent living of older persons in the early stage of dementia. In this paper, we first describe the human centered interface specifications and implementations for such a system, which can be supported by ambient intelligence and robotic technologies. We, subsequently, describe a multi-view eating and drinking activity recognition database that has been created in order to facilitate research towards this direction. The database has been created by using four cameras in order to produce multi-view videos, each depicting one of twelve persons having a meal, resulting to a database size equal to 59.68 hours in total. Various types of meals have been recorded, ie, breakfast, lunch and fast food. Moreover, the persons have different sizes, clothing and are of different sex. The database has been annotated in a frame base in terms of person ID and activity class. We hope that such a database will serve as a benchmark data set for computer vision researchers in order to devise methods targeting to this important application.",

            "Abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art results for object detection by replacing the traditional detection methodologies with deep convolutional neural network architectures. A contemporary technique that is shown to further improve the performance of these models on tasks ranging from optical character recognition and neural machine translation to object detection is based on incorporating an attention mechanism within the models. The idea behind the attention mechanism and its variations was to improve the information quality extracted for any confronted task by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input. In this paper we propose two novel deep neural architectures for object recognition that incorporate the idea of the attention mechanism in the well-known faster-RCNN object detector. The objective is to develop attention mechanisms that can be used for small objects detection \u2026",

Unlike most methods proposed in the literature, in which \u201cwalk\u201d (i.e., gait) is assumed to be the only activity exploited for person identification, we incorporate several activities in order to identify a person. A multicamera setup is used to capture the human body from different viewing angles. Fuzzy vector quantization and linear discriminant analysis are exploited in order to provide a discriminant activity representation. Person identification, activity recognition, and viewing angle specification results are obtained for all the available cameras independently. By properly combining these results, a view-invariant activity-independent person identification method is obtained. The proposed approach has been tested in challenging problem setups, simulating real application situations. Experimental results are \u2026",

If the feedback of the users is large enough a generic model refinement method is also proposed, for improving the entire performance of the system in the retrieval task. In this case, we refine the deep CNN weights based on the feedback gathered from multiple users, forming a new training set.

            "Abstract": "Music is an essential part of human life. It is a way to express ourselves. Its importance gave rise to music Recommender Systems (RS) through e-commerce applications. The most commonly used technique in such applications is Collaborative Filtering (CF) that uses the User-Item (UI) matrix. The latter codes the users' preferences for items. The advantage of using CF methods is their simplicity and their relatively high efficiency. However, data sparsity deteriorates their efficiency. In this paper, we propose a process that can enhance the similarities among users in a way that can address the sparsity problem. The proposed user based CF algorithm alters the values of similarity matrix between users by incorporating a graph based method, improving the performance of the RS. We also propose a method that groups users using spectral clustering and together with the graph-based similarity method yield even more \u2026",

However, CNNs are complex models that require the use of powerful hardware, both for training and deploying them. To this end, a quantization-based pooling method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method is inspired from the bag-of-features model and can be used for learning more lightweight deep neural networks. Trainable radial basis function neurons are used to quantize the activations of the final convolutional layer, reducing the number of parameters in the network and allowing for natively classifying images of various sizes. The proposed method employs differentiable quantization and aggregation layers leading to an end-to-end trainable CNN architecture. Furthermore, a fast linear variant of the proposed method is introduced and discussed \u2026",

However, flying drones in such setting requires the coordination of several people, increasing the cost of using drones for aerial cinematography and limiting the shooting flexibility by putting a significant cognitive load on the director and drone/camera operators. To overcome some of these limitation, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (RL) method for performing autonomous frontal view shooting. To this end, a realistic simulation environment is developed, which ensures that the learned agent can be directly deployed on a drone. Then, a deep RL algorithm, tailored to the needs of the specific application, is derived building upon the well known deep Q-learning approach.

The problem of face verification is considered as a two-class problem (genuine versus impostor class). The typical Fisher\u2019s Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) gives only one or two projections in a two-class problem. This is a very strict limitation to the search of discriminant dimensions. As for the FLDA for N class problems (N> 2) the transformation is not person specific. In order to remedy these limitations of FLDA, exploit the individuality of human faces and take into consideration the fact that the distribution of facial images, under different viewpoints, illumination variations and facial expression is highly complex and non-linear, novel kernel discriminant algorithms are used. The new method is tested in the face verification problem using various datasets where it is verified that it outperforms other commonly used kernel approaches",

In order to visualize that data in 2D or 3D, usually Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are employed. Most of these techniques produce static projections without taking into account corrections from humans or other data exploration scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel interactive DR framework that is able to learn the optimal projection by exploiting the user interactions with the projected data. We evaluate the proposed method under a widely used interaction scenario in multidimensional projection literature, ie, project a subset of the data, rearrange them better in classes, and then project the rest of the dataset, and we show that it greatly outperforms competitive baseline and state-of-the-art techniques, while also being able to readily adapt to the computational requirements of different applications.",
