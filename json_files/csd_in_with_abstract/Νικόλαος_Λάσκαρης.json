The single trials are treated as observation vectors from a multidimensional distribution, in order to exploit the obvious correlation between the time instants. The technique of potential functions is utilized to approximate the vector distribution. A genetic algorithm is employed for the location of the mode of this distribution which is proposed as an estimate of the underlying EP signal. The experimental results indicate that the mode of the vector distribution deviates a lot from the corresponding ensemble average, justifying our approach. The proposed filtering method offers significant increases in SNR compared to conventional averaging, showing that the status of the visual pathway can be better portrayed.",

Nonetheless, how conflicting biomarker constellations affect the progression risk is still elusive. The present study explored the impact of different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker constellations on the progression risk of MCI patients. A multicentre cohort of 469 patients with MCI and available CSF biomarker results and clinical follow-up data was considered. Biomarker values were categorized as positive for AD, negative or borderline. Progression risk differences between patients with different constellations of total Tau (t-Tau), phosphorylated Tau at threonine 181 (p-Tau) and amyloid-beta 1\u201342 (A\u03b242) were studied. Group comparison analyses and Cox regression models were employed. Patients with all biomarkers positive for AD (N\u2009=\u2009145) had the highest hazard for progression to dementia due to AD, whilst patients with no positive biomarkers (N\u2009=\u2009111) had the lowest. The risk of patients with only abnormal p-Tau and/or t-Tau (N\u2009=\u200949) or with positive A\u03b242 in combination with positive t-Tau or p-Tau (N\u2009=\u2009119) is significantly lower than that of patients with all biomarkers positive. The risk of progression to dementia due to AD differs between patients with different CSF biomarker constellations.",

We attempted to decode music appraisal from brain activity, recorded via wearable EEG, during music listening. Approach. To comply with the dynamic nature of music stimuli, cross-frequency coupling measurements were employed in a time-evolving manner to capture the evolving interactions between distinct brain-rhythms during music listening.

            "Abstract": "Cross-frequency, phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) between neuronal oscillations at rest may serve as the substrate that supports information exchange between functionally specialized neuronal populations both within and between cortical regions. The study utilizes novel algorithms to identify prominent instantaneous modes of cross-frequency coupling and their temporal stability in resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 23 students experiencing severe reading difficulties (RD) and 27 age-matched non-impaired readers (NI). Phase coherence estimates were computed in order to identify the prominent mode of PAC interaction for each sensor, sensor pair, and pair of frequency bands (from \u03b4 to \u03b3) at successive temporal segments of the continuous MEG record. The degree of variability in the characteristic frequency-pair PACf1-f2 modes over time was also estimated. Results revealed a wider repertoire of prominent PAC interactions in RD as compared to NI students, suggesting an altered functional substrate for information exchange between neuronal assemblies in the former group. Moreover, RD students showed significant variability in PAC modes over time. This temporal instability of PAC values was particularly prominent: (a) within and between right hemisphere temporal and occipitotemporal sensors and, (b) between left hemisphere frontal, temporal, and occipitotemporal sensors and corresponding right hemisphere sites. Altered modes of neuronal population coupling may help account for extant data revealing reduced, task-related neurophysiological and hemodynamic activation in left hemisphere regions \u2026",

To alleviate this, tensor subspace analysis (TSA) is incorporated for the parsimonious representation of connectivity data. In addition to the particular methodological innovation, this work also makes a contribution at a conceptual level by encoding in FCGs cross-frequency coupling apart from the conventional frequency-specific interactions.

            "Abstract": "\u201cVukovar landscapes\u201d is a series of oil on canvas paintings made in mid-19th century by an unknown author [1]. Only one of the landscapes is signed, by Joseph Franz M\u00fccke, a royal painter of Habsburg dinasty, presumably ordered by count Emmerich Josef Eltz as a decoration for his Manor in Vukovar, Croatia. Of all candidate authors, M\u00fccke is the only one who was known to live in Vukovar in the period the landscapes were made. One of the clues toward the discovery or confirmation of the true author could be given by comparing the painting pigments used in signed and unsigned landscapes.Raman spectroscopy with 785 nm laser is used to identify the pigments used for the signed painting \u201cThe Gardens\u201d. Raman analysis reveals the author\u2019s palette [2]. For blue colours indigo pigment was found with addition of calcite for lighter hues. Green colours contain malachite with possible mixture of other earth pigments, like terre-verte. Orange-brown colours are obtained using either a mixture of red lead, red earth and yellow earth pigments or terra umbra. All earth pigments contain traces of quartz. Elemental analysis, like XRF, is proposed for complete characterization of M\u00fccke\u2019s palette [3].",

A computable biomarker for the assessment of spontaneous aesthetic brain responses during music listening is introduced here. It derives from well-established measures of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and quantifies the music-induced alterations in the dynamic relationships between brain rhythms. During a stage of exploratory analysis, and using the signals from a suitably designed experiment, we established the biomarker, which acts on brain activations recorded over the left prefrontal cortex and focuses on the functional coupling between high-\u03b2 and low-\u03b3 oscillations.

When associated with estimates of covariance, its implications concern not only classification accuracy, but also computational efficiency. However, very few attempts have been made so far, since it constitutes a challenging mathematical problem. Herein, we propose an efficient heuristic scheme that combines discriminative learning (from a small training dataset of labelled trials) with unsupervised learning (the automated detection of sensors that collectively maximize the trial discriminability of the induced Covariance structure). The approach is motivated from a complex network modelling perspective. Its efficacy and efficiency are demonstrated experimentally, based on BCI-competition datasets concerning MI-tasks, and compared against popular techniques in the field.",

The reconstructed cortical activity was examined with respect to the onset of the target stimulus and the onset of the saccade. Upward saccades were faster than downward saccades, in agreement with previous studies.

EMG signals are influenced by electrical environmental noise. The main sources of these noise signals are the noise from the differential amplifier circuit that is normally included in data logger devices and 50 Hz power line noise.

Despite the fact that in early days it was used mostly for pictorial information, ie 2D-signals, now the same term stands almost for any output from a data-source. For instance, any digital-signal can be considered as an 1D-pattern, a grey-scale image as a 2D-patterm, a video-sequence as a (temporal) multi-dimensional pattern etc.Here we will present a general purpose framework for dealing with patterns and discuss simple algorithms with a wide-range of applications (from novelty-detection and prototyping in databases to the full organization of a library of patterns). The main characteristic of the framework and simultaneously its great benefit is its Geometrical character. This enables the direct conceptualization of the employed ideas and promotes the easy understanding of the described algorithmic steps.",

The existence of such a communication pattern is first confirmed for our data and then precisely determined by means of two distinct measures of non-linear interdependence between time-series. A graph encapsulating the small-world network structure along with the relative interdependence strength is formed for each sleep stage and subsequently fed to a suitable clustering procedure.

There has been only one previous work with virtual reality and the use of a virtual action planning supermarket for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. The authors of that study examined the feasibility and the validity of the virtual action planning supermarket (VAP-S) for the diagnosis of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and found that the VAP-S is a viable tool to assess EF deficits. In our study we employed the in-house platform of virtual action planning museum (VAP-M) and a sample of 25 MCI and 25 controls, in order to investigate deficits in spatial navigation, prospective memory and executive function. In addition, we used the morphology of late components in event-related potential (ERP) responses, as a marker for cognitive dysfunction. The related measurements were fed to a common classification scheme facilitating the direct comparison of both approaches. Our results indicate that both the VAP-M and ERP averages were able to differentiate between healthy elders and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and agree with the findings of the virtual action planning supermarket (VAP-S).

As in vitro data indicate IL-1 b-p38 MAPK system is a key regulator of microglia/inflammation, p38 MAPK is recognized as a significant therapeutic target (Correa, 2012). However, the effects of inhibiting p38 MAPK in a chronic model of Alzheimer\u2019s are unknown due to previous unavailability of blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-penetrant p38 MAPK antagonists (Munoz, 2010). VX745 (BBB penetrant selective p38 MAPK a antagonist) inhibits IL-1 b production and signaling, with potency against signaling two-fold higher. VX-745 has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in non-CNS clinical studies. To re-position for Alzheimer\u2019s, VX-745 was tested in aged rat model. Methods: This study was conducted at Charles River Finland. It used 60 Fischer rats aged 20-24 months with cognitive deficit in Morris-Water-Maze (MWM), as well as 15 young (2-3 months) adult Fischer rats. The vehicle (1% Pluronic F108) or VX745 (0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg) was administered twice daily by oral gavage for 23 days. Learning/memory deficits were analyzed by MWM on eight occasions. Hippocampal PSD95 and IL-1b were determined by ELISA; and plasma VX745 drug levels by LC/MS were determined at sacrifice, one hour after the last dose. Results: Vehicle-treated young rats demonstrated effective learning with rapid reduction in MWM latency/distance with sequential testing. Aged vehicle-treated rats appeared cognitively impaired, exhibiting longer times/distances than young rats, and little improvement during the study. VX745-treated aged rats \u2026",

As exciting new techniques were being adapted from medical research to the commercial domain, many neuroscientists and marketing practitioners have taken the chance to exploit them so as to uncover the answers of the most important marketing questions. Among the available neuroimaging technologies, electroencephalography (EEG) stands out as the less invasive and most affordable method. While not equally precise as other neuroimaging technologies in terms of spatial resolution, it can capture brain activity almost at the speed of cognition. Hence, EEG constitutes a favorable candidate for recording and subsequently decoding the consumers\u2019 brain activity. However, despite its wide use in neuromarketing, it cannot provide the complete picture alone. In order to overcome the limitations imposed by a single monitoring method, researchers focus on more holistic approaches. The exploitation of hybrid EEG schemes (e.g. combining EEG with eye-tracking, electrodermal activity, heart rate and/or other) is ever growing and will hopefully allow neuromarketing to uncover consumers' behaviour. Our survey revolves around last-decade hybrid neuromarketing schemes that involve EEG as the dominant modality. Beyond covering the relevant literature and the state-of-the-art findings, we also provide future directions on the field, present the limitations that accompany each of the commonly employed monitoring methods and briefly discuss the omni-present ethical scepticism related to neuromarketing.",

Initially, a vector quantization technique is adopted, based on the application of self-organizing neural networks. The color content in each image is summarized by representative RGB-vectors extracted using the Neural-Gas network, an efficient way to extract faithful representations from multivariate distributions. The similarity between two images is then assessed as commonality between the corresponding representative color distributions and quantified using the multivariate Wald-Wolfowitz test, a nonparametric statistical test dealing with the \"multivariate two-sample problem\". Experimental results drawn from a diverse collection of color images show a significantly improved performance relative to the popular approach of color histogram.",

It has a vital role in the development and maturation of living organisms. However, when deregulated, it is involved in the onset of a number of diseases. Based on a computational model describing a \u201csurface\u201d and an \u201cinternalized\u201d parallel route, we use systems biology techniques to characterize aspects of the network\u2019s functional organization. We examine the re-organization of protein groups from low to high external stimulation, define functional groups of proteins within the network, determine the parameter best encoding for input intensity and predict the effect of protein removal to the system\u2019s output response. Extensive functional re-organization of proteins is observed in the lower end of stimulus concentrations. As we move to higher concentrations the variability is less pronounced. 6 functional groups have emerged from a consensus clustering approach, reflecting different dynamical aspects of the network. Mutual information investigation revealed that the maximum activation rate of the two output proteins best encodes for stimulus intensity. Removal of each protein of the network resulted in a range of graded effects, from complete silencing to intense activation. Our results provide a new \u201cvista\u201d of the EGF-induced MAP kinase cascade, from the perspective of complex self-organizing systems. Functional grouping of the proteins reveals an organizational scheme contrasting the current understanding of modular topology.

            "Abstract": "The ability of recognizing and correcting the erroneous actions is an integral part of human nature. Plenty of neuroscientific studies have been investigating the ability of human brain to recognize errors. The distinct neuronal responses that are produced by the human brain during the perception of an erroneous action are referred to as errorrelated potentials (ErrPs). Although research in brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) has managed to achieve significant improvement in terms of detecting the users\u2019 intentions over the last years, in a real-world setting, the interpretation of brain commands still remains an error-prone procedure leading to inaccurate interactions. Even for multimodal interaction schemes, the attained performance is far from optimal. As a means to overcome these debilities, and apart from developing more sophisticated machinelearning techniques or adding further modalities, scientists have also exploited the users\u2019 ability to perceive errors. During the rapid growth of the BCI/Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) technology over the last years, ErrPs have been used widely in order to enhance several existing BCI applications serving as a passive correction mechanism towards a more user-friendly environment. The principal idea is that a BCI system may incorporate, as feedback, the user\u2019s judgement about its function and use this feedback to correct its current output. In this chapter, we discuss the potentials and applications of ErrPs into developing hybrid BCI systems that emphasize in reliability and user experience by introducing the so-called error awareness.",

So far many techniques of this kind have been proposed as a means to analyze brain dynamics, but most of them are restricted to single-sensor measurements. Analyzing the dynamics in a channel-wise fashion is an invalid approach for multisite encephalographic recordings, since it ignores any pattern of coordinated activity that might emerge from the coherent activation of distinct brain areas. We suggest, here, the use of neural-gas algorithm (Martinez et al. in IEEE Trans Neural Netw 4:558\u2013569, 1993) for encoding brain activity spatiotemporal dynamics in the form of a symbolic timeseries. A codebook of k prototypes, best representing the instantaneous multichannel data, is first designed. Each pattern of activity is then assigned to the most similar code vector.

            "Abstract": "Symbolic dynamics (Rajagopalan et al. 2007) in the context of EEG are highly interwoven with the notion of Lehmann's microstates (Lehmann et al. 1987, 2010). These are detectable in the multichannel signal, from both event-related and spontaneous activity recordings, as recurrent quasi-stable scalp potential maps lasting from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Discrete symbols can be assigned to these microstates, and since they are characterized by great consistency across subjects, this offers a very efficient data reduction method and further facilitates the derivation of brain dynamics descriptors (Ville et al. 2010; Dimitriadis et al., 2012). However, the whole approach relies on signal amplitude characteristics and, hence, ignores aspects of neural coordination that involves genuine interactions beyond coincidence in timing. Inspired by the simplicity and effectiveness of microstates, we have recently introduced an alternative representation that aims at analyzing functional-connectivity patterns (Dimitriadis et al. 2013, 2015). The relevant microstates, functional connectivity microstates (FC\u03bcstates), proved to be convenient descriptors for tracking inter-areal synchronization during cognitive ERP responses and revealed dynamical trends in a parsimonious fashion.We increase the descriptive power of the FC\u03bcstates approach by integrating a nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF)(Lee and Sung, 1999) algorithmic step. Here-for the first time-NNMF is applied to functional connectivity patterns, which are formed by inherently positively-valued measurements. The introduced approach starts by deriving time-indexed functional connectivity profiles \u2026",

P300 has been related to task relevance, information delivery, decision making, expectancy, stimulus evaluation time, etc. Although its importance has been underlined, no systematic work on its enhancement via signal processing methods has yet been presented. The individual sweeps are affected by latency jitter and might contain an EEG component too high for accurate P300 detection. This way, the most useful information to be extracted (P300 latency) is diminished. It is our objective to restore the degraded peaks and provide accurate information about their exact location. The proposed processing method is based on non-linear filtering of the FIR-median hybrid (FMH) type. Elaborating research via discriminant analysis showed that a triangular-like modelling of a useful signal is not far from being realistic. The proposed filter, selected from the FMH filter family, has been designed for revealing triangular-shaped signals from additive gaussian noise (the on-going EEG in our case). The new method is recommended as a powerful tool incorporated in the peak-picking procedure, where the ensemble average will be processed. It is also recommended in place of the single-trial template-fitting procedures that suffer from the fact that the EP is embedded in the on-going EEG (especially in elderly people). III this case the filtering of each individual sweep will lead to the corresponding single-trial P3OO latency measurement. The variability quantification of these measurements constitutes a parameter of great significance for the 1Q \u2026",

Animal studies have identified and classified the neuronal responses in SI but they have not yet resolved whether during prolonged stimulation the collective SI response just passively reflects the input or actively participates in the comparison and decision processes. This question was investigated using tomographic analysis of single trial magnetoencephalographic data. Four right-handed males participated in a frequency discrimination task to detect changes in the frequency of an electrical stimulus applied to the right-hand digits 2+3+4. The subjects received approximately 600 pairs of stimuli with Stim1 always at 21 Hz, while Stim2 was either 21 Hz (50%) or varied from 22 to 29 Hz in steps of 1 Hz \u2026",

On its way to the cortex, odor information is encoded in spatiotemporal maps of activated loci in the bulb, and these are known as input maps. Using optical recording techniques, experimental neuro-scientists can reveal the input maps by applying response-dependent fluorescent dyes to the OB of rodents and imaging the odorant-evoked responses. A hard signal analysis task then emerges (i.e., to handle the resulting sequence of spatial patterns). We suggest that the intricate spatiotemporal patterning of event-related dynamics can be described fully by using a manifold learning approach that merges both the spatial and temporal aspects of the response into a single visualization scheme.",

In its original format, the particular approach is tailored to unidimensional timeseries, hence its straightforward application to brain signals is restricted to singlesensor measurements. The treatment of multisite recordings by analyzing the dynamics in a channelwise fashion is obviously a problematic approach, as it is equivalent to ignoring any coordinated activity patterns emerging from the coherent activation of distinct brain areas. We introduce here a vectorial version of ordinal time series analysis that can fully encompass the multidimensional character of brain\u2019s activations and covariations. By applying it to EEG-data from subjects while performing mental calculations, we show that our approach can differentiate between, otherwise, indistinguishable brain states.METHODS: A sliding window is moving along the N-dimensional time series (each recording site treated as an individual variate). At every step, the window encloses M successive vectors on which we apply a vector-ranking operator and the resulting ranks provides the ordinal pattern associated with the particular signal-segment. This is, always, just one of the permutations of {1, 2,\u2026, M}. By simply counting the number of different ordinal patterns, which appear while traversing the whole timeseries, we end up with a histogram reflecting the variations in global brain dynamics.

            "Abstract": "The detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the transitional stage between normal cognitive changes of aging and the cognitive decline caused by AD, is of paramount clinical importance, since MCI patients are at increased risk of progressing into AD. Electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations in the spectral content of brainwaves and connectivity at resting state have been associated with early-stage AD. Recently, cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) have entered into the picture as an easy to perform screening test. Motivated by the recent findings about the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in cognition, we introduce a relevant methodological approach for detecting MCI based on cognitive responses from a standard auditory oddball paradigm. By using the single trial signals recorded at Pz sensor and comparing the responses to target and non-target stimuli, we first demonstrate that increased CFC is associated with the cognitive task. Then, considering the dynamic character of CFC, we identify instances during which the coupling between particular pairs of brainwave frequencies carries sufficient information for discriminating between normal subjects and patients with MCI. In this way, we form a multiparametric signature of impaired cognition. The new composite biomarker was tested using data from a cohort that consists of 25 amnestic MCI patients and 15 age-matched controls. Standard machine-learning algorithms were employed so as to implement the binary classification task. Based on leave-one-out cross-validation, the measured classification rate was found reaching very high levels (95%). Our approach compares \u2026",

For the first part, we choose 5 attributes: colour (light to dark), colour uniformity (uniform to non-uniform), symmetry (symmetric to non-symmetric), border (regular to irregular), texture (smooth to rough). Using a web based form we asked people to pick a value of each attribute for each lesion. In the second part, we extract 93 features from each lesions and we trained a machine learning algorithm using such features as input and the values of the human attributes as output.

            "Abstract": "Working memory (WM) is a distributed cognitive process that employs communication between prefrontal cortex and posterior brain regions in the form of cross-frequency coupling between theta (\u03b8) and high-alpha (\u03b12) brain waves. A novel method for deriving causal interactions between brain waves of different frequencies is essential for a better understanding of the neural dynamics of such complex cognitive process. Here, we proposed a novel method to estimate transfer entropy (TE) through a symbolization scheme, which is based on neural-gas algorithm (NG) and encodes a bivariate time series in the form of two symbolic sequences. Given the symbolic sequences, the delay symbolic transfer entropy (dSTE NG ) is defined. Our approach is akin to standard symbolic transfer entropy (STE) that incorporates the ordinal pattern (OP) symbolization technique. We assessed the proposed method in a WM-invoked \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This tutorial paper refers to the use of graph-theoretic concepts for analyzing brain signals. For didactic purposes it splits into two parts: theory and application. In the first part, we commence by introducing some basic elements from graph theory and stemming algorithmic tools, which can be employed for data-analytic purposes. Next, we describe how these concepts are adapted for handling evolving connectivity and gaining insights into network reorganization. Finally, the notion of signals residing on a given graph is introduced and elements from the emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) are provided. The second part serves as a pragmatic demonstration of the tools and techniques described earlier. It is based on analyzing a multi-trial dataset containing single-trial responses from a visual ERP paradigm. The paper ends with a brief outline of the most recent trends in graph theory that are about to shape brain signal processing in the near future and a more general discussion on the relevance of graph-theoretic methodologies for analyzing continuous-mode neural recordings.",

Recent electrophysiological investigations suggested that the diminished synchrony between the normal myocardium and the scarred arrhythmogenic tissue bordering a myocardial infarction area gives rise to beat-variable ECG signal components. Using a mathematical model of small variations in a largely repetitive waveform, we show that the inherent alignment errors (trigger jitter) of the high-resolution ECG (HRECG) can artificially increase the value of the time-domain beat-to-beat variance, making it less valuable as a marker of beat-variable signal components. To overcome this drawback, we propose the wavelet based approach which discriminates between the different factors responsible for the beat \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The problem of image similarity has become a challenging task in the field of computer vision through the last two decades. The assessment of (dis) similarity between color (or multichannel, in general) images or parts of images has been studied on several image processing application domains such as image indexing and retrieval, classification and unsupervised segmentation (Rubner et al., 2001). The basic operations that need to be carried out in order to estimate the similarity between two color images are three-fold (Stricker & Orengo, 1995): first, choose an appropriate color space for image representation; then, extract a signature for each image (using, commonly, low-level features) to construct a theoretically valid distribution; finally, establish pairwise comparisons based on these signatures. Each signature constitutes the content description of a corresponding image. It is summarized based on pixel attributes and provides a representation of the image in a multidimensional feature space. There, a proper (dis) similarity measure is defined in order to act as a general rule for comparing any given pair of images. In these directions, several (dis) similarity measures have been developed and used as empirical estimates of the distribution of image features, confirming that distribution-based measures exhibit excellent performance in all areas (Rubner et al., 2001). In the context of visual image similarity, we make use of a nonparametric test from the field of multivariate statistics that deals with the \u201cMultivariate Two-Sample Problem\u201d, originally presented by Friedman and Rafsky (1979). The specific test is a multivariate extension of the classical \u2026",

In a second stage, the STs of encephalographic activity are organized accordingly and the observed variations in the EOG signals are associated with specific brain activations.

The method used is based on nonlinear filtering of the FIR-median hybrid (FMH) type and is recommended as a postfiltering process to the well-known averaging methods of recovering PSVEP signals from noise by time-locking to stimuli.

The idea of \u201cmind reading\u201d was first conceived by Berger, but only in the past few years BCI implementations were made plausible. Due to their design, BCIs are considered ideal assistive tools for people suffering from motor disabilities and as such they receive continuous attention. BCIs can be implemented with various approaches, but electroencephalography (EEG) has been proven to be the most popular choice due to its noninvasiveness, low cost and the advantage of being employed with minimal effort even in home environments. In this Ph. D. thesis, we deal with two different BCI paradigms, namely the Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) and the Motor Imagery (MI) paradigm. It is the scope of this thesis to design signal analytic pipelines for EEG data that will decode the users\u2019 intention/choice. The implementations must be characterized by swift and robust responses, characteristics of paramount importance for all BCI implementations. To this end, the SSVEP paradigm was first examined and a novel decoding scheme based on discriminative vector quantization (DVQ) followed by a subsequent nearest-template classification rule was designed. Additionally, the proposed decoder was designed with the scope of avoiding premature activations (ie false positives) by associating each prediction with a confidence-level that should exceed a threshold (estimated upon training data \u2026",

In the first stage of analysis, hubs were detected in the FCGs based on local and global efficiency. The probability of each node to be identified as a hub was estimated. This defined a topographic function that showed widespread distribution with prominence over the frontal brain regions for both local and global efficiency. Hubs consistent across time were identified via a summarization technique and found to locate over forehead. In the second stage of analysis, the modular structure of each single FCG was delineated. The derived time-dependent signatures of functional structure were compared in a systematic way revealing fluctuations modulated by frequency. Interestingly, the evolution of functional connectivity can be described via abrupt transitions between states, best described as short-lasting bimodal functional segregations. Based on a distance function that compares clusterings, we discovered that these segregations are recurrent. Entropic measures further revealed that the apparent fluctuations are subject to intrinsic constraints and that order emerges from spatially extended interactions.",

There are a few studies concerning the implications in the context of BCIs, but its potential for establishing a communication channel in patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders remains totally unexplored. We investigate, here, this possibility by estimating the time-resolved phase connectivity patterns induced during a motor imagery (MI) task and adopting a supervised learning scheme to recover the subject\u2019s intention from the streaming data. Electroencephalographic activity from six patients suffering from neuromuscular disease (NMD) and six healthy individuals was recorded during two randomly alternating, externally cued, MI tasks (clenching either left or right fist) and a rest condition. The metric of Phase locking value (PLV) was used to describe the functional coupling between all recording sites. The functional connectivity patterns and the associate network organization was first compared between the two cohorts. Next, working at the level of individual patients, we trained support vector machines (SVMs) to discriminate between \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d based on different instantiations of connectivity patterns (depending on the encountered brain rhythm and the temporal interval). Finally, we designed and realized a novel brain decoding scheme that could interpret the intention from streaming connectivity patterns, based on an ensemble of SVMs. The group-level analysis revealed increased phase synchrony and richer network organization in patients.

In line with this motivation, we use data with visual stimuli from a typical subject that participated in different experiments that were previously analyzed with traditional methods. The earlier studies identified well-defined changes in specific brain areas at specific latencies related to attention, properties of stimuli, and tasks demands. Using a recently introduced methodology, we track the event-related changes in network organization, at source space level, thus providing a more global and complete view of the stages of processing associated with the regional changes in activity.

While previous studies have examined isolated aspects of cellular and synaptic organization, an integrated functional index of the cortical microcircuit is still lacking. Here we aimed to provide such an index, in the form of spontaneously recurring periods of persistent network activity -or Up states- recorded in mouse cortical slices. These coordinated network dynamics emerge through the orchestrated regulation of multiple cellular and synaptic elements and represent the default activity of the cortical microcircuit. To explore whether spontaneous Up states can capture developmental changes in intracortical networks we obtained local field potential recordings throughout the mouse lifespan. Two independent and complementary methodologies revealed that Up state activity is systematically modified by age, with the largest changes occurring during early development and adolescence. To explore possible regional heterogeneities we also compared the development of Up states in two distinct cortical areas and show that primary somatosensory cortex develops at a faster pace than primary motor cortex. Our findings suggest that in vitro Up states can serve as a functional index of cortical development and differentiation and can provide a baseline for comparing experimental and/or genetic mouse models.",

The approach is based on conceptually simple geometrical ideas and enables the convergence of pattern analysis and non-linear time series analysis.Methods: Classical steps for analyzing the STs by waveform are first employed and the ST-analysis is transferred to a multidimensional space, the feature space, the geometry of which is systematically studied via multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques giving rise to semantic maps. The structure in the feature space characterizes the trial-to-trial variability and this is utilized to probe functional connectivity between two brain areas. The underlying dynamic process responsible for the emerged structure can be described by a multidimensional trajectory in the feature space. This in turn enables the detection of \u2026",

In the case of transient VEPs (TVEPs) brain responses are never treated individually, i.e. on a single-trial (ST) basis, due to their poor signal quality. Therefore their main characteristic, which is the emergence during early latencies, remains unexplored.Following a pattern-analytic methodology, we investigated the possibility of using single-trial TVEP responses to differentiate between the different spatial locations where a particular visual stimulus appeared and decide whether it was attended or unattended by the subject.Covert spatial attention modulates the temporal patterning of TVEPs in such a way that a brief ST-segment, from a single synthesized sensor, is sufficient for a Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) system to decode subject's intention \u2026",

The scope of this work was to build a methodological framework for assessing developmental changes in intrinsic cortical activity patterns obtained from LFP recordings of spontaneously active mouse brain slices. To overcome the complexity seen in the recorded signals, which are characterized by a high variability in Up-state waveforms, we resorted to a representation that preserves the dynamic invariants of the underlying network and built a pattern-analytic scheme that includes three pipelined stages.

This new approach enhances the detectability of Error Related Potentials by projecting the spatial information of signals into a new space where samples of the same class tend to form local neighborhoods.

The control of size, shape and density of ZnO nanowires is of fundamental significance in modern science and engineering because the properties of ZnO highly depend on its morphology and structure. Doping is an important way to tailor the properties of semiconductor materials and among all Cu doped ZnO is very important recently because of its interesting properties, such as p-type, room temperature ferromagnetism and high efficient solar cells (SCs). We have prepared 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8% of Cu doped ZnO nanowires using sol-gel spin coating techniques on the glass substrate. The coating solution was prepared using Zinc acetate as the dissolved precursor material, with the molarity of 0.2 M and 2-methoxyethanol as the solvent, and the Copper acetate as the doping material. The stabilizer was mono-ethanolamine, and the molarity ratio of the stabilizer and zinc acetate was 1. In this research work we investigate the structure using micro Raman Spectroscopy and Micro-PL techniques of these nanowires transferred to a Si/SiO2 substrate.",

However, the relevant features are not readily apparent and accessible. To mine informative latent representations from multichannel EEG recordings, we propose a novel differentiable EEG decoding pipeline consisting of learnable filters and a pre-determined feature extraction module. Specifically, we introduce filters parameterized by generalized Gaussian functions that offer a smooth derivative for stable end-to-end model training and allow for learning interpretable features. For the feature module, we use signal magnitude and functional connectivity. We demonstrate the utility of our model towards emotion recognition from EEG signals on the SEED dataset, as well as on a new EEG dataset of unprecedented size (i.e., 763 subjects), where we identify consistent trends of music perception and related individual differences. The discovered features align with previous neuroscience studies and offer new insights, such as marked differences in the functional connectivity profile between left and right temporal areas during music listening. This agrees with the respective specialisation of the temporal lobes regarding music perception proposed in the literature.",
