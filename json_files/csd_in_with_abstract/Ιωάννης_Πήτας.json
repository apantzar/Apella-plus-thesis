            "Abstract": "In this paper we propose a visual speech recognition network based on support vector machines. Each word of the dictionary is described as a temporal sequence of visemes. Each viseme is described by a support vector machine, and the temporal character of speech is modeled by integrating the support vector machines as nodes into a Viterbi decoding lattice. Experiments conducted on a small visual speech recognition task show a word recognition rate on the level of the best rates previously reported, even without training the state transition probabilities in the Viterbi lattice and using very simple features. This proves the suitability of support vector machines for visual speech recognition.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for estimating 3D head pose in single-view video sequences. Following initialization by a face detector, a tracking technique that utilizes a 3D deformable surface model to approximate the image intensity is used to track the face in the video sequence. Head pose estimation is performed by using a feature vector which is a by-product of the equations that govern the deformation of the surface model used in the tracking. The afore-mentioned vector is used for training support vector machines (SVM) in order to estimate the 3D head pose. The proposed method was applied to IDIAP head pose estimation database. The obtained results show that the proposed method can achieve an accuracy of 82% if angles are estimated in 10deg increments and 75% if angle are estimated in 5deg increments.",

Efficient approaches for detecting three typical artifacts, sharpness mismatch, synchronization mismatch and stereoscopic window violation, are presented in detail. Sharpness mismatch is estimated by measuring the width deviations of edge pairs in depth planes. Synchronization mismatch is detected based on the motion inconsistencies of feature points between the stereoscopic channels in a short time frame. Stereoscopic window violation is detected, using connected component analysis, when objects hit the vertical frame boundaries while being in front of the virtual screen. For experiments, test sequences were created in a professional studio environment and state-of-the-art metrics were used for evaluating the proposed approaches. The experimental results show \u2026",

Due to changes in illumination, visual angle and facial expressions, the variability of facial features in their appearance is high. A robust approach to facial feature detection has to handle these variations. In this framework, we present an approach for the extraction of eyebrows, eyes, nostrils, mouth and chin. Our approach for facial feature extraction is based on the observation that facial features differ from the rest of the face because of their low brightness. Thus, we detect facial feature candidates by evaluating the topographic greylevel relief of the face region. Based on vertical symmetry, distances between facial features and the assessment of each facial feature, we choose the best face constellation. Incomplete face constellations are considered as well \u2026",

As such, filters find applications in telecommunica tions, radar, sonar, remote sensing, geophysical signal processing, image pro cessing, and computer vision. Numerous authors have considered deterministic and statistical approaches for the study of passive, active, digital, multidimen sional, and adaptive filters. Most of the filters considered were linear although the theory of nonlinear filters is developing rapidly, as it is evident by the numerous research papers and a few specialized monographs now available. Our research interests in this area created opportunity for cooperation and co authored publications during the past few years in many nonlinear filter families described in this book. As a result of this cooperation and a visit from John Pitas on a research leave at the University of Toronto in September 1988, the idea for this book was first conceived. The difficulty in writing such a mono graph was that the area seemed fragmented and no general theory was available to encompass the many different kinds of filters presented in the literature. However, the similarities of some families of nonlinear filters and the need for such a monograph providing a broad overview of the whole area made the pro ject worthwhile. The result is the book now in your hands, typeset at the Department of Electrical Engineering of the University of Toronto during the summer of 1989.",

The presented video analysis focuses on extracting multiple low-level content descriptors that once combined, enhance the shot boundary detection results achieved when each descriptor is considered individually. Static feature analysis provides the system with the bin-wise differences of color vector histograms and also with the color frame differences, both computed between successive frames. Furthermore, dynamic feature analysis yields binwise differences of motion vector histograms calculated on successive frames too. Static and dynamic features are combined to form 4D feature vectors characterizing a frame in the temporal dimension. Shot cuts are detected via the implementation of a supervised Support Vector Machine classifier so that feature vectors are assigned to two classes, one representing shot cuts and another representing in-shot information. The method proves to behave satisfactorily leading to remarkable recall and precision values.",

Despite the simplicity of 3F2N SNE, no similar method already exists in the literature. To evaluate the performance of our proposed SNE, we created three large-scale synthetic datasets (easy, medium and hard) using 24 3D mesh models, each of which is used to generate 1800\u20132500 pairs of depth images (resolution: 480 \u00d7 640 pixels) and the corresponding ground-truth surface normal maps from different views. 3F2N SNE demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all other existing \u2026",

According to the definition there are two important characteristics of watermarking. First, information embedding should not cause perceptible changes to the host medium. Second, the message should be related to the host medium. In this sense, the watermarking techniques form a subset of information hiding techniques, which also include cases where the hidden information is not related to the host medium. This chapter reviews the main application domains of watermarking. Properties and classification schemes of watermarking techniques are presented followed by the basic functional modules of a watermarking scheme. Further, the principles and techniques devised for two major application areas, namely copyright protection and authentication are discussed.",

            "Abstract": "Learning from examples uses specific instances (examples and counterexamples) to produce general rules. It is a convenient learning scheme in cases where the process of interviewing human experts and analyzing and formalizing their decision is very difficult or time consuming. The system proposed is capable of obtaining the rules that fit a set of examples and counterexamples based on the minimal entropy (ME) criterion. The system proposed can also set various parameters of the rule (e.g., thresholds) in such a way that entropy is minimized. The system can also handle incremental learning from examples. Applications of the proposed system to seismic image analysis are included.< >",

First, a face detector is applied to detect the facial region, and the edge map of this region is extracted. A vector pointing to the closest edge pixel is then assigned to every pixel. Length and slope information for these vectors is used to detect the eyes. For eye center localization, intensity information is used. The proposed method can work on low-resolution images and has been tested on two face databases with very good results.",

            "Abstract": "Aerial cinematography relying on camera-equipped umanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, has revolutionized media production during the past years. Autonomous UAV function-alities are already being employed to a degree, in a manner structured mainly around visual target tracking. From a cinematographic point of view, the desired shot type (i.e., Close-Up, Long Shot, etc.) is the most important factor affecting the artistic result. Achieving a specific shot type depends on the target-to-camera distance and the camera focal length. However, the interaction between UAV/camera motion trajectory (e.g., Orbit, Chase, etc.) and the visual tracker requirements constrains the range of feasible shot types at each time instance. In this paper, which extends previous work, these constraints are explored for a number of standard UAV/camera motion types, UAV shot types are classified and rules regarding shot feasibility \u2026",

The approach proves rather efficient against many kinds of distortions, such as linear and nonlinear filtering, JPEG compression, scaling, cropping and rotation.",

The classification of the sample under examination to one of the 7 possible classes of facial expressions, ie anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral, is performed using multiclass SVMs defined in the previously mentioned pseudo-Euclidean. The experiments were performed using the Cohn-Kanade database and the results show that the above mentioned system can achieve an accuracy of 95.6%.",

The scope of this work is to define requirements for a system aimed at supporting a real professional production based on an ideal multi-drone system. The rationale of this choice is that at this stage MULTIDRONE wants to produce a complete overview of the challenges, limits, constraints and possibilities offered by the implied technologies (eg, autonomous flight systems, computer vision, automated control, efficient human-in-the-loop tools, integration with media production tools and processes) and put them in the context of real industrial processes and use cases. The advantages of this approach are manifold: 1) it helps identify long term strategic objectives of technology development even beyond the project's lifetime; 2) it allows for a better design of the project's experimental cases making them more in line with the future industrialisation of the system and more useful in general; 3) it helps in identifying the key technological, organisational and regulatory/legal concerns on which to focus short-to-mid term development in the project. In order to derive requirements we started from the definition of a layered approach made up of three fundamental layers: usage scenarios (the objectives), media production (the process through which achieving the objectives) and system platform (the infrastructure enabling and supporting the process). For each of these layers we conducted a further breakdown analysis to identify domains and sub-domains, each of \u2026",

The strength of audio signal modifications is limited by the necessity to produce an output signal that is perceptually similar to the original one. The watermarking method presented here does not require the use of the original signal for watermark detection. The watermark signal is generated using a key, i.e., a single number known only to the copyright owner. Watermark embedding depends on the audio signal amplitude and frequency in a way that minimizes the audibility of the watermark signal. The embedded watermark is robust to common audio signal manipulations like MPEG audio coding, cropping, time shifting, filtering, resampling, and requantization.",

In this framework, a variational Bayesian algorithm is employed, where prior knowledge about the object displacement (movement) is incorporated via a prior distribution. This displacement information is obtained in a preprocessing step, where object displacement is estimated via feature extraction and matching. In parallel, disparity information is extracted and utilized in the same framework. The improvements introduced by the proposed methodology in terms of tracking accuracy are quantified through experimental analysis.",

Linear LVQ is not the optimal estimator for non-Gaussian multivariate data distributions. Furthermore, it is not robust either in the case of outliers or in the case of erroneous decisions. The novel LVQs use multivariate ordering in order to obtain location estimators that are robust and that provide superior and, in certain cases, optimal performance for non-Gaussian multivariate distributions. A special case of the novel LVQ class is the marginal median LVQ (MM LVQ), which uses the marginal median as multivariate estimator of location.",

The goal is to find subgroups of closely related data samples (clusters) in a set of unlabeled data. Kernel k-Means is a state of the art clustering algorithm. However, in contrast to clustering algorithms that can work using only a limited percentage of the data at a time, Kernel k-Means is a global clustering algorithm. It requires the computation of the kernel matrix, which takes O (n 2 d) time and O (n 2) space in memory. As datasets grow larger, the application of Kernel k-Means becomes infeasible on a single computer, a fact that strongly suggests a distributed approach. In this paper, we present such an approach to the Kernel k-Means clustering algorithm, in order to make its application to a large number of samples feasible and, thus, achieve high performance clustering results on very big datasets.

In the clustering step that follows a new discriminant space is defined by processing this subset and both the test and training data are projected to this space. This process is repeated until one final cluster is selected and the most similar, to the test face, face class contained is set as the identity match.

These filters include circular mean, median and a-trimmed mean filters. Emphasis is given to a circular median filter for which the approximate output pdf as well as other interesting properties are derived. The effectiveness of angular estimators of location in noise filtering is studied in simulations involving color images.

Based on this representation, simple classification algorithms, such as the nearest subclass centroid, provide high classification accuracy. A three step iterative optimization procedure for choosing statemes, optimal discriminant subspace and optimal sequence class representation in the final decision space is proposed. The classification procedure is fast and accurate. The proposed method has \u2026",

Such an analysis indicates whether bagging, a method for generating multiple versions of a classifier from bootstrap samples of a training set, and combining their outcomes by majority voting, is expected to improve the accuracy of the classifier. We estimate the bias, variance, and aggregation effect by using bootstrap smoothing techniques when support vector machines are applied to face detection in the AT & T face database and we demonstrate that support vector machines are stable classifiers. Accordingly, bagging is not expected to improve their face detection accuracy.",

Watermark casting is performed in the spatial domain by slightly modifying the intensity of randomly selected image pixels. Watermark detection does not require the existence of the original image and is carried out by comparing the mean intensity value of the marked pixels against that of the pixels not marked. Statistical hypothesis testing is used for this purpose. Pixel modifications can be done in such a way that the watermark is resistant to JPEG compression and lowpass filtering.

The field of machine learning has matured considerably in both methodology and real-world application domains and has become particularly important for solution of problems in signal processing. As reflected in this collection, machine learning for signal processing combines many ideas from adaptive signal/image processing, learning theory and models, and statistics in order to solve complex real-world signal processing applications. High quality across such topical diversity can only be maintained through a rigorous and selective review process. This volume contains 73 papers presented at the Workshop, including 70 accepted submissions, an overview paper on feature selection for genomics by Sun-Yuan Kung, our plenary speaker, and two papers from the winners of the Data Analysis Competition. The program included papers in the following areas: genomic signal processing, pattern recognition and classification, image and video processing, blind signal processing, models, learning algorithms, and applications of machine learning. The program featured a Special Session on Genomic Signal Processing, chaired by Prof. Man-Wai Mak from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong. The session included four refereed papers by leading experts in the field.

Certain points that are involved into creating the facial action units (FAUs) movements are selected. Their geometrical displacement information, defined as the coordinates' difference between the last and the first frame, is extracted to be the input to a bank of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers that are used to recognize either the six basic facial expressions or eight chosen FAUs.

Identification of the position of each camera with respect to the subject's body is achieved by a procedure based on morphological operations and the proportions of the human body. Binary body masks from frames of all cameras, consistently arranged through the previous procedure, are concatenated to produce the so-called multi-view binary mask. These masks are rescaled and vectorized to create feature vectors in the input space. Fuzzy vector quantization is performed to associate input feature vectors with movement representations and linear discriminant analysis is used to map movements in a low dimensionality discriminant feature space. Experimental results show that the method can achieve very satisfactory recognition rates.",

Thus, it is capable of handling faces in different orientations and poses (frontal, profile, intermediate). To avoid false  detections, a number of decision criteria are employed. Tracking is performed using a variant of the well-known Kanade- Lucas-Tomasi tracker, while occlusion is handled through a re-detection stage. Manual intervention is allowed to assist  both modules if required. In manual mode, the system can track any object of interest, so long as there are enough features  to track.",

In case that the unknown person performs more than one movements, a multi-modal algorithm combines the results of the individual classifiers to yield the final decision for the id of the unknown human. Using a publicly available database, we provide promising results regarding the discrimination power of the different movements for the human identification task, as well as we indicate that the combination of the individual classifiers may increase the robustness of the human recognition algorithm.",

A novel data representation is obtained by applying nonlinear class-specific data projection to a discriminant feature space, where the data belonging to the class under consideration are enforced to be close to their class representation, while the data belonging to the remaining classes are enforced to be as far as possible from it. A class is represented by an optimized class vector, enhancing class discrimination in the resulting feature space. An iterative optimization scheme is proposed to this end, where both the optimal nonlinear data projection and the optimal class representation are determined in each optimization step. The proposed approach is tested on three problems relating to human behaviour analysis: face recognition, facial expression recognition and human action recognition. Experimental results denote the effectiveness of the proposed approach, since the proposed Class-specific Reference Discriminant Analysis outperforms Kernel Discriminant Analysis, Kernel Spectral Regression and Class-specific Kernel Discriminant Analysis, as well as Support Vector Machine-based classification, in most cases.",

Four cases are presented to demonstrate the potential use of DSR in the detection of vertical root fractures in endodontically treated teeth. After the digital subtractions had been carried out, a dark line in the body of the roots was distinguishable, raising the possibility of the presence of a vertical root fracture.

Their computation is relatively fast, because it requires only comparisons. The author presents an algorithm that requires a significantly smaller number of comparisons and is significantly faster than the traditional approach to order statistics filtering.

Moreover we introduce custom weight functions based on object properties. Thus, we can be more specific on what are the important parts of the object to be subsampled.",

            "Abstract": "Six basic facial expressions are investigated when the human face is partially occluded, ie when the eyes and eyebrows or the mouth regions are occluded. Such occlusions occur when a person wears glasses (eg in VR application) or a mouth mask (eg in medical application). More specifically, we are interested in finding the part of the face that contains sufficient information in order to correctly classify these six expressions. Two facial image databases are employed in our experiments. Each image from the database is convolved with a set of Gabor filters having various orientations and frequencies. The new feature vectors are classified by using a maximum correlation classifier and the cosine similarity measure approaches. We find that, overall, the facial expression recognition method provides robustness against partial occlusion, the classification accuracy only decreasing from 89.7%(no occlusion) to 84%(eyes region occlusion) and 83.5%(mouth region occlusion) for the first database and from 94.5%(no occlusion) to 91.5%(eyes region occlusion) and 87.2%(mouth region occlusion) for the second database, respectively.",

In order to classify the expression of a test face to one of seven pre-determined facial expression classes, multiple two-class classification tasks are carried out. For each such task, a unique set of features is identified that is enhanced, in terms of its ability to help produce a proper separation between the two specific classes. The selection of these sets of features is accomplished by making use of a class separability measure that is utilized in an iterative process. Fisher's linear discriminant is employed in order to produce the separation between each pair of classes and train each two-class classifier. In order to combine the classification results from all two-class classifiers, the `voting' classifier-decision fusion process is employed. The standard JAFFE database is utilized in order to evaluate the performance of this algorithm. Experimental results \u2026",

Given monocular or stereoscopic 3D images, depicted scene/object geometry in the form of depth maps can be successfully estimated, while modern Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures can accurately predict semantic masks on an image. In several scenarios, both tasks are required at once, leading to a need for combined semantic 3D world mapping methods. In the wake of modern autonomous systems, DNNs that simultaneously handle both tasks have arisen, exploiting machine/deep learning to save up considerably on computational resources and enhance performance, as these tasks can mutually benefit from each other. A great application area is 3D road scene modeling and semantic segmentation, eg, for an autonomous car to identify and localize in 3D space visible pavement regions (marked as \u201croad\u201d) that are essential for autonomous car driving.

In this paper, we propose a graph theory-based algorithm for tracing the curve directly to eliminate the decomposition needs. This approach obviously improves the compression performance, as longer line segments can be used. We tune our method further by selecting optimal turns at junctions during tracing the curve. We assign a polygon approximation to the curve which consists of letters coming from an alphabet of line segments. We also discuss how other application fields can take advantage of the provided curve description scheme.",

We describe a video representation scheme that exploits the enriched visual and disparity information that is available for such data. Each stereoscopic video is represented by multiple vectors, evaluated on video locations corresponding to different disparity zones. By using these vectors, multiple action descriptions can be determined that either correspond to specific disparity zones, or combine information appearing in different disparity zones in the classification phase. Experimental results denote that the proposed approach enhances action classification performance, when compared to the standard approach, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Hollywood 3D database designed for the recognition of complex actions in unconstrained environments.",

            "Abstract": "Any colour can be reproduced by mixing an appropriate set of three primary colours (1)(usually red, green and blue). Therefore, any colour image can be considered as a twodimensional three-channel sequence. Furthermore, in cases of constant brightness a two-variable scheme can be developed by factoring out luminance while keeping only the chromaticity attributes eg, huc and saturation, thus projecting the three-dimensional colour space on a plane. In this case, we can treat colour image as a two-dimensional, two-channel sequence. Therefore, colour image processing is essentially multichannel two-dimensional signal processing. Until recently, little attention was paid to the multichannel nature of colour images. Thus, black and white (BW) image processing techniques were applied to each channel separately. Later, transformation techniques (eg, the KarhuneN-Loeve transformation) have been used to decorrelate the three channels in order to apply BW image processing techniques afterwards. Although this is a valid approach, we think that a more natural way to deal with colour image processing is to apply multichannel signal processing techniques.In the following, the use of ordering of multivariate data in multichannel signal processing is investigated, with particular application to colour image processing. We shall define a number of nonlinear multichannel digital filters that are based on multivariate data ordering and we shall investigate their properties in colour image processing/analysis and in motion field processing.",

Since the same human body representations, e.g., body silhouettes, can be employed for both tasks, there is a need to automatically create privacy preserving representations. We have applied 2D Gaussian filtering to obfuscate the human body silhouettes that implicate information about the person ID. We have experimentally showed how the use of filtering affects the person identification and action recognition performance in different camera setups formed by an arbitrary number of cameras.

The extrapolation propagates backward the noise present in the measurements, so that the quality of the final image is degraded, unless statistical restoration techniques are used. Another source of degradation of the image is the insufficient knowledge of some properties of the medium such as the wave propagation velocity. Bayesian estimation techniques are proposed for the problems and are shown to be superior to known methods such as direct inversion or Wiener filtering. Their superiority comes from the fact that they utilize all the a priori information available and also provide means to estimate characteristics of the media. Most of them are \u2026",

This is also true for metal-binding proteins, ie proteins that bind one or more metal atoms necessary for their biological function. With regard to metal-interacting residues, the question arising is whether these interactions apply additional evolutionary constraints and to what extent. We try to answer this question for a subset of metal-binding-proteins, namely zinc-binding proteins, which play an important role in a number of biological processes, as exemplified by the tumor-suppressor protein p53. Our results shows significantly higher evolutionary pressure on zinc-interacting residues, a result which can be used in a number of other studies, including zinc-binding site prediction.",

Metrics for both the initialisation of the region to be tracked as well as for measuring the performance of the tracking algorithm are presented. The metrics variations may be interpreted as a quantitative estimate of changes in the tracking region due to occlusion, sudden movement or deformation of the tracked object. Performance metrics based on the Kullback\u2013Leibler distance and normalised correlation were also added for comparison purposes. The proposed approach was tested on an object tracking scheme using multiple feature point correspondences. Experimental results have shown that mutual information can effectively characterise object appearance and reappearance in many computer vision applications.",

Following initialization by a face detector, a tracking technique that utilizes a 3-D deformable surface model to approximate the facial image intensity is used to track the face in the video sequence. Head pose estimation is performed by using a feature vector which is a byproduct of the equations that govern the deformation of the surface model used in the tracking. The afore-mentioned vector is used as input in a radial basis function interpolation network in order to estimate the 3-D head pose. The proposed method was applied to IDIAP head pose estimation database. The obtained results show that the method can estimate the head direction vector with very good accuracy.",

Recognition of frontal poses is required as a preprocessing step to face analysis algorithms (eg face or facial expression recognition) that can operate only on frontal views. A novel frontal facial pose recognition technique that is based on discriminant image splitting for feature extraction is presented in this paper. Spatially homogeneous and discriminant regions for each facial class are produced. The classical image splitting technique is used in order to determine those regions. Thus, each facial class is characterized by a unique region pattern which consists of homogeneous and discriminant 2-D regions. The mean intensities of these regions are used as features for the classification task. The proposed method has been tested on data from the XM2VTS facial database with very satisfactory results.",

From these teeth, the pulp tissues of 5 were removed, fixed in formalin solution, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Serial cross sections 5ym thick were taken from 3 of the above mentioned pulpal tissues and stained with CD34 according to the immunohistochemical ABC technique, while the rest 2 were stained with CD34 and Cy5 by means of immunofluorescence after serial cross sectioning of 10 \u03bcm. 5 of the 10 teeth were fixed, decalcified, serial cross sectioned (30 \u03bcm thickness) and stained with eosin. The physical sections were examined under 2 types of confocal laser microscope. Serial images were taken for each section, alignment of the images was followed and finally 3-dimensional reconstructions of the pulpal vessels were achieved. The combined use of immunofluorescence, confocal microscope and automatic segmentation proved to be a useful method for the detailed study of pulpal vasculature. The above method provides deep knowledge of the form and spatial relationship even of the smallest pulpal blood vessels with neighbouring structures like odontoblasts, which are essential for the fully understanding of their role and function within the dental pulp.",

Person identification, activity recognition, and viewing angle specification results are obtained for all the available cameras independently.

            "Abstract": "In this paper a novel method for human movement representation and recognition is proposed. A movement type is regarded as a unique combination of basic movement patterns, the so-called dynemes. The fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm is used to identify the dynemes in the input space and allow the expression of a posture in terms of these dynemes. In the so-called dyneme space, the sparse posture representations of a movement are combined to represent the movement as a single point in that space, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is further employed to increase movement type discrimination and compactness of representation. This method allows for simple Mahalanobis or cosine distance comparison of movements, taking implicitly into account time shifts and internal speed variations, and, thus, aiding the design of a real-time movement recognition algorithm.",

It is based on the morphological signal decomposition, a procedure that is used to model a facial image region as a sum of components. During the procedure, partial sums of components create a sequence of reconstructed images which starts with a crude approximation of the facial region that recursively becomes finer. More specifically, a feature vector is created at each node of a sparse grid superimposed on the facial area by concatenating the gray level values of the reconstructed images at the grid node position. When a candidate person claims the identity of a reference person, a variant of dynamic link matching, the so-called morphological signal decomposition\u2014dynamic link architecture, is applied to yield a matching error between the reference grid and a variable grid that is built over the facial image region of the candidate person \u2026",

This study presents a unique local facial feature descriptor, the Local Arc Pattern (LAP) for facial expression recognition. Feature is obtained from a local 5* 5 pixels region by comparing the gray color intensity values surrounding the referenced pixel to formulate two separate binary patterns for the referenced pixel. Each face is divided into equal sized blocks and histograms of LAP codes from those blocks are concatenated to build the feature vector for classification. The recognition performance of proposed method was evaluated on popular Japanese Female facial expression dataset using support vector machine as the classifier.

Our experiments show that after printing, ten times of repeated copying, followed by scanning, the hidden data can still be extracted without a single bit error.

Experiments are carried out to validate the feasibility of the aforementioned approach by using ground-truth indicator functions determined by human observers on six different movies.

A video summarization algorithm is typically fed an input video and expected to extract a set of important key-frames which represent the entire content, convey semantic meaning and are significantly more concise than the original input. The most wide-spread approach relies on video frame clustering and extraction of the frames closest to the cluster centroids as key-frames. Such a process, although efficient, offloads the burden of semantic scene content modelling exclusively to the employed video frame description/representation scheme, while summarization itself is approached simply as a distance-based data partitioning problem.

The expressions of the SUGC's projection axis are derived from two cross-sections projected onto the image plane. Based on these axes we derive the SUGC localization in the camera coordinate system. We explain how we can find a virtual image representation when the intersection of the two axes is matched to the image center. We analyze the perspective distortions when flattening a scene which is mapped on a SUGC. We evaluate the lower and the upper bounds of the necessary number of views in order to represent the entire scene from a SUGC, by considering the distortions produced by perspective projection.

Audio analysis focuses on the segmentation of the audio source into three types of semantic primitives, i.e. silence, speech and music. Further processing on speech segments aims at locating speaker change instants. Video analysis attempts to segment the video source into shots, without the segmentation being affected by camera pans, zoom-ins/outs or significantly high object motion. Results from single source segmentation are in some cases suboptimal. Audio-visual interaction achieves to either enhance single source findings or extract high level semantic information.

Subsequently, two-class discriminant analysis is applied on the SFVs to produce salient discriminant hyper-planes (SDHs), which are used to train the corresponding two-class classifiers.

This linear model is then utilized to reduce the redundant information in the left and right road images. The right image is also transformed into the left perspective view, which greatly enhances the road surface similarity between the two images. Finally, the processed stereo images and their disparity maps are concatenated to create a set of 3D images, which are then utilized to train our neural network.

            "Abstract": "In this paper a novel view-invariant human identification method is presented. A multi-camera setup is used to capture the human body from different observation angles. Binary body masks from all the cameras are concatenated to produce the so-called multi-view binary masks. These masks are rescaled and vectorized to create feature vectors in the input space. A view-invariant human body representation is obtained by exploiting the circular shift invariance property of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Fuzzy vector quantization (FVQ) is performed to associate human body representation with movement representations and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to map movements in a low dimensionality discriminant feature space. Two human identification schemes, a movement-specific and a movement-independent one, are evaluated. Experimental results show that the method can achieve \u2026",

This study measured residual gastric fluid in 365 pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia or sedation, and compared gastric volumes in patients receiving oral contrast material to a group who received intravenous contrast medium alone. The mean volume of oral contrast material administered was 18.1 ml/kg with a wide degree of variability in administered quantity (range 1.5\u201382.8 ml/kg). The median gastric fluid volume 1 h after completing oral contrast was significantly higher in patients receiving oral contrast medium than in patients who received only IV contrast medium (0.38 ml/kg vs 0.15 ml/kg; P< 0.005). While 49% of the oral contrast group exceeded 0.4 ml/kg of gastric volume, only 11% of the IV-contrast-alone group had gastric \u2026",

AVDP was designed by having mainly single channel videos in mind. Thus, in order to utilize it for the description of stereoscopic video and multichannel audio content, a number of implementation decisions, that cater to the particularities of such content (storage of stereoscopic quality information, relations between entities in the various channels etc) had to be taken and will be presented in this contribution. Examples of using AVDP to describe the results of analysis algorithms on stereo video and multichannel audio content will be presented. Additionally, several Classification Schemes used in the proposed framework will be discussed, since some terms may be useful in other applications. Finally, the contribution will include a discussion on possible extensions/modifications of the MPEG-7 standard or the AVDP profile to better cover the needs of stereoscopic and mutiview content description. The proposed framework was devised within 3DTVS (3DTV Content Search), a European FP7 project that aims at devising 3DTV audiovisual content analysis description, indexing, search and browsing methods and incorporating such functionalities in 3D audio-visual content archives.",

Wavefield measurements recorded on the surface of an object are inverted according to the wave equation to give an \"image\" of the interior of the object. This inversion usually enhances the noise present in the measurements and degrades the quality of the final image. Another source of degradation of the image is the insufficient knowledge of some properties of the medium, such as the wave propagation velocity. The aim of this paper is to use estimation theory to determine good estimates of the velocity and of the object image from known wavefield measurements.",

Taking as an input an audio-visual video sequence of the user\u2019s face, the MCM generates a facial animation, in which the prosody and the facial expressions of emotions can either be reproduced or amplified. The user can thus simulate an emotion and see almost instantly the animation it produced, like with a regular mirror. In addition, the MCM also enables to amplify the emotions of selected parts of the input video sequence, leaving other parts unchanged. It therefore constitutes a novel approach to the design of very expressive facial animation, as the affective content of the animation can be modified by post-processing operations.",

The modular nature of the model makes it adaptable as a whole or per module, to any corresponding data of a specific human by means of a Finite Element Method (FEM).

Current industry practices are formalized by presenting a UAV shot-type taxonomy composed of framing shot types, single-UAV camera motion types, and multiple-UAV camera motion types. Visually pleasing combinations of framing shot types and camera motion types are identified, while the presented camera motion types are modeled geometrically and graded into distinct energy consumption classes and required technology complexity levels for autonomous capture. Two specific strategies are prescribed, namely focal length compensation and multidrone compensation, for partially overcoming a number of issues arising in UAV live outdoor event coverage, deemed as the most complex UAV \u2026",

Robust segmentation of faces out of complex scenes is done based on color and shape information. Additionally, face candidates are verified by searching for facial features in the interior of the face. As interesting facial features we employ eyebrows, eyes, nostrils, mouth and chin. We consider incomplete feature constellations as well. If a face and its features are detected once reliably, we track the face contour and the features over time. Face contour tracking is done by using deformable models like snakes. Facial feature tracking is performed by block matching. The success of our approach was verified by evaluating 38 different color image sequences, containing features as beard, glasses and changing facial expressions.",

The proposed approach utilizes image resemblance for deciding whether a test image has been replicated from a certain original or not. We formulate replica detection as a classification problem and show that we can optimize efficiency on a per query basis by dynamically solving a reduced multiclass problem. For this purpose, we investigate the effective coupling of multidimensional indexing and machine learning approaches and we aim to achieve replica detection through the training of classifiers with distortions expected in a replica. Visual descriptors are indexed using an R-tree based multidimensional structure for fast image retrieval. Cases unsuccessfully handled by the R-tree are resolved by a multiclass classifier operating on the transformed feature space that results from the application of linear discriminant \u2026",

The second one claims that a more appropriate face representation is given by a sparse code, where only a small fraction of the neural cells corresponding to face encoding is activated. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that the HVS performs face analysis (encoding, storing, face recognition, facial expression recognition) in a structured and hierarchical way, where both representations have their own contribution and goal. According to neuropsychological experiments, it seems that encoding for face recognition, relies on holistic image representation, while a sparse image representation is used for facial expression analysis and classification.

The problem of face verification is considered as a two-class problem (genuine versus impostor class). The typical Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) gives only one or two projections in a two-class problem. This is a very strict limitation to the search of discriminant dimensions. As for the FLDA for N class problems (N is greater than two) the transformation is not person specific. In order to remedy these limitations of FLDA, exploit the individuality of human faces and take into consideration the fact that the distribution of facial images, under different viewpoints, illumination variations and facial expression is highly complex and non-linear, novel kernel discriminant algorithms are proposed. The new methods are tested in the face verification problem using the XM2VTS database where it is verified that they outperform other \u2026",

Recently, a discriminant NMF method that incorporates Linear Discriminant Analysis criteria and achieves an efficient decomposition of the provided data to its discriminant parts has been proposed. However, this approach poses several limitations since it assumes that the underline data distribution forms compact sets which is often unrealistic. To remedy this limitation we regard that data inside each class form various number of clusters and apply a Clustering based Discriminant Analysis. The proposed method combines appropriate discriminant constraints in the NMF decomposition cost function in order to address the problem of finding discriminant projections that enhance class separability in the reduced dimensional projection space.

An image watermarking algorithm has two stages: signature casting (embedding) and signature detection. In the first stage it embeds an identifying label in the image. This is recognized in the second stage. The proposed algorithm has two processing steps. In the first step certain pixel blocks are selected using a set of parameters while in the second step a DCT coefficient constraint is embedded in the selected blocks. Two different constraint rules are suggested for the parametric modification of the DCT frequency coefficients.

A 3D deformable surface model is used to represent the image intensity and the introduced discrete transform is a by-product of the explicit surface deformation governing equations. The properties of the proposed transform are similar to those of the DCT. To illustrate these properties, the proposed transform is applied to lossy image compression and the obtained results are compared to those of a DCT-based compression scheme. Experimental results show that DMT, which includes an embedded compression ratio selection mechanism, has excellent energy compaction properties and achieves comparable compression results to DCT at low compression ratios, while being in \u2026",

In the following, we focus on using NMF factorization followed by SVM classification. Typically, the parameters of these two steps, e.g., the NMF bases/coefficients and the support vectors, are optimized independently, thus leading to suboptimal classification performance. In this paper, we merge these two steps into one by incorporating maximum margin classification constraints into the standard NMF optimization.

            "Abstract": "Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is a post-processing step in almost every visual object detector. NMS aims to prune the number of overlapping detected candidate regions-of-interest (ROIs) on an image, in order to assign a single and spatially accurate detection to each object. The default NMS algorithm (GreedyNMS) is fairly simple and suffers from severe drawbacks, due to its need for manual tuning. A typical case of failure with high application relevance is pedestrian/person detection in dense human crowds, where GreedyNMS doesn't provide accurate results. This paper proposes an efficient deep neural architecture for NMS in the person detection scenario, by capturing relations of neighbouring ROIs and aiming to ideally assign precisely one detection per person. The presented Seq2Seq-NMS architecture assumes a sequence-to-sequence formulation of the NMS problem, exploits the Multihead Scale-Dot Product Attention mechanism and jointly processes both geometric and visual properties of the input candidate ROIs. Thorough experimental evaluation on three public person detection datasets shows favourable results against competing methods, with acceptable inference runtime requirements and good behaviour for large numbers of raw candidate ROIs per image.",

The second rule is based on the cross-power in a particular frequency band that is also compared to a threshold. Experiments are carried out in order to validate the feasibility of the aforementioned dialogue detection rules by using ground-truth indicator functions determined by human observers from six different movies. A total of 25 dialogue scenes and another 8 non-dialogue scenes are employed. The probabilities of false alarm and detection are estimated by cross-validation, where 70% of the available scenes are used to learn the thresholds \u2026",

Semantic video signatures are those that are based on high-level content information rather than on low-level features of the video stream, their major advantage being that they are invariant to nearly all types of distortion. Since a major semantic feature of a video is the appearance of specific people in specific frames, we have developed a method that uses the pre-extracted output of face detection and recognition to perform fast semantic indexing and retrieval of video segments. We give the results of the experimental evaluation of our method on an artificial database created using a probabilistic model of the creation of video",

The most discriminant features of a person's face are found and a deformable model is placed in the spatial coordinates that correspond to these discriminant features. The discriminant deformable models, for verifying the person's identity, that are learned through this procedure are elastic graphs that are dense in the facial areas considered discriminant for a specific person and sparse in other less significant facial areas. The discriminant graphs are enhanced by a discriminant feature selection method for the graph nodes in order to find the most discriminant jet features. The proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of elastic graph matching in frontal face verification",

On the basis of the results derived for a video frame, we can predict (or estimate) rather than detect the object position and/or orientation. This is in contrast with frame-based video object detection, where the goal is to find the location of the object of interest in the scene without using its motion information. An obvious advantage of object tracking over object detection is that, in the case of multiple objects, the former can often provide automatic object labelling as they move over time. Additionally, one of the motivations behind object tracking is that object detection is frequently computationally slow or prone to detection errors. Even in the case that object detection is the final goal, tracking can significantly reduce the search region within a frame and, hence, the computations required. The output of an object \u2026",

After SVD is performed, a two-phase process is employed to detect the shots. In the first phase, a dynamic clustering method is used to create the frame clusters. In the second phase, every two consecutive clusters, obtained by the clustering procedure, are tested for a possible merging in order to reduce false shot-cut detections. In the merging phase, statistical hypothesis testing is used.

Images can be modeled as two-dimensional stochastic processes, whose statistics vary in the various image regions. Images are nonstationary processes. Furthermore the noise statistics, e.g., the noise standard deviation and even the noise probability density function, vary from application to application, as was described in chapter 3. Sometimes, the noise characteristics vary in the same application from one image to the next. Such cases are the channel noise in image transmission and the atmospheric noise (e.g., the cloud noise) in satellite images. In these environments non-adaptive filters cannot perform well because their characteristics depend \u2026",

The specific problem that is used as a case study for digital media analysis is the human-centered video analysis for activity and identity recognition. Several neural network topologies, such as self organizing maps, independent subspace analysis, multi-layer perceptrons, extreme learning machines and deep learning architectures are presented and results on human activity recognition are reported.",

This demand has been lately addressed by the emergence of a variety of watermarking methods. Such methods target towards hiding in the original data an imperceptible and undetectable signal which conveys information about the host medium (owner or authorized user, transaction or product ID, etc). For a review of existing schemes and a detailed discussion on the main requirements of a watermarking scheme, the interested reader may consult [5, 9].The field of nonlinear dynamics which has its roots in the work of French mathematician H. Poincar\u00e9 (1854\u20131912) is dealing with the study of the systems whose time evolution equations are of nonlinear nature. Under certain conditions, some nonlinear systems give rise to chaos, that is, a complex, aperiodic, and apparently random behavior. However, neither is the random and complex behavior of chaotic systems the result of uncontrolled external factors, namely, noise, nor is it necessarily attributed to the complexity of the system; most chaotic systems are deterministic in nature and can be described by very simple equations. Chaotic behavior can result, for example, from the iterative application of an appropriate nonlinear scalar map f (\u00b7):",

In this paper, a novel facial images fast labeling method that is essentially a semi-supervised face recognition approach, is presented. The proposed method is based on the acceleration of a state of the art facial identity label propagation technique. The new method is called pruned label propagation due to the fact that the facial label inference is conducted using a similarity matrix containing fewer entries, namely the pairwise similarities that reside in the main and the off-diagonals of this matrix. Experiments conducted on facial image labeling in three stereoscopic movies, confirm the increased labeling accuracy and the reduced computational complexity of the proposed method.",

            "Abstract": "Three techniques called non-negative matrix fac-torization (NMF), local non-negative matrix factorization (LNMF), and discriminant non-negative matrix factorization (DNMF), have been recently developed for decomposing a data matrix into non-negative factors named basis images and decomposition coefficients. Although these techniques are closely related to each other since they impose certain common non-negative constraints, the decomposition process of each algorithm involves a different objective function. While NMF approximates in the best possible way the data matrix by the product of its decomposition factors imposing only nonnegative constraints, LNMF adds more constraints on the basis images to reduce the redundant information between them and to enlarge their sparseness degree. DNMF imposes more constraints on the coefficients in order to take into account class information. In this paper these methods are used in the context of face recognition to extract features from two image databases (YALE and ORL). Extracted features are further classified by two metric-based classifiers, namely Maximum Correlation Classifier (MCC) and Cosine Similarity Measure (CSM). Besides, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are also used for classification. Experiments show that when these algorithms are applied along with the aforementioned classifiers, to face recognition task they lead to quite different results, their performance being data dependent.",

Linear projection algorithms for feature selection and automatic weighting of the nodes according to their discriminatory power succeed to increase the authentication capability of the method. The performance of the morphological dynamic link architecture is evaluated in terms of the receiver operating characteristic in the M2VTS face image database. The comparison with other frontal face authentication algorithms indicates that the morphological dynamic link architecture with discriminatory power coefficients is the best algorithm with respect to the equal error rate achieved.",

The proposed morphological skeleton matching process provides translation, rotation, and scaling information at the same time. The interpolated slices preserve the shape of the original object slices, when the slices have similar shapes. It can also modify the shape of an object when the successive slices do not have similar shapes. Applications on artificial and real data are also presented.",

For instance, based on the Graph Embedding (GE) framework, which is a platform for developing novel DR methods, Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) has been proposed. Although MFA surpasses the above distribution limitations, it fails to model potential subclass structure that might lie within the several classes of the data.

Although it is common-knowledge that appearance-based methods are sensitive to image registration errors, there is no systematic experiment reported in the literature. As a result of these experiments, the training set enrichment with translated, scaled and rotated images is proposed for confronting the low robustness of these techniques in facial expression recognition.

Thereby, the solution of the proposed modified SVM optimization problem lies in a regularized space, where data similarity is expressed by a linear combination of multiple single-graph regularized kernels. The proposed method exploits and extends the findings of Multiple Kernel Learning and graph-based SVM method families. It is shown that the available kernel options for the former can be broadened \u2026",

Our objective is to weigh the local matching errors at the nodes of an elastic graph according to their discriminatory power. We propose a novel approach to discriminant analysis that re-formulates Fisher's linear discriminant ratio to a quadratic optimization problem subject to inequality constraints by combining statistical pattern recognition and support vector machines. The method is applied to frontal face authentication on the M2VTS database.",

The proposed method incorporates discriminant constraints inside the NMF decomposition in a class specific manner. Thus, a decomposition of a face to its discriminant parts is obtained and new update rules for both the weights and the basis images are derived. The introduced methods have been applied to the problem of frontal face verification using the well known XM2VTS database.

The crack filling procedure must be applied only on the cracks and not on these dark brush strokes, which are also detected. In order to separate these brush strokes from cracks, we use the Hue and Saturation information in the HSV or HSI color space. The separation is obtained by classification through the implementation of the MRBF neural network. Alternatively, a semi-automatic method is described for this separation. The primitive geometric shape-matching property of the morphological opening can be used to separate brush strokes, which have a specific shape.

A Support Vector Machines (SVMs) system is used for the classi cation of the shape information derived from tracking the Candide grid over the video sequence. The shape information consists of the di erences of the node coordinates between the  rst (neutral) and last (fully expressed facial expression) video frame. Subsequently, fusion of texture and shape information obtained is performed using Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Networks (NNs).

That is, the role of the Generator is assigned to the tracking model so that it produces response maps belonging to some target distribution, while an additional discriminator network is trained to identify if the tracker response maps produced by the generator belong to this target distribution, or not. Therefore, the tracker model exploits the discriminator network as an additional information pool about the target distribution. It is shown that \u2026",

The overall focus is on cinematographic coverage of sports events, but most of the contributions are relevant to all UAV cinematography applications.A recent research trend is the development of end-to-end systems able to execute specific single-drone shooting missions. In [1], a tool is presented for computing drone trajectories and camera parameters using example \u201ckey-frames\" specified by the user. Subsequently, a UAV is guided outdoors so as to autonomously capture the desired footage, while obeying cinematographic rules. Static shots based on visual composition principles and canonical shots, as well as transitions between shots are computed automatically.

            "Abstract": "The Kernel k-Means algorithm for clustering extends the classic k-Means clustering algorithm. It uses the kernel trick to implicitly calculate distances on a higher dimensional space, thus overcoming the classic algorithm's inability to handle data that are not linearly separable. Given a set of n elements to cluster, the n \u00d7 n kernel matrix is calculated, which contains the dot products in the higher dimensional space of every possible combination of two elements. This matrix is then referenced to calculate the distance between an element and a cluster center, as per classic k-Means. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for zeroing elements of the kernel matrix, thus trimming the matrix, which results in reduced memory complexity and improved clustering performance.",

Two of them are multimedia databases collected under controlled conditions. The rst one contains 37 persons' audio and video data in four shots. The second database is extended to 295 persons' audio and video data recorded at eight time instances. The remaining two databases are small galleries recorded during real-world tests such as access-control to buildings and cash dispenser services or access-control to tele-services via INTERNET in a typical o ce environment. It is demonstrated that the morphological elastic graph matching achieves a very low equal error rate on databases collected under well-controlled conditions. However, its performance deteriorates when it is applied to databases recorded during eld tests. The compensation for image variations attributed to variable recording conditions, ie, changes in illumination, face size di erences and varying face position, is addressed next. The use of simple and powerful pre-processing techniques aiming at compensating for the aforementioned variations prior to the application of morphological elastic graph matching is proposed. The results obtained indicate that such an approach overcomes the image variations and stabilizes the performance of the authentication algorithm.",

Therefore, fast algorithms for their computation can be easily constructed. Simulations on the use of discrete multichannel transforms on color image compression have also been performed.< >",

The first method employs discriminant analysis in the features derived from NMF. In this way, a two-phase discriminant feature extraction procedure is implemented, namely NMF plus Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The second method incorporates the discriminant constraints inside the NMF decomposition. Thus, a decomposition of a face to its discriminant parts is obtained and new update rules for both the weights and the basis images are derived.

Also, the metrics used for the evaluation of each method varies depending on the number of points in search, the resolution of the test database and, generally, is usually based on subjective criteria. For these reasons, an objective comparison of the existing methods would fail in the sense that, most of the times, they are developed for specific reasons (eg expression recognition, gaze detection, driver\u2019s alertness estimation, etc.) and a method of general applicability seems to be away from the current state of research.

The major advantage of such signatures is that they are highly invariant to nearly all types of distortion. A major semantic feature of a video is the appearance of specific persons in specific video frames. Because of the great amount of research that has been performed on the subject of face detection and recognition, the extraction of such information is generally tractable, or will be in the near future.

            "Abstract": "Face recognition has attracted great interest due to its importance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we present a novel low-rank sparse representation-based classification (LRSRC) method for robust face recognition. Given a set of test samples, LRSRC seeks the lowest-rank and sparsest representation matrix over all training samples. Since low-rank model can reveal the subspace structures of data while sparsity helps to recognize the data class, the obtained test sample representations are both representative and discriminative. Using the representation vector of a test sample, LRSRC classifies the test sample into the class which generates minimal reconstruction error. Experimental results on several face image databases show the effectiveness and robustness of LRSRC in face image recognition.",

In order to improve both detection reliability and robustness against attacks, embedding of watermarks with high-frequency spectrum, in the low frequencies of the DFT domain, is introduced in this paper and theoretical analysis of correlation based watermarking techniques with multiplicative embedding is performed. The proposed watermarking framework is successfully applied to audio signals, demonstrating its superiority with respect to both robustness and inaudibility.

They partly degrade image quality, so that humans can identify the persons in a scene, while face identification algorithms fail to do so. The approaches used involve: a) singular value decomposition (SVD) and b) image projections on hyperspheres. Simulation experiments verify that these methods reduce the percentage of correct face identification rate by over 90 %. Additionally, the final image is not degraded beyond recognition by humans, in contrast with the majority of other de-identification methods.",

The evaluation of the proposed method was performed on two classification tasks: person recognition on facial images extracted from three stereo movies and human action recognition on two data sets consisting of videos downloaded from YouTube.

For example, hackers exploiting weaknesses in other systems and the use of inadequate too short cipher keys produce frequent news headlines about broken security systems. Despite the news headlines, such problems have been well explored and even solved in principle, therefore they arent the primary focus of this special theme issue. Rather the articles here cover the unsolved problems in image security, which relate fairly closely to computer graphics. The unsolved challenges arise from the increased availability and distribution of multimedia content over Internet services such as the World Wide Web and their implications for intellectual property protection and copyright issues.Descriptors:",

            "Abstract": "The influence zone transform is a fundamental tool in morphological and qualitative digital image processing. Because of its inherent geodesic properties, it is most efficiently computed using propagation front or grassfire based methods. However, when the image processed is too large to be contained in available memory, the random access nature of these algorithms makes them exceptionally inefficient. In order to alleviate this problem, we have developed two algorithms that greatly reduce the memory requirements of the transform. The first is designed specifically for computing the influence zone transform on surfaces, without storing the volume enclosing the surface. The second performs the transform using only the propagation fronts, and without storing any part of the region that is being processed. Both methods use much less memory than the ones in the literature, and thus enable the transform to be performed on much larger images than before. However, since all three algorithms use a significant number of set-access operations, they are considerably slower that their classical counterparts. Several techniques have been developed in this work in order to minimize the effect of these set operations. These include fast search methods, double propagation fronts, directional propagation, and others.",

We develop a method that directs the snake further into the concavities and saves iterations, adding new snake points further inside concavities.

Thus, a bank of L-filters results, with each of them corresponding to and operating on a different image region. Simulation results are presented, which verify the (qualitative and quantitative) superiority of our technique over a number of commonly used speckle filters.",

To this end, this paper proposes a 3D object pose estimation method that is suitable for execution on embedded systems. Specifically, a novel multi-task objective function is proposed, in order to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract pose-related features from RGB images, which are subsequently utilized in a Nearest-Neighbor (NN) search-based post-processing step to obtain the final 3D object poses. By utilizing a symmetry-aware term and unit quaternions in the proposed objective function, our method yielded more robust and discriminative features, thus, increasing 3D object pose estimation accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art. In addition, the employed feature extraction network utilizes a lightweight CNN architecture, allowing \u2026",

Copyright protection is achieved by embedding an \"invisible\" signal, known as digital signature, in the digital image. Signature casting is performed in the spatial domain by slightly modifying the intensity level of randomly selected image pixels. Signature detection is done by comparing the mean intensity value of the marked pixels against that of the not marked pixels. Statistical hypothesis testing is used for this purpose. The signature can be designed in such a way that it is resistant to JPEG compression and lowpass filtering. This is done by minimizing the energy content of the signature signal in higher frequencies. Experiments on real image data verify the effectiveness of the method.",

Next, we reconstruct the surface using the information of parallel curves in order to backproject the image on the surface. Finally, we simulate a camera to obtain new images from di erent viewpoints. x1. IntroductionA depicted scene may be represented on curved surfaces, as shown in Figure 1. Our reconstruction method will be limited to surfaces with curvature di erent than zero in only one direction. The curves drawn on the scene of constant altitude in the coordinate system of the surface will be called parallels. In case of monocular vision, we need to use certain a priori knowledge to perform the 3D reconstruction of a surface. So, we use the information given by the projections of at least two parallels contained on the scene. Before reconstructing the curved surface it is necessary to locate this surface in the camera coordinate system. Next, we shall present the method of surface reconstruction using the information of the parallel curves. An overview on the general domain of 3D reconstruction is found in the papers 4, 8].

In addition to the experiments conducted in facial expression database we also conducted experiments on classification databases to provide evidence that our method outperforms state of the art methods.",

However, because of their random-access nature, they are inefficient in large images that cannot fit in available random access memory. We explore ways to increase the memory efficiency of two algorithms that use propagation fronts: the skeletonization by influence zones and the watershed transform. Two algorithms are presented for the skeletonization by influence zones. The first computes the skeletonization on surfaces without storing the enclosing volume. The second performs the skeletonization without any region reference, by using only the propagation fronts. The watershed transform algorithm that was developed keeps in memory the propagation fronts and only one greylevel of the image. All three algorithms use much less memory than the ones \u2026",

An iterative optimization scheme is proposed for sequential discriminant BoWs-based action representation and codebook adaptation based on action discrimination in a reduced dimensionality feature space where action classes are better discriminated. Experiments on five publicly available data sets aiming at different application scenarios demonstrate that the proposed unified approach increases the codebook discriminative ability providing enhanced action classification performance.",

Slice similarity is computed using the distance transform measure in both directions.

Two main theories exist with respect to the face analysis, encoding and representation in the HVS. The first one claims that the face is represented globally (known also as holistic) where the features have \u201cholon\u201d-like appearance. The second theory suggests that a more appropriate human face representation would be given by a sparse representation, where only a few neural cells are triggered. Although impressive work has been reported in the literature concerning both theories, no common agreement was established yet. However, a link exists, as, nowadays, the theoretical and experimental evidence brought evidence that the HVS performs face analysis (encoding, storing, face recognition, facial expression recognition) in a structured and hierarchical way, where both representations have their own contribution and goal. Basically, according to neuropsychological experiments, it is believed that, for face recognition, the encoding appears to be more likely global, while the sparse (or local) image representation is for the facial expression analysis and classification tasks. However, face and facial expression analysis is not only a concern from the neuropsychology field. Applications where the human face plays a central role are provided by facial biometrics and facial expression analysis. In the light of the computer vision perspective, various \u2026",

A novel concealment scheme is proposed in this paper that uses spatial or, when available, temporal information to reconstruct the corrupted frames. The concealment strategy is embedded in the MPEG-2 decoder model to avoid further concealment of propagation errors. The proposed scheme is proved to be of better performance compared to that achieved by other error concealment (EC) methods.

The introduced models are much faster than other deformable models (e.g., finite-element methods). The approach relies on the determination of explicit deformation governing equations that involve neither eigenvalue decomposition, nor any other computationally intensive numerical operation. The approach was evaluated and compared with another fast and accurate physics-based deformable shape model, both in terms of deformation accuracy and computation time. The conclusion is that the introduced model is completely accurate and is deformed very fast on current personal computers (Pentium III), achieving more than 380 contour deformations per second.",

As the object view changes over time, the object model is updated, hence incorporating these changes. Color histogram similarity between the detected object and the surrounding background is employed for background subtraction.

The following classes of nonlinear digital image/signal processing techniques can be identified at present: (1) order statistic filters; (2) homomorphic filters; (3) polynomial filters; (4) mathematical morphology (5) neural networks; (6) nonlinear image restoration. One of the main current limitations of nonlinear techniques is the lack of unifying theory, that can encompass all existing nonlinear filter classes. Each class of nonlinear processing techniques possesses its own mathematical tools that can provide reasonably good analysis of its performance. Cross-fertilization of these classes has been proven to be promising.

The algorithm focuses not only on the detection of FISH dots but also on overall case classification. The algorithm includes two combined stages for nuclei and dot detection respectively. The dot detection consists of a top-hat filtering stage followed by 3D template matching to separate real signals from noise. Nuclei segmentation includes a non-linearity correction step, global thresholding and a geometric rule to distinguish between holes within a nucleus and holes between nuclei.

Then, using fuzzy vector quantization (FVQ) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), different movements are represented and classified. This method allows view independent movement recognition, without the use of calibrated cameras, a-priori view correspondence information or 3D model reconstruction.

This task is usually solved manually or pseudo-automatically, requiring some manual human intervention. Past attempts to contour extraction based on typical edge detection schemes failed in the case of frontal gray level natural mouth images due to the weak contrast of these images. The proposed approach for lip contour extraction is still based on edge processing, but instead of using the edge magnitude, we process the edge direction. Clear patterns of edge directions can be observed around the lip contours, and noisy directions in the remaining areas. By using angular measures for edge following, good results are obtained with little manual intervention.",

An automatic mosaicing method is applied on the flattened images in order to obtain the complete scene. The mosaiced scene is visualized on a new synthetic surface by a mapping procedure. ing taken from different viewpoints. This approach is similar to the block matching algorithm [6] used for motion detection. Finally, we show how to map the painting on a new curved surface. The most appropriate area of application for this work is in painting representation and restoration (3].",

Identification process involves Fuzzy Vector Quantization and Discriminant Learning. In the case of multiple cameras used in the identification phase, single-view identification results combination is achieved by employing a Bayesian combination strategy. The proposed identification approach does not set the assumptions of known action class and number of capturing cameras in the identification phase. Experimental results on two publicly available video databases denote the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

For this purpose, a simple blind copyright protection watermarking system is considered. The analysis involves theoretical evaluation of the system detection reliability, when a correlator detector is used. The system is modeled in a communication framework considering the signal as interference and converting the addressed problem to the detection of the underlying watermark signal. The aim of the paper is twofold:(i) to introduce the n-way Bernoulli shift generated chaotic watermarks and theoretically contemplate their properties with respect to detection reliability and (ii) to theoretically establish their potential superiority against the widely used (pseudo-) random watermarks. An important property of Bernoulli watermarks is their controllable spectral/correlation properties that render them ideal for a variety of applications. Experimental verification of the theoretical analysis results has been performed as well.",

These features represent the texture of the seismic image. The horizons are clustered into classes according to one or several of their features. Each cluster represents a distinct texture characteristic of the seismic image. After this initial clustering, the points of each horizon are used as seeds for geophysical image segmentation. All pixels in the seismic image are clustered in those classes, according to their geometric proximity to points lying on classified horizons. Thus the entire seismic image is classified on the basis of seismic texture patterns. Two methods are proposed for clustering pixels according to their geometric proximity to reference points.

This is often not possible in practical applications, such as person verification, where the lack of sufficient training samples causes improper estimation of a linear separation hyper-plane between the two classes. To overcome this shortcoming a novel algorithm that can handle the verification problem more efficiently than traditional LDA is presented. The dimensionality of the samples is reduced by breaking them down, thus creating subsets of smaller dimensionality feature vectors, and applying discriminant analysis on each subset. The resulting discriminant weight sets are themselves weighted under a normalization criterion, making the discriminant functions continuous in this sense.

Since no such information is available for the first frame (I-frame) of an MPEG-2 coded sequence, another concealment technique is added to the proposed scheme, which uses spatial information from neighbouring macroblocks (MBs). The simulation results compared with other methods prove to be better judging from both PSNR values and the perceived visual quality of the reconstructed sequence.

Thus, a bank of L-filters results, with each of them corresponding to and operating on a different image region. Simulation results from both simulated and real B-mode ultrasonic images are presented, which verify the (qualitative and quantitative) superiority of our technique over a number of commonly used speckle filters.",

Then, these heatmaps are back-projected onto the 3D terrain of the navigation environment. The projected crowd heatmaps are fused by exploiting a Bayesian filtering approach that favors newer crowd observations over older ones.

The analysis involves theoretical evaluation of the system detection reliability, when a correlator detector is used. The effect of distortions (lowpass filtering, noise corruption of the watermarked data) on the detection reliability is also theoretically investigated. The system is modeled in a communication framework considering the signal as interference and converting the addressed problem to the detection of the underlying watermark signal. The aim of the paper is two-fold:(i) to introduce the n-way Bernoulli shift generated chaotic watermarks and theoretically contemplate their properties with respect to detection reliability and (ii) to theoretically establish their potential superiority against the widely used (pseudo-) random watermarks. An important property of Bernoulli watermarks is their controllable spectral/correlation properties that renders them ideal for a variety of applications. Bernoulli watermarks can be generated with lowpass spectral properties to withstand lowpass attacks. When no distortions are to be inflicted, white spectrum Bernoulli watermarks can be generated so that their performance converges to that of random watermarks. Experimental verification of the theoretical analysis results has been performed as well.",

The latter approaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not necessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated dataset for CNN training.

This paper introduces the L/sub p/ comparators, which are based on the theory of nonlinear mean filters. It is shown that the disadvantage of introducing errors is counter-balanced by their faster performance, when compared to the performance of classical comparators. A novel L/sub p/ comparator-based sorting network is also presented, for the fast calculation of the median of a data set. In this implementation, the number of steps required to produce the ordered output is not related to the number of inputs.",

The purpose of this study was to reconstruct three dimensionally the external and internal morphology of two double teeth. The first one was formed by the conjunction of a mandibular molar and a premolar, and the second one from a maxillary molar and a supernumerary tooth. The steps followed towards 3 D reconstruction included serial cross sectioning, photographing of the sections, digitization of the photographs, extraction of the boundaries of interest for each section, surface representation using triangulation and, finally, surface rendering using photorealistic effects. The resulting three dimensional representations of the two teeth helps us to efficiently visualize their external and internal anatomy. The results showed fusion of the radical and coronal dentine, as well as fusion of the pulp chambers for the first case, whereas fusion only of the radical dentine and of the pulp chambers for the second case.",

Assuming a multichannel signal corrupted by additive white multivariate noise whose components are generally correlated, the coefficients of the multichannel L filter based on marginal ordering are chosen to minimize the output mean-squared-error (MSE) either subject to the constraints of unbiased or location-invariant estimation or without imposing any constraint. Both the case of a constant multichannel signal corrupted by additive white multivariate noise as well as the case of a nonconstant signal is considered. In order to test the performance of the designed multichannel marginal L filters, long-tailed multivariate distributions are \u2026",

Face tracking is achieved by a Bayesian framework. The likelihood estimation scheme is based on statistical training of sets of automatically generated feature points, while the prior probability estimation is based on the fusion of an information theoretic tracking cue and a Gaussian temporal model. The likelihood estimation process is the cone of a multiple face detection scheme used to initialize the tracking process. The resulting system was tested on real image sequences and is robust to significant partial occlusion and illumination changes.",

The most widely used scale estimator, which is known as the sample standard deviation, is also extended to fuzzy numbers through the extension principle. Equivalent relations that can be used to calculate the fuzzy estimators by using crisp arithmetic are also given for each one of the proposed fuzzy estimators.",

The sequential forward selection method (SFS) has been used in order to discover a set of 5 to 10 features which are able to classify the utterances in the best way. The criterion used in SFS is the cross-validated correct classification score of one of the following classifiers: nearest mean and Bayes classifier where class pdf are approximated via Parzen windows or modelled as Gaussians.

The interchannel correlations which exist in color images must be taken into account in the restoration procedure. The design of a multichannel Wiener filter in the frequency domain is presented. The sensitivity of the multichannel Wiener filter to the spectral estimates requires the use of a robust multichannel power spectral estimator. The use of multichannel autoregressive (AR) spectral estimators results in multichannel filters which have excellent performance.<>",

Certain points that are involved into creating the Facial Action Units movements are selected. Their geometrical displacement information, defined as the coordinates' difference between the last and the first frame, is extracted to be the input to a six class Support Vector Machine system.

These two ratios constitute the 2-D feature vectors which are fed into the SVM. A ground truth labeled shot database was created in order to experimentally test the proposed method performance.

In addition, we show that a low-rank decomposition of the kernel matrix defined on the input training data can be exploited in order to determine an appropriate ELM space for input data mapping.

This face recognition methodology employs dynamic training in order to implement a person-specific iterative classification process. This process employs discriminant clustering, where, by making use of an entropy-based measure, the algorithm adapts the coordinates of the discriminant space with respect to the characteristics of the test face. As a result, the training space is dynamically reduced to smaller spaces, where linear separability among the face classes is more likely to be achieved.

It is necessary for video indexing, copyright protection and other tasks. Semantic video signatures are those that are based on high-level content information rather than on low-level features of the video stream. The major advantage of such signatures is that they are invariant to nearly all types of distortion. A major semantic feature of a video is the appearance of specific people in specific frames. Because of the great amount of research that has been performed on the subject of face detection and recognition, the extraction of such information is generally tractable. We have developed an indexing and retrieval method that uses the pre-extracted output of face detection and recognition to perform fast semantic indexing and retrieval of video segments.

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a parallel algorithm for the calculation of vector median filters on mesh connected computers. A straightforward algorithm to find the vector median requires the computation of the sum of the distances (norms) of each vector to all other vectors in the filter window. By taking into account the fact that adjacent filter windows share common input samples, the computation of the common norms of adjacent windows could be done only once. In the proposed algorithm, a 2-D signal is assumed to be stored in a SIMD mesh connected computer of the same size. According to this scheme, each processing element (PE) computes some norms and the rest ones, that are required for the selection of the vector median, are received from its neighbouring PEs via the local communication channels.< >",

In this paper the RHT is combined with the fuzzy cell Hough transform (FCHT) and a new variation, the randomized fuzzy cell Hough transform (RFCHT) is proposed. The p-dimensional parameter space of Hough transform is split into fuzzy cells with overlapped intervals of confidence. The fuzzy cells are defined as fuzzy numbers. The RFCHT selects p pixels from an edge image by random sampling and solves the p parameters of a curve. Then the p parameters accumulate to more than one fuzzy cells, since the fuzzy cells intervals are overlapped by adding a value that belongs in the interval [0, 1] and is calculated from the membership function of the corresponding fuzzy cell. The procedure continues by using a percentage of the total contour pixels. The RFCHT algorithm \u2026",

The algorithm exploits connectedness and coherence properties in skin image regions in order to capture alarming Regions of Interest (ROIs). The technique to identify ROIs in an image employs a region-splitting scheme, in which the image plane is recursively partitioned into quadrants. Splitting is achieved by considering both the accumulation of skin pixels and texture coherence. This processing step is proven to significantly boost the accuracy and reduction of running time demands, even in the presence of sparse noise due to errors attributed to skin segmentation. For detected ROIs, we extract 15 rough color and spatial features computed from the pixels residing in the ROI.

HNSCC is a kind of oral cancer associated with smoking and alcohol drinking habits; however the individual risk could be modified by genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the metabolism of tobacco carcinogens and in the DNA repair mechanisms. To study this relationship, the data set comprised demographic and life-style (age, gender, smoke and alcohol), and genetic data (the individual genotype of 11 polymorphic genes), with the information on 124 HNSCC patients and 231 healthy controls.

            "Abstract": "The increasing computational complexity of label propagation-based facial image annotation when applied on multimedia data whose cardinality increases over the time (e.g., when analyzing video or movie content on-line), can be reduced by using an incremental approach. In this paper, a method for incremental label propagation on facial images is described. The similarity matrix is incrementally constructed by employing the kd-tree nearest neighbor algorithm. Furthermore, the matrix inversion, which is included in the label propagation solution, is calculated with a block-wise inversion formula involving the Woodbury matrix identity. Experiments show significant computational savings when the incremental approach is applied on a dataset of three full length movies. Moreover, the classification accuracy was improved in most cases.",

In this context, autonomous functionalities based on machine learning and computer vision modules are gaining ground. During live coverage of outdoor events, an autonomous UAV may visually track and follow a specific target of interest, under a specific desired shot type, mainly adjusted by choosing appropriate focal length and UAV/camera trajectory relative to the target. However, the selected UAV/camera trajectory and the object tracker requirements (which impose limits on the maximum allowable focal length) affect the range of feasible shot types, thus constraining cinematography planning. Therefore, this paper explores the interplay between cinematography and computer vision in the area of autonomous UAV filming. UAV target-tracking \u2026",

The similarity of an action volume with representative action volumes is exploited in order to map it to a lower-dimensional feature space that preserves the action class properties. Discriminant learning is, subsequently, employed for further dimensionality reduction and action class discrimination.

The uncertainty of the contour point location is transferred to the parameter space and gives better accuracy in curve estimation than the classical Hough transform, especially when noisy images have to be used. Moreover, the computation time is significantly decreased, since the regions of the parameter space where contours do not correspond, are rejected during the iterations.",

The algorithm focuses on the detection of FISH spots and on the cell nuclei segmentation in order to perform overall case classification as positive or negative. Spots detection includes mainly a top-hat filtering stage, a binary thresholding, a 3D template matching and a grey level contrast evaluation. Nuclei segmentation consists of a non-linear blue channel correction step, a global thresholding by Otsu algorithm, a grey level hole classification by a geometric rule and of the marked watershed transform using local h-dome maxima as markers. By the measurement of the FISH signals ratio per cell nucleus we perform the classification of cases.

            "Abstract": "This manuscript introduces the concept of self similar watermarks for the purpose of counterfeiting geometrical attacks on copyright protected still images. Geometrical transformations result in the de-synchronization of watermark detection mechanisms enforcing the adoption of exhaustive search strategies for optimizing the algorithm\u2019s efficiency. The self-similar structure attained by the presented watermarks reduces the search ranges and enhances the detection performance by accelerating the overall procedure and minimizing the false detection probability. Various embedding domains (DFT, DWT) were utilized for hiding the watermark information while the presented schemes do not require the original image during detection. Self-similar watermarks prove rather robust against many kinds of attacks, such as linear and non linear filtering, jpeg compression, scaling, cropping and rotation, especially when combined with a robust transform domain.",

Relevant algorithms face the challenge of needing to achieve a careful balance between summary compactness, enjoyability, and content coverage. The specific case of stereoscopic 3D theatrical films has become more important over the past years, but not received corresponding research attention. In this paper, a multi-stage, multimodal summarization process for such stereoscopic movies is proposed, that is able to extract a short, representative video skim conforming to narrative characteristics from a 3D film. At the initial stage, a novel, low-level video frame description method is introduced (frame moments descriptor) that compactly captures informative image statistics from luminance, color, optical flow, and stereoscopic disparity video data, both in a \u2026",

The optimization problem of the so-called Minimum Within-Class Variance Multiclass Classifiers (MWCVMC) is formulated and solved in arbitrary Hilbert spaces, defined by Mercer\u2019s kernels, in order to find multiclass decision hyperplanes/surfaces. Afterwards, MWCVMCs are solved using indefinite kernels and dissimilarity measures via pseudo-Euclidean embedding. The power of the proposed approach is firstly demonstrated in the facial expression recognition of the seven basic facial expressions (ie, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise plus the neutral state) problem in the presence of partial facial occlusion by using a pseudo-Euclidean embedding of Hausdorff distances and the MWCVMC. The experiments indicated a recognition accuracy rate achieved up to 99%. The MWCVMC classifiers are also applied to face recognition and other classification problems using Mercer\u2019s kernels.",

By SM examination, an extensive destruction of dentin was seen, while, by SEM examination, a disappearance of dentinal tubules was clear.

The proposed method called maximum margin projection pursuit, aims to identify a low dimensional projection subspace, where samples form classes that are better discriminated, i.e., are separated with maximum margin. The proposed method is an iterative alternate optimization algorithm that computes the maximum margin projections exploiting the separating hyperplanes obtained from training a support vector machine classifier in the identified low \u2026",

An indicator function defines that a particular actor is present at a time instant. Two dialogue detection rules are developed and assessed. The first rule relies on the value of cross-correlation function at zero time lag that is compared to a threshold. The second rule is based on the cross-power in a particular frequency band that is also compared to a threshold. Experiments are carried out in order to validate the feasibility of the aforementioned dialogue detection rules by using ground-truth indicator functions determined by human observers from six different movies. A total of 25 dialogue scenes and another 8 non-dialogue scenes are employed. The probabilities of false alarm and detection are estimated by cross-validation where 70% of the available scenes are used to learn the thresholds employed in the dialogue detection rules and the remaining 30% of the scenes are used for testing. An almost perfect dialogue detection is reported for every distinct threshold.",

It has also importance for the provision of improved home care in cases of disabled persons or persons suffering from certain diseases that have high social impact. In this context, the development of computer vision systems capable to identify human eating and drinking activity can be really useful in order to prevent undernourishment/malnutrition and dehydration in a smart home environment targeting to extend independent living of older persons in the early stage of dementia. In this paper, we first describe the human centered interface specifications and implementations for such a system, which can be supported by ambient intelligence and robotic technologies. We, subsequently, describe a multi-view eating and drinking activity recognition database that has been created in order to facilitate research towards this direction. The database has been created by using four cameras in order to produce multi-view videos, each depicting one of twelve persons having a meal, resulting to a database size equal to 59.68 hours in total. Various types of meals have been recorded, ie, breakfast, lunch and fast food. Moreover, the persons have different sizes, clothing and are of different sex. The database has been annotated in a frame base in terms of person ID and activity class. We hope that such a database will serve as a benchmark data set for computer vision researchers in order to devise methods targeting to this important application.",

As a matter of fact, detection is involved in one of the two major approaches that one can adopt to devise a tracking algorithm [1]. According to this approach, object detection is performed on each frame of a video sequence and, subsequently, correspondences between objects detected in successive frames are sought. Thus, the trajectory of each object is established.

            "Abstract": "The objectives of the M2VTS project is to address the issue of secured access to local and centralised services in a multimedia environment. The major problem in user authentication is to achieve on the one hand toll performance: false acceptance rate as low as possible (minimise access to impostors), and false rejection rate as low as possible (a registered user should access to his system in any case), and on the other hand stand the wide range of conditions of use of such systems as well as provide ergonomically viable solutions. The use of multiple modalities will help to overpass potential technical limitations of individual modalities as well as take benefit of the emerging multimedia environment: workstations, network computers, smart phones are more and more equipped with audio and video capabilities. The research is driven by the application needs and user requirements. Therefore, work has essentially been driven by three main goals: 1. Develop platforms for evaluation, implementation and fast prototyping of technology. Submit these platforms to user tests in real situations, in order to measure the adequation between user requirements and current maturity of the technology. 2. Develop algorithmic solutions for user authentication in a multimodal context. Implement these solutions on the software platforms for fast prototyping. Refinements of the algorithms based on the results of the user tests in real situations",

The described procedure was implemented as a plug-in for Maya, which requires as inputs only the animated face model and the correspondence between its vertices and the FDPs. The extracted data were tested on a publicly available FAP-player in order to demonstrate the faithful reproduction of the face animation originally created with the high-end 3D graphics modeller. The capabilities of the publicly available FAP player have also been augmented in order to enable loading any proprietary face model and its corresponding FAT.",

However, their limited resources burden computation cinematography techniques on operating with high accuracy and real-time speed on such devices. State-of-the-art object detectors and feature extractors are, thus, studied in this work, aiming to find a trade-off between performance and speed that will allow UAV exploitation for intelligent cinematography purposes. Experimental evaluation on three newly introduced datasets of rowing boats, cyclists and parkour athletes is performed and evidence is provided that even limited-resource autonomous UAVs can indeed be used for cinematography applications.",

Face detection in images or videos is the first step in human-centered video analysis to be followed, e.g. by automatic face recognition. Therefore, by hindering face detection, we also render automatic face recognition improbable. To this end, we examine the application of two methods. First, we consider a naive approach, i.e., we simply use additive or impulsive noise to the input image, until the point where the face cannot be automatically detected anymore. Second, we examine the application of the SVD-DID face de-identification method. Our experimental results denote that both methods attain high face detection failure rates.",

The goal is to find subgroups of closely related data samples (clusters) in a set of unlabeled data. A classic clustering algorithm is the so-called k-Means. It is very popular, however, it is also unable to handle cases in which the clusters are not linearly separable. Kernel k-Means is a state of the art clustering algorithm, which employs the kernel trick, in order to perform clustering on a higher dimensionality space, thus overcoming the limitations of classic k-Means regarding the non linear separability of the input data. It has recently received a distributed implementation, named Trimmed Kernel k-Means, following the MapReduce distributed computing model. In addition to performing the computations in a distributed manner, Trimmed Kernel k-Means also trims the kernel matrix, in order to reduce the memory \u2026",

A set of rules for a robust and online update of the camera motion model parameters is also proposed, based on the expectation maximization algorithm.

This is what gives it its semantic richness, as semantic content can vary enormously over the duration of a video sequence. Conversely, exactly because of the variability of video semantic content with respect to time, any attempt to exact semantics from the video necessitates the temporal segmentation of the video. The basic concepts and principles that are involved in the temporal segmentation of digital video are derived from the art of creating motion pictures. There, directors andfilm editors perceptually segment their motion pictures into a hierarchy of scenes and shots. Scenes (also called story units) are a concept that is much older than motion pictures, ultimately originating in the theater.

Three known classifiers are tested and compared in both cases, namely the Fisher linear discriminant, the#-nearest neighbor classifier, and the nearest mean classifier.

We extend the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm by incorporating appropriate regularization terms describing geometric properties and discrimination criteria of the training data representation in the ELM space to this end. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on human action recognition, where its performance is compared with that of other (semi-)supervised classification schemes. Experimental results on two publicly available action recognition databases denote its effectiveness.",

We formulate this problem as the one of automatic video segment selection based on a learning process that employs salient video segment paradigms. For this one-class classification problem, we introduce a novel variant of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) classifier that exploits subclass information in the OC-SVM optimization problem, in order to jointly minimize the data dispersion within each subclass and determine the optimal decision function. We evaluate the proposed approach in three Hollywood movies, where the performance of the proposed SOC-SVM algorithm is compared with that of the OC-SVM. Experimental results denote that the proposed approach is able to outperform OC-SVM-based video segment selection.",

In this framework we present a novel approach to face localization by using color and shape information. For the extraction of facial features we employ two approaches.

In this application scenario, a 2D target tracker visually assists the UAV pilot (or cameraman) to maintain proper target framing, or it is employed for autonomous UAV operation. It should be expected that in such scenarios, the 2D tracker may fail due to target occlusions, illumination variations, fast 3D target motion, etc., thus, the 2D tracker should be able to recover from such situations. The proposed long-term 2D tracking algorithm solves exactly this problem, by detecting occlusions from the 2D tracker responses. Moreover, according to the immensity of the occlusion, the tracker may stop updating the tracker model or try to re-detect the target in a broader frame region.

For each intra and predicted image, we perform edge detection. Each image of the sequence is compared with the other images by subtracting corresponding edges. The choice of the reference image is based on the result of subtraction. We adopt the criterion of minimum pixels if the resulting images present only points and the criterion of minimum distance between the lines if they present parallel lines and possibly points.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, a modified class of support vector machines (SVMs) inspired from the optimization of Fisher's discriminant ratio is presented, the so-called minimum class variance SVMs (MCVSVMs). The MCVSVMs optimization problem is solved in cases in which the training set contains less samples that the dimensionality of the training vectors using dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis (PCA). Afterward, the MCVSVMs are extended in order to find nonlinear decision surfaces by solving the optimization problem in arbitrary Hilbert spaces defined by Mercer's kernels. In that case, it is shown that, under kernel PCA, the nonlinear optimization problem is transformed into an equivalent linear MCVSVMs problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing it with the standard SVMs and other classifiers, like kernel Fisher discriminant analysis in facial image \u2026",

A large number of such techniques have been proposed utilizing a priori knowledge about the data. In this paper, new subspace learning techniques are presented that use symmetry constraints in their objective functions. The rational behind this idea is to exploit the a priori knowledge that geometrical symmetry appears in several types of data, such as images, objects, faces, and so on. Experiments on artificial, facial expression recognition, face recognition, and object categorization databases highlight the superiority and the robustness of the proposed techniques, in comparison with standard SL techniques.",

Examples include micro-blogging services (eg, Twitter), web-based friendship networks (eg, Facebook), and online product reviews (eg, Yelp).Exploiting the immense big data opportunities comes at the cost of overcoming significant challenges. First, traditional analytics are ill-equipped to cope with the sheer volume of data. Many distributed platforms (eg, Hadoop/MapReduce and GraphLab) have emerged to tame the scale of data. Nevertheless, only a subset of algorithms are readily implementable on these platforms, and development of more versatile architectures is an active research area.",

Although the term watermarking has slightly different meanings in the literature, one definition that seems to prevail is the following [1]: Watermarking is the practice of imperceptibly altering a piece of data in order to embed information about the data. The above definition reveals two important characteristics of watermarking. First, information embedding should not cause perceptible changes to the host medium (sometimes called cover medium or cover data). Second, the message should be related to the host medium. In this sense, the watermarking techniques form a subset of information hiding techniques. The latter ones also include cases where the hidden information is not \u2026",

The first problem is the use of partly specified patterns, ie, the use of wildcards in the right-hand-sides of the rewriting rules of a context-free grammar. The second one is the use of priority patterns, ie, the assignment of priority values to rewriting rules. These problems are not handled in the majority of the state-of-the-art dialogue systems. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a dialogue system core application called CAML Core [7], that is used to implement dialogue systems in several domains like conversational and multimodal interfaces for help desk applications, and chat bots.",

The default algorithm (Greedy NMS) is fairly simple and suffers from drawbacks, due to its need for manual tuning. Recently, NMS has been improved using deep neural networks that learn how to solve a spatial overlap-based detections rescoring task in a supervised manner, where only ROI coordinates are exploited as input. In this paper, neural NMS performance is augmented by feeding the network additional information extracted from the appearance of each candidate ROI. This information captures statistical properties regarding the spatial distribution of interest-points detected within the corresponding image region. Thus, the deviation in 2D \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a new approach for reconstructing images painted on curved surfaces. A set of monocular images is taken from di erent viewpoints in order to mosaic and represent the entire scene. By using a priori knowledge about the support surface of the picture, we derive the surface localization in the camera coordinate system. An automatic mosaicing method is applied on the attened images in order to obtain the complete scene. The mosaiced scene is visualized on a new synthetic surface by a mapping procedure.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this research monograph is to present the results in timefrequency analysis achieved by the group within the Center for Signals, Systems, and Information Theory from the University of Montenegro, during the course of last ten years. Contributions are written by the members of this group and their colleagues from other institutions all over the world. The monograph is composed of the selected papers arranged in a consistent manner. The related papers are grouped into twelve parts, preceded by a short introduction to the respective area.The very form of the monograph inevitably causes some repetition and overlap of the certain information and results. Since the papers presented here are aimed for, and were published in the most renowned journals, it is sometimes assumed that the reader is already familiar with this area. We hope that the introductory exposition, as well as the composition of the papers along with the references in each of them, will alleviate this problem. The work of the group has been supported during these years by several institutions. We want to thank to the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Montenegro, Montenegrin Academy of Science and Art (CANU), Ministry of Science of the Republic of Montenegro, and the Alexander von Humboldt foundation.",

Utilizing a fuzzy vector quantization (FVQ) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based algorithm, an unknown movement is first classified, and, then, the person performing the movement is recognized from a movement specific person recognition expert. In case that the unknown person performs more than one movements, a multi-modal algorithm combines the scores of the individual experts to yield the final decision for the identity of the unknown human. Using a publicly available database, we provide promising results regarding the human identification strength of movement specific experts, as well as we indicate that the combination of the outputs of the experts increases the robustness of the human recognition algorithm.",

In this study, the moving scene is decomposed into different regions with respect to their motion, by means of a pattern recognition scheme. The inputs of the proposed scheme are the feature vectors representing still image and motion information. Each class corresponds to a moving object. The classifier employed is the median radial basis function (MRBF) neural network. An error criterion function derived from the probability estimation theory and expressed as a function of the moving scene model is used as the cost function. Each basis function is activated by a certain image region. Marginal median and median of the absolute deviations from the median (MAD) estimators are employed for estimating the basis function parameters. The image regions associated with the basis functions are \u2026",

We formulate this problem as the one of automatic video segment selection based on a learning process that employs salient video segment paradigms. We design an hierarchical learning scheme that consists of two steps. At the first step, an unsupervised process is performed in order to determine salient video segment types. The second step is a supervised learning process that is performed for each of the salient video segment type independently. For the latter case, since only salient training examples are available, the problem is stated as an one-class classification problem. In order to take into account subclass information that may appear in the video segment types, we introduce a novel formulation of the Support Vector Data Description method that exploits subclass information in its optimization process \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A scene boundary detection method is presented, which analyzes both aural and visual information sources and accounts for their inter-relations and coincidence to semantically identify video scenes. Audio analysis focuses on the segmentation of the audio source into three types of semantic primitives, ie silence, speech and music. Further processing on speech segments aims at locating speaker changing points. Video analysis attempts to segment the video source into shots. Results from single source segmentation are in some cases suboptimal. Audio-visual interaction achieves to either enhance single source findings or extract high level semantic information. The aim of this paper is to identify semantically meaningful video scenes by exploiting the temporal correlations of both sources based on the observation that semantic changes are characterized by significant changes in both information sources. Experimentation has been carried on several TV sequences composed of many different in-content scenes with plenty of commercials in-between.",

The method relies on performing singular value decomposition on the matrix A, which columns are reshaped 3D color histograms of the frames. We have used SVD for its capabilities to derive a low dimensional refined feature space from a high dimensional raw feature space, where the similar patterns are placed together and can be easily detected. The detection technique was tested on TV video sequences having different types of shots and significant object and camera motion inside the shots. The method can detect cuts and gradual transitions, such as dissolves and fades, which cannot be detected easily using other methods.",
