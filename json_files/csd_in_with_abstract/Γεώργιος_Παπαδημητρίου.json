            "Abstract": "The switching speeds of electronics cannot keep up with the transmission capacity offered by optics. All-optical switch fabrics play a central role in the effort to migrate the switching functions to the optical layer. Optical packet switching provides an almost arbitrary fine granularity but faces significant challenges in the processing and buffering of bits at high speeds. Generalized multiprotocol label switching seeks to eliminate the asynchronous transfer mode and synchronous optical network layers, thus implementing Internet protocol over wavelength-division multiplexing. Optical burst switching attempts to minimize the need for processing and buffering by aggregating flows of data packets into bursts. In this paper, we present an extensive overview of the current technologies and techniques concerning optical switching.",

Multimedia network applications are time-bounded and have stricter QoS demands. The IEEE 802.11e workgroup is standardizing a new QoS enhanced access scheme for wireless networks. It is based on a mechanism called Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA). EDCA seems capable of differentiating the traffic, however, it exhibits great overhead that limits the actually available bandwidth and degrades the overall performance. This work proposes an alternative protocol which could be used in place of EDCA. The Priority Oriented Adaptive Polling (POAP) is collision free, it prioritizes the different kinds of traffic, and it is able to provide QoS for all types of multimedia network applications, while efficiently supporting background data traffic. POAP compared to EDCA, provides higher channel utilization, distributes \u2026",

In this way, actions that have been selected only a few times, have the opportunity to be estimated as \"optimal,\" to increase their choice probability and consequently, to be selected.

While assuming this role, a device must take into account various factors such as the mean service time, energy expenditure, or copyright costs. Apart from adhering to multiobjective optimality, a broadcast schedule must also be as small as possible in size to be producible and cacheable on a mobile device. This paper analytically proves the existence of optimal schedules that are finite and minimal in size. Furthermore, the optimality of the schedule is allowed to refer to an unlimited number of criteria. The analysis shows that multiobjective optimality can be met precisely by extremely small schedules, enabling their use in mobile devices. Simulations indicate perfect efficiency of the minimal schedules in realistic application scenarios.",

This is primarily due to the ease of implementation of shared-medium switches. However, ATM switches of this category, suffer from a major drawback \u2014 they are not scalable for large sizes because they require a bus running N times faster than the ports (where N is the switch size, i.e. the number of input ports). Furthermore, ATM switches that are based on the TDMA bus arbitration scheme suffer from low performance when the offered traffic is bursty. In this paper, a new approach to the design of scalable shared-medium ATM switches, which are capable of operating efficiently under bursty traffic, is introduced. The main features of the proposed switch are the following: (1) It uses the broadcast bus topology. (2) There is no need to have a bus running N \u2026",

Latest advancements in optical access networks, such as Passive Optical Networks (PONs), allow transmission rates of 10 Gbps. Hence, a very accurate synchronization method is required in order to keep the network free of blocking and collisions. In this work, we focus on 10-gigabit-capable passive optical network (XG-PON) systems, one of the most popular standards for PONs. A rigorous analytic approach is devised so as to investigate the required precision of underlying synchronization method. Closed equations for computing the no blocking and blocking probabilities are developed. The devised analytic framework is verified using simulation methods.",

            "Abstract": "Although new high-bandwidth network technologies are being introduced and widely deployed, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is still considered one of the most important network technologies currently in use. A number of ATM switch architectures have been proposed in the literature. However, industry has shown that is better to use the well-known shared-medium technique in the design of these ATM switches. In this paper, four variations of a new distributed scheme are proposed for the arbitration of a shared bus of an ATM switch. These schemes are based on learning automata. By taking advantage of the bursty nature of ATM traffic, the new arbitration scheme demonstrates superb performance compared to the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme.",

However they consume a non-negligible amount of power, while their traffic volume is forecasted to grow at very high rates for the 10 or 15 coming years. Thus, energy-efficiency in core and metro networks is mandatory for the sustainability of the future Internet. In this context, in this work we used Mantis, our network planning and operation tool, to design and carry out a comparative study of energy efficiency of current and next generation optical networks. In particular, we examined the cases of fixed-grid single-line-rate (SLR) Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks, which are now deployed in the core, and next-generation mixed-line-rates (MLR) WDM and flex-grid networks. Under realistic network scenarios we profiled the total energy consumption of the optical layer and showed that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "ADAPTIVE and learning systems have drawn considerable attention in the last few decades due to their inherent strength in suitably modeling many real-world complex systems, which are otherwise difficult to model using the traditional existing tools and systems. There exist many theories of adaptation and learning such as learning automata (LA), neural networks, and cellular automata. Considering the case of LA, for example, although it is only quite recently that LA and their applications in solving complex problems have become popular, their history dates back to the 1950s and 1960s with reference to the works of mathematicians and mathematical psychologists such as Bush and Mosteller, Atkinson et al., Tsetlin, and Varshavskii and Vorontsova, among others. Some of the popular current-generation researchers on LA include K. Narendra, MAL Thathachar, BJ Oommen, S. Lakshmivarahan, MS Obaidat, K. Najim, AS Poznyak, N. Baba, LG Mason, PS Sastry, AS Pomportsis, G. Papadimitriou, S. Misra, MR Meybodi, and H. Beigy. In typical LA systems, a self-operating machine or a mechanism, termed as an Automaton, responds to a sequence of instructions in a certain way, so as to achieve a certain goal. The Automaton either responds to a predetermined set of rules or adapts to the environmental dynamics in which it operates. The term learning has its root in Psychology and is used to refer to the act of acquiring knowledge and modifying one\u2019s behavior based on the experience gained. Thus, in LA, the adaptive automaton adapts to the responses from the environment through a series of interactions with it. It then attempts to learn the best \u2026",

This paper proposes a mechanism that exploits locality of demand in order to increase the performance of wireless data dissemination systems. Specifically, it trades the received energy per bit redundancy at distances smaller than the radius of the service area for an increased bit rate for transmission of items demanded by clients at such distances. This results to an increased transmission speed for many items. The bit rate for an item transmission is dynamically determined from the distance between the server\u2019s antenna to the group of clients that demand this item via a simple feedback from the clients. Simulation results are presented that reveal significant performance improvement over fixed bit rate broadcasting in environments characterized by locality of client demands.",

However, as the amount of data increases, the waiting time of the clients becomes unacceptably high. The present paper proposes the combination of optimal wireless broadcasting and information hovering, as an effective means of performance improvement in vehicular networks with locality of demand. While state-of-the-art works exploit user collaboration only as a means of wireless coverage extension, the proposed scheme proposes parallel dissemination through broadcasting and user networking over the whole studied area. Optimal, periodic broadcast scheduling is adopted at the highest tier for data dissemination. At the lowest tier, users can exploit information hovering around selected anchoring points, in order to retrieve data faster than their next scheduled broadcast.

            "Abstract": "One of the most challenging issues of the Ethernet passive optical networks' (EPONs) architecture is the bandwidth allocation problem. Various dynamic allocation schemes have been proposed to schedule the subscribers' demands. However, the performance of all these schemes is significantly degraded when the round-trip times (RTTs) of the optical network units (ONUs) are dissimilar, due to the large number of gaps in the transmission schedule. Unfortunately, in real networks, RTTs are usually dissimilar. In this paper a new medium access control (MAC) protocol for multichannel EPONs, namely the Intelligent Gap Filling Strategy (IGFS) is proposed. The IGFS employs two algorithms: the  DissimilarityExploitation  algorithm, which exploits the RTTs' dissimilarities, and the  MinimumLatencyScheduling  algorithm, which rearranges the ONUs' service order in order to favor the requests that cause the minimum \u2026",

According to the proposed protocol, the access of stations to the wavelengths is based on their grouping. A separate set of groups is maintained for each wave-length. All the groups are granted permission to transmit to the corresponding wavelength in a round-robin fashion. The main objective of the grouping algorithm is to have in each group exactly one station which is ready to transmit on the corresponding wavelength. In this way, idle slots and collisions arc minimized and a nearly optimal throughput-delay performance is achieved. The grouping of stations is dynamically modified at each time slot according to the network feedback information. Due to the dynamic nature of the grouping algorithm, the protocol is capable of being adapted to the sharp \u2026",

QAP operates under an infrastructure wireless LAN, where an access point (AP) polls the wireless nodes in order to grant them permission to transmit. The polled node sends data directly to the destination node. We consider bursty traffic conditions, under which the protocol operates efficiently. The polling scheme is based on an adaptive algorithm according to which it is most likely that an active node is polled. Also, QAP takes into account packet priorities, so it supports QoS by means of the highest priority first packet buffer discipline and the priority distinctive polling scheme. Lastly, the protocol combines efficiency and fairness, since it prohibits a single node to dominate the medium permanently. QAP is compared to the efficient learning automata-based polling (LEAP) protocol, and is shown to have superior performance.",

At the edges of an OBS cloud, packets are assembled to form bursts which enter the network core and are switched on the fly using bandwidth previously reserved by their control packets at each node. A key problem in OBS networks is the assignment of wavelengths to incoming bursts, i.e. the scheduling of bursts. This paper proposes two new techniques which are shown to improve burst scheduling algorithms by lowering their complexity. The first proposed technique is based on a triangular estimator that defines a ldquodrop zonerdquo; bursts that fall into this area are considered to have a very low probability of finding a suitable wavelength and as such, no effort is made to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "LEARNING automata [1] have attracted a considerable in-terest in the last three decades. They are adaptive decision making devices that operate in unknown stochastic environments and progressively improve their performance via a learning process. They have been initially used by psychologists and biologists to describe the human behavior from both psychological and biological viewpoints. Learning automata have made a significant impact on all areas of engineering. They can be applied to a broad range of modeling and control problems, which are characterized by nonlinearity and a high degree of uncertainty. Learning automata have some key features, which make them applicable to a broad range of applications: they combine rapid and accurate convergence with a low computational complexity.Learning is defined as any permanent change in behavior as a result of past experience, and a learning system should therefore have the ability to improve its behavior with time, toward a final goal. In a purely mathematical context, the goal of a learning system is the optimization of a function not known explicitly [2].",

We propose a protocol that makes use of a memory buffer at the Central Office (CO) at the providers side that allows for the reduction of the number of polling packets required to identify all the active wireless nodes that need to transmit data. This greatly increases the overall throughput of the network at a maximum percentage of 42% for the examined configurations. The high throughput provided by our proposal is achieved without the need to update current infrastructure and only needs a trivial amount of memory at the provider's side.",

The learning automaton used is a multifeedback automaton, specially designed for the receiver collision avoidance problem of WDM broadcast-and-select star networks. The asymptotic behavior of the system, which consists of the automata and the network, is analyzed. The probability of choosing each packet asymptotically tends to be proportional to the probability that no receiver collision will appear at the destination node of this packet.

However, HCCA is not efficient for all types of time-bounded traffic. This paper proposes an alternative protocol which could be adapted in hybrid coordination function (HCF). The priority-oriented adaptive control with QoS guarantee (POAC-QG) is a complete centralized channel access mechanism, it is able to guarantee QoS for all types of multimedia network applications, it enhances the parameterized traffic with priorities, and it supports time division access using slots.

The total lack of knowledge of the surrounding environment, a characteristic in-wrought with ad-hoc networking, is in most cases the main reason for the degradation of performance in Wireless Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). To effectively address this problem Wireless Medium Access through Record Keeping (WiMARK), a hybrid approach, is being proposed, combining the busy tone, the table-driven and the power-control protocols. Each node in WiMARK uses a local matrix where it stores the current condition of all its neighbouring nodes. The records of the matrix get updated by periodically transmitted Status Messages (SMs), which also have an RTS-like role in initiating a data packet transmission. The SMs that denote a critical change of status (ie the transition of a node from IDLE to RECEIVING_DATA state) are protected by a busy tone in order to be given the highest priority and thus maximize the chances of a successful transmission. In conjunction with this, the use of the power control scheme ensures the best possible bandwidth allocation in the area of interest.",

We assume that the two relays do not generate packets of their own, the users have saturated queues and that the communication employs random access to the medium with slotted time. We obtain analytical expressions for the arrival and service rates of the queues of the two relays and the stability conditions, under the collision channel. We investigate a model of the system, in which the users are divided into clusters, each being served by one relay, and show its advantages in terms of aggregate and throughput per user. We quantify the above, analytically for the case of the collision channel and through simulations for the case of Multi-Packet Reception (MPR), and we illustrate when the deployment of a second relay in the system yields significant advantages.",

Optical networks involve a number of technologies from the physics of light through protocols and networks architectures. In fact there is so much technology and know-how that most people involved with optical networks only have a full understanding of the narrow area they deal with. We start first examining the principles that govern light and its use as a wave guide, and then turn our focus to the various components that constitute an optical network and conclude with the description of all optical networks and wavelength-routed networks in greater detail.",

In many cases however, such broadcasting systems fail to exploit the full potential of the multiple antennas as they do not take into account the geographical distribution of clients within the coverage area of the system. This letter proposes an adaptive smart antenna-based wireless push system where the beamwidth of each smart antenna is altered based on the current placement of clients within the system area. Coupled with a modification of the broadcast schedule, the proposed approach significantly increases the performance observed by the system clients.",

HyTDMA/HTS can smoothly operate in diverse traffic environments of very high loads and bursty traffic, and it can still maintain maximum shared medium utilization while maintaining low packet delay times.

To this end, a novel merging of wireless data broadcasting and information hovering is proposed. The information hovering subsystem handles the least popular data items, allowing the most popular ones to be efficiently disseminated through the central wireless broadcasting.

Elastic optical networks offer flexibility in the way capacity is assigned to connections and are considered the most prevalent solution for the next generation metro/backbone networks. Reduction in energy consumption is an important issue in such networks. In this work, a new power aware algorithm is introduced, which selectively switches off network links under low utilization scenarios supporting energy efficiency. A new power-aware scheme is proposed, which reduces the total energy consumption, while maintaining a low blocking probability under dynamic traffic.

            "Abstract": "A new protocol for WDM star networks is introduced. According to the proposed Centralized Packet Filtering (CPF) protocol, more than one stations share each wavelength and transmit their packets in a random access fashion. An array of electrooptic tunable filters, which is placed at the network hub, allows at most one packet per wavelength to pass to the star coupler; at each time slot. In this way, channel collisions are eliminated. Furthermore, the selection of the passing packets is implemented in such a way that receiver conflicts are avoided.",

However, networks of this architectural form suffer from low efficiency when the offered traffic is bursty. Under bursty traffic conditions, it is probable that some wavelengths are idle, while some other wavelengths are overloaded. Therefore, the overall network performance is degraded. In this paper, a new MAC protocol which is capable of operating efficiently under bursty traffic conditions is introduced. According to the proposed protocol an array of tunable wavelength converters is placed at the network hub in order to uniformly distribute the incoming packets to the available wavelengths. In this way, the load is balanced between the wavelengths and consequently, the network performance is improved. The performance of the proposed protocol \u2026",

HIPERSIM simulates the HIPERLAN network under various conditions, assuming that the communication range and the sense range (signal detection range) of a node are different. In a wireless LAN, like HIPERLAN, the medium access protocol, the hidden nodes, the packet forwarding and the power saving mechanism are important issues that affect significantly the overall performance. The intention is to provide a HIPERLAN specialized tool (HIPERSIM) which can simulate most of the features of this WLAN protocol, in order to examine the performance of HIPERLAN. The main focus is to simulate the channel access mechanism accurately, so as to examine the effectiveness of the EY-NPMA protocol, and underline its advantages and the elements that need improvement. Also, in HIPERSIM, there is emphasis on the \u201chidden nodes\u201d issue. More specifically, we distinguish between the communication range and the signal detection range of a node, since this is a characteristic of the wireless nature and it affects the network operation. The simulation results show that EY-NPMA is effective and suitable for WLANs. Probably there could be some improvement in order to avert the collisions close to the receiver.",

The new automata use a stochastic estimator and are able to operate in nonstationary environments with high accuracy and a high adaptation rate. According to the stochastic estimator scheme, the estimates of the mean rewards of actions are computed stochastically. So, they are not strictly dependent on the environmental responses. The dependence between the stochastic estimates and the deterministic estimator's contents is more relaxed when the latter are old and probably invalid. In this way, actions that have not been selected recently have the opportunity to be estimated as \"optimal\", to increase their choice probability, and, consequently, to be selected. Thus, the estimator is always recently updated and consequently is able to be adapted to environmental changes.

Therefore, the most significant advantage of a push system is the minimal cost. This fact implies that hardware limitations do exist in the case of push systems. As a consequence, every related proposed algorithm should primarily be cost-effective. This attribute, however, has been overlooked in related research. In this paper, popular broadcast scheduling approaches are tested from an implementation cost aspect, and the results render them only conditionally realizable. Moreover, a new, cost-effective, adaptivity oriented schedule constructor is proposed as a realistic, minimal-cost solution.",

Traditional scheduling techniques define the nodes transmissions and receptions, by considering either channel assignment or nodespsila service order issue. Furthermore, they take into account data channels or receiverspsila availability, but they ignore the similarity between nodespsila demands which affect the scheduling length. In this paper a novel, clustering-driven scheduling approach is introduced. The proposed clustering driven - minimum scheduling latency (CD-MSL) scheme combines all the aforementioned information and creates groups of source nodes which present similar demands on the basis of their message destination nodes. Based on the obtained clusters, CD-MSL improves network performance by rearranging \u2026",

In this context, Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is the most popular technique for introducing concurrency among multiple user transmissions into the network and, thus, exploiting the huge amount of fibre bandwidth available under the severe limitations imposed by electronics speed on the maximum network access rate. This book extensively covers an important research area in optical networking, enabling readers to fully understand the concepts of optical LANs and learn details of architecture issues and control protocols. Through its careful focus on the local area, the book, covers the major architectural, topological and protocol issues regarding optical Local Area Networks (LANs) today. Considering that constant advances on optical component technology make all-optical WDM LANs all the more feasible for a wide commercial deployment, the book investigates thoroughly the crucial latter topic, ie the Media-Access Control (MAC) protocols that should be used. Besides introducing a noteworthy part of the vast literature on such protocols and providing some helpful distinguishing key protocol characteristics, the book is also innovative in focusing on a recent significant class of promising protocols whose operation is based on network feedback information. In this way, these adaptive protocols for optical LANs achieve an overall higher performance in comparison with many other \u2026",

This task has been proven to be NP-Hard and more recent works have discarded the scheduling cost attribute, focusing only on the minimization of the mean client serving time. In the context of the present work the scheduling cost is reinstated.

The goal is to construct a broadcast schedule that minimizes the mean query serving time and the mean scheduling cost at the same time. This task has been proven to be NP-Hard, and related studies have gradually discarded the scheduling cost attribute in an effort to simplify the problem. The present study reinstates the cost attribute, as well as any number of additional cost attributes per data item. The proposed, MULTIOPT scheduling algorithm then achieves optimal mean serving time and mean values for all costs concurrently. Comparison with brute-force results and related approaches yield optimality in all tested cases.",

According to the HARP protocol, all the ready stations transmit their packets in a slotted ALOHA-like fashion. An array of acoustooptic tunable filters which is placed at the network hub, allows at most one packet per wavelength to pass to the star coupler. In this way, collisions are eliminated. All the blocked packet transmissions are used as reservations for future transmissions. Thus, HARP is a hybrid protocol which stands between random access and reservation protocols and combines the advantages of both families of protocols. Analytical and simulation results are presented which indicate that a WDM passive star network operating under the HARP protocol achieves a high performance under any load conditions.",

Since it is often not possible or desirable for the clients to send any requests, the server should broadcast the data periodically. The performance of this system relies heavily on the proper scheduling of the broadcast data. The well known algorithm proposed by Vaidya and Hameed battles this challenge and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, this performance comes with a computational complexity linear to the number of data items that are broadcast. Furthermore, Vaidya's and Hameed's proposed solution for this time complexity degenerates performance. This paper proposes a scheduling algorithm for wireless push-based data broadcasting systems, which performs near optimal and has low computational complexity.

This paper identifies a number of prospective attacks and quantifies their impact on the performance of the system. A novel query filtering mechanism named Sensor Swarm is introduced to tackle these attacks. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme can ensure smooth system operation even under heavy attacks. Thus, a broadcast system that employs the Sensor Swarm filtering scheme can sustain excessive client misbehavior before resolving to Turing tests or compromising user anonymity.",

By lowering the available choices of AES variants from 3 to 2, we can increase the encryption speed process while sacrificing a nonsignificant amount of security. In our setup, the network component that enforces the encryption of the packets decides between AES 128 and 192 and then we compare the results with the ones that use all 3 variants.

            "Abstract": "A new approach about virtual topology reconfiguration in IP over WDM optical networks is introduced. Traditional reconfiguration algorithms adjust the virtual topology using two thresholds as a control mechanism. When the load of a lightpath exceeds the upper threshold, a new lightpath is activated to avoid congestion and possible data loss upon the arrival of traffic bursts. Similarly, when the load of a lightpath decreases below the low threshold, a lightpath is deactivated to release the underutilized network equipment. Reconfiguration algorithms use these thresholds to adjust the virtual topology to the constantly fluctuating IP traffic flows. While they save large amounts of energy in comparison to a static virtual topology scenario, they define the upper threshold arbitrary. This is not considered efficient, since setting a very low upper threshold as a precaution is a waste of lightpath capacity. Similarly, setting a high \u2026",

The adaptation is accomplished using a simple feedback from the clients. We propose that the simple feedback is sent only from clients whose distance from the server does not incur a significant timing overhead for the acknowledgment of an item.

The rule defines a ratio of item occurrences in a schedule, which minimizes the mean serving time. However, the actual number of each item's occurrences must be an integer. Therefore, the square root rule assumes large schedules, in order for the ratio to hold with acceptable precision. The present paper introduces an analysis-derived formula which connects the mean serving time and the size of the schedule. The relation shows that small schedules can also achieve near-optimal serving times. The analysis is validated through comparison with simulation and brute force-derived results. Finally, it is shown that minimizing the size of the schedule is also an efficient way of optimizing the aggregate scheduling cost.",

Secondly, an efficient adaptive prediction-based scheme is devised, which is able to adjust the downlink sub-frame capacity, accordingly to the traffic load, since the standard allows the downlink-to-uplink subframe ratio to be changeable from 3:1 to 1:1.

The traffic volume in metro and core networks is forecast to grow at very high rates, exceeding 30% per year for the next five years, and if the corresponding energy requirements grow analogously, they will sooner rather than later form a bottleneck for network communications. Thus, energy efficiency in optical networks is mandatory for the sustainability of the future Internet. The objectives of the current work are to identify the main causes of energy consumption for current fixed-grid wavelength division multiplexing and future flex-grid optical networks, and to propose and compare techniques for improving their energy efficiency.

These technologies enable the access and metro convergence and the joint and efficient control of the optical and the IP equipment used in these different network segments. Network monitoring information is collected and analyzed utilizing machine learning and big data analytics methods. Dynamic algorithms then decide how to adapt and dynamically optimize the unified network. The ARMONIA network enables unprecedented resource efficiency and provides advanced virtualization services, reducing the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) and lowering the barriers for the introduction of new services. We demonstrate the benefits of the ARMONIA network in the context of dynamic resource provisioning of network slices.

This paper proposes a push system that continuously adapts to the demand pattern of the client population in order to reflect the overall popularity of each data item. The adaptation is accomplished using a simple feedback from the clients. We propose that the simple feedback is sent only from clients whose distance from the server does not incur a significant timing overhead for the acknowledgment of an item. Simulation results are presented which reveal satisfactory performance in highspeed environments with a-priori unknown and dynamic client demands.",

            "Abstract": "A significant amount of research has been carried out in the UK during the last decade in order to establish an analytical specification for pavement foundation design. The new approach aims to establish the performance parameters of the materials prior to designing using modern laboratory testing techniques and hence set target values for the end product. The method seeks to abandon CBR testing, an empirical assessment of disputable effectiveness in establishing detailed design parameters. Research on the performance parameters of untreated soils has been done, however the area of stabilised materials requires further investigation. Clay soils consisting predominantly of illite, such as Oxford Clay, are commonly found in the UK and elsewhere. Due to their mineralogy, these soils are susceptible to water ingress so when they are to be used as pavement subgrades in wet environments it is common to treat them with arbitrary amounts of lime/cement prior to compaction in order to achieve high post-compaction CBR values. The result is uneconomical design as well as a waste of materials, let alone questionable performance. This paper presents the performance parameters of lime-treated Oxford Clay as established through a repeated load triaxial testing regime. Clearly, for the soil used herein, the addition of lime alone at the appropriate amount creates a layer that can confidently be used for pavement foundation construction since it performs satisfactorily under adverse, though realistic, curing and testing conditions.",

The classic pursuit of data broadcast scheduling has revolved around QoS metrics, such as the minimization of the mean serving time or jitter.

Content discarding in single channel systems was then proven to maximize the service ratio. The present work introduces a novel algorithm for service-ratio-oriented assignment of data to multiple channels with different bandwidths.

            "Abstract": "During the last two decades, the IEEE 8201.11 family has multiplied data rate transmissions in wireless local area networks (WLANs). This progress is based on the adoption of new technologies concerning physical layer (PHY), combined with the enhancements in the medium access control (MAC) layer. Radio over Fiber (RoF) is a technology which can further extend this progress, combining the benefits of optical fiber and wireless networks. The current IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is contention based, which leads to low utilization of the RoF PHY data rate and on the other hand cannot handle the effects of long propagation delays in RoF networks. In this paper, we present a new Hybrid Link Time Division Multiple Access (HL-TDMA) MAC protocol which addresses the above shortcomings and enhances the performance of both conventional and RoF WLANs. Then, through simulation, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, which is shown to be superior to relevant RoF WLAN protocols in the literature.",

The core power management process comprises distinct states representing the desired power management transitions, while two modes: namely, the doze and the cyclic sleep mode, are defined. This study provides an analytical model for power consumption computation of an optical network unit (ONU), assuming that the two modes are enabled in the ONU operation.

The flexible nature of elastic optical networks (EONs) effectively uses spectral resources for communication by allocating the minimum required bandwidth to customer requirements. Since the energy consumption of such networks scales with the magnitude of bandwidth demand, many studies have addressed the issue of energy wastage in optical networks. Learning Automata are Artificial Intelligence tools that have been used in networking algorithms where adaptivity to the characteristics of the network environment can result in a significant increase in network performance. This work introduces a new adaptive power-aware algorithm, which selectively switches off bandwidth variable optical transponders (BVTs) under low utilization scenarios supporting energy efficiency. A novel algorithm which uses LA technology and significantly reduces the total energy consumption, while maintaining low bandwidth blocking probability (BBP), is proposed. LA mechanism applied in this work, aims to find the best number of BVTs to be switched off so as for the BBP not to be affected. Simulation results are presented, which indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves a power saving of up to 50%, compared to non-adaptive solutions.",

In this paper influential and top performing, well-known algorithms are evaluated from a cost aspect. It is shown that radical improvements are required for them to be realizable. Moreover, a new cost-efficient broadcast scheduling algorithm is introduced, achieving nearly top performance with minimal CPU and memory requirements.

At each time instant, only one packet per wavelength is allowed to pass to the star coupler. Therefore, collisions are avoided and the network performance is improved. The proposed module is based on the use of optical logic circuits for controlling the passing of the transmitted packets to the star coupler, without the need of optical to electronic translation or electronic processing of the network feedback information. In this way, the processing time is drastically reduced, while the need for slowly tunable optical filters is eliminated. Furthermore, due to the all-optical nature of the network hub, the reliability of the system is improved.",

However, the determination of the most suitable ratio is left open to the network designers and the research community. Existing scheduling and mapping schemes are inflexibly designed. In this paper, a novel adaptive mapping scheme is proposed aiming to dynamically adjust the downlink-to-uplink ratio, following adequately the modification of the load requests with respect to both downlink and uplink directions. A learning automaton is exploited in order to sense the performance of the downlink and uplink mapping processes and to determine the most appropriate length ratio of both sub-frames in order to maximize the network performance. The suggested ratio determination scheme is evaluated through realistic scenarios and it is compared with static schemes that maintain a fixed ratio \u2026",

Clients are organized into groups and may request a set of items. The server side sends an item per time and then clients respond with a feedback, if the transmitted item is the desirable one. The novel model tries to adapt quickly and precisely to the dynamic changes of the clients\u2019 demands. Initially, the suggested scheme learns the intentions of the connected clients for a specific number of broadcasts and then begins to predict the clients\u2019 requests. Finally, the server side follows the results of the prediction procedure, by sending the appropriate items. Concurrently, the prediction module keeps a request history, which is updated by the clients\u2019 feedbacks. The presented scheme is compared with a learning automata-based scheme and the simulation results indicate that the novel scheme induces an improvement, in terms of mean response time.",

Since the energy crisis and environmental protection are of increasing concern in recent years, many research efforts are in use to save energy. In this context, the present research focuses on reducing the energy consumption of an IP over WDM backbone network using the lightpath bypass strategy. Schemes based on lightpath bypass strategy were previously proposed aimed at reducing energy consumption. Although these approaches, which perform aggregation of traffic, can increase the overall power saving, they suffer from low reuse of lightpaths. To overcome the above drawback this paper proposes a new efficient heuristic called Intelligent Search Lightpath Bypass (ISLB) which will focus on energy efficiency issues related to the planning phase of a WDM optical network.

The drawback of this approach is that anchor nodes increase the overall cost and complexity of the system. To address this problem, this letter proposes a novel, anchor node\u2013free algorithm that can achieve a useful estimate for actual distance between 2 nodes, by analytically finding an estimate for the average maximum distance traveled per hop and multiplying with the hop count.

We assume that the two relays do not have packets of their own and the users have saturated queues and random access to the medium with slotted time. We obtain analytical expressions for the arrival and service rates of the queues of the two relays and the stability conditions. We also study a model of the system, in which the users are divided into two clusters, and show its advantages in terms of aggregate and per user throughput. We quantify the above, analytically and through simulations, for different number of users and we indicate the conditions under which the deployment of a second relay in the system provides significant advantages.",

In many applications, clients are grouped into several groups, each one located in a different region, with the members of each group having similar demands. In fixed-bit-rate wireless broadcast systems, transmission power is set at such a level that guarantees the necessary level of received energy per bit for all clients in the service area so that they can operate under a predefined bit error rate level. However, as in wireless cellular environments, the path loss of wireless signals is typically inverse to the fourth power of the transmitter/receiver distance, there exists an increasing redundancy in the level of received energy per bit for decreasing distances from the server's antenna.

The coordination is achieved with one demand (or traffic) matrix, which saves the predetermination of the timeslots each node transmits. Each transmission frame (or cycle) has two phases: the control phase and the data phase.

The results reveal that this new paradigm can successfully enhance the message delivery process in a chemotaxis-based biological nanonetwork.",

Up to now, popular clustering approaches build clusters based on usage patterns derived from users' page preferences. This paper emphasizes the need to discover similarities in users' accessing behavior with respect to the time locality of their navigational acts. In this context, we present two time-aware clustering approaches for tuning and binding the page and time visiting criteria. The two tracks of the proposed algorithms define clusters with users that show similar visiting behavior at the same time period, by varying the priority given to page or time visiting. The proposed algorithms are evaluated using both synthetic and real data sets and the experimentation has shown that the new clustering schemes result in enriched clusters compared to those created by the conventional non-time-aware user clustering \u2026",

The work presented in this paper focuses on the semantic representation of knowledge and its utilization for mission planning and plan adaptation in a simulated MCM environment using the Nessie AUV. With respect to semantic knowledge representation this work builds upon the KnowRob system. Various ontologies model the environment, the AUV components and capabilities as well as the planning domain. For planning and plan adaptation we use the POPF Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planner. Plan adaptation reuses previous plans when calculating a new plan thus saving computational resources.

The clustering process aims at organizing the network nodes into groups in terms of their packetspsila requests per channel. Then, NOC-PS rearranges the nodespsila service order beginning from the cluster with long-length requests and ending to the cluster with short-length requests. The novelty of NOC-PS is that it applies separate clustering to nodes with high and low priority packets, while it also differentiates their scheduling, since high-priority packets have the privilege of being scheduled prior to low-priority ones.

This paper proposes a mechanism that exploits locality of demand in order to increase the performance of wireless data dissemination systems. It trades the received energy per bit redundancy at distances smaller than the radius of the service area for an increased bit rate and thus increased transmission speed for items demanded by clients at such distances. The paper focuses on performance optimization of clients located around the geographical area of interest. It does so by protecting degradation caused by clients that are located elsewhere and demand the same information items with clients inside that area.

The protocol adopted is pre-transmission coordination-based and packet collisions have been eliminated due to predetermination of the timeslots each node transmits in a demand matrix. The requests of the transmitted packets are predicted through Markov chains in order to reduce the calculation time of the final scheduling matrix. This is accomplished by pipelining the schedule computation. The innovation that this algorithm introduces is to modify the service sequence of the node. The proposed algorithm is studied via extensive simulation results and it is proved that changing the sequence that nodes transmit, from the node with the largest number of requests to the node with the fewest requests, that there is an increase in the throughput of the network, with a minimum (almost zero) cost in mean time delay and in delay \u2026",

EDCA seems capable of differentiating the traffic, however, it exhibits great overhead that limits the actually available bandwidth and degrades the overall performance. This work proposes an alternative protocol in place of EDCA. The Low Energy Priority Oriented Adaptive Polling (LEPOAP) is a collision free MAC protocol, implements a power saving mechanism, employs traffic priorities, and is able to provide QoS for all types of multimedia applications, while efficiently supporting background data traffic.

The proposed technique relies on the novel data compatibility distance, which is introduced herein. Clustering techniques are then used for defining optimal data subsets. Comparison with related work and brute force-derived solutions yielded superior and near-optimal service ratios in all test cases.
