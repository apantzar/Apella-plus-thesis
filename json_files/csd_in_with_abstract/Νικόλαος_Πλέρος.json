It comprises a hybrid broadcast-and-select (BS)/wavelength-routed architecture, with the BS layout being responsible for identifying the desired cluster of outgoing ports, while the wavelength-routed switch part forwards then the data to the specific outgoing port. Contention resolution at the BS switch part is offered through an \u03bcm-SOI integrated optical delay line bank and wavelength-routing is realized by means of a \u03bcm-SOI 3 \u00d7 3 echelle grating router, while semiconductor optical amplifier Mach-Zehnder interferometers are employed for wavelength conversion purposes.

The flexibility of the link is highlighted in two 3-user scenarios with 0.6 Gb/s uplink traffic: A Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) scheme with the PAA receiving isotropically at different frequencies and a Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM) scheme where the same V-band frequency is re-used by all three users but are selectively received by the PAA using beamsteering. Error-free transmission with 100 Mbaud QPSK per user is demonstrated for both cases, forming the first comparison of FDM and SDM towards multi-user 5G mmWave/IFoF networks.",

Powerful fully programmable gate array boards located inside the access nodes convert the Ethernet-based traffic to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-modulated intermediate frequency (IF) waveforms, supporting the A-IFoF propagation through the optical legacy infrastructure. Coexistence of the 5G traffic with the residential legacy traffic for the field propagation is achieved through utilization of unused C-band channels and wavelength-division multiplexing. To this extent, we experimentally demonstrate the downlink operation of a converged A-IFoF/mmWave link, over Telecom Italia\u2019s legacy infrastructure located at Turin \u2026",

Fabrication tolerances about the optimum parameter values are also assessed. In addition, the effect of a longitudinal metallic stripe gap on coupling efficiency is quantified, since such gaps have been observed in fabricated structures. Finally, theoretical results are compared against insertion loss measurements, carried out for two distinct sets of samples comprising rib and wire SOI waveguides, respectively.",

Moreover, a Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture will be mainly adopted, which places the BaseBand Units (BBUs) at centralized locations, thus offering cost-efficient energy supply and climate control. To this end, efficient Medium Transparent-Medium Access Control (MT-MAC) protocols are needed to ensure the optimal exploitation of both media. In this paper, we propose a gated service MT-MAC protocol (gMT-MAC) for Millimeter Wave (mmWave) Analog Radio-over-Fiber (A-RoF) C-RANs. GMT-MAC grants a transmission window to each user equal to the time needed for its requested traffic to be successfully sent. A mean packet delay model is also proposed and verified by means of simulation. The performance of gMT-MAC is evaluated for \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Electronic Content Addressable Memories (CAM) implement Address Look-Up (AL) table functionalities of network routers; however, they typically operate in the MHz regime, turning AL into a critical network bottleneck. In this communication, we demonstrate the first steps towards developing optical CAM alternatives to enable a re-engineering of AL memories. Firstly, we report on the photonic integration of Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-Mach Zehnder Interferometer (SOA-MZI)-based optical Flip-Flop and Random Access Memories on a monolithic InP platform, capable of storing the binary prefix-address data-bits and the outgoing port information for next hop routing, respectively. Subsequently the first optical Binary CAM cell (B-CAM) is experimentally demonstrated, comprising an InP Flip-Flop and a SOA-MZI Exclusive OR (XOR) gate for fast search operations through an XOR-based bit comparison, yielding an error-free 10 Gb/s operation. This is later extended via physical layer simulations in an optical Ternary-CAM (T-CAM) cell and a 4-bit Matchline (ML) configuration, supporting a third state of the \u201clogical X\u201d value towards wildcard bits of network subnet masks. The proposed functional CAM and Random Access Memories (RAM) sub-circuits may facilitate light-based Address Look-Up tables supporting search operations at 10 Gb/s and beyond, paving the way towards minimizing the disparity with the frantic optical transmission linerates, and fast re-configurability through multiple simultaneous Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) memory access requests.

Instead, sinusoidal and sigmoidal nonlinearities are usually employed, rendering the training process unstable and difficult to tune, mainly due to vanishing gradient phenomena.

Simulations came up with a grating coupler layout capable of theoretical coupling losses lower than 3dB for 1550 nm in TM configuration. A fully etched grating structure was chosen for fabrication simplicity and the optimal filling factor was found. The structures were fabricated using proximity error correction (PEC) and show a uniform coupling efficiency for all couplers. Therefore they are well-suited for all applications which demand for stable fiber-to-chip coupling.

Its main application targets include dense and Hot-Spot Area networks, promoting the deployment of mmWave massive MIMO Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) that can offer wireless data-rates ranging from 25Gbps up to 400Gbps depending on the fronthaul technology employed.

Physically, the optical cache is implemented externally in a separate chip located next to the CPU die. The cache interconnection system is realized through WDM optical interfaces that connect the shared cache module with the processing cores and the Main Memory via spatial-multiplexed optical waveguides; hence, the CPU-DRAM communication completely takes place in the optical domain. To evaluate the shared optical cache approach, we carry out system-level simulations of 6 realistic processor parallel workloads via the Gem5 platform. The optical cache architecture is compared against the conventional electronic Chip Multiprocessor topology that uses dedicated on-chip L1 electronic caches and a shared L2 cache. The results show significant reduction in the L1 miss \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In order to cope with the ever-increasing traffic demands and stringent latency constraints, next generation, ie, sixth generation (6G) networks, are expected to leverage Network Function Virtualization (NFV) as an enabler for enhanced network flexibility. In such a setup, in addition to the traditional problems of user association and traffic routing, Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement needs to be jointly considered. To that end, in this paper, we focus on the joint network and computational resource allocation, targeting low network power consumption while satisfying the Service Function Chain (SFC), throughput, and delay requirements. Unlike the State-of-the-Art (SoA), we also take into account the Access Network (AN), while formulating the problem as a general Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Due to the high complexity of the proposed optimal solution, we also propose a low-complexity energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm, which was shown to significantly outperform the SoA, by achieving up to 78% of the optimal energy efficiency with up to 742 times lower complexity. Finally, we describe an Orchestration Framework for the automated orchestration of vertical-driven services in Network Slices and describe how it encompasses the proposed algorithm towards optimized provisioning of heterogeneous computation and network resources across multiple network segments.

The aim of the project was to demonstrate the basic building blocks of a co-packaged optical system. Two-dimensional silicon photonics arrays with 64 modulators were fabricated. Novel modulation schemes based on slow light modulation were developed to assist in achieving an efficient performance of the module. Integration of DFB laser sources within each cell in the matrix was demonstrated as well using wafer bonding between the InP and SOI wafers. Improved semiconductor quantum dot MBE growth, characterization and gain stack designs were developed. Packaging of these 2D photonic arrays in a chiplet configuration was demonstrated using a vertical integration approach in which the optical interconnect matrix was flip-chip assembled on top of a CMOS mimic chip with 2D vertical fiber coupling. The optical chiplet was further assembled on a substrate to facilitate integration with the multi-chip module of the co-packaged system with a switch surrounded by several such optical chiplets. We summarize the features of the L3MATRIX co-package technology platform and its holistic toolbox of technologies to address the next generation of computing challenges.",

These nonlinear effects that present the most severe problem and limit the usefulness of SOAs as optical amplifiers in lightwave systems can be proven attractive in optically transparent networks. The origin of the nonlinearities lies in the SOA gain saturation and in its correlation with the phase of the propagating wave, since the carrier density changes induced by the input signals are affecting not only the gain but also the refractive index in the active region of the SOA. The carrier density dynamics within the SOA are very fast (picosecond scale) and thus the gain responds in tune with the fluctuations in the input power on a bit by bit basis even for optical data at 10 or 40 Gb/s bit-rates (Ramaswami & Sivarajan, 2002).If more than one signal is injected into the SOA, their nonlinear interaction will lead to XPM between the signals. However, in order to take advantage of the XPM phenomenon and create functional devices, the SOAs have to be placed in an interferometric configuration such as a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) that converts phase changes in the signals to intensity variations at its output exploiting interference effects. Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-based Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (SOA-MZIs) have been widely used in the past years as all-optical high speed switches for signal \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Plasmonics have been identified as an ideal platform for ultra-sensitive, label-free biosensors mainly due to the high field confinement on a metal-dielectric interface and the resulting strong light-matter interaction offered by surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) that can be entirely exposed to test analytes. Well-established SPR-based biosensors exploiting propagating SPRs yield superior specifications regarding bulk sensitivity compared to localized counterparts leading to already commercial available sensor devices. However, most of these systems require bulky prism-based configurations to couple light into the Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) mode impeding system miniaturization. In addition, SPR-based sensors suffer from intrinsic high propagation losses restricting the potential for multiple on-chip functionalities. In this context, co-integration of plasmonics with a low-loss photonic platform emerges as a \u2026",

The MEC concept utilizes a mechanism for restructuring the virtual multi-cell area according to the user's mobility pattern, so that a virtual antenna group moves together with the mobile user. A mathematical model is developed and performance evaluation is also conducted and presented, demonstrating zero packet loss and call dropping probability values in high-rate wireless services for a broad range of mobile speeds up to 40 m/sec and independently of the fiber link distances.",

            "Abstract": "Significant research efforts, both industrial and academic, have been committed in the direction of Rack-scale computing through resource disaggregation, that aims to increase resource utilization at a reduced energy and cost envelope. However, the realization of resource disaggregation necessitates an underlying network infrastructure that can compete with a challenging set of requirements including low-latency performance and high-port count connectivity, as well as high data-rate operation. At the same time, it is crucial for the interconnection architecture to be able to accommodate efficient delivery of traffic with different locality characteristics. We propose a dual-layer locality-aware optical interconnection architecture for disaggregated Data Centers by combining the STREAMS silicon-based on-board communication paradigm with the disaggregation-oriented Hipo\u03bbaos high-port count switch. Simulation evaluation of a 256-node disaggregated system, comprising 32 optically-interconnected 8-socket boards, revealed up to 100% throughput and mean, p99 latencies not higher than 335nsec and 610nsec, respectively, when a 50: 50 ratio between onand off-board traffic is employed. Evaluation of the same layout with 75: 25 on-/off-board traffic yields even lower mean and p99 latency at 210ns and 553ns, respectively.",

In this scheme, network coding is performed on-the-fly at the central office and the resultant packet is broadcasted at the client nodes, where the decoding takes place. We demonstrate experimental results of OPNC using OOK data signals modulated on a 10 GHz SC with the aid of a second all-optical XOR gate for the decoding process at the client's site, reporting error-free performance for both synchronous \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have been extensively used in a wealth of tele\u2010com and datacom applications as a powerful building block that features large optical gain, all-optical gating function, fast response, and ease of integration with other func\u2010tional semiconductor devices. As fabrication technologies are steadily maturing toward enhanced yield, SOAs are foreseen to play a pivotal role in complex photonics integrated circuits (PICs) of the near future. From a design standpoint, accurate numerical modeling of SOA devices is required toward optimizing PICs response from a system perspective, while enhanced circuit complexity calls for efficient solvers. In this book chapter, we present established experimentally validated SOA numerical modeling techniques and a gain parameterization procedure applicable to a wide range of SOA devices. Moreover, we describe multigrid concepts and implicit schemes that have been only recently pre\u2010sented to SOA modeling, enabling adaptive time stepping at the SOA output, with dense sampling at transient phenomena during the gain recovery and scarce sampling during the steady-state response. Overall, a holistic simulation methodology approach along with recent research trends are described, aiming to form the basis of further develop\u2010ments in SOA modeling.",

            "Abstract": "Today, the increasing demand for fast routing processes has turned the address look-up (AL) operation into one of the main critical performance operations in modern optical networks, since it conventionally relies on slow-performing AL tables. Specifically, AL memory tables are comprised of content addressable memories (CAMs) for storing a known route of the forwarding information base of the router, and random access memories (RAMs) for storing the respective output port for this route. They thus allow for a one-cycle search operation of a packet's destination address, yet they typically operate at speeds well below 1 GHz, in contrast with the vastly increasing optical line rates. In this paper, we present our overall vision towards light-based optical AL memory functionalities that may facilitate faster router AL operations, as the means to replace slow-performing electronic counterparts.

            "Abstract": "In recent years it has become evident that the increasing need for huge bandwidth and throughput capabilities in Data Center and High Performance Computing (HPC) environments can no longer be met by bandwidth-limited electrical interconnects. Besides their limited capacity, electrical wiring technologies impose great energy and size limitations originating from the requirements to handle the vast amount of information that needs to be exchanged across all hierarchical communication levels within Data Centers and HPCs, ie rack-to-rack, backplane, chip-to-chip and on-chip interconnections. This reality has inevitably led to a clearly shaped roadmap for bringing optics into the spotlight and replacing electrical with optical interconnects, thereby overtaking the bottleneck in traffic exchange imposed by electrical wires [1]. Hence, the optical technology should penetrate into intra-rack and board-to-board transmission links, considering that the optical fiber as a large-bandwidth transmission medium [2] is used only in commercial systems for rack-torack communication [3].",

The proposed router platform relies on a novel dual-ring Dielectric-Loaded Surface Plasmon Polariton (DLSPP) 2x2 switch heterointegrated on a Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) photonic motherboard that is responsible for traffic multiplexing and header processing functionalities. We present experimental results of a Poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA)-loaded dual-resonator DLSPP waveguide structure that uses two racetrack resonators of 5.5 \u03bcm radius and 4\u03bcm-long straight sections and operates as a passive add/drop filtering element. We derive its frequency-domain transfer function, confirm its add/drop experimental spectral response, and proceed to a circuit-level model for dual-ring DLSPP designs supporting 2x2 thermo-optic switch operation. The validity of our circuit-level modeled 2x2 thermo-optic switch is verified by means of respective full vectorial three-dimensional Finite Element Method (3D-FEM) simulations. The router setup is completed by means of two 4x1 SOI multiplexing circuits, each one employing four cascaded 2nd order micro-ring configurations with 100GHz spaced resonances. Successful interconnection between the DLSPP switching matrix and the SOI circuitry is performed through a butt-coupling design that, as shown via 3D-FEM analysis, allows for small coupling losses of as low as 2.2 dB. The final router architecture is evaluated through a co-operative simulation environment, demonstrating successful 2x2 routing for two incoming 4-wavelength Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) optical packet \u2026",

This Q factor is one of the highest that ever reported for a plasmonic component and motivate their future use in plasmonic based switches. The plasmonic resonators have been implemented as a first preliminary stage for the design of 2x2 and X-add-drop switches. Based on the theoretical and experimental results from the transmission spectra of the drop and through ports of the switch and the thermo-optics response of a racetrack resonator coupled to a single waveguide, we conclude that reasonable switching exploiting the thermo-optics effect is achievable.",

It is of great importance to characterize the quality of the optical channel with a proper model, taking into consideration the interesting challenges of the mobility and the slanted path of the optical beam in order to design a high performance communication link. In this paper we investigate the performance of a mobile link between a fixed GS and an UAV in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) and average Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

For a PLSPPW excited by sub-nanosecond long pulses, we find that the thermo-absorption process leads to modulation depths up to 50% and features an activation time around 2ns whereas the relaxation time is around 800ns, four-fold smaller than the cooling time of the metal film itself. Next, we observe the photo-thermal activation of PLSPPW racetrack shaped resonators at a time scale of 300ns followed however by a long cooling time (18\u03bcs) attributed to the poor heat diffusivity of the polymer.

Silicon-based photonics offer very low losses, high optical mode confinement while they meet most fabrication requirements of standard CMOS process lines [1]-[3]. Despite this remarkable progress, further miniaturization of PICs is bounded by the inherent diffraction limit of light imposed by optical waveguides. In this respect, Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) based waveguides offer unique ability to guide light at sub-wavelength scales and confine light into a width of few tens of nanometers due to coupling to electron plasma oscillations near the metal interface [4].

The circuit is completely based upon hybrid integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometric (MZI) switches as it employs four cascaded MZIs, each one performing a different functionality. The 3R burst-mode reception is achieved with the combination of two discrete all-optical subsystems. A reshape, reamplify BMR employing a single MZI is used first to perform power equalization of the incoming bursts and provide error-free data reception. This novel approach is experimentally demonstrated to operate error-free, even for a 9-dB dynamic range of power variation between bursty data packets and for a wide range of average input power.

For a PLSPPW excited by sub-nanosecond long pulses, we find that the thermo-absorption process leads to modulation depths up to 50% and features an activation time around 2ns whereas the relaxation time is around 800ns, four-fold smaller than the cooling time of the metal film itself. Next, we observe the photo-thermal activation of PLSPPW racetrack shaped resonators at a time scale of 300ns followed however by a long cooling time (18\u03bcs) attributed to the poor heat diffusivity of the polymer.

An initialization scheme that can be used to efficiently train deep photonic networks that employ quadratic sinusoidal activation functions is proposed in this paper. The proposed initialization scheme can overcome these limitations, leading to faster and more stable training of deep photonic neural networks.

The proposed scheme comprises a low-finesse Fabry-Perot Filter (FPF) followed by a Quantum-Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (QD-SOA) and exploits the memory properties of the passive filtering element and the nonlinear gain characteristics of the homogeneously broadened spectral regions within the QD-SOA in order to acquire the clock signal of multiple incoming wavelengths on a per packet basis. Simulation-based performance analysis shows successful operation both at 40 Gb/s and 160 Gb/s with data packets at four wavelengths entering simultaneously the circuit, yielding a packet clock signal for every incoming data packet with only a few bits rise time and with significantly reduced timing jitter compared to the jitter of the original data.",

In addition, with electronic Address Look-Up tables operating still at speeds of only up to 1 GHz, the constant increase in optical switch i/o data rates will yield severe latency and energy overhead during forwarding operations. In this invited paper, we present an overview of our recent research, introducing an all-optical RAM cell that performs both Write and Read functionalities at 10Gb/s, reporting on a 100% speed increase compared to state-of-the-art optical/electrical RAM demonstrations.

            "Abstract": "Analog fronthauling is currently promoted as a bandwidth and energy-efficient solution that can meet the requirements of the Fifth Generation (5G) vision for low latency, high data rates and energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose an analog optical fronthaul 5G architecture, fully aligned with the emerging Centralized-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) concept. The proposed architecture exploits the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique and multicarrier intermediate-frequency-over-fiber (IFoF) signal generation per wavelength in order to satisfy the demanding needs of hotspot areas. Particularly, the fronthaul link employs photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based WDM optical transmitters (Txs) at the baseband unit (BBU), while novel reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs) cascaded in an optical bus are used at the remote radio head (RRH) site, to facilitate reconfigurable wavelength switching functionalities up to 4 wavelengths. An aggregate capacity of 96 Gb/s has been reported by exploiting two WDM links carrying multi-IF band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals at a baud rate of 0.5 Gbd with sub-carrier (SC) modulation of 64-QAM. All signals exhibited error vector magnitude (EVM) values within the acceptable 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) limits of 8%. The longest reach to place the BBU away from the hotspot was also investigated, revealing acceptable EVM performance for fiber lengths up to 4.8 km. View Full-Text",

For the first time, it is shown that such devices can provide enhanced intensity modulation reduction to return-to-zero (RZ) formatted input pulse trains, when the SOA is saturated with a strong continuous-wave (CW) input signal. A novel theoretical platform has been developed in the frequency domain, which reveals that the intensity modulation of the input pulse train can be suppressed by more than 10 dB at the output. This stems from the presence of the strong CW signal that transforms the sinusoidal transfer function of the interferometric switch into an almost flat, strongly nonlinear curve. This behavior has also been verified experimentally for both periodically and randomly degraded, in terms of intensity modulation, signals at 10 Gb/s using the ultrafast \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Bringing photonics and electronics into a common integration platform can unleash unprecedented performance capabilities in data communication and sensing applications. Plasmonics were proposed as the key technology that can merge ultra-fast photonics and low-dimension electronics due to their metallic nature and their unique ability to guide light at sub-wavelength scales. However, inherent high losses of plasmonics in conjunction with the use of CMOS incompatible metals like gold and silver which are broadly utilized in plasmonic applications impede their broad utilization in Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs). To overcome those limitations and fully exploit the profound benefits of plasmonics, they have to be developed along two technology directives. 1) Selectively co-integrate nanoscale plasmonics with low-loss photonics and 2) replace noble metals with alternative CMOS-compatible counterparts \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are an efficient high-performance optical access solution that is able to provide huge bandwidth in a resourceful way through the incorporation of inexpensive passive elements. PONs have been widely used for the provision of high-demand services to a number of wired end-users. However, the PON configuration may be also used for the support of wireless end-users through the integration of the PON with a wireless access system. This converged network can therefore take advantage of the mobility features of the wireless network and the high-bandwidth benefits of the PON. In this article, we highlight the basic features of the existing optical-wireless access systems. Moreover, we discuss the challenges in the medium access control layer of the converged network and viable solutions for the efficient Quality of Service management support.",

            "Abstract": "Next generation, ie, fifth generation (5G), networks will leverage both fiber and wireless (FiWi) technology to meet the challenging 5G traffic demands. Moreover, a Cloud-Radio Access Network (CRAN) architecture will be mainly adopted, which places the BaseBand Units (BBUs) at centralized locations, thus offering cost-efficient energy supply and climate control. To this end, efficient Medium Transparent-Medium Access Control (MT-MAC) protocols are needed to ensure the optimal exploitation of both media. In this paper, we propose a gated service MT-MAC protocol (gMT-MAC) for Millimeter Wave (mmWave) Analog Radio-over-Fiber (A-RoF) C-RANs. GMT-MAC grants a transmission window to each user equal to the time needed for its requested traffic to be successfully sent. A mean packet delay model is also proposed and verified by means of simulation. The performance of gMT-MAC is evaluated for different network load conditions, number of Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) and optical availability values. The provided results prove the suitability of gMT-MAC to meet the sub-ms delay requirements of latency-critical 5G services.",

In this paper we focus on Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) network architectures at 60 GHz band, which recently attracts high attention for delivering broadband wireless access services. We introduce a Markov chain model that depicts the behavior of the dominant handoff algorithms in such topologies and calculates cell blocking probability and cell utilization. Furthermore, we improve the efficiency of handoff algorithms by extending the model with Call Admission Control (CAC) policies. The results of the proposed models are presented and verify that the combination of CAC policies with handoff schemes increases the desired performance.",

At the same time, it is crucial for the interconnection architecture to be able to accommodate efficient delivery of traffic with different locality characteristics. We propose a dual-layer locality-aware optical interconnection architecture for disaggregated Data Centers by combining the STREAMS silicon-based on-board communication paradigm with the disaggregation-oriented Hipo\u03bbaos high-port count switch. Simulation evaluation of a 256-node disaggregated system, comprising 32 optically-interconnected 8-socket boards, revealed up to 100% throughput and mean, p99 latencies not higher than 335 nsec and 610 nsec, respectively, when a 50: 50 ratio between on-and off-board traffic is employed.

Time-resolved electrical measurement techniques, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and microwave (MW) conductivity, are primarily used to deconvolute ultrafast processes and to directly access behavior of charged species from the ps to \u00b5s timescales. Transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy were also utilized to gain insight on carrier population dynamics and radiatively recombining charges. Photogenerated charged species were converted into highly mobile charges (\u00b5e = 12.5 cm2V-1s-1 and \u00b5h = 7.5 cm2V-1s-1) almost instantaneously (< 0.2 ps), while the remaining loosely bounded excitons dissociate into mobile charges after 2-3 ps. This high mobility is maintained for at least 1 ns as obtained by THz spectroscopy, while its lifetime is at least few tens of \u00b5s as measured by the MW conductivity technique. Lowering the temperature increases carrier mobilities with T-1.6.Dependence and a 75 meV barrier energy is required for temperature-activated recombination. Finally, injection of hole from MAPbI3 to Spiro-OMeTAD was found to be ultrafast and the state and population of dark holes dictate its recombination.",

The oversubscribed sub-6 GHz wireless band is lacking the necessary bandwidth to support the envisioned 5G data rates, suggesting the transition to mm-wave bands as the only viable scenario. In conjunction with the cell densification that is required to achieve the desired frequency reuse factor, it becomes obvious that the current CPRI-based fronthaul cannot cope with massive multi-Gbps traffic streams and a paradigm shift in resource allocation and network intelligence is necessary. To this end we propose the Medium Transparent MAC protocols as the solution towards forming and managing a converged mm-wave FiWi fronthaul infrastructure.

Signal integrity is traditionally considered as a limiting factor due to various non-linearities attributed to the microwave photonic link, expected to be further exacerbated by the RF-chain of beamforming Phased Array Antennas (PAAs). The letter proposes the end-to-end evaluation of FiWi analog links as unified communication channels rather than separately for the radio or optical part, presenting a link with a 32-element 60 GHz PAA, 1 m V-band distance, 10 km fiber and 10 dB dynamic range. The measurements reveal a third order Intercept Point (IIP3) of 4.8 dBm, compared to 22.8 dBm exclusively for the optics, pinpointing the V-band radio as the main source of degradation rather than the microwave photonic link.

            "Abstract": "We present a multiwavelength ring laser source using an uncoated semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) for providing both gain as well as the comb-like filtering function in the cavity. A SOA-based ring laser source oscillates over a wide bandwidth range due to heterogeneous spectral broadening and the broad gain spectrum of the SOA. Multi-wavelength operation can be obtained by inserting comb-like filters inside the cavity. Fig. 1 (a) shows the relative simple experimental setup used. Gain was provided by a bulk, 500\u00b5m long, InGaAsP/InP ridge waveguide SOA (OptoSpeed, SA) with facets tilted at 10oand without AR-coatings. The reflectance of the uncoated facets was calculated to be about 0.3. A polarization controller was incorporated to adjust polarization state and an isolator to ensure unidirectional oscillation in the ring cavity. Output was obtained via a 50: 50 fused fiber coupler. The total length of the cavity was 11, 45m corresponding to a fundamental ring frequency of 16.9 MHz. The oscillating spectrum was defined by the Fabry-Perot modes of the uncoated SOA whose free spectral range was 65GHz. At the output of the ring laser a 1.5 mm SOA was used for amplification and a fiber Fabry-Perot for individual channel isolation and detection in an optical or electrical spectrum analyzer. Multi-wavelength operation is possible even by using the reflection coated SOA alone considered as a linear, 500 um long, cavity, providing lasing lines determined by the Fabry-Perot modes that experience the highest gain. However, due to gain compression caused by the extreme low cavity losses, its performance as a multiwavelength source is \u2026",

The activation function is realized by means of a deeply-saturated differentially-biased Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (SOA-MZI) followed by a SOA-Cross-Gain-Modulation (XGM) gate. Its transfer function is both experimentally and theoretically analyzed, showing excellent agreement between theory and experiment and an almost perfect fitting with a logistic sigmoid function. The optical sigmoid transfer function is then exploited in the experimental demonstration of a photonic neuron, demonstrating successful thresholding over a 100psec-long pulse sequence with 4 different weighted-and-summed power levels.",

It is also true to say that before this, the telecommunications industry had experienced an explosive growth for a good number of years. For wired networks this growth was due to the unprecedented improvement in performance of the photonic technologies as well as proof of their maturity that has resulted in a spectacular decrease in transmission cost, which in turn has lead to the widespread adoption and construction of new fiber networks. At this point of the business cycle and in preparation for the next crest of the wave, it is appropriate to review research lines that have been maturing over the years and whose results may be incorporated in next generation products.

Commercially successful rollouts will involve scaling enabling technologies, such as cloud radio access networks, virtualization, and artificial intelligence. This paper addresses the principal technologies in the transition towards next generation mobile networks. The convergence of 6G key-performance indicators along with evaluation methodologies and use cases are also addressed. Free-space optics, Terahertz systems, photonic integrated circuits, softwarization, massive multiple-input multiple-output signaling, and multi-core fibers, are among the technologies identified and discussed. Finally, some of these technologies are showcased in an experimental demonstration of a mobile fronthaul system based on millimeter 5G NR OFDM signaling compliant with 3GPP Rel. 15. The signals are generated by a bespoke 5G baseband unit and transmitted through both a 10 km prototype multi-core fiber and 4 m wireless V-band link using a pair of directional 60 GHz antennas with 10\u00b0 beamwidth. Results shown that the 5G and beyond fronthaul system can successfully transmit signals with both wide bandwidth (up to 800 MHz) and fully centralized signal processing. As a result, this system can support large capacity and accommodate several simultaneous users as a key candidate for next generation mobile networks.

To cope with this demand, we present a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of the deterministic timing jitter and the pulse peak power equalization of SOA-amplified intensity-modulated optical pulses. The deterministic timing jitter model relies on the pulse mean arrival time estimation and its analytic formula reveals an approximate linear relationship between the deterministic timing jitter and the logarithmic values of intensity modulation when the SOA gain recovery time is faster than the pulse period. The theoretical analysis also arrives at an analytic expression for the intensity modulation reduction (IMR), which clearly elucidates the pulse peak power equalization mechanism of SOA. The IMR analysis shows that the output intensity modulation depth is linearly related to the respective input modulation depth of the optical pulses when the gain recovery time is faster than the pulse period. This novel theoretical platform provides a qualitative and quantitative insight into the SOA performance in case of intensity-modulated optical pulses.",

This new analytical model enables us to conduct an extensive delay performance analysis of the various performance aspects of hybrid RoF networks operating under the fixed service paradigm, such as various optical capacity availability scenarios, varying load conditions, optical network ranges, transmission window lengths, and data packet sizes.

Unfortunately, the high optical loss of many optical components, coupled with the low efficiency of laser sources, result in high aggregate power requirements for the thousands of optical transceivers that such networks employ. As optical interconnects stay always on, even during periods of system inactivity, most of this power is wasted. Ideally we would like to turn off the transceivers when a network link is idle (i.e., \u201cpower gate\u201d the lasers), and turn them back on right before the next transmission. The danger with this approach is that it may expose the laser turn-on delay and lead to higher network latency. However, data center networks typically employ network topologies with path diversity and facilitate multiple paths for each source-destination pair. Based on this observation, we propose an optical network architecture \u2026",

The RAM cell features wavelength diversity in the incoming bit signals and provides Read/Write operation capability with true random access exclusively in the optical domain. Two of the SOA-XGM switches are coupled together through an 70/30 coupler to form an asynchronous flip-flop, which serves as the memory unit. Random access to the memory unit is granted by a third SOA-ON/OFF switch and all three SOAs together form the proposed RAM cell. Proof-of-principle operation is experimentally demonstrated at 8 Mb/s using commercial fiber-pigtailed components. The distinctive simplicity of the proposed RAM cell architecture suggests reduced footprint. The proposed flip-flop layout holds all the credentials for reaching multi-Gb/s operational \u2026",

These effects have been included directly in an extended FDTD simulator through time-dependent Maxwell's equations and using the nonlinear constitutive relation.

            "Abstract": "Multi-socket server boards (MSBs) exploit the interconnection of multiple processor chips towards forming powerful cache coherent systems, with the interconnect technology comprising a key element in boosting processing performance. Here, we present an overview of the current electrical interconnects for MSBs, outlining the main challenges currently faced. We propose the use of silicon photonics (SiPho) towards advancing interconnect throughput, socket connectivity and energy efficiency in MSB layouts, enabling a flat-topology wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-based point-to-point (p2p) optical MSB interconnect scheme. We demonstrate WDM SiPho transceivers (TxRxs) co-assembled with their electronic circuits for up to 50 Gb/s line rate and 400 Gb/s aggregate data transmission and SiPho arrayed waveguide grating routers that can offer collision-less time of flight connectivity for up to 16 nodes. The capacity can scale to 2.8 Gb/s for an eight-socket MSB, when line rate scales to 50 Gb/s, yielding up to 69% energy reduction compared with the QuickPath Interconnect and highlighting the feasibility of single-hop p2p interconnects in MSB systems with >4 sockets.",

This has set a new class of requirements for the TX infrastructure that should now offer multiple credentials, namely: high-speed, O-band operation for avoiding dispersion compensation in long distances, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) capabilities for higher throughput and multicasting/broadcasting support, and tight co-packaging with low-power electronics. Silicon (Si) photonic TXs have been extensively studied toward high-speed and WDM TX engines targeting mainly C-band. Only a limited number of Si-Pho O-band TXs have been reported, however with \u226432 Gb/s/channel line-rate capabilities and with a WDM portfolio that has not been fully explored yet.

The limited capacity and pitch lane of electrically wired interconnects require the development of new disruptive technologies to cope with the massive amount of data moving across all hierarchical communication levels, namely rack-to-rack, backplane, chip-to-chip and even on-chip interconnections. Plasmonics comes indeed as a disruptive technology that enables seamless interoperability between light beams and electronic control signals through the underlying metallic layer, providing thereby an inherent energy-efficient platform for merging broadband optical links with intelligent electronic processing. In ICT PLATON project we are aiming to the exploitation of plasmonics for the demonstration of novel hybrid Si-plasmonic router prototypes for chip-to-chip and on-chip interconnection, starting with a 2\u00d7 2 WDM-traffic router with up to 640 Gb/s capacity and proceeding to a 4\u00d7 4 router with up to 1.12 Tb/s throughput.

The second version is the Client-Weighted Medium Transparent MAC (CW-MT-MAC). The latter assigns wavelengths based on the number of active users that reside within each RAU, and for time proportionate to the latter, with the purpose of providing capacity fairness among the users. The CWMT-MAC exhibits greater performance and equalization regarding the achieved throughput and packet delay in the user basis regardless of the user population distribution in the network's RAUs.

This process becomes even more difficult for recurrent networks, where exploding gradient phenomena can further destabilize the training process. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data-driven initialization approach for recurrent photonic neural networks.

            "Abstract": "Slot-based plasmonic waveguides have attracted significant attention owing to their unique ability to confine light within nanometer-scale. In this context, enhanced localized light-matter interaction and control have been exploited to demonstrate novel concepts in data communication and sensing applications revealing the immense potential of plasmonic slot waveguides. However, inherent light absorption in the metallic parts included is such structures hampers the scaling of plasmonic devices and limits their application diversity. A promising solution of such issues is the use of hybrid plasmo-photonic configurations. Hybrid slot waveguides have been introduced as the means to reduce such propagation losses while maintaining their functional advantages. In addition, their co-integration with low-loss photonic waveguides can enable the development of more complex structures with acceptable overall losses. In \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The emergence of disaggregation in data center (DC) architectures as a way to increase resource utilization introduces significant challenges to the DC switching infrastructure, which has to ensure high bandwidth and low-latency communication along with high-radix connectivity. This paper examines the network requirements in disaggregated systems and reviews the credentials of state-of-the-art high-radix optical switch architectures. We also demonstrate a novel optical packet switch design, called Hipo\u03bbaos, that satisfies these requirements by combining N-port broadcast-and-select and N\u00d7N arrayed waveguide grating router-based forwarding schemes in N^2-port connectivity configurations. The Hipo\u03bbaos switch provides sub-\u03bcs latency and high throughput performance by utilizing distributed control and optical feed-forward buffering in a modified Spanke architecture.

We report on recent experimental results obtained within the FP7 project RAMPLAS and we discuss the disintegration roadmap relying on optical PCB technologies and Si-integrated AWGR and transceiver chips pursued within the recently started project ICT-STREAMS. Finally, we demonstrate the application of optical memory setups in routing applications by proposing optical CAM memories towards the implementation of complete ultra-fast routing look-up tables directly in the optical domain.",

            "Abstract": "In this article, we present for the first time to our knowledge, a DWDM     silicon photonic cyclic-frequency AWGR device. The AWGR features a channel spacing of 1.06 nm (189 GHz), a free spectral range of 17.80 nm (3.16 THz) and a 3-dB channel bandwidth of 0.65 nm (116 GHz). Its proper cyclic-frequency operation was experimentally verified for all     channels with channel peak insertion loss values in the range of 3.90 dB to 8.37 dB, yielding a channel loss non-uniformity of 4.47 dB. Its compact footprint of 0.27 mm     mm and its low crosstalk value of 21.65 dB highlight its potential for employment in future AWGR-based interconnect schemes in O-band.",
