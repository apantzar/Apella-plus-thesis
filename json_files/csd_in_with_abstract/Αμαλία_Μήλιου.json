The skin nerves can be stimulated by mechanical, electrical or thermal stimuli. Apart from fibers for pain, skin has six more types of receptors. A review of the state of the art concerning the physiological and technological principles, considerations and characteristics, as well as latest implementations of micro-actuator based tactile graphic displays and the relative software interfaces structures and representations is presented. Fabrication technologies are reviewed in order to demonstrate the potential in tactile applications. Existing electronic Braille displays for accessibility are limited to text-based information. Graphic tactile displays enable for viewing images by the sense of touch on a reusable surface and substitution of the visual/auditory sense. Applications include education, engineering/artistic design, web surfing, and viewing of art and photographs. Tactile substitution can be used in augmenting accessibility for the blind or deaf in order to:(a) to enhance access to computer graphical user interfaces,(b) to enhance mobility in controlled environments. In general tactation based interfaces may allow communication of visual information to the brain in situations where the visual or hearing system is already overloaded such as race car drivers, airplane pilots, operating rooms, virtual reality and tele-presence.",

The enhancement in the security of the system at hand is achieved neither by increasing chaos dimensionality nor by making synchronization of transmitter and receiver more sensitive to system parameters but by introducing a set of parameters used in the encoding and decoding of the message signal. We also introduce a time delay parameter in the dynamical system which on the one hand improves the chaotic behavior of the system and on the other, adds further security in the encoding-decoding scheme. In our work, we modify the non-autonomous 2\" order non-linear oscillator system presented by G. Mycolaitis, et al in Proc. of 7\" Int.

Time-resolved electrical measurement techniques, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and microwave (MW) conductivity, are primarily used to deconvolute ultrafast processes and to directly access behavior of charged species from the ps to \u00b5s timescales. Transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy were also utilized to gain insight on carrier population dynamics and radiatively recombining charges. Photogenerated charged species were converted into highly mobile charges (\u00b5e = 12.5 cm2V-1s-1 and \u00b5h = 7.5 cm2V-1s-1) almost instantaneously (< 0.2 ps), while the remaining loosely bounded excitons dissociate into mobile charges after 2-3 ps. This high mobility is maintained for at least 1 ns as obtained by THz spectroscopy, while its lifetime is at least few tens of \u00b5s as measured by the MW conductivity technique. Lowering the temperature increases carrier mobilities with T-1.6.Dependence and a 75 meV barrier energy is required for temperature-activated recombination. Finally, injection of hole from MAPbI3 to Spiro-OMeTAD was found to be ultrafast and the state and population of dark holes dictate its recombination.",

In all three routes to chaos the appropriate experimental distributions were calculated. Moreover, the chaotic nature of the circuit operation was evaluated by using the Grassberger\u2013Procaccia method.

To cope with this demand, we present a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of the deterministic timing jitter and the pulse peak power equalization of SOA-amplified intensity-modulated optical pulses. The deterministic timing jitter model relies on the pulse mean arrival time estimation and its analytic formula reveals an approximate linear relationship between the deterministic timing jitter and the logarithmic values of intensity modulation when the SOA gain recovery time is faster than the pulse period. The theoretical analysis also arrives at an analytic expression for the intensity modulation reduction (IMR), which clearly elucidates the pulse peak power equalization mechanism of SOA. The IMR analysis shows that the output intensity modulation depth is linearly related to the respective input modulation depth of the optical pulses when the gain recovery time is faster than the pulse period. This novel theoretical platform provides a qualitative and quantitative insight into the SOA performance in case of intensity-modulated optical pulses.",

The last decade has witnessed a rapid progress in haptic application software development due to the fact that the underlying technology has become mature and has opened up novel research areas. In an attempt to organize the path between cause and effect we envision a need for a standard for haptic application software modeling. In order for the software to better enhance the tactile information sensation, flow and perception and also make interaction between humans and haptics more efficient and natural, we need a formal representation of the haptics domain. This article proposes the use of HASM, a haptic applications software modeling ontology to formally model the haptics domain in order to be used during the specifications and design phases of developing software applications for haptic interfaces.

The device, which has a symmetric directional coupler configuration, exploits the stress-induced birefringence in K/sup +/-Na/sup +/, ion-exchanged waveguides, giving rise to an adequate difference in the coupling lengths for the two polarizations. Starting from the measured potassium concentration (refractive index) profile of the structure and utilizing a combination of the multilayer stack theory and the effective-index method, the normal mode propagation constants and mode field profiles are calculated to determine the polarization splitting length and the extinction ratio, and the results are compared with the experimental data. It is shown that in a given coupler, the splitting occurs at several wavelengths in the 1.0-1.45 mu m range.

In this scheme, network coding is performed on-the-fly at the central office and the resultant packet is broadcasted at the client nodes, where the decoding takes place. We demonstrate experimental results of OPNC using OOK data signals modulated on a 10 GHz SC with the aid of a second all-optical XOR gate for the decoding process at the client's site, reporting error-free performance for both synchronous \u2026",

The proposed router platform relies on a novel dual-ring Dielectric-Loaded Surface Plasmon Polariton (DLSPP) 2x2 switch heterointegrated on a Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) photonic motherboard that is responsible for traffic multiplexing and header processing functionalities. We present experimental results of a Poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA)-loaded dual-resonator DLSPP waveguide structure that uses two racetrack resonators of 5.5 \u03bcm radius and 4\u03bcm-long straight sections and operates as a passive add/drop filtering element. We derive its frequency-domain transfer function, confirm its add/drop experimental spectral response, and proceed to a circuit-level model for dual-ring DLSPP designs supporting 2x2 thermo-optic switch operation. The validity of our circuit-level modeled 2x2 thermo-optic switch is verified by means of respective full vectorial three-dimensional Finite Element Method (3D-FEM) simulations. The router setup is completed by means of two 4x1 SOI multiplexing circuits, each one employing four cascaded 2nd order micro-ring configurations with 100GHz spaced resonances. Successful interconnection between the DLSPP switching matrix and the SOI circuitry is performed through a butt-coupling design that, as shown via 3D-FEM analysis, allows for small coupling losses of as low as 2.2 dB. The final router architecture is evaluated through a co-operative simulation environment, demonstrating successful 2x2 routing for two incoming 4-wavelength Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) optical packet \u2026",

The measured K/sup +/ concentration profile, the refractive index profile, and the diffusion profile obtained by solving the one-dimensional diffusion equation are correlated to explain the differences in the index profiles in the two glasses. The mobility of the potassium ions was measured by fabricating waveguides using electromigration. Surface waveguides formed by diffusion from a molten KNO/sub 3/ salt bath were buried by applying an electric field. Single-mode channel waveguides for operation at a wavelength of 1.3 mu m that exhibit excellent mode matching with conventional optical fibers, achieving a fiber-waveguide insertion loss of less than 1 dB for a 20-mm-long waveguide, have been obtained.< >",

The current approach by chip architects to tackle this obstacle is to increase constantly the size of the cache memories on the dye in order to prevent the cores standing in idle state, while expecting data from the RAM circuit. However, this solution is totally inefficient considering that the dye area of the chip is very precious and could be used alternative for the integration of additional cores, transceivers etc. that would radically enhance the performance of current CPUs. A disruptive solution for data storage within the chip is the introduction of optics in the processor layout by embedding photonic RAM circuits operating at multiple tens of GHz frequencies that would unleash the processing performance of CPU cores at high \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The centralized filtering of the transmitted packets has been the base of a family of high-performance protocols for WDM star networks. Protocols of this family have been proved to achieve a significantly higher performance than the well-known contention-oriented or round-robin protocols. However, the need for electronic control of the filtering mechanism as well as the use of slowly tunable acoustooptic filters have been limiting factors in their performance. Furthermore, since the network hub of WDM star networks represents a single point of failure, the extensive use of electronic circuits at this point reduces the reliability of the system. In this paper, an all-optical centralized protocol is introduced. According to this protocol, the passing of the transmitted packets to the star coupler is controlled by means of optical logic circuits, without the need of optical to electronic translation or electronic processing of the network \u2026",

Coexistence of the 5G traffic with the residential legacy traffic for the field propagation is achieved through utilization of unused C-band channels and wavelength-division multiplexing.

Tactile interfaces are used in virtual environments, and as a complement or substitution of the visual or auditory presentation of information.

This paper focuses on modeling the inherent optical properties of silicon waveguides using the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method. Emphasis was placed on nonlinearities which are: Kerr effect, Two Photon Absorption (TPA), Stimulated Raman Scattering, Free Carrier Absorption (FCA) and Free Carrier Plasma (FCP). These effects have been included directly in an extended FDTD simulator through time-dependent Maxwell's equations and using the nonlinear constitutive relation. The objective is to develop a time-domain algorithm for investigating the complex physical phenomena inherited in silicon waveguides before photonic devices are fabricated.

            "Abstract": "Towards the 5G millimeter Wave (mmWave) era, analog transport offers a spectrally efficient scheme for converged Fiber Wireless (FiWi) networks. Signal integrity is traditionally considered as a limiting factor due to various non-linearities attributed to the microwave photonic link, expected to be further exacerbated by the RF-chain of beamforming Phased Array Antennas (PAAs). The letter proposes the end-to-end evaluation of FiWi analog links as unified communication channels rather than separately for the radio or optical part, presenting a link with a 32-element 60 GHz PAA, 1 m V-band distance, 10 km fiber and 10 dB dynamic range. The measurements reveal a third order Intercept Point (IIP3) of 4.8 dBm, compared to 22.8 dBm exclusively for the optics, pinpointing the V-band radio as the main source of degradation rather than the microwave photonic link.

            "Abstract": "Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have been extensively used in a wealth of tele\u2010com and datacom applications as a powerful building block that features large optical gain, all-optical gating function, fast response, and ease of integration with other func\u2010tional semiconductor devices. As fabrication technologies are steadily maturing toward enhanced yield, SOAs are foreseen to play a pivotal role in complex photonics integrated circuits (PICs) of the near future. From a design standpoint, accurate numerical modeling of SOA devices is required toward optimizing PICs response from a system perspective, while enhanced circuit complexity calls for efficient solvers. In this book chapter, we present established experimentally validated SOA numerical modeling techniques and a gain parameterization procedure applicable to a wide range of SOA devices. Moreover, we describe multigrid concepts and implicit schemes that have been only recently pre\u2010sented to SOA modeling, enabling adaptive time stepping at the SOA output, with dense sampling at transient phenomena during the gain recovery and scarce sampling during the steady-state response. Overall, a holistic simulation methodology approach along with recent research trends are described, aiming to form the basis of further develop\u2010ments in SOA modeling.",

A new high amplitude oscillation is observed and attributed to the emergence of a large diode junction capacitance. Increasing the driving signal amplitude, the circuit is led to a non-periodic mode of operation, producing trajectories of increasing chaotic content in a four-dimensional phase space. At specific amplitudes a two-dimensional tori was monitored, where trajectories are periodic, like in a two oscillator system with commensurate frequencies. Poincar\u00e9 cross-sections, FFT spectra and correlation dimension calculations, suggest the quasi-periodicity route to chaos.",

            "Abstract": "Analog fronthauling is currently promoted as a bandwidth and energy-efficient solution that can meet the requirements of the Fifth Generation (5G) vision for low latency, high data rates and energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose an analog optical fronthaul 5G architecture, fully aligned with the emerging Centralized-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) concept. The proposed architecture exploits the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique and multicarrier intermediate-frequency-over-fiber (IFoF) signal generation per wavelength in order to satisfy the demanding needs of hotspot areas. Particularly, the fronthaul link employs photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based WDM optical transmitters (Txs) at the baseband unit (BBU), while novel reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs) cascaded in an optical bus are used at the remote radio head (RRH) site, to facilitate reconfigurable wavelength switching functionalities up to 4 wavelengths. An aggregate capacity of 96 Gb/s has been reported by exploiting two WDM links carrying multi-IF band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals at a baud rate of 0.5 Gbd with sub-carrier (SC) modulation of 64-QAM. All signals exhibited error vector magnitude (EVM) values within the acceptable 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) limits of 8%. The longest reach to place the BBU away from the hotspot was also investigated, revealing acceptable EVM performance for fiber lengths up to 4.8 km. View Full-Text",

Today, Quantum Cryptography is rapidly moving out of the lab and into the telecommunications mainstream offering commercial quantum cryptography and key distribution systems based solely on quantum first principles.

A new high amplitude oscillation is observed and attributed to the emergence of a large diode junction capacitance. Increasing the driving signal amplitude, the circuit is led to a non-periodic mode of operation, producing trajectories of increasing chaotic content in a four-dimensional phase space. At specific amplitudes a two-dimensional tori was monitored, where trajectories are periodic, like in a two oscillator system with commensurate frequencies. Poincar\u00b4e crosssections, FFT spectra and correlation dimension calculations, suggest the quasi-periodicity route to chaos.",

These two in synergy will provide high capacity gain not only through the hyperdense deployment of small cell but also through accessing large swathes of untapped spectrum at mmWave frequencies. The envisaged architecture entails an integrated optical wireless network architecture, where optical technology will complement radio in order to handle the new demands on capacity over the backhaul and fronthaul network, leading to the notion of analog radio over fiber (ARoF).

            "Abstract": "Although SOAs have been initially introduced as integrated modules mainly for optical amplification purposes, they have been widely used in all optical signal processing applications, like all-optical switching and wavelength conversion, utilizing the exhibited nonlinearities such as gain saturation, cross-gain (XGM) and cross-phase modulation (XPM). These nonlinear effects that present the most severe problem and limit the usefulness of SOAs as optical amplifiers in lightwave systems can be proven attractive in optically transparent networks. The origin of the nonlinearities lies in the SOA gain saturation and in its correlation with the phase of the propagating wave, since the carrier density changes induced by the input signals are affecting not only the gain but also the refractive index in the active region of the SOA. The carrier density dynamics within the SOA are very fast (picosecond scale) and thus the gain responds in tune with the fluctuations in the input power on a bit by bit basis even for optical data at 10 or 40 Gb/s bit-rates (Ramaswami & Sivarajan, 2002).If more than one signal is injected into the SOA, their nonlinear interaction will lead to XPM between the signals. However, in order to take advantage of the XPM phenomenon and create functional devices, the SOAs have to be placed in an interferometric configuration such as a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) that converts phase changes in the signals to intensity variations at its output exploiting interference effects. Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-based Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (SOA-MZIs) have been widely used in the past years as all-optical high speed switches for signal \u2026",

Firstly, we report on the photonic integration of Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-Mach Zehnder Interferometer (SOA-MZI)-based optical Flip-Flop and Random Access Memories on a monolithic InP platform, capable of storing the binary prefix-address data-bits and the outgoing port information for next hop routing, respectively.

This is later extended via physical layer simulations in an optical Ternary-CAM (T-CAM) cell and a 4-bit Matchline (ML) configuration, supporting a third state of the \u201clogical X\u201d value towards wildcard bits of network subnet masks. The proposed functional CAM and Random Access Memories (RAM) sub-circuits may facilitate light-based Address Look-Up tables supporting search operations at 10 Gb/s and beyond, paving the way towards minimizing the disparity with the frantic optical transmission linerates, and fast re-configurability through multiple simultaneous Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) memory access requests.

            "Abstract": "We have measured the surface index change and birefringence in K^+\u2013Na^+ ion-exchanged waveguides and compared the results with theory. The contribution to the index change caused by the polarizability/volume changes (\u0394np) is calculated using two theoretical models which use empirical relations based on the glass composition. In both cases, we encounter large discrepancies between the predicted and measured values which are attributed to the inherent deficiency in the models, which assume free expansion of the glass in calculating the volume changes. Recognizing that the net volume change is much smaller, we accurately measure its value and show that both models can be used to predict \u0394np with the same accuracy, provided that the correct volume change is used. We show that the limitation in accuracy is dictated by measurement errors and uncertainties in the values of the ionic radii and \u2026",

The array implements a \u2018pixel\u2019 of the display and is used to focus airborne ultrasound energy on the skin surface. The pressure field generated by the focused ultrasound waves excites the mechanoreceptors under the skin and transmits tactile information. The geometry of the individual transducer and the array are optimized so that the medium presents maximum impedance and the membrane oscillates with maximum deflection. Optimization is achieved using an electrical equivalent circuit model and the Berkeley Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) code. Finite element analysis of the CMUT and the CMUT phased array is used to verify the SPICE results. The pressure at focal point is compared with the pressure threshold required for \u2026",

The device operation and performance have been mathematically analyzed through a novel theoretical framework that considers finite extinction ratio signals entering a deeply saturated differentially biased SOA-MZI. Based on the theoretical model, the BMWC is capable of both power equalization and WC of intensity modulated input pulses with > 9 dB loud/soft ratio. The theoretical results were verified experimentally for 10 Gb/s Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) intensity modulated data, revealing successful power equalization and WC for up to 8 dB loud/soft \u2026",

The proposed module is based on the use of optical logic circuits for controlling the passing of the transmitted packets to the star coupler, without the need of optical to electronic translation or electronic processing of the network feedback information. In this way, the processing time is drastically reduced, while the need for slowly tunable optical filters is eliminated.
