            "Abstract": "A three-dimensional layered and isotropic medium is excited by primary spherical waves due to     magnetic dipoles radiating inside or outside the medium. Interaction scattering cross sections (ISCS) are defined as the differences between the overall scattering cross section and the sum of the individual cross sections generated by all dipoles within a layer or by all     dipoles. Optical theorems and physical bounds for the ISCS are established. Extensive numerical investigations are performed for the variations of the ISCS and their physical bounds with respect to the geometrical and physical characteristics of the layered medium. Conditions for which ISCS contribute significantly in the overall cross section are analyzed. It is also demonstrated that the number of excitation layers and the total number     of dipoles can be determined by means of the individual scattering cross sections.",

In this paper, fundamental issues related to the MAS solution of three-dimensional (3-D) scattering problems are analytically and numerically investigated. Two 3-D scattering problems are considered. In both, the respective singularities of the analytic continuation of the scattered field in the scatterer's interior can be explicitly determined; the location of these singularities plays a crucial role to the application of the MAS. The first problem concerns the acoustic scattering by a soft sphere when excited by an exterior point source. The analytic solution of this problem is directly compared with the numerical solution obtained by the MAS for varying locations of the auxiliary sources (AS's). The second problem concerns the plane wave acoustic scattering by a soft ellipsoid. This may \u2026",

Various methods have been established for the localization and reconstruction of such a scatterer. Characteristic representatives are groundpenetrating radar (GPR) methods which use pulses from a radar, lying in close proximity to the ground, to image the subsurface. The effectiveness of most of the utilized methods usually depends on the electric dimensions and the shape of the scatterer, it\u2019s depth inside the earth, the operating frequency as well as the adopted model for the earth.In this work, we use a different approach from the conventional ones which aims to reveal the localization of an inclusion inside the earth. Consider the geometrical configuration of Fig. 1. A circular cylindrical perfectly electric conducting (PEC) inclusion is located at a certain distance from the surface of the ground. Our main objective is to determine the proper parameters of a thin passive superstrate layer (namely its thickness h and complex relative dielectric permittivity \u03f5r2) which is deposited on the ground in order to increase (make more feasible) the detectability of the circular PEC inclusion. A moving line source is utilized as a primitive subsurface scanner; this source is expected to model practical implementations related to GPR\u2019s.",

We found that, inside such a spectral regime, there may exist a subregime wherein the system of the NLS equations can be approximated by the Manakov system.

To this direction, we examine a procedure of \u201cunlocking\u201d the ground by depositing a thin passive layer of conventional material atop of it. The first step is to significantly enhance the transmission into a lossy half-space, in the absence of the inclusion, by covering it with a passive slab.

            "Abstract": "The extended boundary condition method (EBCM) was formulated for the perturbation of a source electric potential by a 3D object composed of a homogeneous anisotropic dielectric medium whose relative permittivity dyadic is positive definite. The formulation required the application of Green\u2019s second identity to the exterior region to deduce the electrostatic counterpart of the Ewald\u2013Oseen extinction theorem. The electric potential inside the object was represented using a basis obtained by implementing an affine bijective transformation of space to the Gauss equation for the electric field. The EBCM yields a transition matrix that depends on the geometry and the composition of the 3D object, but not on the source potential.",

            "Abstract": "Microstrip antennas offer many attractive features and hence it is very challenging to model efficiently their resonance and radiation characteristics (Pozar & Schaubert, 1995). In particular, microstrip antennas composed of perfectly electric conducting (PEC) patches mounted on spherical surfaces possess two basic advantages against the planar ones. First, their curved shape makes them more applicable to real-world moving configurations such as missiles, satellites and aircrafts, where large plane boundaries are usually absent. Second, the frequency scanning problem encountered in case of planar microstrips at low elevations may be overcome due to the conformability of spherical antennas. Apart from these two advantages, spherical microstrip antennas offer (due to their relatively simple geometry) additional attractive features like low cost, light weight, easy fabrication as well as integrability with microwave and millimeter-wave circuits. As far as the metallic patch is concerned, circular or annular-ring ones are preferable for mounting on a spherical body. Interesting design characteristics of microstrip antennas are mainly the complex resonant frequencies, the radiation pattern and the input impedance. An extensive literature survey concerning the analysis of non-planar radiating microstrip structures, as well as the investigations of the aforementioned design characteristics is included in the classic book (Wong, 1999).The mathematical methods, developed for analyzing the behavior of a spherical microstrip, may be categorized as follows:(i) the full-wave approach implements the method of moments (MoM) to approximate the surface current \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A ground-penetrating radar (GPR) antenna excites a perfectly electric conducting (PEC) inclusion buried inside the ground. One of the main problems in the detection of the PEC inclusion via external measurements is its poor scattering response due to attenuation. Hence, increasing the scattered power generated by the inclusion is of great practical interest. To this direction, the main purpose of this work is to investigate a procedure of unlocking the ground by depositing a thin passive layer of conventional material atop of it. The first step of the developed methodology is to significantly enhance the transmission into a lossy half space, in the absence of the inclusion, by covering it with a passive slab, the thickness and permittivity of which are to be determined. Then, the full boundary value problem (including the inclusion) is solved semi-analytically via integral equations techniques. The scattered power of the buried inclusion is compared to the corresponding quantity when no additional layer is present. Results from numerical simulations are presented exhibiting the effectiveness of the approach. Substantial improvement in the detectability of the inclusion is reported for several types of ground and burying depths by using conventional realizable passive materials. The effects of the shape of the buried inclusion on the scattered field are also investigated. The developed technique may constitute an effective configuration (structural) preprocessing which may be used as an initial step in the analysis of related problems before the application of an inverse scattering algorithm concerning the efficient processing of the scattering data.",

Compared to a homogeneous layer of the noncentrosymmetric material with the same thickness as the periodic multilayer, the latter exhibits an effective in-plane anisotropy that can be three orders larger in magnitude. This enhancement gets more substantial at higher frequencies and is electrically controllable. The incorporation of dissipation reduces the enhancement of the effective in-plane anisotropy, which nevertheless remains significant.

Similar wavefront engineering aims are greatly served by the development of general synthesis formulations that provide the correct susceptibility tensors for the desired transformation [6] and give rise to intelligent metasurfaces with continuously tunable surface features for multiple reconfigurable operations [7, 8].

            "Abstract": "The scattering of a dipole generated spherical wave by a layered sphere provides interesting features, which are essentially different from those due to a plane wave. In direct scattering theory the far-field interaction of a dipole with a sphere is in general stronger than that of a plane wave. On the other hand, in inverse scattering problems the distance of the dipole from the sphere\u2019s center constitutes an additional parameter, which is encoded in the far-field pattern and is significant for the sphere\u2019s reconstruction. Dipole excitation of a layered sphere has significant applications. The interaction between the mobile phone antenna and the human head is modelled as an exterior dipole excitation problem [1]. Besides, the interior dipole excitation has significant medical applications, such as implantations inside the human head for hyperthermia or biotelemetry purposes [2], as well as excitation of the human brain by the neurons\u2019 currents [3]. Further chemical, biological, and physical applications are discussed in [4]. In this paper we investigate the excitation of a layered sphere by a time-harmonic spherical electromagnetic wave, generated by a dipole located either in the interior or in the exterior of the sphere. The layered sphere consists of N concentric spherical layers with constant material parameters; N\u2212 1 layers are dielectric and the N-th layer (core) is perfect conducting, impedance or dielectric. We compute the exact Green\u2019s function by combining T-matrix [5] and Sommerfeld\u2019s methods [6]. The T-matrix method uses Mie series expansions and handles the effect of the layers, while the Sommerfeld\u2019s method handles the singularity of the dipole \u2026",

Bright-bright, dark-dark and dark-bright vector solitons can form in those spectral regimes.",

Despite its interesting features, the effectiveness of the MFS and its applicability are restricted by open issues, including the placement of the fictitious sources (FS) and the fields\u2019 convergence. Concerning these issues, we investigate here the MFS convergence and study oscillations in its solutions for a representative scattering problem of a dielectric cylinder illuminated by a current filament. It is shown analytically that, when the FS radii lie in the interior and exterior of two disks with certain critical radii, the MFS currents\u2019 series diverge while the respective fields converge, as the FS number N tends to infinity. Asymptotic formulas of the divergent currents are established, exhibiting that they increase exponentially with N and oscillate.

More precisely, concerning the direct scattering problem, the far-field interaction of a point source with an obstacle is, under certain conditions, stronger compared to that of a plane wave. On the other hand, in inverse scattering problems the distance of the point-source from the obstacle constitutes a crucial parameter, which is encoded in the far-field pattern and is utilized appropriately for the localization and reconstruction of the obstacle\u2019s physical and geometrical characteristics.The research of point-source scattering initiated in (1), dealing with analytical investigations of the scattering problem by a circular disc. The main results for point-source scattering by simple homogeneous canonical shapes are collected in the classic books (2) and (3). The techniques of the low-frequency theory (4) in the point-source acoustic scattering by soft, hard, impedance surface, and penetrable obstacles were introduced in (5),(6), and (7), where also explicit results for the corresponding particular spherical homogeneous scatterers were obtained. Moreover, in (5),(6), and (7) simple far-field inverse scattering algorithms were developed for the determination of the sphere\u2019s center as well as of its radius. On the other hand, point-source near-field inverse scattering problems for a small soft or hard sphere were studied in (8). For other implementations of near-field inverse problems see (9), and p. 133 of (10); also we point out the point-source inverse scattering methods analyzed in (11). In all the \u2026",

A rigorous integral equation methodology is employed for the analysis and the accurate determination of the reflected and transmitted fields. Systematic optimizations with respect to the configuration\u2019s parameters are performed, which reveal that it is possible to obtain significantly enhanced anomalous reflection (with simultaneously suppressed ordinary reflection predicted by Snell\u2019s law) with power varying from 92% to almost 100% of the input one, depending on the color of the incident light. It is shown that these reflection properties are supported by metasurfaces easily realizable with specific low-loss dielectric materials. In this way, several all-dielectric optimal designs are reported that can be used in numerous applications demanding anomalous reflection in the visible range.",

We define a quantity of interest, called \u201cenhancement factor,\u201d expressing the increase of the field concentration in the film-slab when the superstrate is present compared to the case that it is absent.

            "Abstract": "Periodic gratings, such as Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSSs) and EBG (electromagnetic band gap) structures, are used in a wide variety of electromagnetic applications and are typically analyzed under the assumption that they are infinite periodic. Since the real-word structures are necessarily finite, and are derived by truncating the corresponding infinite structures, it is of interest to determine how large the finite structure needs to be so that it mimics its infinite counterpart. A related question is how to extrapolate the simulation results of a finite structure to predict the performance of the corresponding infinite structure in a computationally efficient manner. The objectives of this work are to address both of these questions and to present a novel computational technique which hybridizes analytical and numerical techniques to provide the answers. We illustrate the application of the proposed technique by considering the test case of plane wave scattering by a strip grating and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solution for the current on a truncated periodic grating as we increase its size. The proportionality constant, relating the current distribution on the unit cell of the infinite grating to the corresponding distribution in the truncated grating, is computed, and its asymptotic value is accurately predicted by using an extrapolation algorithm presented in the paper. The required number of strips is estimated such that the current on the finite structure is sufficiently close to that on the infinite one. The results obtained for the current are found to be in excellent agreement with those derived from full-wave simulations.",

In this chapter, we focus on applications of PSO algorithms to optimization problems arising in the theory of wave scattering by inhomogeneous media.

The goal is to optimize the physical and geometrical parameters of the medium\u2019s internal composition for varying numbers of layers (spherical shells) so that the core of the medium is substantially cloaked. For the solution of the associated optimization problem, PSO algorithms have been specifically applied to effectively search for optimal solutions corresponding to realizable parameters values. We performed rounds of simulations for the the basic version of the original PSO algorithm, as well as a newer variant of the Accelerated PSO (known as \u201cChaos Enhanced APSO\u201d/\u201cChaotic APSO\u201d). Feasible solutions were found leading to significantly reduced values of the employed objective function, which is the normalized total scattering cross section of the layered medium. Remarks regarding the differences and particularities among the different PSO algorithms as well as the fine-tuning of their parameters are also pointed out.",

In essence, the desired low-profile operation of the antenna is achieved by overlaying a superstrate slab atop the antenna. Moreover, an optimization process determines the constitutive parameters and thickness of the slab, so that a significantly reduced scattering behavior is obtained.

            "Abstract": "Electromagnetic wave propagation phenomena in nonlinear metamaterials are investigated for waves propagating either in the left-handed frequency band or in the frequency band gaps. In the left-handed band, we implement directly the reductive perturbation method to Faraday\u2019s and Amp\u00e9re\u2019s laws and derive a second-and a thirdorder nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (NLS) equation, describing solitons of moderate and ultra-short pulse widths, respectively. Then, we find necessary conditions and derive exact bright and dark soliton solutions of these equations. On the other hand, in the frequency band gaps with negative linear effective permittivity and positive permeability (where linear electromagnetic waves are evanescent), we derive two short-pulse equations (SPEs) for the high-and low-frequency band gaps. The structure of the SPEs solutions is discussed, and connections with the NLS soliton solutions are presented. Numerical simulations of the SPEs solutions are included and compared with those of the reduced wave equations. Directions towards the modelling of wave propagation in nonlinear chiral metamaterials are pointed out.",

According to the general scheme of MAS, the eigenvalues are obtained by requiring the square impedance matrix to be singular and therefore its determinant to be zero (or its condition number to be large). For large matrices, such computations are complicated and time-consuming. Additionally, these schemes are frequently contaminated with spurious eigenvalues. To overcome the difficulties, an efficient method based on MAS along with an excitation source has been proposed. The eigenvalues are obtained by measuring the physical response of the waveguide's domain to this source; thus, an interior problem is always solved.
