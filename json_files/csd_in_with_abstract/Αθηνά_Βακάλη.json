            "Abstract": "It is evident that in the new Web era, content volume and services availability play a major role, leaving behind typical static pages which have solely text and images. The majority of the business oriented service providers are concerned for the Quality of Services (QoS), in terms of content delivery. In this context, proxy servers and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) have been prosposed as different technologies, dealing with this concern. Their common goal is to bring content close to the users, reducing the response time.Both technologies demonstrate different advantages and disadvantages. CDNs are characterized by robustness in serving huge amounts of requests and content volumes. However, their main shortcoming is that due to replication and distribution cost, replica placements should be static for a large amount of time. This leads to unoptimized storage capacity usage since the surrogate servers \u2026",

This paper proposes a frequency based multimedia data representation model which effectively guides data storage and elevation among the secondary and tertiary storage levels. Multimedia data are stored on the tertiary storage level and (based on certain popularity criteria) they are elevated on secondary level towards improving both the request servicing and the data\u2019s accessibility. The proposed multimedia data elevation is a prefetching approach since it is performed \u201ca priori\u201d(not on demand) based on available information on users access patterns. Secondary storage placement is performed by the use of two distinct type placement policies, namely the \u201cConstructive Placement\u201d and the \u201cIterative Improvement\u201d algorithms. A simulation model has been developed to evaluate the proposed hierarchical data model and the applied placement strategies. Experimentation results have shown that the this hierarchical approach under the iterative improvement placement outperforms earlier related multimedia data placement policies.",

            "Abstract": "Common approaches to text categorization essentially rely either on n-gram counts or on word embeddings. This presents important difficulties in highly dynamic or quickly-interacting environments, where the appearance of new words and/or varied misspellings is the norm. A paradigmatic example of this situation is abusive online behavior, with social networks and media platforms struggling to effectively combat uncommon or non-blacklisted hate words. To better deal with these issues in those fast-paced environments, we propose using the error signal of class-based language models as input to text classification algorithms. In particular, we train a next-character prediction model for any given class and then exploit the error of such class-based models to inform a neural network classifier. This way, we shift from the \u2018ability to describe\u2019seen documents to the \u2018ability to predict\u2019unseen content. Preliminary studies using out-of-vocabulary splits from abusive tweet data show promising results, outperforming competitive text categorization strategies by 4-11%.",

Biologists have developed standardized and structured vocabularies, called bio-ontologies, to assist them in describing the different functions. A critical issue in the assignment of functions to genes is the utilization of knowledge from published biomedical articles. The purpose of this paper is to present a unified and comprehensive statistical methodology for functionally annotating genes using biomedical literature. Specifically, classification models are built using the discriminant analysis method while validation, analysis and interpretation of the results is based on graphical methods and various performance metrics and techniques. The general conclusions from the study are very promising, in the sense that the proposed methodology not only performs well in the assignment of functions to genes, but also provides useful and interpretable results regarding the discriminating power of certain keywords in the texts.",

In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis comparing four baseline matching methods that rely on photo metadata, three variants of an approach that uses cluster analysis in order to discover PoI-related photo clusters, and a real-world retrieval mechanism (Flickr search) on a set of less popular PoIs. A user-based evaluation of the aforementioned methods is conducted on a Flickr photo collection of over 100, 000 photos from 10 well-known touristic destinations in Greece.

            "Abstract": "Aggression in online social networks has been studied mostly from the perspective of machine learning which detects such behavior in a static context. However, the way aggression diffuses in the network has received little attention as it embeds modeling challenges. In fact, modeling how aggression propagates from one user to another, is an important research topic since it can enable effective aggression monitoring, especially in media platforms which up to now apply simplistic user blocking techniques. In this paper, we address aggression propagation modeling and minimization on Twitter, since it is a popular microblogging platform at which aggression had several onsets. We propose various methods building on two well-known diffusion models, Independent Cascade (IC) and Linear Threshold (LT), to study the aggression evolution in the social network. We experimentally investigate how well each method can model aggression propagation using real Twitter data, while varying parameters, such as seed users selection, graph edge weighting, users' activation timing, etc. It is found that the best performing strategies are the ones to select seed users with a degree-based approach, weigh user edges based on their social circles' overlaps, and activate users according to their aggression levels. We further employ the best performing models to predict which ordinary real users could become aggressive (and vice versa) in the future, and achieve up to AUC=0.89 in this prediction task. Finally, we investigate aggression minimization by launching competitive cascades to \"inform\" and \"heal\" aggressors. We show that IC and LT models can be \u2026",

As pointed out by Moustaka et al.(2019a), cities behave as \u201cdata engines\u201d that constantly produce and consume heterogeneous data. The acquisition and exploitation of this data is essential for acquiring knowledge that is critical in identifying the weaknesses and strengths of cities in order to facilitate their efficient management and decision-making. Citizens are recognized by many scholars as the main strength of smart cities (Bird, 2017; Marinaro, 2016; Nam and Pardo, 2011). They share their opinions, feelings, and content on online social networks (OSNs), generate data with personal IoT devices (eg wearable devices, smart devices, smartphones), and in some cases participate in surveys and crowdsourcing activities.

Most early XML storage practices rely on conventional database management systems. However, such systems involve mappings and transformations between XML and the underlying database structure. More recent efforts are based on specific XML-tailored systems that provide ad hoc functionalities.

This metric captures the traffic activity in a CDN, expressing the usefulness of surrogate servers in terms of data circulation in the network. Through an extensive simulation testbed, we identify the parameters that affect the CDN utility in such infrastructures. We evaluate the utility of surrogate servers under various parameters and provide insightful comments.",

This paper introduces a two level video data representation model in order to guide video data storage on a tertiary storage subsystem. A simulation model has been developed to evaluate different video placement strategies based on both Constructive and Iterative Improvement approaches. Experimentation has been carried out for the proposed placement approaches as well as for a typical random placement policy which serves as a comparison reference. Iterative Improvement placement has been proven to outperform the other considered video data placement approaches, in both seek and service times.",

Even though rating prediction is the prevailing paradigm in CFR, there are other issues which have gained significant attention with respect to the content and its variety. Coverage, which constitutes the degree to which recommendations cover the set of available items, is an important factor along with diversity of the items proposed to an individual, often measured by an average dissimilarity between all pairs of recommended items. In this paper, we argue that coverage and diversity cannot be effectively addressed by conventional CFR with pure similarity-based neighborhood creation processes, especially in sparse datasets. Motivated by the need for including wider content characteristics, we propose a novel neighbor selection technique \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The increasing importance of Web 2.0 applications during the last years has created significant interest in tools for analyzing and describing collective user activities and emerging phenomena within the Web. Network structures have been widely employed in this context for modeling users, web resources and relations between them. However, the amount of data produced by modern web systems results in networks that are of unprecedented size and complexity, and are thus hard to interpret. To this end, community detection methods attempt to uncover natural groupings of web objects by analyzing the topology of their containing network. There are numerous techniques adopting a global perspective to the community detection problem, i.e. they operate on the complete network structure, thus being computationally expensive and hard to apply in a streaming manner. In order to add a local perspective to the study of the problem, we present Bridge Bounding, a local methodology for community detection, which explores the local network topology around a seed node in order to identify edges that act as boundaries to the local community. The proposed method can be integrated in an efficient global community detection scheme that compares favorably to the state of the art. As a case study, we apply the method to explore the topic structure of the LYCOS iQ collaborative question/answering application by detecting communities in the networks created from the collective tagging activity of users.",

To this end, this paper presents CrEve, a collaborative event annotation framework which uses content found in social media sites with the prime objective to facilitate the annotation of large media corpora with event information. The proposed annotation framework could significantly benefit social media research due to the proliferation of event-related user-contributed content. We demonstrate that, compared to a standard \u201cbrowse-and-annotate\u201d interface, CrEve leads to a 19% increase in the coverage of the generated ground truth in a large-scale annotation experiment \u2026",

Our main intuition is that organic behavior has more variability, while fraudulent behavior is more synchronized. We refer to the detection of such fraudulent activities as the Retweet Fraud problem and propose:(A) a set of carefully designed features for characterizing retweet threads, ie a given post\u2019s retweets,(B) an efficient method for spotting fraudsters. We present experiments on a real dataset of almost 12 million retweets crawled from Twitter, where our method achieves a 97% accuracy.",

In the wide range of OSNs, the famous micro-blogging service Twitter stands out for a plethora of reasons, such as the platform popularity and the ease of access to data. Activities like retweeting in the popular OSN micro-blogging Twitter service, constitute fundamental mechanisms for information diffusion. The form of such cascading activities (like retweet) in time plays a crucial role in identifying the influence and the life duration of an information source (like tweet). In this paper, we propose an integral framework with a dual functionality to : (i) examine the effectiveness of robust mathematical models in the fitting of the curves produced by the number of retweets over a period of time, and (ii) employ these mathematical models to predict the behavior of the examined retweets \u2026",

The development of efficient classification methods in order to facilitate the organization of these databases and the extraction of novel biomedical knowledge is becoming increasingly important. Several of these methods use bio-ontologies, like Gene Ontology to concisely describe and classify biological documents. The purpose of this paper is to compare two classical statistical classification methods, namely multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), to a machine learning classification method, called support vector machines (SVM). Although all the methods have been used with success for classifying texts, there is not a direct comparison between them for classifying biological text to specific Gene Ontology terms. The results from the study show that LDA performs better (accuracy 80.32%) than SVM (77.18%) and MLR (57.4%). LDA not only performs well in the assignment of Gene Ontology terms to documents, but also reduces the dimensions of the original data, making them easier to manage.",

We model full completion as a frequent sequence mining problem and we show how existing algorithms can be applied in this context. To overcome some limitations of the frequent sequence mining algorithms, e.g., efficiency and recommendation granularity, we propose FESMA, a new and efficient algorithm for computing frequent sequences of services and recommending completions. FESMA also integrates a social dimension, extracted from the transformation of user-service interactions into user-user interactions, building an implicit graph that helps to better predict completions of services in a fashion tailored to individual users.

Proxy servers partially address the need for rapid content delivery by providing multiple clients with a shared cache location. In this context, if a requested object exists in a cache (and the cached version has not expired), clients get a cached copy, which typically reduces delivery time.

Each client has an associated queue and the server performs selective polling such that the next client to be served is identified by a learning automaton. The learning automaton updates each client's choice probability according to the feedback information. Under the considered approach, a client's choice probability asymptotically tends to be proportional to the probability that this client is ready.

            "Abstract": "The wide adoption of photo sharing applications such as Flickr \u00a9  and the massive amounts of user-generated content uploaded to them raises an information overload issue for users. An established technique to overcome such an overload is to cluster images into groups based on their similarity and then use the derived clusters to assist navigation and browsing of the collection. In this paper, we present a community detection (i.e. graph-based clustering) approach that makes use of both visual and tagging features of images in order to efficiently extract groups of related images within large image collections. Based on experiments we conducted on a dataset comprising publicly available images from Flickr \u00a9 , we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, the added value of combining visual and tag features and the utility of the derived clusters for exploring an image collection.",

            "Abstract": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become essential for modern graph data mining and learning tasks. GRL aims to capture the graph's structural information and exploit it in combination with node and edge attributes to compute low-dimensional representations. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been used in state-of-the-art GRL architectures, they have been shown to suffer from over smoothing when many GNN layers need to be stacked. In a different GRL approach, spectral methods based on graph filtering have emerged addressing over smoothing; however, up to now, they employ traditional neural networks that cannot efficiently exploit the structure of graph data. Motivated by this, we propose PointSpectrum, a spectral method that incorporates a set equivariant network to account for a graph's structure. PointSpectrum enhances the efficiency and expressiveness of spectral methods, while it outperforms or competes with state-of-the-art GRL methods. Overall, PointSpectrum addresses over smoothing by employing a graph filter and captures a graph's structure through set equivariance, lying on the intersection of GNNs and spectral methods. Our findings are promising for the benefits and applicability of this architectural shift for spectral methods and GRL.",

            "Abstract": "XML data storage is a critical issue due to the so-called I/O bottleneck problem emerged in nowdays computer systems. This paper presents an object-based XML data representation model towards effective XML data placement The proposed representation of XML documents is analysed in a two-level scheme: the external level is based on the structure of a browsing graph whereas the internal level is supported by a tree-like structure. The main contribution of the paper is that it exploits the object data model in order to consider XML data dependencies, access frequencies and constraints. A simulation model has been developed in order to evaluate different XML data placement strategies and the impact of the proposed representation model in the overall storage process. XML data placement is applied on a tertiary storage subsystem by either constructive or iterative placement techniques. Three popular policies: the Organ-pipe, the Camel and the Simulated Annealing algorithms, have been considered and experiments have been carried out on synthetic workloads of XML data sets. The need of applying an XML data storage policy is apparent as indicated by the resulted improvements in seek and service times. The Simulated Annealing approach has been proven to outperform the other XML data placement strategies.",

However, lack of any time-related data in the analysis process implicitly denies much of the dynamic nature of social tagging activity. In this paper we claim that holding a temporal dimension, allows for tracking macroscopic and microscopic users\u2019 interests, detecting emerging trends and recognizing events. To this end, we propose a time-aware co-clustering approach for acquiring semantic and temporal patterns out of the tagging activity. The resulted clusters contain both users and tags of similar patterns over time, and reveal non-obvious or \u201chidden\u201d relations among users and topics of their common interest.

This paper proposes a framework for the description and retrieval of multimedia data. The data are represented at both the syntactic (structure, metadata and low level features) and semantic (the meaning of the data) levels. We use the MPEG-7 standard, which provides a set of tools to describe multimedia content from different viewpoints, to represent the syntactic level. However, due to its XML schema based representation, MPEG-7 is not suitable to represent the semantic aspect of the data in a formal and concise way. Moreover, inferential mechanisms are not provided. To alleviate these limitations, we propose to extend MPEG-7 with a domain ontology, formalized using a logical formalism. Then, the semantic aspect of the data is described using the \u2026",

A CDN replicates content from the origin server to cache servers, scattered over the globe, in order to deliver content to end-users in a reliable and timely manner from nearby optimal surrogates. Content distribution on the Internet has received considerable research attention. It combines development of high-end computing technologies with highperformance networking infrastructure and distributed replica management techniques. Therefore, our aim is to categorize and analyze the existing CDNs, and to explore the uniqueness, weaknesses, opportunities, and future directions in this field.In this paper, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy with a broad coverage of CDNs in terms of organizational structure, content distribution mechanisms, request redirection techniques, and performance measurement methodologies. We study the existing CDNs in terms of their infrastructure, request-routing mechanisms, content replication techniques, load balancing, and cache management. We also provide an indepth analysis and state-of-the-art survey of CDNs. Finally, we apply the taxonomy to map various CDNs. The mapping of the taxonomy to the CDNs helps in \u201cgap\u201d analysis in the content networking domain. It also provides a means to identify the present and future development in this field and validates the applicability and accuracy of the taxonomy.",

The collective tagging activities of users can be represented in the form of a folksonomy, i.e., a tripartite network associating the users with the online content resources of their selection and the tags used to annotate them. The network structure of folksonomies has been extensively studied and exploited in a series of information retrieval systems. This chapter discusses the application of community detection, i.e., the identification of groups of nodes in a network that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network, on folksonomy networks.

            "Abstract": "The rapid spread of Internet technologies has redefined E-commerce, since opinion sharing by product reviews is an inseparable part of online purchasing. However, e-commerce openness has attracted malicious behaviors often expressed by fake reviews targeting public opinion manipulation. To address this phenomenon, several approaches have been introduced to detect spam reviews and spammer activity. In this paper, we propose an approach which integrates content and usage information to detect fake product reviews. The proposed model exploits both product reviews and reviewers\u2019 behavioral traits interlinked by specific spam indicators. In our proposed method, a fine-grained burst pattern detection is employed to better examine reviews generated over \u201csuspicious\u201d time intervals. Reviewer\u2019s past reviewing history is also exploited to determine the reviewer\u2019s overall \u201cauthorship\u201d reputation as \u2026",

The existing algorithms operate on small-to-medium-scale graphs; thus, we propose a close to linear time algorithm called Mani-Web suitable for large-scale graphs. The result is similar to the one produced by the manifold-learning technique Laplacian eigenmap that is tested on artificial manifolds and real web-graphs. Mani-Web can also be used as a general-purpose manifold-learning/dimensionality-reduction technique as long as the data can be represented as a graph.",

In this study, we propose and examine the relationship between narcissistic leaders and followers who are prone to experience uncertainty intensely and frequently in general, namely highly anxious followers. We do so by applying machine learning algorithms to account for personality traits in a large sample of leaders and followers on Twitter. We find that highly anxious followers are more likely to interact with narcissistic leaders in general, and male narcissistic leaders in particular. Finally, we also examined these interactions in the context of highly popular leaders and found that as leaders become more popular, they begin to attract less anxious followers, regardless of leader gender.

Given a pair of such datasets, it might be possible to reveal hidden dependencies between them since the presence of the one dataset elements may influence the elements of the other dataset and vice versa. Furthermore, the impact of these relations may last during a period instead of the time point of their co-occurrence. Mining such relations under those assumptions is a challenging problem. In this paper, we study two time-related datasets whose elements are bilaterally affected over time. We employ a co-clustering approach to identify groups of similar elements on the basis of two distinct criteria: the direction and duration of their impact. The proposed approach is evaluated using time-related news and stock\u2019s market real datasets.",

            "Abstract": "Content distribution networks (CDNs) balance costs and quality in services related to content delivery. Devising an efficient content outsourcing policy is crucial since, based on such policies, CDN providers can provide client-tailored content, improve performance, and result in significant economical gains. Earlier content outsourcing approaches may often prove ineffective since they drive prefetching decisions by assuming knowledge of content popularity statistics, which are not always available and are extremely volatile. This work addresses this issue, by proposing a novel self-adaptive technique under a CDN framework on which outsourced content is identified with no a priori knowledge of (earlier) request statistics. This is employed by using a structure-based approach identifying coherent clusters of \u201ccorrelated\u201d Web server content objects, the so-called Web page communities. These communities are the core outsourcing unit, and in this paper, a detailed simulation experimentation has shown that the proposed technique is robust and effective in reducing user-perceived latency as compared with competing approaches, ie, two communities-based approaches, Web caching, and non-CDN.",

We evaluate this scheme on three real-world tag networks by assessing the relatedness of same-cluster tags and by using tag clusters for tag recommendation. In addition, we compare our results to the ones derived from a baseline graph-based clustering method and from a popular modularity maximization clustering method.",

Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multi-media content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

Towards that objective, businesses can gain benefits by employing redefined team-building processes through which teams will be generated in a more cohesive and efficient manner. Aiming at forming productive and effective teams, we present PROTEAS, a framework where professional profiles and personality traits are both taken into account in the teambuilding process. The professional portrait of users is drawn from their LinkedIn accounts, while hints for their personality are obtained by a well-defined questionnaire based on the Big Five Factor Model. The significance of personality is substantiated by recent research work where it has been proven that personality traits can play a vital role in group dynamics. Motivated by the latter, PROTEAS defines a series of variables where characteristics of team members (eg skills, education) are combined with personality traits towards identifying candidate teams. All candidates are evaluated via a weight-based algorithm which calculates pair-wise similarities among teams\u2019 members and ranks the teams accordingly at the end. To assess the effectiveness of PROTEAS an academic setting has been chosen and through the experimentation a number of interesting observations occurred which are analogous to those of similar researches, confirming the significance of personality and professional compatibility between team members.",

We propose a method that maps a large network into a smaller graph with two kinds of nodes: a node of the first kind is representative of a community, a node of the second kind is neighbor to a representative and rejects the semantics of that community. Our approach encompasses a learning and ranking algorithm that derives this smaller graph from the original one, and a visualization algorithm that returns a graph layout to the observer. We report on our results on inspecting the network of a folksonomy.",

More than half of young social media users worldwide have been exposed to such prolonged and/or coordinated digital harassment. Victims can experience a wide range of emotions, with negative consequences such as embarrassment, depression, isolation from other community members, which embed the risk to lead to even more critical consequences, such as suicide attempts.In this work, we take the first concrete steps to understand the characteristics of abusive behavior in Twitter, one of today\u2019s largest social media platforms. We analyze 1.2 million users and 2.1 million tweets, comparing users participating in discussions around seemingly normal topics like the NBA, to those more likely to be hate-related, such as the Gamergate controversy, or the gender pay inequality at the BBC station \u2026",

In this paper we suggest an alternative framework called Hydra which enables the virtual fusion of any and as many currently available recommendation algorithms in such a distributed manner that algorithms' complexities are not summarized but parallelized. Therefore, we utilize the available algorithms and technologies aiming to achieve better accuracy in order to surpass even the most state of the art algorithms. In addition, Hydra can be used to find how algorithms interact with each other in order to estimate the resulting accuracy towards inventing a more precise algorithm \u2026",

While several mechanisms have been proposed to prevent, detect or mitigate hijacking events, it has not been studied how to accurately quantify the impact of an ongoing hijack. When detecting a hijack, existing methods do not estimate how many networks in the Internet are affected (before and/or after its mitigation). In this paper, we study fundamental and practical aspects of the problem of estimating the impact of an ongoing hijack through network measurements. We derive analytical results for the involved trade-offs and limits, and investigate the performance of different measurement approaches (control/data-plane measurements) and use of public measurement infrastructure. Our findings provide useful insights for the design of accurate hijack impact estimation methodologies. Based on these insights, we design (i) a lightweight and practical estimation methodology that employs ping measurements, and (ii) an estimator that employs public infrastructure measurements and eliminates correlations between them to improve the accuracy. We validate the proposed methodologies and findings against results from hijacking experiments we conduct in the real Internet.",

The so called organ-pipe and the camel data placement schemes are applied on mid-range Tertiary tape drive models where the area is divided into a speci c number of xed sized partitions. The expected seek time and the overall expected service time are derived for these tertiary storage models. Experiments are carried out for di erent models representing the most widely available tertiary storage media. The organ-pipe shows better performance metrics than the camel arrangement policy whereas both policies are improved by the increase in the number of tape area partitions.

This standard uses XML schema to define the descriptions. Therefore, it lacks ability to represent the data semantics in a formal and concise way and it does not allow integration and use of domain specific knowledge. Moreover, inference mechanisms are not provided and hence the extraction of implicit information is not (always) possible. To address these issues, we propose to add a conceptual layer on top of MPEG-7 metadata layer, where the domain knowledge is represented using a formal language. A set of mapping rules is proposed. They serve as a bridge between the two layers. Querying MPEG-7 descriptions using XML query languages such as XPath or XQuery requires to know MPEG-7 syntax and documents structure. To provide a flexible query formulation, we exploit the conceptual layer vocabulary to express user queries. A user query, making reference to terms specified at the conceptual level, is rewritten into an XQuery expression over MPEG-7 descriptions.",

            "Abstract": "The exponential growth in the availability of biomedical information has posed the need to solve retrieval issues raised in huge sequence/biomedical article repositories. Biomedical article databases, like PubMed, are huge repositories of useful biological information given in natural language form and thus not easily processed by computers. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms have been proposed to facilitate the process of electronically retrieving biomedical articles, which are semantically related. However, most of the classification algorithms, used for information retrieval, require numeric representations of either the keywords or the MeSH terms of the articles. These representations are essentially vectors of variables forming large multivariate numerical datasets. In order to combine the information from keyword datasets and MeSH datasets, this paper proposes a multivariate statistical approach which can quantify their relationships and reveal the underlying correlation. The basis of this approach is a mathematical technique, called non-linear canonical correlation analysis (NLCCA). NLCCA can assemble information from several datasets by building a model describing the whole of the data. The method was applied to a large number of articles from PubMed. Certain statistics obtained from the analysis showed that the degree of correlation between MeSH terms and keywords is high. The method results in the reduction of data dimensionality, containing in one dataset with new variables significant information of the original data. These results are very important for the efficient description and visualization of the data in order to explore \u2026",

They provide the base for development of a fauna of related applications including virtual tours and data management. Common difficulties such as the ever changing software specifications from domain experts make this task challenging as the alterations of the database schema lead to massive code rewrites. Within this context we propose and implement in practice a model for automated code generation building essentially a content management application by traversing a custom tree-based ER-schema.",

Therefore, new issues have emerged in terms of storage and access control policies for XML documents. Concerning the storage issues, the majority of proposals rely on the usage of typical database management systems (DBMSs), whereas XML documents can also be stored in other storage environments (such as file systems and LDAP directories). It is important to consider storage and access control together since these issues are essential in implementations for XML documents management. Moreover, the chapter focuses on the recent access control models which guarantee the security of the XML-based data, which are located in a variety of storage topologies.

            "Abstract": "In today's connected society, many people rely on mHealth and self-tracking (ST) technology to help them break their sedentary lifestyle and stay fit. However, there is scarce evidence of such technological interventions' effectiveness, and there are no standardized methods to evaluate the short- and long-term impact of such technologies on people's physical activity and health. This work aims to help ST and HCI practitioners and researchers by empowering them with systematic guidelines and an extensible framework for constructing such technological interventions. This survey and the proposed design and evaluation framework aim to contribute to health behavior change and user engagement sustainability. To this end, we conduct a literature review of 117 papers between 2008 and 2020, which identifies the core ST HCI design methods and their efficacy, as well as and the most comprehensive list to date of user engagement evaluation metrics for ST. Based on the review's findings, we propose the PAST SELF end-to-end framework to facilitate the classification, design, and evaluation of ST technology. PAST SELF systematically organizes common methods and guidelines from existing works in ubiquitous ST research. Hence, it has potential applications in industrial and scientific settings and can be utilized by practitioners and researchers alike.",

The problem is viewed as a multi-modal analysis process where specialized techniques are used to overcome the obstacles arising from the heterogeneity of data. Focusing at the optimal combination of low-level features (i.e., early fusion), we present a bio-inspired algorithm for feature selection that weights the features based on their appropriateness to represent a resource. Under the same objective of optimal feature combination we also examine the use of pLSA-based aspect models, as the means to define a latent semantic space where heterogeneous types of information can be effectively combined. Tagged images taken from social sites have been used in the characteristic scenarios of image clustering and retrieval, to demonstrate the benefits of multi-modal analysis in social media.",

The goal of this paper is to extend the integration process by the introduction of caching techniques to the client environment, in order to decrease access time to objects distributed over various information sources. In particular, two methods for optimizing distributed objects exchange have been studied and implemented; the rst method is based on evolutionary computation, whereas the second one is based on the Least-Recently-Used caching algorithm. In our model, queries ask for documents or objects which are identi ed by the information source and their placement within that source. Objects are kept in cache area based on their access pattern and the cache is updated by the two proposed algorithms. Both methods are evaluated experimentally, and results show that the evolutionary computing based algorithm is superior than the traditional LRU algorithm.",

Two video data representation levels are considered to capture the frequencies of accesses at external (video objects) and internal (video clips) levels.

            "Abstract": "Microblogging services have nowadays become a very popular communication tool among Internet users. Since millions of users share opinions on different aspects of life everyday, microblogging web-sites are considered as a credible source for exploring both factual and subjective information. This fact has inspired research in the area of automatic sentiment analysis. In this paper we propose an emotional aware clustering approach which performs sentiment analysis of users tweets on the basis of an emotional dictionary and groups tweets according to the degree they express a specific set of emotions. Experimental evaluations on datasets derived from Twitter prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, XML has become the standard for representing and exchanging data over the Web and several approaches have been proposed for efficiently managing, storing, querying and representing XML data originating from diverse and often heterogeneous sources. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a promising technology for XML data storage and retrieval since it facilitates access to information organized under a variety of frameworks and applications. As an open, vendor-neutral standard, LDAP provides an extendable architecture for centralized storage and management of information that needs to be available for today\u2019s distributed systems and services. The similarities between XML and LDAP data representation have led to the idea of processing XML data within the LDAP framework. This chapter focuses on the topic of LDAP and XML integration with emphasis on the storage and retrieval \u2026",

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very \u201cactive\u201d during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Fake news spreading is an ever increasing phenomenon which is deeply tied with the involvement of humans as they tend to adopt, circulate and fall for misinformation stories. However, there has not been significant work in the literature on the role that the human factor has and what characteristics of human users correlate with the diffusion of fake news. Such research would be valuable to better understand and combat misinformation patterns in human dominated platforms such as social networks. Recent work has shown that behavioral user profiling leads to promising results in identifying fake news spreaders. In spite of this, no in-depth analysis has been made to figure out the exact features that correlate with fake news spreading behavior. This work suggests an explainable human-centric approach on detecting fake news spreading behavior by building a fake news spreader classifier, utilizing the psychological characteristics of human users and applying state of the art explanation techniques. Experimentation demonstrates that our model achieves promising results at detecting fake news spreaders by utilizing user characteristics while also offering explanations of which of those characteristics contribute to the fake news spreading behavior.In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that aims to provide a fully explainable setup that evaluates fake news spreading based on users credibility applied to public discussions on Twitter threads and aiming for a comprehensive way to combat fake news circulation. The way we approach this is by utilizing the predictions made by the fake news spreader classifier built before on \u2026",

Past scientific work focused on studying these forms of abusive activity in popular online social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Building on such work, we present an eight month study of the various forms of abusive behavior on Twitter, in a holistic fashion. Departing from past work, we examine a wide variety of labeling schemes, which cover different forms of abusive behavior. We propose an incremental and iterative methodology that leverages the power of crowdsourcing to annotate a large collection of tweets with a set of abuse-related labels. By applying our methodology and performing statistical analysis for label merging or elimination, we identify a reduced but robust set of labels to characterize abuse-related tweets. Finally, we offer a characterization of our annotated dataset of 80 thousand tweets, which we make publicly available for further scientific exploration.",

The data to be stored are defined as variable-sized data blocks, and a specific cache area is reserved for data prefetching and caching. An evolutionary algorithm is proposed for identifying the storage objects to be prefetched, whereas a simulation model is developed to support appropriate parameterization of clients, cache area, and storage units. The parameters defined facilitate the evaluation of expected performance in order to comment on the potential improvements due to prefetching.

The achievement of this e\u2010service delivery has been aligned to critical challenges such as, service transparency; service simplification and improvement; time minimization etc. However, evidence from European scorecards shows significant delays in this e\u2010service delivery between the member States, with gaps between local and national levels across Europe. This phenomenon generates questions regarding this e\u2010service, which could be summarized to the following: which is the context of the application for building permission e\u2010service delivery? This question concerns an analysis of the respective information system, e\u2010service process and even legal framework that accompany this service. An answer to this question will return useful information regarding a complexity of such a project, which could justify the existing gaps or delays even beyond the European borders. Another question concerns how have different countries achieved in delivering building permission e\u2010services?

This work addresses this issue, by proposing a novel self-adaptive technique under a CDN framework on which outsourced content is identified with no a-priori knowledge of (earlier) request statistics. This is employed by using a structure-based approach identifying coherent clusters of \"correlated\" Web server content objects, the so-called Web page communities. These communities are the \u2026",

Thus, access control mechanisms should also be distributed in order to protect them effectively. A recent idea in the access control theory is the delegation and revocation of rights, i.e. the passing over of one clients rights to the other and vice versa. Here, we propose an XML-based distributed delegation module which can be integrated into a distributed role-based access control mechanism protecting networks. The idea of X.509v3 certificates is used for the transfer of authorization information referring to a client. The modules are XML-based and all of the associated data structures are expressed through Document Type Definitions (DTDs).",

In this paper, we examine the security problems related to XML data and present our approach, the XML Security model, for enforcing security policies in XML based Information systems. Our methodology has been based on the study of the XML data model, on the identification of the security requirements of XML Information systems and on the survey of security models which have been proposed to support the conventional data models (relational, object-oriented, hypertext etc). The proposed approach takes into account and exploits the specific characteristics of XML data and incorporates the flexibility of Role based Access Control policies.",

However, their performance gain is limited since the storage space in CDN\u2019s servers is not used optimally. In order to manage their storage capacity in an efficient way, we integrate caching techniques in CDNs. The challenge is to decide which objects would be devoted to caching so as the CDN\u2019s server may be used both as a replicator and as a proxy server. In this article, we propose a nonlinear, nonparametric model which classifies the CDN\u2019s server cache into two parts. Through a detailed simulation environment, we show that the proposed technique can yield significant reduction in user-perceived latency as compared with other heuristic schemes.",

Several new access control models have been introduced. Most of the proposed approaches increase the complexity of the access control procedure and at the same time expressing these models is becoming complicated. Improving the execution time of the access control procedures is a challenging task due to the increased number of resources (available over the Internet) and the size of the audience involved. In this paper, we introduce an approach for speeding up the access control procedure under an environment accessed by known subjects (i.e. subjects whose identity and attributes are known apriori through a subscription phase). This approach is based on some update functions (employed at the background during idle times) over files which are associated with \u2026",

Such vectors are mosquitoes, which are one of the deadliest animals in the world. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases, causing more than 700,000 deaths annually [59]. In Europe, according to a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) review [48], VBDs are widespread and are the best studied diseases associated with climate change. Despite the fact that many of these diseases have been effectively controlled, the last two decades the emergence of global trends is driving the re-emergence of mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs)[24]. Mosquito-Borne Diseases (MBDs) are diseases spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Tropical MBDs, such as West Nile Virus (WNV) transmitted with Culex mosquitoes, Malaria transmitted with Anopheles mosquitoes, and Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika transmitted with Aedes mosquitoes have posed challenges to national public health authorities in the European region [6]. The changing climatic and ecological conditions, global travel and trade, human behavior, as well as the rapid and unplanned urbanization, are key trends that influence the seasonal and geographic distribution of vectors\u2019 population and therefore the transmission of the pathogens [19].It is a wrong belief that MBDs are a problem that only the developing countries face. Europe has experienced many cases of MBDs outbreaks in the last 10 years. 2010 was a year with large outbreaks of West Nile Virus in Greece and Russia having 262 and \u2026",

To address this problem, we have developed a new model that is based on the feedback information provided to the I/O subsystem controller. The presented model is applied to a multiple disk drive subsystem, which serves requests in parallel. Under conventional servicing, each request refers to a specific drive and is placed on the corresponding disk drive queue in order to be serviced. The proposed feedback-based model redirects requests among disk drives towards performance gain. The feedback is evaluated by a metric identified by the queue length per disk drive. Performance analysis proves that the feedback-based model results in effective and improved load distribution.

This question concerns an analysis of the respective information system, e-service process and even legal framework that accompany this service. An answer to this question will return useful information regarding a complexity of such a project, which could justify the existing gaps or delays even beyond the European borders.

Moreover, most of the content available online is either explicitly or implicitly characterized by a set of categories organized in a taxonomy, allowing the page-level navigation patterns to be generalized to a higher, aggregate level. In this direction, the authors present the Frequent Generalized Pattern (FGP) algorithm. FGP takes as input the transaction data and a hierarchy of categories and produces generalized association rules that contain transaction items and/or item categories. The results can be used to generate association rules and subsequently recommendations for the users. The algorithm can be applied to the log files of a typical Web site \u2026",

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users \u2026",

            "Abstract": "It goes without saying that the museums are a critical cultural medium for preserving and demonstrating items of historical value to the general public. This exposure to the general public attracted the scientific community attention for proposing alternative museum access methods improving the visitors' experience. In this context we may identify two distinct visitor access methods, the'physical visitor presence'and the'virtual visitor presence'. The physical visitor presence suggests a visitor that actually enters a museum building the traditional way. The overall experience is natural since the visitor actually sees or even touches the archeological items. However finding specific information or archeological items can be a hard and time consuming task. Moreover, the museum's geographic location may prevent a visitor from visiting the museum. An alternative access method is the virtual visitor presence where the visitor \u2026",

            "Abstract": "OSN platforms are under attack by intruders born and raised within their own ecosystems. These attacks have multiple scopes from mild critiques to violent offences targeting individual or community rights and opinions. Negative publicity on microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, is due to the infamous Twitter bots which highly impact posts\u2019 circulation and virality. A wide and ongoing research effort has been devoted to develop appropriate countermeasures against emerging \u201carmies of bots\u201d. However, the battle against bots is still intense and unfortunately, it seems to lean on the bot-side. Since, in an effort to win any war, it is critical to know your enemy, this work aims to demystify, reveal, and widen inherent characteristics of Twitter bots such that multiple types of bots are recognized and spotted early. More specifically in this work we: (i) extensively analyze the importance and the type of data and features used to generate ML models for bot classification, (ii) address the open problem of multi-class bot detection, identifying new types of bots, and share two new datasets towards this objective, (iii) provide new individual ML models for binary and multi-class bot classification and (iv) utilize explainable methods and provide comprehensive visualizations to clearly demonstrate interpretable results. Finally, we utilize all of the above in an effort to improve the so called Bot-Detective online service. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy, explainability and scalability, comparable with the state of the art, despite multi-class classification challenges.",

Since each user has his/her own understanding and point of view of a given document, we propose an approach in which the index model provides a Personalized Social Document Representation (PerSaDoR) of each document per user based on his/her activities in a social tagging system. The proposed approach relies on matrix factorization to compute the PerSaDoR of documents that match a query, at query time. The complexity analysis shows that our approach scales linearly with the number of documents that match the query, and thus, it can scale to very large datasets. PerSaDoR has been also intensively evaluated by an offline study and by a user survey operated on a large public dataset from delicious showing significant benefits for personalized search compared to state of the art \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Information exchange has been increased drastically and rapidly due to the major large scale Internet expansion. The structure of information sources worldwide has been altered and both structured and semistructured data are stored in various heterogeneous information spaces. Several tools have been developed for facilitating the rapid integration of the different information structures and accessing needs across heterogeneous sources over the Internet. This paper proposes a caching approach to extend the heterogeneous information sources integration process such that distributed objects are better accessed and retrieved. Our caching approach considers objects that are formed in response to certain queries posed over a specified number of distinct information sources. A methodology based on the notion of genetic algorithms is studied aiming at facilitating distributed objects exchange and accessing. In the proposed model, queries refer to documents or objects identified by their information source and their location within that source. Objects remain in the cache area based on their frequency of accesses, their popularity and their server priority, whereas the cache content is regularly updated. The proposed methods are experimented and results are compared with the corresponding results of the conventional Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement algorithm. The proposed evolutionary approach based algorithm is proven to be superior than the traditional LRU algorithm with respect to both cache and byte hit ratios.",

            "Abstract": "The rising popularity of photo-sharing applications on the Web has led to the generation of huge amounts of personal image collections. Browsing through image collections of such magnitude is currently supported by the use of tags. However, tags suffer from several limitations\u2014such as polysemy, lack of uniformity, and spam\u2014thus not presenting an adequate solution to the problem of content organization. Therefore, automated contentorganization methods are of particular importance to improve the content-consumption experience. Because it\u2019s common for users to associate their photo-captured experiences with some landmarks\u2014for example, a tourist site or an event, such as a music concert or a gathering with friends\u2014we can view landmarks and events as natural units of organization for large image collections. It\u2019s for this reason that automating the process of detecting such concepts in large image sets can enhance the experience of accessing massive amounts of pictorial content.In this article, we present a novel scheme for automatically detecting landmarks and events in tagged image collections. Our proposal is based on the simple yet elegant concept of image similarity graphs as a means of combining multiple notions of similarity between images in a photo collection; in our case, we use visual and tag similarity. We perform clustering on such image similarity graphs by means of community detection, 1 a process that identifies on the graph groups of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. In contrast to conventional clustering schemes such as k-means or hierarchical agglomerative \u2026",

In this paper, an approach for improving the retrieval in these systems, in case of ambiguous terms, is presented that attempts to perform tag disambiguation and, at the same time, provide users with relevant content. The idea is based on a mashup that combines data and functionality of two major web 2.0 sites, namely Flickr and Wikipedia and aims at enhancing content retrieval for web users. A case study with the ambiguous notion \u201cApple\u201d illustrates the value of the proposed approach.",

The various gene functions can be described by standardized and structured vocabularies, called bio-ontologies. The assignment of bio-ontolgy terms to genes is carried out by means of applying certain methods to datasets extracted from biomedical articles. These methods originate from data mining and machine learning and include maximum entropy or support vector machines (SVM).The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative to the existing methods for functionally annotating genes. The methodology involves building of classification models, validation and graphical representations of the results and reduction of the dimensions of the dataset.Classification models are constructed by Linear discriminant \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Mosquito-Borne Diseases (MBDs) are known to be more prevalent in the tropics, and yet, in the last two decades, they are spreading to many other countries, especially in Europe. The set (volume) of environmental, meteorological and other spatio-temporally variable parameters affecting mosquito abundance makes the modeling and prediction tasks quite challenging. Up to now, mosquito abundance prediction problems were addressed with ad-hoc area-specific and genus-tailored approaches. We propose and develop MAMOTH, a generic and accurate Machine Learning model that predicts mosquito abundances for the upcoming period (the Mean Absolute Error of the predictions do not deviate more than 14%). The designed model relies on satellite Earth Observation and other in-situ geo-spatial data to tackle the problem. MAMOTH is not site- nor mosquito genus-dependent; thus, it can be easily replicated and applied to multiple cases without any special parametrization. The model was applied to different mosquito genus and species Culex spp. as potential vectors for West Nile Virus, Anopheles spp. for Malaria and Aedes albopictus for Zika/Chikungunya/Dengue) and in different areas of interest (Italy, Serbia, France, Germany). The results show that the model performs accurately and consistently for all case studies. Additionally, the evaluation of different cases, with the model using the same principles, provides an opportunity for multi-case and multi-scope comparative studies.",

Visible to the naked eye, regular depressions in the ground may foretell the places of underground space, created or influenced by the flow of water or due to geological structures, characterizing the substrate as inconsistent. These spaces seriously affect the possibility of placing wind turbines. By using LIDAR high correlation is visible between the characteristics of the terrain model and the location of underground geological spaces that could endanger the constructions that will be formed in the area. While the construction is being built the ground emphasizes so much that wrong location can simply cause the collapse of the structure. The results were supported with geophysical researches, using three methods: ERT-electrical resistivity tomography, GPR-ground penetrating radar, and the seismic method.",

            "Abstract": "The recent advent and wide adoption of Social Bookmarking Systems (SBS) has disrupted the traditional model of online content publishing and consumption. Until recently, the majority of content consumed by people was published as a result of a centralized selection process. Nowadays, the large-scale adoption of the Web 2.0 paradigm has diffused the content selection process to the masses. Modern SBS-based applications permit their users to submit their preferred content, comment on and rate the content of other users and establish social relations with each other. As a result, the evolution of popularity of socially bookmarked content constitutes nowadays an overly complex phenomenon calling for a multi-aspect analysis approach. This chapter attempts to provide a unified treatment of the phenomenon by studying four aspects of popularity of socially bookmarked content:(a) the distributional properties of content consumption,(b) its evolution in time,(c) the correlation between the semantics of online content and its popularity, and (d) the impact of online social networks on the content consumption behavior of individuals. To this end, a case study is presented where the proposed analysis framework is applied to a large dataset collected from digg, a popular social bookmarking and rating application.",

Unlike Web caching, which exploits the temporal locality, Web prefetching utilizes the spatial locality of Web objects. Specifically, Web prefetching fetches objects that are likely to be accessed in the near future and stores them in advance. In this context, a sophisticated combination of these two techniques may cause significant improvements on the performance of the Web infrastructure. Considering that there have been several caching policies proposed in the past, the challenge is to extend them by using data mining techniques.

            "Abstract": "We present a technical demonstration of an online city exploration application that helps users identify interesting spots in a city by use of photo clusters corresponding to landmarks and events. Our application, called ClustTour, is based on an efficient landmark and event detection scheme for tagged photo collections. The proposed scheme relies on the combination of a graph-based photo clustering algorithm, making use of both visual and tag information of photos, with a cluster classification and merging module. ClustTour creates a map-based visualization of the identified photo clusters that are classified in prominent categories and are filterable by time and tag. We believe that such an application can greatly facilitate the task of knowing a city through its landmarks and events. So far, the demo has been based on a large photo dataset focused on Barcelona, and it is gradually expanding to contain photo \u2026",

Caching and replication have been combined and applied in prototype systems in order to reduce the overall bandwidth and increase system's fault tolerance. This paper presents a model for optimizing access performance when requesting Web objects across distributed systems. The replication and caching scheme is designed by the use of an evolutionary computation algorithm. Cached data are considered as a population evolving over simulated time, replicating the most prominent data to dedicated replication servers. The simulation model is experimented and tested under cache traces provided by the Squid proxy cache server at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Cache hit rates and bytes hit length are reported showing that the proposed evolutionary mechanisms improve cache consistency and reliability.",

In the present paper, earlier analytic models are studied again, under a different perspective which takes into account the disk scheduling policy applied and the total number of cylinders per disk. Our analysis is exact and results in new formulae for the expected seek distances traveled for reads and writes. The deviation of the earlier formulae with respect to the new exact formulae decrements with decreasing number of shadowed disks, increasing number of disk cylinders, as well as decreasing ration of reads vs. writes. Thus, it is verified that earlier results could be used as good approximations in the \u2026",

Identical disks (comprising the shadowed disk) sets have been adopted as an effective secondary storage replication scheme. In the present paper, we introduce a shadowed disk model and mathematically analyze its theoretical expected performance measures by applying the nearer-server rule to satisfy the requests. In addition, we introduce the corresponding simulation model, where each disk is modeled by means of a prototype disk configuration and specific commercial disks metrics. Furthermore, the mirrored disks model is studied extensively as a boundary disk topology of the shadowed disks set. The developed simulation model is experimented and tested under various workloads produced by real disk I/O traces. The performance of the simulation model is compared to the analytical results and, thus, it is validated since analysis and simulation give close results.",

PKI involves digital certificates which are managed by certificate authorities (CAs) that authenticate users identity, in order to establish encrypted communication channels. The centralized operation model of CAs has already caused several targeted attacks due to the distribution of rogue certificates. Users remain vulnerable since it is too challenging to detect and revoke such certificates, but also to speed up the user update process when a certificate is revoked. To address such issues, a decentralized PKI alternative approach, targeting Domain Validated certificates, is proposed. In the proposed approach, which is based on blockchain technologies (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), the transparency, immutability and decentralization aspects of these technologies have been leveraged \u2026",

In fact, up to now, they have entered an arms race with the perpetrators, who constantly change tactics to evade the detection algorithms deployed by these platforms. Such algorithms, not disclosed to the public for obvious reasons, are typically custom-designed and tuned to detect only one specific type of abusive behavior, but usually miss other related behaviors.

Each artificial graph is assigned a pre-specified clustering, which is compared to clustering solutions obtained by the algorithms under evaluation. Hence, the pre-specified clustering should comply with specifications that are assumed to delimit a good clustering. However, existing construction processes for artificial graphs do not set explicit specifications for the pre-specified clustering. We call these graphs, randomly clustered graphs. Here, we introduce a new class of benchmark graphs which are clustered according to explicit specifications. We call them optimally clustered graphs. We present the basic properties of optimally clustered graphs and propose algorithms for their construction. Experimentally, we compare two community mining algorithms using both randomly and optimally clustered graphs. Results \u2026",

This work presents a novel FLR extension, namely agglomerative similarity measure FLR, or asmFLR for short, for clustering based on a similarity measure function, the latter (function) may also be based on a metric. We demonstrate application in a metric space emerging from a weighted graph towards partitioning it. The asmFLR compares favorably with four alternative graph-clustering algorithms from the literature in a series of computational experiments on artificial data. In addition, our work introduces a novel index for the quality of clustering, which (index) compares favorably with two popular indices from the literature.",

Until recently, the majority of content consumed by people was published as a result of a centralized selection process. Nowadays, the large-scale adoption of the Web 2.0 paradigm has diffused the content selection process to the masses. Modern SBS-based applications permit their users to submit their preferred content, comment on and rate the content of other users and establish social relations with each other. As a result, the evolution of popularity of socially bookmarked content constitutes nowadays an overly complex phenomenon calling for a multi-aspect analysis approach.

An evolutionary algorithm is proposed for identifying the storage objects to be prefetched and cached.

A two\u2013level representation model is considered to capture the frequencies of accesses at external (video objects) and internal (video clips) levels. The video data placement strategies are evaluated and the impact of video data representation model on the overall storage process is investigated and commented. Video data placement is employed on a tertiary storage topology under three well known placement policies governed by the Organ-pipe, the Camel and the Simulated Annealing algorithms.

However, their performance gain is limited since the storage space in CDN's servers is not used optimally. In order to manage their storage capacity in an efficient way, we integrate caching techniques in CDNs. The challenge is to decide which objects would be devoted to caching so as the CDN's server may be used both as a replicator and as a proxy server. In this paper we propose a nonlinear non-parametric model which classifies the CDN's server cache into two parts. Through a detailed simulation environment, we show that the proposed technique can yield significant reduction in user-perceived latency as compared with other heuristic schemes.",

            "Abstract": "Information exchange has shown a rapid growth due to Internet expansion and has altered the structure of information sources worldwide. Structured and semistructured data are stored in various heterogeneous information sources and, thus, tools have been developed for facilitating their rapid integration. The goal of this paper is to extend the integration process by the introduction of caching techniques to the client environment, in order to decrease access time to objects distributed over various information sources. In particular, two methods for optimizing distributed objects exchange have been studied and implemented the first method is based on evolutionary computation, whereas the second one is based on the Least-Recently-Used caching algorithm. In our model, queries ask for documents or objects which are identified by the information source and their placement within that source. Objects are kept in cache area based on their access pattern and the cache is updated by the two proposed algorithms. Both methods are evaluated experimentally, and results show that the evolutionary computing based algorithm is superior than the traditional LRU algorithm.",

This paper presents contributions in several directions to improve the state-of-the-art in RGB-D scene labeling. First, we present a novel combination of depth and color features to recognize different object categories in isolation. Then, we use a context model that exploits detection results of other objects in the scene to jointly optimize labels of co-occurring objects in the scene. Finally, we investigate the use of social media mining to develop the context model, and provide an investigation of its convergence. We perform thorough experimentation on both the publicly available RGB-D Dataset from the University of Washington as well as on the NYU scene dataset. An analysis of the results shows interesting insights about contextual \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The recent advent and wide adoption of Social Bookmarking Systems (SBS) has disrupted the traditional model of online content publishing. Until recently, the majority of content consumed by people was published as a result of a centralized selection process. Nowadays, large-scale adoption of the Web 2.0 paradigm has diffused the content selection to the masses. As a result, the evolution of online content popularity nowadays constitutes an overly complex phenomenon involving both semantic and social aspects. Work in the era before the wide adoption of Web 2.0 mostly focused on estimating web resource popularity under a web graph model. Recently, several aspects of the popularity dynamics emerging in the context of Web 2.0 applications have attracted significant research interest. Here, we introduce a formalism that enables the study of the dynamics underlying the popularity evolution of online content within an SBS. Based on this formalism, we carry out a study of the diggTM popularity dynamics. Our study confirms the power law nature of content popularity in SBS, and presents new insights into the temporal aspects of popularity under the influence of the social factor.",

            "Abstract": "The emerging evolution of technology has changed the role of mobile phones which apart from being communication devices are also powerful devices for uploading and consuming content. This fact poses new challenges for the mobile industry, which needs to develop and adapt useful and appealing services for the users in order to enhance the role of the mobile phone as a mainstream device. Adopting and using mobile social networks sites and other Web 2.0 services is expected to be inline with such a mobile technology trend. Current mobile web technologies offer a computer-like user-experience since a user can easily generate and share digital content from his/her mobile. However, current services and applications do not include techniques for analyzing this mass user-generated input (eg content, annotations), user interactions (eg ranking) and social interactions (eg relationships). Knowledge extracted from this massive user contribution and interaction can offer personalized added-value services enabling more efficient mobile usage. Our goal is to outline this information analysis gaps in existing services and going one step further to suggest possible solutions. Aiming at social networks we discuss novel methods for analyzing users\u2019 actions and modeling users\u2019 social relationships. The goal from these suggestions is to extract the underlying knowledge from users\u2019 tagging activities, users\u2019 generated content and users\u2019 social relationships within a social network. We present our points with indicative example services.",

Two-headed disks may have either two autonomous heads per surface or may have two heads moving concurrently at a fixed distance. The performance of both models is examined by assuming that successive seeks are either independent or dependent. Exact new formulae are derived for each of the aforementioned cases and generalized performance comparisons of all these disk configurations are made.",

Caching has been applied to distributed I/O subsystems as a standard solution to the problems of fastening data accessibility and increasing data reliability. Cache consistency mechanisms have been implemented in order to influence the cache usefulness in a positive way. This paper presents a new caching technique based on the genetic algorithm idea and examines the effect of this technique on the parallel I/O cache consistency and updating process. Cached data blocks on parallel disks are considered as a population evolving over simulated time and are updated at regular intervals towards an improved cache content. The proposed cache update scheme is compared with the LRU caching scheme which has been widely adopted. The proposed technique shows improved performance compared to conventional caching under simulation runs for various workloads.",

Our framework analyzes the spatial distribution of large city-centered collections of user contributed photos at different time scales in order to index the most popular spots of a city in a time-aware manner. Subsequently, the photo sets belonging to the same spatiotemporal context are clustered in order to extract representative photos for each spot. The resulting application enables users to obtain flexible summaries of the most important spots in a city given a temporal slice (time of the day, month, season). The demonstration will be based on a photo dataset covering major European cities.",

PKI involves digital certificates which are managed by certificate authorities (CAs) that authenticate users identity, in order to establish encrypted communication channels. The centralized operation model of CAs has already caused several targeted attacks due to the distribution of rogue certificates. Users remain vulnerable since it is too challenging to detect and revoke such certificates, but also to speed up the user update process when a certificate is revoked. To address such issues, a decentralized PKI alternative approach, targeting Domain Validated certificates, is proposed. In the proposed approach, which is based on blockchain technologies (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), the transparency, immutability and decentralization aspects of these technologies have been leveraged.

This work proposes smart city profiling with the introduction of the\" CityDNA\" model, according which, smart city's dimensions' relevance can be captured and visualized. Based on this model, a smart city's profile can be defined and characterized, under a simple comprehensive view of local needs and challenges. A particular smart city scenario is highlighted as a proof of concept for CityDNA and future design and implementation ideas are identified and justified.",

            "Abstract": "Social Bookmarking Systems (SBS) have been widely adopted in the last years, and thus they have had a significant impact on the way that online content is accessed, read and rated. Until recently, the decision on what content to display in a publisher\u2019s web pages was made by one or at most few authorities. In contrast, modern SBS-based applications permit their users to submit their preferred content, to comment on and to rate the content of other users and establish social relations with each other. In that way, the vision of the social media is realized, ie the online users collectively decide upon the interestingness of the available bookmarked content. This paper attempts to provide insights into the dynamics emerging from the process of content rating by the user community. To this end, the paper proposes a framework for the study of the statistical properties of an SBS, the evolution of bookmarked content popularity and user activity in time, as well as the impact of online social networks on the content consumption behavior of individuals. The proposed analysis framework is applied to a large dataset collected from digg, a popular social media application.",

However, the study of naturally occurring emotions in virtual interactions is limited.The REVITAL study adopted a combined methodology to study emotion experience in real and virtual social interactions using:(a) an experience sampling methodology (ESM) of emotion states in real and virtual social interactions, and (b), a lexicon-based approach to identify the emotions expressed in naturally occurring computer-mediated communications and to verify the results extracted from the previously conducted analysis (ie, offline social activities\u2019 analysis).",

Although several AI driven bot detection methods have been implemented, the justification of bot classification and characterization remains quite opaque and AI decisions lack in ethical responsibility. Most of these approaches operate with AI black-boxed algorithms and their efficiency is often questionable.

In this paper, we present a cache replacement algorithm (so-called FRES-CAR), which identifies the objects that should be evicted by considering together three important criteria: object's frequency, recency and size.

            "Abstract": "The emergent Web 2.0 reality has advanced a new role for Web users since they now approach information in a dynamic way regulating content, opinions, and policies. Revealing, analyzing and exploiting non-evident (often hidden) communities formulated in Web social networks is crucial, since communities influence content distribution and drive Web trends and events. It is now important to overcome typical single-criterion community detection methodologies (usually originating from graph mining), and within multidisciplinary efforts advance novel multiple criteria approaches which will identify communities of high coherence and homogeneity.In constructing such Web community indices (both now and in the future Web context) it is vital to consider human behavioral and cognitive criteria, since, it is those that affect users\u2019 activities, preferences and social interactions on the Web. We therefore argue, that within typical processing criteria (such as frequency of access, user profiling, and content semantics), we need to incorporate affective criteria which are closely connected to users\u2019 actions and social interactions. In this paper we present an emotion aware clustering approach that incorporates affect as a central component. This approach can be applied to a range of activities such as: highlighting non-obvious and evolving phenomena on the Web, improving data accessing performance, assisting the design of novel content promotion strategies, and developing targeted actions of personalized recommendation. The report identifies the scientific and technical background needed for such multidisciplinary approach on the Web 2.0 and \u2026",

Although the aspects of privacy and security, and individuals' behavior in social networking are important for the successful development of smart cities, they have not been adequately discussed. To this end, this study aims to address this issue by \u2026",

Many recommenders suffer from the absence of indicative features capable of capturing precisely the users' preferences which constitutes a vital requirement for a successful recommendation technique. Aiming to overcome such limitations, we introduce a framework through which we extract dissimilarity features based on differences in preferences of items' attributes among users. We enrich the representations of items with the extracted features for the purpose of increasing the ability of a recommender to highlight the preferred items. In this direction, we incorporate the dissimilarity features into different types of classifiers/recommenders (C4.5 and lib-SVM) and evaluate their importance in terms of precision and relevance \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Users in Online Social Networks (OSN) leaves traces that reflect their personality characteristics. The study of these traces is important for a number of fields, such as a social science, psychology, OSN, marketing, and others. Despite a marked increase on research in personality prediction on based on online behavior the focus has been heavily on individual personality traits largely neglecting relational facets of personality. This study aims to address this gap by providing a prediction model for a holistic personality profiling in OSNs that included socio-relational traits (attachment orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from OSN accounts of users. Then, we designed a machine learning model that predicts scores for the psychological traits of the users based on the extracted features. The proposed model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychological theory, i.e, utilizing interrelations among personality facets, and leads to increased accuracy in comparison with the state of the art approaches. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model to two datasets, one of random OSN users and one of organizational leaders, and compared their psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two groups can be clearly separated by only using their psychological profiles, which opens a promising direction for future research on OSN user characterization and classification.",

The constraint system, FT\u00a3, provides information-ordering constraints interpreted over feature trees. Based on this approach, we show how a generalization of FT\u00a3 combined with path constraints can be used to formally represent and state constraints and reason over semistructured data.

As a result, Question and Answer (Q&A) sites, like Stack Overflow, have seen large growth. The questions are characterized by tags, which support developers to easily trace their topic of interest. Very often, these tags refer to technologies that are connected or serve the same purpose. This work is motivated by the fact that despite the volume of questions and technologies change over time, tags inter-connections carry insightful information since they can be utilized to monitor the technology trends and their dynamics given technologies fast simultaneous evolution over time. This work recognizes the value of such connections, to reveal associations of technologies and to support the scientific community, which can be highly inspired by this study, using advanced data analysis tools. Benefits of the present study include early notification of the labor market needs, competency discovery and directions for educational planning. In the present study, graph theory principles and tools were employed to profile chronologically the evolution and the associations of technologies related to tags, and the experimentation carried out has involved the entire set of Stack Overflow questions posted during a decade, between 2008 and 2018. Very interesting conclusions are summarized based on the tags related to Computer Science Technologies (Hard Skills) analysis, revealing non-evident software \u2026",

This paper emphasizes the need to discover similarities in users' accessing behavior with respect to the time locality of their navigational acts. In this context, we present two time-aware clustering approaches for tuning and binding the page and time visiting criteria. The two tracks of the proposed algorithms define clusters with users that show similar visiting behavior at the same time period, by varying the priority given to page or time visiting. The proposed algorithms are evaluated using both synthetic and real data sets and the experimentation has shown that the new clustering schemes result in enriched clusters compared to those created by the conventional non-time-aware user clustering \u2026",

A Content Distribution Network provides its services by using a number of surrogate servers geographically distributed in the web. Surrogate servers have the copies of the original contents belonging to the origin server, depending on their storage capacity. When a client requests for some particular contents from a surrogate server, either this request can be fulfilled directly by it or in case of absence of the requested contents, surrogate servers cooperate with each other or with the origin server.

            "Abstract": "Content distribution networks (CDNs) are increasingly being used to disseminate data in today's Internet. The growing interest in CDNs is motivated by a common problem across disciplines: how does one reduce the load on the origin server and the traffic on the Internet, and ultimately improve response time to users? In this direction, crucial data management issues should be addressed. A very important issue is the optimal placement of the outsourced content to CDN's servers. Taking into account that this problem is NP complete, a heuristic method should be developed. All the approaches developed so far assume the existence of adequate popularity statistics. Such information though, is not always available, or it is extremely volatile, turning such methods problematic. This paper develops a network-adaptive, non-parameterized technique to place the outsourced content to CDN's servers, which requires no a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Urbanization and knowledge economy have highly marked the new millennium. Urbanization brings new challenges which can be addressed by the knowledge economy, which opens up scientific and technical innovation opportunities. The enhancement of cities\u2019 intelligence has heavily impacted city transformation and sustainable decision-making based on urban data knowledge extraction. This work is motivated by the strong demand for robust standardization efforts to steer and measure city performance and dynamics, given the growing tendency of conventional cities\u2019 transformation into smart and resilient ones. This paper revises the earlier so-called \u201ccityDNA\u201d framework, which was designed to detect the interrelations between the six smart city dimensions, such that a city\u2019s profile and capacities are recognized in a systematic manner. The updated framework implements the widely accepted smart city (ISO 37120:2018) standard, along with an adaptive Web service, which processes urban data and visualizes the city\u2019s profile to facilitate decision-making. The proposed framework offers a solid benchmarking service, at which the value of crowdsourced data is exploited for the production of urban knowledge and city transformation empowerment. The proposed benchmarking approach is tested and validated through relevant case studies and a proof-of-concept scenario, in which open data and crowdsourced data are exploited. The outcomes revealed that cities should intensify their KPI-driven data production and exploitation along with a set of solid standards for cities to enable cities with customizable scenarios enriched with indicators \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Social networking media generate huge content streams, which leverage, both academia and developers efforts in providing unbiased, powerful indications of users' opinion and interests. Here, we present Cloud4Trends, a framework for collecting and analyzing user generated content through microblogging and blogging applications, both separately and jointly, focused on certain geographical areas, towards the identification of the most significant topics using trend analysis techniques. The cloud computing paradigm appears to offer a significant benefit in order to make such applications viable considering that the massive data sizes produced daily impose the need of a scalable and powerful infrastructure. Cloud4Trends constitutes an efficient Cloud-based approach in order to solve the online trend tracking problem based on Web 2.0 sources. A detailed system architecture model is also proposed, which is \u2026",
