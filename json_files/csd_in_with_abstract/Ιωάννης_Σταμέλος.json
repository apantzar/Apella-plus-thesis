            "Abstract": "Nowadays one key question for most organizations is which of the agile practices should be implemented to improve product quality. This systematic literature review surveys studies published up to and including 2009 and attempts to present and evaluate the empirical findings regarding quality in agile practices. The studies were classified into three groups: test driven or test first development, pair programming, and miscellaneous agile practices and methods. The findings of most studies suggest that agile practices can improve quality if they are implemented correctly. The significant findings of this study, in conjunction with previous research, could be used as guidelines for practitioners on their own settings and situations.",

            "Abstract": "Software reuse is a popular practice, which is constantly gaining ground among practitioners. The main reason for this is the potential that it provides for reducing development effort and increasing the end-product quality. At the same time, Open-Source Software (OSS) repositories are nowadays flourishing and can facilitate the reuse process, through the provision of a variety of software artifacts. However, up-to-date OSS reuse processes have mostly been opportunistic, leading to not fully capitalizing existing reuse potentials. In this study we propose a process (namely REACT) for improving planned OSS reuse practices, i.e., we define the activities that a software engineer can perform to reuse OSS artifacts. To illustrate the applicability of REACT, we provide an example, in which a mobile application is developed based upon the reuse of OSS artifacts. To validate the proposed process we compared the effort \u2026",

First, a brief overview for simulation methods of closed source software development is given. Then, based on empirical facts reported in F/OSS case studies, we describe a general framework for F/OSS dynamical simulation models and discuss its similarities and differences to closed source software simulation. A specific F/OSS simulation model is introduced. The model is applied to the Apache project and to the gtk+ module of the GNOME project, and simulation outputs are compared to real data. The potential of formal F/OSS simulation models to turn into practical tools used by F/OSS coordinators to predict key project factors is demonstrated. Finally, issues for further research and efforts for improvement of this first-attempt model are \u2026",

It is recognized that in most countries software industry is composed of a scheme made up mainly of SMEs. This paper condenses efficient Software Engineering practices that will help a SME make tangible improvements in finite time. A practical and easily applied mechanism for SPI is suggested tailored in the needs, size and type of each SME. The main concept of this process involves creating a knowledge base that consists of information about three distinct improvement areas: experience, process and product area. This knowledge base is formed as an ontology that will provide further inference knowledge on the interrelationships of the information recorded. Such knowledge is exploited to define problematic areas and test alternative improvement solutions.",

The premise of the paper is that students\u2019 engagement with real open source projects, and more specifically with the respective open source communities, can be an effective instructional method for skill development. We argue that through such a process, the students are able to get familiar with tools and technologies used in FLOSS and receive certification as FLOSS participants. On the other hand, the students can also review and evaluate the FLOSS project they use during the learning activity from different perspectives. In more advanced learning activities, this evaluation can be based on certification standards, providing in that \u2026",

To this end, we have measured quality characteristics of 100 applications written for Linux, using a software measurement tool, and compared the results with the industrial standard that is proposed by the tool. Another target of this case study was to investigate the issue of modularity in open source as this characteristic is being considered crucial by the proponents of open source for this type of software development.

            "Abstract": "Reuse is an established software development practice, whose benefits have attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners. In order for software reuse to advance from an opportunistic activity to a well-defined, systematic state of practice, the reuse phenomenon should be empirically studied in a real-world environment. To this end, OSS projects consist a fitting context for this purpose. In this paper, the authors aim at assessing the:(a) strategy and intensity of reuse activities in OSS development,(b) effect of reuse activities on design quality,(c) modification of reuse decisions from a chronological viewpoint and (d) effect of these modifications on software design quality. In order to achieve these goals, the authors performed a large-scale embedded multi-case study on 1,111 Java projects, extracted from Google Code repository.

The estimation models that were derived were applied and evaluated on the on\u2010going projects of the company. Finally, by performing the same analysis on data from the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) repository, it is demonstrated how one company can utilize data from other companies when it lacks sufficient data of its own.

The emergence of open source software has changed this picture allowing us to evaluate both software products and the processes that yield them. Thus, the software source code and the associated data stored in the version control system, the bug tracking databases, the mailing lists, and the wikis allow us to evaluate quality in a transparent way. Even better, the large number of (often competing) open source projects makes it possible to contrast the quality of comparable systems serving the same domain. Furthermore, by combining historical source code snapshots with significant events, such as bug discoveries and fixes, we can further dig into the causes and effects of problems.

In order for a software system to be modular, it should be organized into modules that are highly coherent internally, whereas at the same time as independent from other modules as possible. In this paper we explore coupling and cohesion metrics at the software package level-i.e., one of most basic levels of software functional decomposition in object-oriented (OO) systems, with the aim of investigating their relation to the technical debt of each package. Current state-of-the-art tools in TD measurement are working on the source code level, and the extent to which they can unveil limitations at the architecture level (e.g., violations of the modularity principle), has not been explored so far. To achieve this goal, we conducted a case study on 1,200 packages retrieved from 20 well-known open source software projects. The results of the study suggested that \u2026",

Nowadays, the way that decision support techniques are applied suffers from a number of severe problems, such as naive interpretation of sophisticated methods and generation of counter-intuitive, and therefore most probably erroneous, results. In this paper we identify some common flaws in decision support for software evaluations. Subsequently, we discuss an integrated solution through which significant improvement may be achieved, based on the Multiple Criteria Decision Aid methodology and the exploitation of packaged software evaluation expertise in the form of an intelligent system. Both common mistakes and the way they are overcome are explained through a real world example.",

The reuse of OSS components however is restricted to ready-made components and developers who want to reuse code that exists in OSS projects but is not offered as a black-box component often resort to copying existing code and adapting it in their projects. OPEN-SME is a European research project which aims at providing ready-to-use OSS components that originate from existing OSS projects but are not necessarily provided as such. In this work we describe the Component Adaptation Environment (COPE) tool that was developed in the context of the OPEN-SME project and enables software experts, called reuse engineers, to extract components from OSS projects, test them and provide test documentation, validate them with Model-Based Testing techniques, package them \u2026",

As projects evolve over time, it is a common and beneficial task to upgrade the external libraries to their latest versions because bugs are solved or new functionality is implemented. Nonetheless, external libraries evolve as well and undergo architectural and structural changes and therefore, impact the projects that use them in the case of library upgrades. In this paper, we propose a metrics\u2010based approach in order to identify evolution patterns of candidate reuse libraries and ultimately, assist in selecting new libraries for reuse or upgrading existing libraries. We propose a metrics suite that measures structural and behavioral attributes of software systems' evolution that affect their possible reuse by other projects.

However, these indices either do not synthesize their constituent metrics into an aggregate or they do not capture all facets of reusability, such as structural characteristics, external qualities, and their documentation. To alleviate these shortcomings, we introduce a reusability index (REI) as a synthesis of various software metrics that cover a number of related reusability aspects. Furthermore, we evaluate its ability to quantify reuse, by comparing it to existing indices through a case study on 15 reusable open-source assets (i.e., libraries and frameworks). The results of the study suggest that the proposed index presents the highest predictive and discriminative power, it is the most consistent in ranking reusable assets, and the most strongly correlated to their levels of reuse.

This paper proposes SPARSE, an OWL ontology based knowledge-based system that aims to assist software project managers in the antipattern detection process. The antipattern ontology documents antipatterns and how they are related with other antipatterns through their causes, symptoms and consequences.

The selection of the optimum refactoring strategy can be a daunting task involving the identification of refactoring candidates, the determination of which refactorings to apply and the assessment of the refactoring impact on software product quality characteristics. As such, the benefits from refactorings are measured from the quality advancements achieved through the application of state of the art structural quality assessments on refactored code. Perceiving refactoring trough the lens of value creation, the optimum strategy should be the one that maximizes the endurance of the architecture in future imposed changes. We argue that an alternative measurement and examination of the refactoring success is possible, one, that focuses on the balance between effort spent and anticipated cost minimization. In \u2026",

Two groups of undergraduate students participated, each performing on one of the two designs. The subjects designed, implemented in Java, and tested a set of three maintenance tasks in order to assess the degree of their understanding, effort, and performance. The results indicate that the RD version due to its delocalised structure, exhibited higher correctness, better extensibility, and design stability, than the MF version.

This innovatively supports the decentralization of the authentication and authorization processes to overcome the single point of failure problems and the use of SSI to assign identities to IoT devices. Additionally, it gives full control to the holders for their identities, whether they are humans, organizations or smart vehicles. With the practice of advanced zero \u2026",

Estimations in the initial project phases are made with a lot of uncertainty that influences estimation accuracy which typically increases as the project progresses in time. Project data collected during the various project phases can be used in a progressive time\u2010dependent fashion to train software cost estimation models. Our motivation is to reduce uncertainty and increase confidence based on the understanding of patterns of effort distributions in development phases of real\u2010world projects. In this work, we study effort distributions and suggest a four\u2010stage progressive software cost estimation model, adjusting the initial effort estimates during the development life\u2010cycle based on newly available data.

In other words, we wish to better understand to what extent a specific design heuristic contributes to the quality of designs developed. The experiment has been conducted using undergraduate students as subjects, performing on two system designs using the Coad & Yourdon method. The results of this study provide evidence that the investigated design heuristic: (a) affects the evolution of design structures; and (b) considerably affects the way participants apply the inheritance mechanism.",

Learning outcomes are typically reported explicitly and expressed as knowledge, skills, attitudes or values. Literature and practice distinguishes between two types of learning outcomes, namely domain-specific and domain-general outcomes. Domainspecific outcomes refer to knowledge rooted to the specifics of an educational subject, while domain-general outcomes refer to learning benefits, such as key skills, that learners may transfer and apply to other contexts. Recognition of learning outcomes is essential both for assessing student performance and for providing feedback. In the context of OE, recognition of learning outcomes presents instructors with certain additional difficulties stemming from the nature of OE. In this section, a case-study of blended learning is presented, focusing on the way student learning outcomes are captured and assessed by the instructors.",

Innovative formal and generative approaches are needed to avoid re-designing and re-implementing software solutions, features, patterns, components, designs, tests, etc. Special care should be taken for the non-functional properties of the new generations of software systems, such as performance or security, in case of intensive reuse.The 2015 edition of the International Conference on Software Reuse (ICSR) took place in Miami (Florida/US), on 4-6 January (http://icsr2015. ipd. kit. edu/).

However, empirical results suggest that patterns may sometimes support and other times hurt a quality attribute. Thus, there is a need for guidance on when a pattern is beneficial and when it is not. To provide such guidance, we propose a theoretical model for understanding the effect of patterns on quality. The obtained results are expected to improve the theoretical body of knowledge on design patterns, and facilitate informed decision making about when to insert or remove a pattern from a system. As an example, we present and discuss the results of modeling and exploring the effect of Decorator instances on quality. The results suggest that Decorator instances that are not expected to evolve through the addition of components in composite objects decrease system cohesion and therefore, modularity \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Though it is widely accepted that uncertainty influences software development it is rarely captured explicitly in software models. Despite the emphasis on artifact uncertainties, process uncertainties should also be modeled. Software process modeling formalisms must be enhanced to include uncertainty values, which an environment for supporting definition and execution of process models should take under consideration. For this purpose the use of iterative Bayesian Belief Networks is suggested for representing software process models. Bayesian approach can provide a Network of software workflows and their interdependencies. Also Bayesian Networks have the mathematical background to deal with situations and problems that evolve over time and software process is one of these situations. We are not exactly sure of the steps we must follow in each situation and we need a flexible model that will deal with iterations, backward movements and incremental development. Bayesian updating of software process values is allowed by the model and is carried out during process execution. Belief values and confidence levels are continuously updated as new evidence arrives. In this paper the structure of several BBNs based on Rational Unified Process are presented with various levels of abstraction. The models are generalized for various types of software process models from sequential to iterative, incremental models. Our target is to provide a framework in which all the necessary actions for software development are depicted. Also the sequence of these actions and their interactions will be represented.

This shift is not only redefining the software industry but also the way we teach and learn in our software engineering (SE) courses. But for many universities F/OSS is seen as an optional low cost technology to support the IT infrastructure and administrational duties. Few see F/OSS as an opportunity for students to learn the SE concepts and skills we teach. Furthermore, it is still an open question as to whether the F/OSS methodology can be effectively used to teach SE courses within the formally structured curriculwn in most universities. This paper discusses F/OSS projects as bazaars of learning that offer a meaningful learning context. The discussion is centered on a pilot study in which students were involved in software testing in F/OSS projects. We present the teaching and learning framework we used in the pilot study and report on our experiences, lessons learned, and some practical problems we encountered. Our grading and evaluation approach show that the students did relatively well as bug hunters and reporters. Results from two online surveys indicate that students are motivated in participating in software testing in the bazaar, and they are willing to participate in project activities long after their graduation. The study reveals one possible way SE educators can teach and integrate F/OSS into their formal curricular structure.",

Although many studies have explored various aspects of design patterns, no research summarizing the state of research related to design patterns existed up to now. This paper presents the results of a mapping study of about 120 primary studies, to provide an overview of the research efforts on Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns. The research questions of this study deal with (a) if design pattern research can be further categorized in research subtopics, (b) which of the above subtopics are the most active ones and (c) what is the reported effect of GoF patterns on software quality attributes. The results suggest that design pattern research can be further categorized to research on GoF patterns formalization, detection and application and on the effect of GoF patterns on software quality \u2026",

A possible solution to this problem is to map game mechanics to design patterns, in order to provide template instantiations that handle structural complexity. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) introduce template instantiations of game mechanics with Gang of Four (GoF) patterns and (b) evaluate such mappings in terms of extendibility and reusability. To achieve these objectives, we developed an online repository of mappings between GoF patterns and game mechanics and conducted an experiment to explore the benefits of the mapping.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques can be used to assist software project managers in finding similar antipattern ontologies. For this purpose, SNA measures are extracted from one layer of the semantic social network to another and this knowledge is used to infer new links between antipattern ontologies.

The contribution of this paper is the analysis of the applicability of probabilistic reasoning approaches, in particular Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), to this problem. BBNs are capable of discovering the dependencies and independencies among the attributes of a project and defining the direct impact of some of them on productivity. Uncertainty is depicted through the use of estimate intervals and probabilities: the estimation is actually an interval within which the productivity of a project is likely to fall in, with a certain probability, considering both an optimistic and a pessimistic situation. The use of predefined intervals is another important feature of the method, allowing the control of the estimation process and the generation of meaningful intervals, appealing and understood by software managers. The ability of the method to classify correctly the rest of the attributes in one of their discrete values is also tested, paying further attention on the software development mode. The method is applied and evaluated on the widely known COCOMO81 dataset. The evaluation shows that BBN is a promising method whose results can be confirmed intuitively. BBN are easily interpreted, allow flexibility in the estimation, can support expert judgment and create models considering all the information that lay in a dataset by including all productivity factors in the final model.",

            "Abstract": "In the last few years, there has been growing enthusiasm, for objectoriented (OO) approaches to information systems. There have been significant advancements in all areas of object-oriented information systems from programming to analysis, design and development. Considering the difficulty students face adopting the Object-Oriented (OO) concepts and techniques, this paper presents a systematic teaching approach aiming at applying efficiently and effectively these concepts. The model, based on OO design heuristics, and the most significant OO features, namely, abstraction, inheritance and composition, provides two teaching directions. First, is the guidance role of a number of appropriate design heuristics; Secondly, is the assessment role of a number of design heuristics in order to provide confirmation of their appropriate application on basic design structures. The proposed model is expected, first to guide the students on how to apply a specific OO feature at a given situation, and then to provide them with the ability to examine whether the chosen design alternative was the most appropriate.",

            "Abstract": "Although typically a software development organisation is involved in more than one project simultaneously, the available tools in the area of software cost estimation deal mostly with single software projects. In order to calculate the possible cost of the entire project portfolio, one must combine the single project estimates taking into account the uncertainty involved. In this paper, statistical simulation techniques are used to calculate confidence intervals for the effort needed for a project portfolio. The overall approach is illustrated through the adaptation of the analogy-based method for software cost estimation to cover multiple projects.",

However software reuse has been proven challenging for most organizations. The challenges involve both organizational and technical issues. In this work we concentrate on the technical issues and we propose a new metric facilitating the reuse of object-oriented software based on the popular Chidamber and Kemerer suite for object-oriented design. We derive this new metric using linear regression on a number of OSS java projects. We compare and contrast this new metric with three other metrics proposed in the literature. The purpose of the proposed metric is to assist a software developer during the development of a software system in achieving reusability of classes considered important for future reuse and also in providing assistance during re-architecting and componentization activities of existing \u2026",

However, this suggestion is an open issue, since there is little concrete evidence to justify whether F/OSS quality is indeed better or worse than that of proprietary software products. The general perspective of this article is to discuss the current status of F/OSS quality and to assess its performance in various aspects of quality, based on existing literature. Specifically, this article will provide some answers to various questions raised by the assertion concerning the quality of F/OSS. In this regard issues addressed in this article include the quality framework, through which F/OSS quality should be investigated and the performance of F/OSS in various quality factors within this quality framework. Answers to these issues are given by providing evidence from various research papers, empirical studies and reports based on experience about the quality of F/OSS products. The overall results seem to indicate that F/OSS has achieved an acceptable level of quality, although there is more to be done in order to outperform proprietary software.",

In this paper, the focus of process mining is on Open Source Software projects and software events. The use of data that are publicly available on the web with the application of process mining algorithms can lead to useful conclusions on characteristics of successful projects and ways to help those who appear to be risky. This can be achieved by analyzing the event logs in order to extract process models but also in order to identify social networks within the community of a project. In addition, with further research and analysis a general process specification could be created to help Open Source Software projects reengineer their processes and improve their activities in order to succeed. In this paper there is an attempt to extract a process model from an Open Source Software project and compare it with the process that the development team should follow. More specific, the effort is focused on the bug handling process and thus, the extraction of the followed process model could help improve the way tasks are shared and bugs are closed.",

According to this principle, software should be organized into modules that are tightly linked internally (high cohesion), whereas at the same time as independent from other modules as possible (low coupling). However, in practice, this principle is violated due to poor architecting design decisions, lack of time, or coding shortcuts, leading to a phenomenon termed as architectural technical debt (ATD). To alleviate this problem (lack of architectural modularity), the most common solution is the application of a software refactoring, namely Move Class\u2014ie, moving classes (the core artifact in object-oriented systems) from one module to another. To identify Move Class refactoring opportunities, we employ a search-based optimization process, relying on optimization metrics, through which optimal moves are derived.

Reuse of OSS software in systems that will have to guarantee certain product properties is still complicated. The main reason is the many different levels of trust that can be placed on the various OSS sources and the lack of information for the impact that a reused OSS component can have on the system properties. A prerequisite for promoting widespread reuse of OSS software is certification at the component level in an affordable cost. This work addresses the main technical issues behind OSS component certification by formal and semiformal techniques, as well as the incentives that raised the need for the OPEN-SME European funded project. OPEN-SME introduces an OSS software reuse service for SMEs, in order to address the problem that OSS evolves by volunteers that follow different development processes. We discuss the requirements relating to OSS software reuse based on the findings of a survey. Then we present the OPEN-SME tool-set and approach for OSS reuse and finally we show how the provision of verifiable certificates can provide assurance that an OSS component conforms to one or more anticipated requirements, necessary for reusing it in a system.",

AR descriptive nature is exploited by identifying logical associations between project attributes and the required effort for the development of the project. CART method on the other hand has the benefit of acquiring general knowledge from specific examples of projects and is able to provide estimates for all possible projects. The particular methods have the ability of learning and modelling associations in data and hence they can be used to describe complex relationships in software cost data sets that are not immediately apparent. Potential benefits of combining these probabilistic methods involve the ability of the final model to reveal the way in which particular attributes can increase or decrease productivity and the fact that such assumptions vary \u2026",

In particular, we present an industrial case study conducted in a software consulting/development company in Netherlands, which aimed at: identifying the most common SharePoint quality rule violations and their severity. The results indicate that the most frequent rule violations are identified in the JavaScript part of the applications, and that the most severe ones are related to correctness, security and deployment. The aforementioned results can be exploited by both researchers and practitioners, in terms of future research directions, and to inform the quality assurance process.",

This is what we call the quality mismatch problem: the mismatch between the quality requirements of a new system with the quality properties exhibited by the components that we want to use for its development. This work contributes to the understanding of the quality mismatch problem between component properties and component-based systems requirements. To solve this problem we introduce the concept of elastic components. An elastic component is an open-ended hierarchy of the same pure component with variants that differ between them to the quality properties that they exhibit. We present a quality-driven design approach that can be effectively applied for the design and implementation of elastic \u2026",

The creation of large portals, which host a vast amount of FLOSS projects make it easy to create large datasets with valuable information regarding the FLOSS development process. In addition initiatives such as FLOSSMole provide researchers with a single point and continuing access to those data. Up to now the majority of datasets from FLOSSMole offered data regarding the development process and not the code itself. From February 2007 FLOSSMole offers data donated by SourceKibitzer, which contain source code metrics for FLOSS projects written in Java. In this paper we provide a premilinary analysis on those data using machine learning techniques, such as classification rules and decision trees. Using the first available data from February 2007, we tried to build rules that can be used in order to estimate the future values of metrics offered for March. Here we present some preliminary results that are encouraging and deserve to be further analyzed in future releases of SourceKibitzer datasets.\u2217 This work is funded by the Greek Ministry of Education (25%) and European Union (75%) under the EPEAK II program Archimedes and partly by the European Community\u2019s Sixth Framework Programme under the contracts of projects FLOSSMETRICS (FP6-IST-5-033547) and SQOOSS (FP6-IST-5-033331)",

Proprietary software is distributed on the basis of licenses that keep the property of the software to the software company that produced it. The user has to accept the software as it is sold by the producer and its vendors and to pay license fees for using it. The buyer and user of a proprietary software product is thus not allowed and not capable to read and change the source code of the program. 1 If the user wants to customize functionalities of a proprietary software system to his needs he relies on the producer's willingness to take his demand into account when the next release of the software program is created. The world market for desktop operating systems, for instance, is dominated by proprietary software, as 84% of all desktop operating systems are Microsoft Windows XP. 2The other software domain is Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) 3. In contrast to proprietary software, FLOSS is distributed on the basis of licenses that entitle the users to read and modify the source code and that do not require the user to pay license fees for using FLOSS systems. Well-known examples of FLOSS are the Linux operating system or the Apache web server. 4",

Antipatterns provide information on commonly occurring solutions to problems that generate negative consequences. These mechanisms are documented using informal structures that do not readily support knowledge sharing and reuse. For this, we need better-structured representations. The formalism of Bayesian Networks (BN\u2019s) has been proposed to capture and model software project management antipattern uncertainty manually or automatically, through an antipattern knowledge base. The antipattern ontology proposed in this paper, specifies the conceptual structure of the antipattern knowledge base, encodes tacit software project management knowledge into computer understandable form and will allow the sharing and reuse of this knowledge by software tools. Furthermore, the issue of capturing and quantifying uncertainty in the antipattern ontology is addressed by including the concepts of antipattern BN models and their corresponding OWL ontology in the design of the generic antipattern ontology.",

In the domain of computer games, requirements engineering is a heavily studied research field (39.3% of published papers are dealing with requirements [1]), since it is considered substantially different from traditional software requirements engineering (see [1] and [14]). The main point of differentiation is that almost all computer games share a common key-driver as requirement, ie user satisfaction. In this paper, we investigate the most important user satisfaction factors from computer games, though a survey on regular gamers. The results of the study suggest that, user satisfaction factors are not uniform across different types of games (game genres), but are heavily dependent on them. Therefore, this study underlines the most important non-functional requirements that developers and researchers should focus on, while dealing with game engineering.",

For the development of recyclable components we show how inherent characteristics of agile methods, particularly the provision of useful and complete partial components during the lifecycle, can be used constructively for the development of components. These components are placed in a component repository for later recycling. The requirements implemented at each iteration serve as the design rationale for the components and distinguish earlier components from their later versions providing tracing.",

This pairing may be proved beneficial not only for the integrated representation of software development processes, human resources and work products, but also in analysing properties and detecting errors of a software process specification, before the process is put to actual use. The use of OO models provides the advantages of graphical abstraction, highlevel of understanding and manageable representation of software process classes and instances. Resulted OO models are mechanically transformed into a high-level timed Petri net representation to derive a model for formally proving process properties as well as applying managerial analysis. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by addressing a simple software process modelling example problem used in the literature to exercise various software process modelling notations.",

One way of achieving this is to estimate an interval accompanied by a probability instead of a particular value. In this paper we compare traditional methods that focus on point estimates, methods that focus both on point and interval estimates and methods that produce only predefined interval estimates. In the case of predefined intervals, software cost estimation becomes a classification problem. All the above methods are applied on two different data sets, namely the COCOMO81 dataset and the Maxwell dataset. Also the ability of classification techniques to resolve one classification problem in cost estimation, namely to determine the software development mode based on project attributes, is assessed and compared to reported results.",

The latter studies presented qualitative and quantitative data for the OSS development process, managerial issues and programmer attitudes. The authors in many cases offer descriptive explanations based on plausible assumptions but, as there is no general model to quantify their claims together with their possibly complicated interactions, the validity of such explanations cannot be directly demonstrated. Therefore, there is a need to move from descriptive models based on special cases to a more general quantitative mathematical model that would hopefully reproduce real case results. In the present paper we present a general framework for dynamical simulation models of the development process of OSS projects. Then we present a specific simulation model, which is demonstrated against results from available literature case study of the Apache OSS project. OSS dynamic simulation models could serve as generic predicting tools of key OSS project factors such as project failure/success as well as time dependent factors such as the evolution of source code, defect density, number of programmers and distribution of work effort to distinct project modules and tasks.",

Frameworks are semicomplete applications, usually implemented as a hierarchy of classes. The framework is developed first, then several applications are derived from it. Frameworks are a reuse technique that supports the engineering of product lines. In the study, we compare quality (in the sense of rework effort) and productivity in traditional and framework-based software production. We observe that the latter is characterized by better productivity and quality, as well as a massive increase in productivity over time, that we attribute to the effect of learning the framework. Although we cannot extrapolate the results outside the local environment, enough evidence has been accumulated to stimulate future research work.",

The paper proposes the automated selection of past problem cases and the automated synthesis of a new evaluation model, based on the cumulative experience stored in a knowledge base. In order to select the most promising past evaluation cases we propose the use of two metrics: their proximity to the new case and the degree of success. To add flexibility, we allow the user to express his preference on these two factors. After having selected a group of the most promising past evaluation cases, a method for deriving a new evaluation model, i.e. the weights and the scales of the attributes, is presented. The method covers both numerical and nominal attributes. The derived model can be used as a starting point for an interactive evaluation session.

This technique starts with the quantification of the qualitative attributes (expressed either on nominal or ordinal scale), that appear frequently within such data, and proceeds by using the obtained scores as independent variables of a regression model.

The Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) approach has been recently proposed for modelling software project management antipatterns. BBNs provide a solution for software project managers, who would like to model the cause-effect relationship that underlies antipatterns by considering their inherent uncertainty. Although a BBN model can be used to aid decisions by observing the effect of uncertainty on a specific attribute of interest (such as software quality), in many circumstances decisions based on multiple criteria need to be made. Multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) can be applied to improve the effectiveness of management decisions. A BBN model ignores the multiple, and often conflicting, criteria that surround a managerial decision (such as development time and total collaboration costs). In this paper such an approach is exemplified through a specific BBN model of an antipattern complemented by MCDA. The final resulted model is helpful in evaluating the impact of developer personalities and temperaments on communication, collaboration viability and effectiveness in pair programming.",

On the other hand, it is widely accepted that public domain software cost estimation techniques need to be calibrated, ie properly adjusted, to historical project data, in order to produce accurate estimates for new projects. Another important requirement for any modern cost estimation method is the ability to produce interval estimates, not mere point estimates. Statistical simulation techniques may be used for both purposes.

The test target is faults that may appear in predicates found in the specification or implementation of a computer program. A hierarchy of fault classes has been recently established, identifying associative shift faults (ASFs) as one of the strongest fault classes in predicate testing. The upto date proposed approaches resolve adequately the issue of test generation for weaker fault classes but do not guarantee the detection of all ASFs. In this paper we define a suitable fault model to represent this type of faults and propose a heuristic test strategy, while trying to keep low the number of required tests by fault simulation. Empirical results of the algorithm application on the TCAS-II expression suite are encouraging and suggest that it is easy to detect a significant subset of ASFs by considering only few additional tests.",

RvC initially automatically discretizes the number of defects into a number of fault classes, then learns a model that predicts the fault class of a software system. Finally, RvC transforms the class output of the model back into a numeric prediction. This approach includes uncertainty in the models because apart from a certain number of faults, it also outputs an associated interval of values, within which this estimate lies, with a certain confidence. To evaluate this approach we perform a comparative experimental study of the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms in a software dataset. The data was collected by Pekka Forselious and involves applications maintained by a bank of Finland.",

In order to achieve this goal we conducted an empirical study on java open source games. More specifically, we examined several successful open source games, identified the number of defects, the debugging rate and performed design pattern related measurements. The results of the study suggest that the overall number of design pattern instances is not correlated to defect frequency and debugging effectiveness. However, specific design patterns appear to have a significant impact on the number of reported bugs and debugging rate.",

            "Abstract": "Currently, open source software communities are thriving and the number of projects that are available through well known code repositories is rapidly increasing over the years. The amount of code that is freely available to developers facilitates high reuse opportunities. One of the major concerns of developers when reusing code is the quality of the code that is going to be reused. Design patterns are well known solutions that are reported to produce substantial benefits with respect to software quality. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which design patterns are employed in open source software. More specifically, this study reports empirical results based on the number and type of design patterns retrieved from open source software projects. Up to now, one hundred and eight (108) open source software projects of various characteristics have been considered. The results of the study suggest that several patterns are more frequently used in open source software than others, that some patterns are more applicable in some categories than others and that program size, number of downloads, days of project activity and the number of developers are crucial factors that influence the use of design patterns in open source software project.",

A great number of companies deal with education related business areas, either delivering educational services or selling educational tools, be it hardware or software. Within this area, Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) have a prominent position for two major reasons:(a) their ability to incorporate novel technologies and (b) their ability to provide intuitive computer interfaces for youngsters. In particular infants and children of nursery school age are more used to tangible objects than to software elements. A consequence of the above is that innovation in the TUI arena produces interesting prototypes that very often evolve into commercial products.

In addition, measurable component quality attributes can be characterized differently for different application domains (e.g., a total execution time value can be considered very satisfactory for one application domain and extremely unsatisfactory for another). In this paper we demonstrate the usage of an intuitionistic fuzzy approach in selecting components originating from an elastic component repository. Elastic components are the output of a quality-driven process for component development that results in component variants based on quality discrimination. During reuse, utilization of intuitionistic fuzzy sets can be proven an efficient solution to derive \u2026",

It is argued that lines of code and object oriented function points are more suitable in this case. Data analysis reveals that learning influences mainly the cost of writing new code, consisting of continuous calls to components provided by the framework.

            "Abstract": "A common problem in software cost estimation is the manipulation of incomplete or missing data in databases used for the development of prediction models. In such cases, the most popular and simple method of handling missing data is to ignore either the projects or the attributes with missing observations. This technique causes the loss of valuable information and therefore may lead to inaccurate cost estimation models. On the other hand, there are various imputation methods used to estimate the missing values in a data set. These methods are applied mainly on numerical data and produce continuous estimates. However, it is well known that the majority of the cost data sets contain software projects with mostly categorical attributes with many missing values. It is therefore reasonable to use some estimating method producing categorical rather than continuous values. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of using such a method for estimating categorical missing values in software cost databases. Specifically, the method known as Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) is suggested for imputation and is applied on projects of the ISBSG multiorganizational software database. Comparisons of MLR with other missing data techniques, such as listwise deletion (LD), mean imputation (MI), expectation maximization (EM) and regression imputation (RI) show that the proposed method is efficient, especially when the percentage of missing values is high.",

To justify our approach, we identify two options in an incremental/iterative project plan. The first option is to stall the development at a predefined increment/iteration, while the second is to continue increments and deliver the full system functionality. By calculating the expected value of each option, we provide the project manager with the flexibility to compare candidate schedules and decide, under favourable or unfavourable conditions, the most profitable combination of delivered functionalities.",

Profiles are defined starting fromranges of values on measures of attributes. The method is based on two main phases, namely definition of the evaluation model and application of the evaluation model, and is presented in a simplified case study that deals with evaluating the level of quality of an asset to decide if accepting it in a reuse repository. The advantages of the method are that it allows using ordinal scales, while it deals explicitly with preferences expressed, implicitly or explicitly, by the evaluator.",

But the more businesses are obliged to implement an information system to cope with competition, the less viable is the cost of acquisition and maintenance of the ERP cause of the unfavorable economic conditions. One solution is provided by the Open Source Software (OSS) for the transparency of software and the less expensive implementation. We have conducted an exploratory study about implementing an OSS ERP in a developing anonymous Greek industry. It included recording of the processes of the industry as well as interviews and meetings with company managers in order to elicit the system requirements. Overall, we found that the combination of the industry's ISO related information, the manager's interviews and the cost \u2026",

Open card sorting is a widely-used method to create information architectures based on users' groupings of the content. However, little is known about the method's cross-study reliability: Does it produce consistent content groupings for similar profile participants involved in different card sort studies? This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the method's cross-study reliability. Six card sorts involving 140 participants were conducted: three open sorts for a travel website, and three for an eshop. Results showed that participants provided highly similar card sorting data for the same content. A rather high agreement of the produced navigation schemes was also found. These findings provide support for the cross-study reliability of the open card sorting method.",

Two groups of students studied learning material using a web environment designed for supporting case-based learning. The first group followed a non-scaffolded individual mode of study while students in the second group were guided by a collaboration script to work (in dyads) on the case material. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences in the learning outcomes of the two groups. Qualitative analysis (based on students' interviews and field observations) revealed that students' self-organization resulted to a broad range of actual script implementation ranging from full conformance to partial violation of the script guidelines. The paper discusses the socio-cognitive role of students' self-organization during scripted collaboration and presents suggestions for the teacher and CSCL designer in order to enhance the engagement of collaborating students to productive learning interactions.",

The aim of this paper is to develop an objective model (ie, a set of quality attributes and metrics) for evaluating game scenarios with respect to users' satisfaction. The proposed model can be applied to flow charts and character models (ie, common game scenario representation mechanisms).

Program comprehension activities, like software architecture recovery, become very demanding, especially for large and complex systems due to the existence of noise, which is created by omnipresent and utility classes that obscure the system structure. Omnipresent classes represent crosscutting concerns, utilities or elementary domain concepts. The identification and filtering of noise is a necessary preprocessing step before attempting program comprehension techniques, especially for undocumented systems. In this paper, we propose an automated methodology for noise identification. Our methodology is based on the notion that noisy classes are widely used in a system, directly or indirectly.

In this paper, we focus on the reuse opportunities that can be offered in one specific application domain, i.e., game development. In particular, we performed an embedded multiple case study on approximately 110 open-source games, exploiting a large-scale repository of OSS components, and investigated: (a) which game genres can benefit from open source reuse, and (b) what types of requirements can the available open-source components map to. The results of the case study suggest that: (a) game genres with complex game logic, e.g., First Person Shooter, Strategy, Role-Playing, and Sport games offer the \u2026",

In this paper we attempt to unveil and discuss relationships between maintenance productivity, the structural quality of the source code and process metrics like the type of a release and the number of downloads. To achieve this goal, we developed a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) involving several maintainability predictors and three managerial indices for maintenance (i.e., duration, production, and productivity) on 20 open source software projects. The results suggest that maintenance duration depends on inheritance, coupling, and process metrics. On the other hand maintenance production and productivity depend mostly on code quality \u2026",

Refactorings can be applied at different levels of granularity to resolve \u2018bad smells\u2019 that can be identified in various artifacts (eg, methods, classes, packages). A fundamental software engineering principle that can be applied at various levels of granularity is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), whose violation leads to the creation of lengthy, complex and non-cohesive artifacts; incurring smells like Long Method, God Class, and Large Package. Such artifacts, apart from being large in size tend to implement more than one functionalities, leading to decreased cohesion, and increased coupling. In this paper, we study the effect of applying refactorings that lead to conformance to the SRP, at all three levels of granularity to identify possible differences between them. To study these differences, we performed an industrial case study on two large-scale software systems (more than 1,500 classes). Since SRP is by definition related to modularity, as a success measure for the refactoring we use coupling and cohesion metrics. The results of the study can prove beneficial for both researchers and practitioners, since various implications can be drawn.",

Usually the similarity measures are selected empirically, using jackknife-like procedures. Typically, the measures that identify the most similar projects in most of the cases are considered the most appropriate ones and are applied in every new estimation procedure. However there are situations that the default similarity measures may not be the most appropriate ones. In this study we determine the situations in which the default parameters are not the best and we propose the similarity measures for these cases. In particular we provide rules that point out which projects are not accurately estimated with the default parameters.",

Power efficiency considerations have led to the development of a wide range of specialized deep learning accelerators such as Google\u2019s TPU [27], Amazon\u2019s Inferentia chip, and Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910 by the hyperscalers themselves, replacing GPUs. These specialized compute architectures reduce dissipated power for a given number of DNN queries per second. Revenue stream optimization has led to an increasing trend towards accelerator multi-tenancy, which DC operators can leverage to extract multiple revenue streams per accelerator chip, and dis-aggregation of acceleration in the datacenter, which enables flexible coupling of accelerators to CPUs, memory and storage for specific user requirements, reducing waste from idle CPU/accelerator cycles or unused memory. Recently FPGAs have also gained a foothold in the datacenter DNN inference acceleration market and appear well aligned with the above-mentioned trends. Unlike other DC compute accelerators, FPGAs enable complete customization of accelerator architecture, allowing computational logic to fit application precision, and memory hierarchies to fit application memory access patterns, thus minimizing the quantity of accesses to external memory and in theory achieving low-latency, power-efficient acceleration. Furthermore, FPGAs can connect directly to the DC network through dedicated \u2026",

Acknowledging the importance of entrepreneurship to value creation and its contribution to the wider society, focus has therefore shifted on antecedents of entrepreneurial intent (eg Krueger et al., 2000), as well as on incentives encouraging young individuals to become familiar with and undertake entrepreneurial activity (eg Maesa et al., 2014; Souitaris et al., 2007).",

However, in practice it is more realistic and useful to have a method providing interval predictions. Although some methods accompany a point estimate with a prediction interval, it is also reasonable to use a method predicting the interval in which the cost will fall. In this paper, we consider a method called Multinomial Logistic Regression using as dependent variable the predefined cost intervals and as predictor variables the attributes, similar to the ones characterizing completed projects of the available data set. The method builds a model, which classifies any new software project, according to estimated probabilities, in one of the predefined intervals. The proposed method was applied to a well-known data set and was validated with respect to its fitting and predictive accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays open-source software communities are thriving. Successful open-source projects are competitive and the amount of source code that is freely available offers great reuse opportunities to software developers. Thus, it is expected that several requirements can be implemented based on open source software reuse. Additionally, design patterns, i.e. well-known solution to common design problems, are introduced as elements of reuse. This study attempts to empirically investigate the reusability of design patterns, classes and software packages. Thus, the results can help developers to identify the most beneficial starting points for white box reuse, which is quite popular among open source communities. In order to achieve this goal we conducted a case study on one hundred (100) open source projects. More specifically, we identified 27,461 classes that participate in design patterns and compared the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Exploiting the enormous amount of open source software (OSS) as a vehicle for reuse is a promising opportunity for software engineers. However, this task is far from trivial, since such projects are sometimes not easy to understand and adapt to target systems, whereas at the same time the reusable assets are not obvious to identify. In this study, we assess open source software projects, with respect to their reusability, i.e., the easiness to adapt them in a new system. By taking into account that domain-specific reuse is more beneficial than domain-agnostic; we focus this study on identifying the application domains that contain the most reusable software projects. To achieve this goal, we compared the reusability of approximately 600 OSS projects from ten application domains through a case study. The results of the study suggested that in every aspect of reusability, there are different dominant application domains \u2026",

In this work we perform an empirical validation of the ability of cohesion, coupling and size metrics to predict the existence and the intensity of long method occurrences.

End-user quality attributes are versatile and difficult to predict but their occurrence is not of an accidental nature.

Software is produced by a community of volunteer developers over the Internet, its source code is available to everyone and can be freely used, modified and distributed at no cost. Maintainability is considered the most important quality factor for such type of software. Recently, F/OSS ERP/CRM products have appeared, and an increasing number of installations is observed worldwide. Proponents of F/OSS claim that their software quality is better than proprietary software quality. Various empirical studies have been conducted to examine these claims, but no study has considered F/OSS products in the ERP/CRM field up to now. This paper presents an analysis of the source code of Compiere, the most successful F/OSS ERP/CRM system written in Java, producing an appraisal of its quality, using a predefined quality model. The internal quality attributes examined are stability, analyzability, testability and changeability. By observing the values of these attributes, assumptions about the degree of the maintainability of the system may be obtained. Moreover an analysis based on multi-organizational productivity data, indicates what would be the cost for producing Compiere in close source mode. The findings of the study, provide evidence provide evidence that Compiere has an aboveaverage level of internal quality, leading to a good level of maintainability as well. However, further empirical research is needed to assess the external quality of Compiere (eg functionality and usability)",

Furthermore, such emerging applications require fast time-to-market and reduced development times. So to address the large processing requirements of these applications, novel architectures are required in the domain of high-performance and energy-efficient processors. Relying on Moore\u2019s law, CPU technologies have scaled in recent years through packing an increasing number of transistors on chip, leading to higher performance. However, on-chip clock frequencies were unable to follow this upward trend due to strict power-budget constraints. Thus, a few years ago a paradigm shift to multicore processors was adopted as an alternative solution for overcoming the problem. With multicore processors, we could increase server performance without increasing their clock frequency. Unfortunately, this solution was also found not to scale well in the longer term. The performance gains achieved by adding more cores inside a CPU come at the cost of various, rapidly scaling complexities: inter-core communication, memory coherency and, most importantly, power consumption [1]. In the early technology nodes, going from one node to the next allowed for a nearly doubling of the transistor frequency, and, by reducing the voltage, power density remained nearly constant. With the end of Dennard\u2019s scaling, going from one node to the next still increases the density of transistors, but their maximum frequency is roughly the same and the voltage does not \u2026",

Education could not stay intact; Internet has introduced the great ability of distance learning, which allows the traditional educational process to overcome several limitations. Among the requirements that accrue naturally, is the assessment of the results for the new type of educational process. This requirement is denoted as distance certification. While numerous organizations have emerged to support the certification process, the presence of systems that will automate this process and will render it clear and objective, is limited. In this paper, we first describe the requirements that have to be addressed for the development of such a system. For a better understanding of the requirements we modelled the certification process and simulate it. The certification model was built according to the most recent standards and processes that major certification providers follow. Next, we propose ASPIS, which is a system that have been developed to meet these requirements. ASPIS takes into account various learning parameters and makes use of the feedback of the process. The proposed system is web based and it is built with a three tier architecture, it is highly modularized and it can be easily extended and modified. The whole application utilizes free/open source software, it is written in php, it functions upon the Apache web server and its database system is MySQL. Furthermore its web interface is compliant with the most recent web standards, separating content from presentation, making it accessible by all operating systems that utilize a web standard browser and with low effort by other \u2026",

            "Abstract": "To capitalize upon the benefits of software reuse, an efficient selection among candidate reusable assets should be performed in terms of functional fitness and adaptability. The reusability of assets is usually measured through reusability indices. However, these do not capture all facets of reusability, such as structural characteristics, external quality attributes, and documentation. In this paper, we propose a reusability index (REI) as a synthesis of various software metrics and evaluate its ability to quantify reuse, based on IEEE Standard on Software Metrics Validity. The proposed index is compared to existing ones through a case study on 80 reusable open-source assets. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed index we performed a pilot study, where real-world reuse decisions have been compared to decisions imposed by the use of metrics (including REI). The results of the study suggest that the proposed index presents the highest predictive and discriminative power; it is the most consistent in ranking reusable assets, and the most strongly correlated to their levels of reuse. The findings of the paper are discussed to understand the most important aspects in reusability assessment (interpretation of results) and interesting implications for research and practice are provided. 1",

            "Abstract": "In an iterative/incremental software project, software is built in a sequence of iterations with each of them providing certain parts of the required functionality. To better manage an incremental delivery plan, iterations are usually performed during pre-specified time boxes. In a previous work, we addressed the problem of optimizing the schedule of incremental software projects which follow an iterative, timeboxing process model (TB projects). We approached scheduling as a multi criteria decision problem that can be formulated by a linear programming model aimed to overcome some \u201crigid\u201d simplifications of conventional timeboxing, where durations of time boxes and stages are equal and a priori fixed. In this paper, we move this decision making process one step forward by applying real options theory to analyze the investment risks associated with each alternative scheduling decision. We identify two options in a TB project. The first is to stall (abandon) the development at a pre-defined iteration, while the second is to continue (expand) development and deliver the full functionality. Thus, we provide the manager the flexibility to decide the most profitable (valued) combination of delivered functionalities, at a certain iteration, under favourable or unfavourable conditions.",

            "Abstract": "In spite of numerous traditional and agile software project management models proposed, process and project modeling still remains an open issue. This paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN) approach for modeling software project management antipatterns. This approach provides a framework for project managers, who would like to model the cause-effect relationships that underlie an antipattern, taking into account the inherent uncertainty of a software project. The approach is exemplified through a specific BN model of an antipattern. The antipattern is modeled using the empirical results of a controlled experiment on extreme programming (XP) that investigated the impact of developer personalities and temperaments on communication, collaboration-pair viability and effectiveness in pair programming. The resulting BN model provides the precise mathematical model of a project management antipattern \u2026",

The questionnaires of the study were e-mailed to the 1,049 largest organizations based on turnover and assets. The final research sample consists of 105 Greek enterprises. The list of organizations was compiled by using the Index of Companies and Products Directory (ICAP). Results show that users have more positive attitude towards system quality and information quality and less positive attitude towards service quality. Moreover, users believe that ERP systems enhance their performance and can contribute to the control of management. Furthermore, present paper proved that D&M model constitutes a causal model with the exception of the variable of system use that is only related to user satisfaction, and ERP system quality. The findings of this research trigger many theoretical and managerial implications and create lots of potential for future research in the fields of Information Systems, Management, and Marketing.",

This paper summarizes the approach we used to evaluate the participation of students in a F/OSS teaching and learning framework. The framework was implemented as a pilot study in which students volunteered to participate in software testing in F/OSS projects. The evaluation approach we discuss here is based on (a) students' participation in software testing and (b) results from two online surveys. In the evaluation process we utilized a statistical approach (both descriptive and inferential) we considered appropriate for assessing the students. We hope that our evaluation approach will help us further understand and strengthen empirical and experimental software engineering research in this emerging technology.",

This has been extensively addressed both in terms of research and established standards. In particular, the need for SPI in the context of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) led a lot of researchers to focus on this area. SMEs struggle daily to survive in a very competitive environment and their distinguishing characteristics such as the small number of employees, the flat and small organizational structure and the flexibility that governs them make it hard for them to adopt and implement SPI. On the same spirit, their distinguishing characteristics are also those that make SMEs an ideal environment for the adoption of agile methodologies. The agility that governs SMEs allows flexibility in every process they apply and, thus, promotes lightweight SPI approaches in order to remain on the \u2026",

Second, commercial relational database management systems (RDBMS) still dominate the database market because, on one hand, vendors and users are skeptical of the boon of applications developed and distributed under the F/OSSD paradigm, and on the other hand, it has been argued that OSDBMS are not likely to follow the successful trend of other robust Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) systems (Linux, Apache, etc.).

            "Abstract": "Open Source Software development signifies collaborative software development where the mobilisation of volunteered expertise is a measure of project success. As the initial hype surrounding open source software settles down, it is becoming ever harder for projects to identify and engage the interests of project participants. Much research has concentrated on the \u2018recruitment\u2019of professional software developers or coders and little attention has been paid to behind the scene individuals who spend valuable time in lists helping project participants on some mundane yet vital project activities. This paper utilises social networks as a knowledge discovery approach to identify key knowledge brokers in F/OSS projects\u2019 mailing lists, analyse how lists participants interact, and the consequences of such collaboration for the success of F/OSS projects. Three Debian mailing lists are used as a case study. We discuss how to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The main aim of this pilot study is to investigate management anti-patterns encountered in IT innovation projects, in the long run. A quantitative research methodology was chosen. A group of software project managers in industrial innovation projects were requested to fill in a questionnaire. The collected data revealed anti-patterns, which were compared and contrasted to the anti-patterns mostly found in traditional software projects. Some anti-patterns encountered in conventional software projects were also identified in innovation projects. Additionally, a new possible anti-pattern was identified and further investigated. The new anti-pattern regards the management of team creativity and is considered as an anti-pattern, because it can be an obstacle in teamwork progress, having negative consequences. A remedy solution is recommended as a re-factoring and recovering management strategy. Overall, this pilot \u2026",
