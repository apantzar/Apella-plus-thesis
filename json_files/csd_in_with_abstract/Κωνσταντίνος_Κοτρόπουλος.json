Due to the vast volume of data, efficient algorithms for recommendation and annotation are needed. Here, a novel two-step approach is proposed, which annotates an image received as input and recommends several tourist destinations strongly related to the image. It is based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis and hypergraph ranking enhanced with the visual attributes of the images. The proposed method is tested on a dataset of 30000 images bearing text information (e.g., title, tags) collected from Flickr. The experimental results are very promising, as they achieve a top rank precision of 80% for tourism recommendation.",

            "Abstract": "A novel homogeneity-based method for music structure analysis is proposed. The heart of the method is a similarity measure, derived from first principles, that is based on the matrix Elastic Net (EN) regularization and deals efficiently with highly correlated audio feature vectors. In particular, beat-synchronous mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, chroma features, and auditory temporal modulations model the audio signal. The EN induced similarity measure is employed to construct an affinity matrix, yielding a novel subspace clustering method referred to as Elastic Net subspace clustering (ENSC). The performance of the ENSC in structure analysis is assessed by conducting extensive experiments on the Beatles dataset. The experimental findings demonstrate the descriptive power of the EN-based affinity matrix over the affinity matrices employed in subspace clustering methods, attaining the state-of-the-art \u2026",

Moreover, the proposed approach is extended by an empirical technique, which is based on a hue preserving non-linear transformation, in order to eliminate the gamut problem.

Next, the feature subset that yields the highest probability of correct classification is found using the sequential floating forward selection algorithm. The probability of correct classification is estimated via cross-validation and the probability density functions are modelled as mixtures of 2 or 3 Gaussian densities.

            "Abstract": "A challenging open question in music classification is which music representation (i.e., audio features) and which machine learning algorithm is appropriate for a specific music classification task. To address this challenge, given a number of audio feature vectors for each training music recording that capture the different aspects of music (i.e., timbre, harmony, etc.), the goal is to find a set of linear mappings from several feature spaces to the semantic space spanned by the class indicator vectors. These mappings should reveal the common latent variables, which characterize a given set of classes and simultaneously define a multi-class linear classifier that classifies the extracted latent common features. Such a set of mappings is obtained, building on the notion of the maximum margin matrix factorization, by minimizing a weighted sum of nuclear norms. Since the nuclear norm imposes rank constraints to the learnt mappings, the proposed method is referred to as low-rank semantic mappings (LRSMs). The performance of the LRSMs in music genre, mood, and multi-label classification is assessed by conducting extensive experiments on seven manually annotated benchmark datasets. The reported experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the LRSMs over the classifiers that are compared to. Furthermore, the best reported classification results are comparable with or slightly superior to those obtained by the state-of-the-art task-specific music classification methods.",

            "Abstract": "Adaptive order statistic filters for noise smoothing in digital images are presented. Two classes of adaptive filters are studied, namely, the least mean squares (LMS)-based adaptive order statistic filters and the signal-adaptive filters. The filter structures in the first class require a noise-free image to be used as a reference image, whereas those in the second class do not require a reference image. Two filter structures from the former class are examined: the adaptive locationinvariant L-filter and the adaptive Ll-filter.

It is well known that each feature vector stemming from a union of independent linear subspaces admits a sparse representation with respect to a dictionary formed by all other feature vectors with nonzero coefficients associated only to feature vectors that stem from its own subspace. Such sparse representation reveals the relationships among the feature vectors and it is used to construct a similarity graph, the so-called \u21131-graph. Accordingly, the segmentation of audio features is obtained by applying spectral clustering to the \u21131-graph. The performance of the just described approach is assessed by conducting experiments on the Pop-Music and the UPF Beatles benchmark datasets. Promising results are reported.",

The second experiment conducted is related to the binary classification of three artificially generated data sets stemming from known distributions and an additional synthetic data set known as \u201cWaveform\u201d.

The proposed algorithm has been applied to frontal views extracted from the European ACTS M2VTS database that contains the videosequences of 37 different persons. It has been found that the algorithm provides a correct facial candidate in all cases. However, the success rate of the detected facial features (e.g. eyebrows/eyes, nostrils/nose, and mouth) that validate the choice of a facial candidate is found to be 86.5% under the most strict evaluation conditions.",

That is, functions which define if an actor speaks at a certain time instant. In particular, the cross-correlation and the magnitude of the corresponding the cross-power spectral density of a pair of indicator functions are input to various classifiers, such as voted perceptrons, radial basis function networks, random trees, and support vector machines for dialogue/non-dialogue detection. To boost classifier efficiency AdaBoost is also exploited. The aforementioned classifiers are trained using ground truth indicator functions determined by human annotators for 41 dialogue and another 20 non-dialogue audio instances. For testing, actual indicator functions are derived by applying audio activity detection and actor clustering to audio recordings. 23 instances are randomly chosen \u2026",

The traditional methods for solving MDS are susceptible to outliers. Here, a unified framework is proposed, where the MDS is treated as maximization of a correntropy criterion, which is solved by half-quadratic optimization in either multiplicative or additive forms. By doing so, MDS can cope with an initial dissimilarity matrix contaminated with outliers because the correntropy criterion is closely related to M-estimators. Three novel algorithms are derived. Their performances are assessed experimentally against three state-of-the-art MDS techniques, namely the scaling by majorizing a complicated function, the robust Euclidean embedding, and the \u2026",

Such rates can be used to describe connections between users or between users and locations, etc. Thus, digital media content analysis is of particular interest in social networks. Digital media representations are usually high-dimensional. For example, a facial image of size 200\u00d7 150 pixels can be represented by a 30000-dimensional vector obtained by using each pixel coordinate as a different dimension.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, music genre classification is addressed in a multilinear perspective. Inspired by a model of auditory cortical processing, multiscale spectro-temporal modulation features are extracted. Such spectro-temporal modulation features have been successfully used in various content- based audio classification tasks recently, but not yet in music genre classification. Each recording is represented by a third-order feature tensor generated by the auditory model. Thus, the ensemble of recordings is represented by a fourth-order data tensor created by stacking the third-order feature tensors associated to the recordings. To handle large data tensors and derive compact feature vectors suitable for classification, three multilinear subspace techniques are examined, namely the Non-Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF), the High-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), and the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). Classification is performed by a Support Vector Machine. Stratified cross-validation tests on the GTZAN dataset and the ISMIR 2004 Genre one demonstrate the advantages of NTF and HOSVD versus MPCA. The best accuracies obtained by the proposed multilinear approach is comparable with those achieved by state-of-the-art music genre classification algorithms.",

An analysis explains why the selected subspace is suitable for detecting scene changes, even more so than the large-eigenvalue subspace used in [1]. Video information is used to align audio scene change indications with neighboring shot changes in the visual data by considering certain timing restrictions, and accordingly to reduce the false alarm rate. Moreover, video fade effects are identified and used independently in order to track scene changes. The detection technique was tested on newscast videos provided by the TRECVID 2003 video test set [2]. The experimental results show that the aforementioned methods that are used to process the audio and video information complement each other well when tackling with the scene change detection problem.",

The major contribution of the paper is to rate the discriminating capability of a set of features for emotional speech recognition. A total of 87 features has been calculated over 500 utterances from the Danish Emotional Speech database. The sequential forward selection method (SFS) has been used in order to discover a set of 5 to 10 features which are able to classify the utterances in the best way. The criterion used in SFS is the cross-validated correct classification score of one of the following classifiers: nearest mean and Bayes classifier where class pdf are approximated via Parzen windows or modelled as Gaussians. After selecting the 5 best features, we reduce the dimensionality to two by applying principal component \u2026",

Social data exhibit three characteristics that play a key role in social network analysis. First, social data are voluminous. Indeed, there are numerous on-line social networks that allow their users to easily create and share content. For example, there are more than 1.39 billion monthly active Facebook users [FbS15] and around 288 million monthly active Twitter users that generate 5800 tweets per second [Twi15], while 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute [You15].

The proposed algorithm is coined as Multiplicative Half-Quadratic MDS (MHQMDS). Its performance is assessed for potential functions associated to various M-estimators, because the correntropy criterion is closely related to the Welsch M-estimator.

It also models every speaker by a multivariate Gaussian probability density function and whenever new information is available, the respective model is updated.

The proposed method addresses face aging as an unsupervised image-to-image translation problem where the goal is to translate a face image belonging to an age class to an image of a different age class. To address this problem, we resort to adversarial training and extend the UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation (UNIT) framework to multi-domain image-to-image translation, since several age classes are considered. Due to the shared-latent space constraint of UNIT, the faces belonging to each age class/domain are forced to be mapped to a shared-latent representation. Low-level features are used to perform the transitions between the domains and to generate age progressed/regressed images. In addition, the most personal and abstract \u2026",

However, this method is vulnerable, because the training samples are seriously affected by the image content. Accordingly, it is difficult to train a reliable feature extractor by using such a training set. To address this problem, a camera identification framework based on the random subspace method and majority voting is proposed in this work.

The first test is a multivariate normality criterion based on the Mahalanobis distance of a sample measurement vector from a certain Gaussian component center. The first test is used in order to derive a decision whether to split a component into another two or not. The second test is a central tendency criterion based on the observation that multivariate kurtosis becomes large if the component to be split is a mixture of two or more underlying Gaussian sources with common centers. If the common center hypothesis is true, the component is split into two new components and their centers are initialized by the center of the (old) component candidate for splitting. Otherwise, the splitting is accomplished by a discriminant derived by the third test. This test is based on marginal cumulative \u2026",

The MDS problem is formulated as maximization of a correntropy criterion, which is solved by half-quadratic optimization in a multiplicative formulation. By doing so, theMDS copes with an initial dissimilarity matrix contaminated with outliers, because the correntropy criterion is closely related to the Welsch M-estimator. The proposed algorithm is coined as Multiplicative Half-Quadratic MDS (MHQMDS). Its performance is assessed for potential functions associated to various M-estimators have been tested. Three state-of-the-art MDS techniques, namely the Scaling by Majorizing a Complicated Function (SMACOF), the Robust Euclidean Embedding (REE), and the Robust MDS (RMDS), are implemented \u2026",

Despite the extensive research efforts, there are still open problems in accurate or efficient image search methods. The majority of existing methods, dedicated to image search, treat the image visual content and the semantic information captured by the social image tags, separately or in a sequential manner. Here, a novel and efficient method is proposed, exploiting visual and textual information simultaneously. The joint visual-textual information is captured by a fuzzy hypergraph powered by the term-frequency and inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) weighting scheme. Experimental results conducted on two datasets substantiate the merits of the proposed method. Indicatively, an average precision of 77% is measured at 1% recall for image-based queries.",

The long distance bigram probabilities and the interpolated long distance bigram probabilities at varying distances within a context capture different aspects of contextual information. In addition, the baseline bigram, which incorporates trigger-pairs for various histories, is tested in the same framework. The experimental results collected on publicly available corpora (CISI, Cran field, Medline, and NPL) demonstrate the superiority of the long distance bigrams over the baseline bigrams as well as the superiority of the interpolated long distance bigrams against the long distance bigrams and the baseline bigram with trigger-pairs in yielding more compact clusters containing less outliers.",

So far, only the ICA approach, which is based on the InfoMax principle, has been tested for facial expression recognition. In this paper, in addition to the InfoMax approach, another five ICA approaches extract features from two facial expression databases. In particular, the Extended InfoMax ICA, the undercomplete ICA, and the nonlinear kernel-ICA approaches are exploited for facial expression representation for the first time. When applied to images, ICA treats the images as being mixtures of independent sources and decomposes them into an independent basis and the corresponding mixture coefficients. Two architectures for representing the images can be employed \u2026",

The criterion employed in SFFS is the correct classification rate of the Bayes classifier assuming that the features obey the multivariate Gaussian distribution. A theoretical analysis that models the number of correctly classified utterances as a hypergeometric random variable enables the derivation of an accurate estimate of the variance of the correct classification rate during cross-validation. By employing such variance estimate, we propose a fast SFFS variant. Experimental findings on Danish emotional speech (DES) and speech under simulated and actual stress (SUSAS) databases demonstrate that SFFS computational time is reduced by 50% and the correct classification rate for classifying speech into emotional states for the selected subset of features varies less than the correct classification rate found \u2026",

A novel method is proposed for updating PLSI when new documents arrive. The proposed method adds incrementally the words of any new document in the term-document matrix and derives the updating equations for the probability of terms given the class (i.e. latent) variables and the probability of documents given the latent variables. The performance of the proposed method is compared to that of the folding-in algorithm, which is an inexpensive, but potentially inaccurate updating method. It is demonstrated that the proposed updating algorithm outperforms the folding-in method with respect to the mean squared error between the aforementioned probabilities as they are estimated by the two updating methods and the original non-adaptive PLSI algorithm.",

Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a \u201cquery and ranking\u201d manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either \u2113 2  norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset \u2026",

The typical contour detection strategy based on image segmentation in homogeneous regions fails in the case when the mouth images available for lipreading are lowcontrast gray level images. Most of the solutions adopted require manual marking of some contour points. Here we propose a new solution from the image segmentation class suitable to lip contour extraction, using a modified version of the fuzzy c-means image segmentation algorithm. The novelty of the solution proposed consists in the types of features used for segmentation, which include not only luminance information (as in the standard use of fuzzy cmeans), but also spatial information about the pixels in the image. After a simple filtering of the outliers, the contours of the resulting segmented objects are extracted. The experimental results obtained are superior to the ones obtained by standard or other versions of geometrically constrained fuzzy c-means, or by gradient-based edge detection strategies, without the need of manual marking of any contour points. Thus we consider the strategy proposed promising for automatic lip contour extraction applications.",

The RSFs are extracted from each speech signal by first averaging its spectrogram along the time axis and then by projecting the resulting mean spectrogram onto a Gaussian random matrix of compatible dimensions. By applying a sparse-representation based classifier to the device RSFs, state-of-the-art identification accuracy of 95.55% has been obtained on a set of 8 telephone handsets, from Lincoln-Labs Handset Database (LLHDB).",

            "Abstract": "Emotional speech recognition aims to automatically classify speech units (e.g., utterances) into emotional states, such as anger, happiness, neutral, sadness and surprise. The major contribution of this paper is to rate the discriminating capability of a set of features for emotional speech recognition when gender information is taken into consideration. A total of 87 features has been calculated over 500 utterances of the Danish Emotional Speech database. The Sequential Forward Selection method (SFS) has been used in order to discover the 5-10 features which are able to classify the samples in the best way for each gender. The criterion used in SFS is the crossvalidated correct classification rate of a Bayes classifier where the class probability distribution functions (pdfs) are approximated via Parzen windows or modeled as Gaussians. When a Bayes classifier with Gaussian pdfs is employed, a correct classification \u2026",

Instead of a set of Gabor lters tuned to di erent orientations and scales, multiscale morphological operations are employed to yield a feature vector at each node of the reference grid. In the veri cation phase, multiscale morphological operations are applied over the entire face image of a candidate and dynamic link matching establishes an isomorphism between the reference grid of the claimed person and the deformed graph built over candidate's image. The details of the proposed pattern matching scheme are discussed, namely:(i) fast algorithms for e cient feature extraction,(ii) linear projection algorithms for feature selection, and (iii) automatic weighting of the nodes according to their discriminatory power. The performance of the morphological dynamic link architecture is evaluated in terms of the receiver operating characteristic in the face image database collected within the European Union research project M2VTS. The comparison with other frontal face authentication algorithms developed within the project indicates that Morphological Dynamic Link Architecture with discriminatory power coe cients is ranked as the best algorithm in terms of the equal error rate achieved.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, automatic musical instrument identification using a variety of classifiers is addressed. Experiments are performed on a large set of recordings that stem from 20 instrument classes. Several features from general audio data classification applications as well as MPEG-7 descriptors are measured for 1000 recordings. Branch-and-bound feature selection is applied in order to select the most discriminating features for instrument classification. The first classifier is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques, where training is performed for each audio class individually. A novel NMF testing method is proposed, where each recording is projected onto several training matrices, which have been Gram-Schmidt orthogonalized. Several NMF variants are utilized besides the standard NMF method, such as the local NMF and the sparse NMF. In addition, 3-layered multilayer perceptrons, normalized Gaussian radial basis function networks, and support vector machines employing a polynomial kernel have also been tested as classifiers. The classification accuracy is high, ranging between 88.7% to 95.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques tested in the aforementioned experiment.",

            "Abstract": "A novel unsupervised method for automatic music structure analysis is proposed. Three types of audio features, namely the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the chroma features, and the auditory temporal modulations are employed in order to form beat-synchronous feature sequences modeling the audio signal. Assume that the feature vectors from each segment lie in a subspace and the song as a whole occupies the union of several subspaces. Then any feature vector can be represented as a linear combination of the feature vectors stemming from the same subspace. The coefficients of such a linear combination are found by solving an appropriate ridge regression problem, resulting to the ridge representation (RR) of the audio features. The RR yields an affinity matrix with nonzero within-subspace affinities and zero between-subspace ones, revealing the structure of the music recording. The segmentation of the feature sequence into music segments is found by applying the normalized cuts algorithm to the RR-based affinity matrix. In the same context, the combination of multiple audio features is investigated as well. The proposed method is referred to as ridge regression-based music structure analysis (RRMSA). State-of-the-art performance is reported for the RRMSA by conducting experiments on the manually annotated Beatles benchmark dataset.",

The transcribed text of each speaker\u2019s utterance is processed by the probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI) that offers a powerful means to model each speaker\u2019s vocabulary employing a number of hidden topics, which are closely related to his/her identity, function, or expertise. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted from each speech frame and their dynamic range is quantized to a number of predefined bins in order to compute MFCC local histograms for each speech utterance, which is time-aligned with the transcribed text. Two identity scores are independently computed by the PLSI applied to the text and the nearest neighbor classifier applied to the local MFCC histograms. It is demonstrated that a convex combination of the two scores is more accurate than \u2026",

Though information is free and available to everybody, it is very difficult be used. For example, let us consider the well-known INTERNET search engines. In an information retrieval system, the user generates a request or query for the information he or she would like to obtain. This might take the form of a command or a question. The information retrieval engine then presents the user with a ranked list of documents, ideally with those most relevant to the query topic first, from which the user can obtain the information or answers to questions, they are seeking. In order to be able to score the match between the documents and the query, a method of indexing, that is, of representing the linguistic information in both the documents and the query must be found along with a method of matching them. Despite the fact that such information retrieval engines can point pretty well to a URL that probably contains an answer to the query, they cannot suggest pages that have similar context to a specific page. Furthermore, they can be easily tricked, in order, to index in a higher position a page not relevant to a specific subject. Most of their problems are based on the fact that they use keyword search strategies.Our work under natural language request analysis addresses information retrieval as a synonym of textual data mining. Moreover, tight links can be identified with exploratory data analysis, knowledge discovery in databases, pattern recognition and machine learning. In textual \u2026",

In addition, it is well-known that the probability density function of stock prices exhibits heavy tails and there is a large degree of uncertainty in stock price evolution. Building on the aforementioned facts, a robust collaborative Kalman filter is proposed for stock price prediction within the context of time-evolving dyadic processes, where the prediction error is treated as a heavy-tailed noise whose variance is a properly modeled random variable. Variational approximation is exploited to make posterior inference tractable. The proposed model captures the volatility of stock prices through time, yielding more accurate predictions than the state-of-the-art and enabling the consistent tracking of the extreme values of stock prices.",

Two cases are studied: stock price prediction and flight price prediction. A dyadic particle filter is proposed that is based on sequential importance resampling. This dyadic particle filter captures the dynamic evolution of a pair of latent vectors. In stock price prediction, one latent vector is defined for each stock. This latent vector is paired with a market segment latent vector introduced for each group of companies of the same category. Both latent vectors capture the hidden information of the stock market and reinforce the state estimation procedure. This hidden information influences strongly the performance of the particle filter, yielding more accurate prediction of stock prices than the state-of-the-art techniques. For flight price prediction, the pair of latent vectors corresponds to route and destination, respectively \u2026",

The oPLSA employs a fixed-size moving window over a document stream to incorporate new documents and at the same time to discard old ones (i.e., documents that fall outside the scope of the window). In addition, the oPLSA assimilates new words that had not been previously seen (out-of-vocabulary words), and discards the words that exclusively appear in the documents to be thrown away. To handle the new words, Good-Turing estimates for the probabilities of unseen words are exploited. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority in terms of accuracy of the oPLSA over well known PLSA updating methods, such as the PLSA folding-in (PLSA fold.), the PLSA \u2026",

The total variation between chi 2  and Fisher, as well as between chi 2  and Beta, allows us to measure the information loss in high dimensions.

A modified LMS L-filter with nonhomogeneous step-sizes is also proposed in order to accelerate the rate of convergence of the adaptive L-filter.

These features are subsequently excluded from sequential floating feature selection that employs the probability of correct classification of the Bayes classifier as criterion. In a second stage, adaptive genetic algorithms search for the worst performing utterances with respect to the same criterion. The sequential application of both stages is demonstrated to improve speech emotion recognition on the Danish Emotional Speech database.",

Another closely related problem is the ability to successfully recommend images to users. An automatic image annotation and recommendation system is proposed based on Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Electric Network Frequency (ENF) is embedded in multimedia recordings if the recordings are captured with a device connected to power mains or placed near the power mains. It is exploited as a tool for multimedia authentication. ENF fluctuates stochastically around its nominal frequency at 50/60 Hz. In indoor environments, luminance variations captured by video recordings can also be exploited for ENF estimation. However, the various textures and different levels of shadow and luminance hinder ENF estimation in static and non-static video, making it a non-trivial problem. To address this problem, a novel automated approach is proposed for ENF estimation in static and non-static digital video recordings. The proposed approach is based on the exploitation of areas with similar characteristics in each video frame. These areas, called superpixels, have a mean intensity that exceeds a specific threshold. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on various videos of real-life scenarios that resemble surveillance from security cameras. These videos are of escalating difficulty and span recordings from static ones to recordings, which exhibit continuous motion. The maximum correlation coefficient is employed to measure the accuracy of ENF estimation against the ground truth signal. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves ENF estimation against the state-of-the-art, yielding statistically significant accuracy improvements.",

The sparse coefficient vectors are then projected to the principal subspaces of their within-class and between-class covariance matrices. Decisions are taken with respect to the minimum Euclidean distance from the class mean sparse coefficient vectors, which undergo the aforementioned projections.

The second rule is based on the cross-power in a particular frequency band that is also compared to a threshold. Experiments are carried out in order to validate the feasibility of the aforementioned dialogue detection rules by using ground-truth indicator functions determined by human observers from six different movies. A total of 25 dialogue scenes and another 8 non-dialogue scenes are employed. The probabilities of false alarm and detection are estimated by cross-validation, where 70% of the available scenes are used to learn the thresholds \u2026",

This paper deals with the L p  comparators for which simple analog implementations exist. From a statistical point of view, the L p  comparators are based on the nonlinear means. Their probability density function and the first and second-order moments are derived for independent uniformly distributed inputs. L p  comparators provide estimates of the minimum and maximum of their inputs. Therefore, they introduce errors. A proper approach to compensate for the estimation errors is proposed.",

This paper theoretically justifies the validity of the aforementioned relationship. Furthermore, it proves that the new estimate of the variance of the prediction error, treated as a random variable itself, exhibits a much smaller variance than the usual estimate obtained by cross- validation even for a small number of repetitions. Accordingly, we claim that the proposed estimate is more accurate than the usual, straightforward, estimate of the variance of the prediction error obtained by applying cross-validation.",

The proposed approach achieves age progression (ie, future looks) and regression (ie, previous looks) of face images that belong to a specific age class by translating them to other (subsequent or precedent) age classes. It learns pairwise translations between all age classes. Two variants are presented. The first one learns a global transformation, while the second one incorporates a pyramid encoding and decoding scheme to more effectively diffuse age class information. The proposed variants are thoroughly evaluated with respect to both qualitative and quantitative criteria. They yield appealing face age progression and regression results when compared to ground truth images and outperform state-of-the-art approaches for face aging based on quantitative evaluation metrics.

The major problem in user authentication is to achieve on the one hand toll performance: false acceptance rate as low as possible (minimise access to impostors), and false rejection rate as low as possible (a registered user should access to his system in any case), and on the other hand stand the wide range of conditions of use of such systems as well as provide ergonomically viable solutions. The use of multiple modalities will help to overpass potential technical limitations of individual modalities as well as take benefit of the emerging multimedia environment: workstations, network computers, smart phones are more and more equipped with audio and video capabilities. The research is driven by the application needs and user requirements. Therefore, work has essentially been driven by three main goals: 1. Develop platforms for evaluation, implementation and fast prototyping of technology. Submit these platforms to user tests in real situations, in order to measure the adequation between user requirements and current maturity of the technology. 2. Develop algorithmic solutions for user authentication in a multimodal context. Implement these solutions on the software platforms for fast prototyping.

Moreover, deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) is applied to the auditory cortical representations for dimensionality reduction. To classify the music recordings, either support vector machines (SVMs) or classifiers based on canonical correlation are employed. An average classification rate of 73.25 % is measured on a dataset of Greek folk songs from 8 regions, when the auditory cortical representations are classified by the SVMs. It is also demonstrated that the reduced features extracted by the DCCA yield an encouraging average classification rate of 66.27%.

Accurate price prediction based on historical data is a challenging task in this field, because a large degree of uncertainty governs price evolution. Stock and flight price prediction are two cases studied here. A dynamic dyadic particle filter is proposed that is based on sequential importance resampling. To ensure the generation of efficient particles, a time-evolving structure is constructed by employing pairs of latent state vectors called dyads. The variance of the observation noise is treated as a random variable obeying a heavy-tailed distribution. For stock price prediction, the dyad consists of a latent state vector modeling each stock and a latent state vector modeling the group of companies of the same category. It is demonstrated by experiments that the dynamic evolution of latent state vectors leads to more efficient prediction \u2026",

As a result, less BIC tests are needed, making the proposed system less computationally demanding in time and memory, and considerably more efficient with respect to missed speaker change points. A feature selection algorithm based on branch and bound search strategy is applied in order to identify the most efficient features for speaker segmentation.

In this paper, we propose a solution to lip contour detection that minimizes user interaction by requiring a minimal number of points to be marked manually on the mouth image. The proposed approach is based on edge detection using gradient masks and edge following. The method is based on the examination of gradient direction patterns in the lip area, and makes use of the local direction constancy along the lip contours, as opposed to the other regions of the mouth image that are characterized by random edge directions.",

Several perceptual features used in general sound classification applications were measured for 300 sound recordings consisting of 6 different musical instrument classes (piano, violin, cello, flute, bassoon, and soprano saxophone). In addition, MPEG-7 basic spectral and spectral basis descriptors were considered, providing an effective combination for accurately describing the spectral and timbral audio characteristics. The audio files were split using 70% of the available data for training and the remaining 30% for testing A classifier was developed based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques, thus introducing a novel application of NMF. The standard NMF method was examined, as well as its modifications: the local NMF, the sparse NMF, and the discriminant NMF. Experimental results are presented to compare MPEG-7 spectral basis representations with MPEG-7 basic spectral features in conjunction with the various NMF algorithms. The results indicate that the use of the spectrum projection coefficients for feature extraction and the standard NMF classifier yields an accuracy exceeding 95%.",

The diffusion process is assumed to be a geometric Brownian motion whose dynamics are modeled by a Kalman filter.

Moreover, video fade effects are identified and used independently in order to track scene changes. The detection technique was tested on newscast videos provided by the TRECVID 2003 video test set.

Therefore, it is reasonable to perform acquisition device identification by analyzing the recorded speech signal. To this end, recording-level spectral, cepstral, and fusion of spectral and cepstral features are employed as suitable representations for device identification. The feature vectors extracted from the training speech recordings are used to form overcomplete dictionaries for the devices. Each test feature vector is represented as a linear combination of all the dictionary columns (ie, atoms). Since the dimensionality of the feature vectors is much smaller than the number of training speech recordings, there are infinitely many representations of each test feature vector with respect to the dictionary.

The reconstruction procedure exploits the assumption that the original signal lies in the range of a generator. A pretrained generator of a Generative Adversarial Network generates audio digits. A new method for reconstruction is proposed, using only the most active segment of the signal, i.e., the segment with the highest energy. The underlying assumption is that such segment offers a more compact representation, preserving the meaningful content of signal. Cases when the reconstruction produces noise, instead of digit, are treated as outliers. In order to detect and reject them, three unsupervised indicators are used, namely, the total energy of reconstructed signal, the predictions of an one-class Support Vector Machine, and the \u2026",

More specifically, a feature vector is created at each node of a sparse grid superimposed on the facial area by concatenating the gray level values of the reconstructed images at the grid node position. When a candidate person claims the identity of a reference person, a variant of dynamic link matching, the so-called morphological signal decomposition\u2014dynamic link architecture, is applied to yield a matching error between the reference grid and a variable grid that is built over the facial image region of the candidate person \u2026",

Three known classifiers are tested and compared in both cases, namely the Fisher linear discriminant, the#-nearest neighbor classifier, and the nearest mean classifier. The performance of each classifier is evaluated in terms of the probabilities of false alarm and detection or the receiver operating characteristic.

This task is usually solved manually or pseudo-automatically, requiring some manual human intervention. Past attempts to contour extraction based on typical edge detection schemes failed in the case of frontal gray level natural mouth images due to the weak contrast of these images. The proposed approach for lip contour extraction is still based on edge processing, but instead of using the edge magnitude, we process the edge direction. Clear patterns of edge directions can be observed around the lip contours, and noisy directions in the remaining areas. By using angular measures for edge following, good results are obtained with little manual intervention.",

The context information is expressed frequently in terms of high-order relations, such as the relations among users, tags, and images. Hypergraphs can model the aforementioned high-order relations between their vertices (i.e., users, user social groups, tags, geo-tags, and images) by hyper-edges, whose influence can be assessed by properly estimating their weights. Here, an efficient adaptive hypergraph weight estimation is proposed for image tagging. In particular, both equality and inequality constraints enforced during hypergraph learning are taken into account and an efficient adaptation step selection using the Armijo rule is proposed.

It is well known that the performance of any face authentication/recognition algorithm deteriorates significantly in the presence of the aforementioned conditions as well as the expression variations. The use of simple and powerful pre-processing techniques aiming at compensating for variable recording conditions prior to the application of any authentication algorithm is proposed. It is shown that such an approach overcomes indeed the image variations and guarantees an almost stable performance for the Morphological Dynamic Link Architecture developed within the European research project M2VTS.",

Due to the non-negative constraints explicitly enforced, the extracted eigenvectors turn to be sparse without employing any sparsity controlling parameter. Accordingly, only one parameter has to be tuned, i.e., the learning rate. Also, the complexity of the method under study is approximately linear under plausible assumptions. To assess the method\u2019s performance, comprehensive experimental evaluation is conducted on both image and financial data.

The proposed system is extensible in the sense that it can be embedded in any conversational system that receives and emits XML content.
