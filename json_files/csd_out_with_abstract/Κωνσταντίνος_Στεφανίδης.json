The application consists of four basic subsystems: (a) the main tile editor for constructing tiles; (b) the bitmap ripper, automatically computing the least number of tiles for any given bitmap; (c) the connectivity checker, to test how tiles actually fit together to form larger regions; and (d) the tile bitmap builder, to put together a final set of tiles as a single bitmap. We discuss how the design of game tiles through the Tile Dreamer tool becomes easier and more efficient.",

This paper proposes an evaluation framework for specifying and measuring the user-orientation of interactive products. The term \u201cuser-orientation\u201d refers to the extent to which target users (will) find the product acceptable at all phases of the user experience lifecycle. The proposed framework incorporates accessibility as a basic determinant of acceptability and long-term adoption. It can be employed effectively in the evaluation of systems that are aimed to be accessible and usable by diverse users (e.g., public systems) or by people with disability.",

            "Abstract": "This chapter describes the Unified User Interface design method. This new user interface design method has been developed to enable the \u201cfusion\u201d of different design alternatives, resulting from the consideration of differing end-user attributes and contexts of use, into a single unified form, as well as to provide a design structure which can be easily translated into a targetimplementation by user interface developers. The Unified User Interface design method is elaborated here in terms of its primary objective, underlying process, techniques used, representation, and overall contribu-tions to Human-Computer Interaction design.In its short history, human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) has accumulated a substantial body of knowledge that provides insight into the design of user interfaces. There is an abundance of design techniques that differ with regard to at least two dimensions, namely (a) the underlying science base and (b) the type, range, and scope of design outcomes, as well as the feedback they offer into the (re) design process. Regarding the science base, there are techniques, such the hierarchical task decomposition (P. Johnson, H. Johnson, Waddington, & Shouls, 1988), which are influenced by the human factors evaluation view of information-processing psychology, and others, such as goals, operators, methods, and selection rules\u2014GOMS (Card, PT Moran, & Newell, 1983), task-action grammar\u2014TAG (Payne, 1984), the user-action notation\u2014UAN (Hartson, Siochi, & Hix, 1990), and so on, that adopt the methodological perspectives and assumptions of cognitive science.

On the other hand, Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is an emerging field of research. AmI environments are claimed to be among other things sensitive, caring and adaptive to their inhabitants. In the context of education, AmI can adopt a student-centric approach and support the education activities that are taking place adapting to the individual learner\u2019s needs. This paper proposes an approach for AmI educational environments to assist in identifying, monitoring, and providing adapted instruction to students with LDs.",

This Chapter provides a review of scanning approaches and presents a scanning method-automatic hierarchical scanning-that enables motor-impaired users to work with any application running in Microsoft Windows, without the need of a posteriori modification, through the use of binary switches as an alternative to traditional input devices (ie, keyboard, mouse).The hierarchical scanning method provides access to all the interactive interface elements of a window, based on their place in the hierarchy, by dynamically retrieving the window hierarchical structure. The main advantage of this technique in comparison to other scanning approaches is that it ensures rapid interaction, avoiding the time-consuming sequential access to all the interactive interface elements. Issues related to hierarchical scanning are \u2026",

The technique, referred to as Non-Functional Requirements Analysis (NfRA), constitutes a preliminary step in a scenario-based inquiry motivated by an explicit focus on non-functional requirements (NfRs) as drivers for scenario retooling (Erskine et al., 1997). This Chapter will illustrate the method by focusing on four main NfRs that are critical for universal access, namely adaptability, scalability, platform independence and user tolerance or individualisation. These are general NfRs applicable to a broad range of interactive software, irrespective of their functional scope, interaction platform or intended use.",

            "Abstract": "An online community is a virtual community composed of individuals who form and maintain online communication, share common goals, interests and needs that provide the reason of community existence, and use common interactive tools that support their networking and communication activities. The term \u201cnetworking\u201d is traditionally used to describe the formation and maintenance of connections and relationships between individuals, organizations or other interested parties. Virtual or online networking is a form of interpersonal communication that is characterized by the use of electronic means of communication between the different parties and the exchange of messages and information in electronic forms [11]. Hence, virtual or online communities perform virtual networking. This paper aims to examine how the principles of Design for All can support the formation and operation of online communities that are fully inclusive, multi-cultural and multiplatform, thus providing an infrastructure essentially accessible to all their members to carry out virtual networking activities. Following an introduction to online communities and community formation, the paper briefly builds the case for Design for All and the challenges for new information and communication technologies towards a fully inclusive Information Society. Then, based on practical experience and case studies, the paper examines the benefits and challenges of applying the principles of Design for All in the design, development and support of virtual interaction spaces, in order to cater for the diversity of users-community members, as well as of their environments of use.

            "Abstract": "A new discipline at the intersection of the development and operation of software systems known as DevOps has seen significant growth recently. Among the wide range of tasks of DevOps professionals, we focus on that of selecting appropriate cloud deployments for distributed applications. Despite the advent of automated software deployment and management frameworks, reasoning about good deployments still requires interaction with experts, often through discussions on online technical forums and social networks. Current social networking technologies offer basic ways to communicate. Within the DevOps community, communication on application structure and cloud deployment tradeoffs could become more effective by using knowledge present in global community-sourced information repositories. In this paper we argue for the benefits of tapping into such knowledge and for seamlessly feeding it back into the social networking platform. The social networking platform presented in this paper integrates social networking with automated deployment of applications on multi-clouds and with knowledge drawn from community-sourced information repositories. The implementation leverages two such repositories, the PaaSage repository and Chef Supermarket. Our user evaluation experiments demonstrate the value created for DevOps professionals.",

Such an evolution brings about radical implications on the current and future HCI research focus and agenda. Firstly, it becomes increasingly complex for designers to know a priori the profiles of the users, and, therefore, it becomes necessary to design for the broadest possible end-user population. This raises implications on design methodology and instruments, as well as on the technical and user perceived qualities to be delivered. Secondly, designers should progressively adapt their thinking to facilitate a shift from designing tools for productivity improvement, to designing computer-mediated \u2026",

Furthermore, student expectations and reactions to the DfA teaching pilots are described by means of the information gained from questionnaires. In this way the taxonomy is evaluated by the teaching pilot experiences for robustness in completeness and usefulness. The second purpose of this exercise is to highlight best practices in, and possible obstacles and other challenges to implementing and maintaining of Design for All courses and modules in a range of higher education schemes, so that education policies and strategies may be informed accordingly. Both of these objectives help to further the work on recommendations for curriculum work on Design for All, in terms of content and in terms of sustainability.",

The two systems differ with respect to the demands for visual attention and controlled processing. With one system, users have to decide among options during the entry dialogue, whereas with the other system destination entry proceeds in a single line of action. Data from a driving study and from three groups of different ages in training studies confirm the task analyses and show the benefit of constrained options.",

            "Abstract": "Design for All (DfA), sometimes addressed as Universal Design, Barrier Free Design, Inclusive Design is seen as an important complement to Assistive Technology. The basic idea is to produce products and services in a way that as many people as possible can use it directly or with the help of As-sistive Technology. This concept is of particular importance in a quickly chang-ing world, in order to keep pace with innovation. A concept to adapt all prod-ucts and services for those who cannot operate it is costly, time consuming and may lead to discrimination. It is further a more economic strategy to design and produce for as many as possible. Information Society Technologies (IST) are an important and interesting field in Design for All that have the potential to en-sure access to products and services for all citizens and can help overcome tra-ditional barriers that a number of population groups in the use of technology in their everyday life.",

To facilitate the development of a modular, rather than monolithic, behavior system, proper software tools need to be introduced. This paper proposes combination of a well-known finite state machine and a custom decision-making tool for implementing adaptive robot behaviors. The notion of automatic behavior adaptation reflects the capability of the robot to adapt during runtime based on the individual end-user, as well as the particular context of use, therefore delivering the most appropriate interaction experience. While each tool on its own can be used towards that aim, a unified approach that combines them simplifies the task at hand and distinguishes the roles of designers and programmers.

A systematic search of databases was carried out to locate theoretical and empirical studies investigating technologies as auxiliary or supporting tools for the inclusion of DHH students. Results are presented in two categories: (1) review/survey or theoretical papers and (2) studies of technology design and evaluation. Based on our findings, there is only preliminary evidence on how technology can support the inclusion of DHH students in mainstream schools. We argue that there is less need for research on technologies specialized on the disability, aiming to accommodate hearing loss, such as technologies to support the acquisition of sign language or speech-to-text translation of the teacher\u2019s talk.

            "Abstract": "As computer technologies rapidly evolve, evaluation as an integral part of the development lifecycle of complex systems and user interfaces (UIs), which address diverse user groups including people with disability, emerge as critical to their success. Typically though, traditional evaluation methods and techniques originally developed for conducting conventional UI usability evaluations (eg, of GUIs) are usually introduced in late development stages of such UIs and adapted on a case-by-case basis. Reportedly, such non-systematic approaches to evaluation are often proved inefficient and ineffective in assessing the accessibility or other qualities-such as the utility and usabilityof systems that are (also) targeted to a diverse user population. This paper presents a normative framework for evaluation that allows to address additional system qualities such as visibility-findability, perceived usefulness prior access and use, availability-approachability, interaction qualities (eg, accessibility, utility and usability), and user relationship maintainability. The proposed model can be employed both in evaluating an individual system and in comparing/assessing sets of systems. Furthermore, the same model can apply also at the level of subsystems and system functions. A significant advantage of the proposed framework is that it can be employed for evaluations that need to pay attention also to substantial factors that are usually neglected. These include accessibility, the needs and requirements of a more diverse user population, and variances in user patterns as these evolve in the context of repeated and long term usage. In particular, the framework can be \u2026",

Such an environment will be characterised by invisible (ie, embedded) computational power in everyday appliances and other surrounding physical objects, and populated by intelligent mobile and wearable devices. Ambient Intelligence will have profound consequences on the type, content and functionality of the emerging products and services, as well as on the way people will interact with them, bringing about multiple new requirements for the development of Information Society Technologies. To address the above, the notion of Universal Access is critically important. This paper aims to discuss the anticipated opportunities and challenges that Ambient \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The 7th ERCIM Workshop \"User Interfaces for All\" builds upon the results of the six previous Workshops held in Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 30-31 October 1995; Prague, Czech Republic, 7-8 November 1996; Obernai, France, 3-4 November 1997; Stockholm, Sweden, 19-21 October 1998; Dagstuhl, Germany, 28 November-1 December 1999; and Florence, Italy, 25-26 October 2000. The vision of User Interfaces for All advocates the proactive realisation of the \"design for all\" principle in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and involves the development of user interfaces to interactive applications and telematic services, which provide universal access and usability to potentially all users. In the tradition of its predecessors, this Workshop aims to consolidate recent work, and to stimulate further discussion, on the state of the art in User Interfaces for All, and its increasing range of applications in the emerging Information Society. This year's event emphasises \"Universal Access\" and invites contributions on a broad range of topics, including technological applications and policy developments aiming to advance the notion of Information Society Technologies accessible and acceptable by the widest possible end-user population. The requirement for Universal Access stems from the growing impact of the fusion of the emerging technologies, and from the different dimensions of diversity that are intrinsic to the Information Society. These dimensions become evident when considering the broad range of user characteristics, the changing nature of human activities, the variety of contexts of use, the increasing availability and diversification of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The role of the teacher in the classroom environment is of crucial importance for the effectiveness of the learning process. However, recent studies on the technological enhancement of education have shown that teacher\u2019s activities are not adequately supported, as the focus remains rather on the student\u2019s side. This article discusses a learner-centric approach towards supporting instructors in improving the teaching and learning processes in ambient educational environments. The proposed solution introduces an intelligent multi-agent infrastructure that monitors unobtrusively the students\u2019 activities and identifies potential learning weaknesses and pitfalls that need to be addressed at an individual or classroom level. Such real-time insights enable the instructor to intervene providing help and adapt the teaching process according to the needs of the class. For that to be achieved, several applications have been developed:(i) a real-time classroom activity visualizer,(ii) a behavioral reasoner that aims to identify common behaviors by analyzing classroom activities,(iii) a statistics records manager targeting to showcase students\u2019 progress and performance at both an individual and classroom level, and finally (iv) a series of mini-tools that enhance typical procedures that can be found in conventional classrooms, such as the classroom attendance record, the schedule manager, etc. Following the system\u2019s description, findings of a preliminary expert-based evaluation are presented and some concluding remarks regarding the deployment of the system in real-life environments are formulated. Finally, potential future extensions of the system are proposed.",

Intangible HC dimensions include dexterity, know-how, and skilled use of tools, as well as identity and traditions of the communities in which craftsmanship is, or was, practiced. HCs are part of history and have impact upon the economy of the areasin which they flourish. Despite their cultural significance, efforts towards HC digital representation and presentation are scattered. In this chapter, as a first step towards the Representation and Presentation of Heritage Crafts as cultural heritage (CH), pertinent requirements and needed technological components are investigated. Representation is expected to capture the wide spectrum of knowledge that a HC covers, from objects and their making, to hand gestures and tool uses that define craft motor skills, to the societal value, economic impact, and historical significance of HCs. Presentation is expected to address the need of exploiting Representation to conserve cultural resources, contribute to their accurate interpretation, provide essential and authentic experiences, as well as stimulate revenues of cultural resources through thematic tourism. This chapter lays the foundations and envisions the further development and formalisation of a suitable approach to HC representation and presentation in the form of a generic protocol that together with the appropriate technological tools can be applied to any HC instance.",

In the second part, the chapter provides a literature review highlighting some of the representative efforts devoted to understanding universal access and addressing specific research and development challenges. Then, it describes a scenario-based methodology, underlying the work of the IS4ALL Thematic network, towards compiling a consolidated universal access code of practice and validating it in designated Health Telematics reference scenarios. The proposed code of practice comprises detailed description of a processoriented (macro-level) method, overviews of specific micro-level design techniques and examples of their application by universal access practitioners in the context of reference scenarios depicting access to Web-based applications. The chapter is concluded with a discussion of lessons learnt and experience gained.",

While previous research addressed the issue of engineering adaptive systems from scratch, there is an important methodological gap since we lack processes to reform existing non-adaptive systems towards adaptive behavior.

            "Abstract": "Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has been established as the dominant paradigm for efficiently transferring skills from human teachers to robots. In this context, the Federated Learning (FL) conceptualization has very recently been introduced for developing large-scale human-robot collaborative environments, targeting to robustly address, among others, the critical challenges of multi-agent learning and long-term autonomy. In the current work, the latter scheme is further extended and enhanced, by designing and integrating a novel user profile formulation for providing a fine-grained representation of the exhibited human behavior, adopting a Deep Learning (DL)-based formalism. In particular, a hierarchically organized set of key information sources is considered, including: a) User attributes (e.g. demographic, anthropomorphic, educational, etc.), b) User state (e.g. fatigue detection, stress detection, emotion recognition, etc.) and c) Psychophysiological measurements (e.g. gaze, electrodermal activity, heart rate, etc.) related data. Then, a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and stacked autoencoders, with appropriately defined neural network architectures, is employed for the modelling step. The overall designed scheme enables both short- and long-term analysis/interpretation of the human behavior (as observed during the feedback capturing sessions), so as to adaptively adjust the importance of the collected feedback samples when aggregating information originating from the same and different human teachers, respectively.",

            "Abstract": "This Chapter presents an overview of widely available methods and tools for developing web-based services. In this context, modern programming languages, popular user interface (UI) toolkits and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are briefly reviewed, taking into account the facilities offered to software developers for producing more advanced web-based services. The main drawback of these development approaches comes out to be their inability to cope with the diversity of the target user population. A potential solution is proposed through a novel approach to the development of inclusive Web-based interfaces (web content), capable to adapt to multiple and significantly different profiles of users and contexts of use. To this purpose, an advanced toolkit called EAGER is proposed. EAGER allows Microsoft\u00ae .NET developers to create interfaces that conform to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) accessibility guidelines, and which are able to adapt to the interaction modalities, metaphors and user interface elements most appropriate to each individual user, according to profile information (user and context). The process of employing EAGER is significantly less demanding in terms of time, experience and skills required from the developer than the typical process of developing Web interfaces for the \u201caverage\u201d user. Ultimately, EAGER offers significant benefits to developers, and ensures the delivery of widely accessible, usable and satisfying Web-based interfaces.",

In this project, we propose a code-free, visual scripting platform to replicate gamified training scenarios through rapid prototyping and VR software design patterns. We implemented and compared two authoring tools: a) visual scripting and b) VR editor for the rapid reconstruction of VR training scenarios.

            "Abstract": "In the past, accessibility in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) was primarily concerned with the selection of suitable equipment to enable alternative computer access for people with disabilities. As a result, it was mainly considered as an afterthought and reflected a reactive approach, whereby Assistive Technology solutions addressed problems introduced by a previous generation of technology (Savidis and Stephanidis, 1995; Stephanidis, 1995; Akoumianakis and Stephanidis, 1999). This reactive approach entails primarily adaptations. Adaptations facilitate access to the interface via suitable mechanisms, such as filtering, dedicated interaction techniques, such as scanning and specialised input/output devices (eg, braille displays, switches, eye-gaze systems). Typically, the result of adaptations includes the reconfiguration of the physical layer of interaction, and when necessary, the translation of the visual interface manifestation to an alternative modality. For example, access to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) by a blind user requires \u201cfiltering\u201d of the contents of the screen, using appropriate software (eg, screen reader), so as to present them in an alternative modality (eg, tactile, audio).Despite the short term benefits that such a posteriori adaptations may bring about, it is important to mention that there are serious shortcomings which render this approach inadequate in the long run. Some of these shortcomings have been identified in the relevant HCI literature. For the purposes of this article, it is important to add the following: First of all, adaptations introduce a programmingintensive approach towards accessibility, which increases the cost of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "With the development of wearable sensors and textile technologies, wearable devices have been incorporated into our everyday life. Using unobtrusive and wearable technology as emotional assistance for wearers has been considered as an important research question in the field of Human-computer interaction (HCI). Not only is it essential to boost one\u2019s own emotional health, it also crucial to influence others\u2019 emotional states through interactions in a group environment. People are easily affected by the emotions and feelings among group members. For example, surrounded by people complaining about their situations, most likely you will feel depressed and sad. If your spouse comes home wearing a big smiling face, your mood can be dramatically affected and you will soon become happier. Researchers call this phenomenon \u201cgroup emotional contagion\u201d[1]. Affective devices should take into account the shared emotions occurring in groups and help their wearers to be aware of their bodily experience in depression or overexcitement and consequently help modify or pacify their emotions. Designing for group emotional health with wearable technologies presents a new challenge to interaction designers. Wearable tech design should also be put in a group\u2019s context. It raises different issues and principles in addition to those of self-emotional awareness and regulation. Designers need to find the important touchpoints with users during the design process.

In this environment various wireless and wired sensor technologies have been integrated, allowing the patient to control the environment and interact with the hospital facilities, while a clinically oriented interface allows for vital sign monitoring. The developed applications are presented both from a patient\u2019s and a doctor\u2019s perspective, offering different services depending on the user\u2019s role. The results of the evaluation process illustrate the need for such a service, leading to important conclusions about the usefulness and crucial role of AmI in health care. View Full-Text",

In this context, there is an increased need for information visualization, so as to propagate information to end users in a smart, sustainable, and resilient way. Currently, despite the growth of the IoT sector, many IoT operators only provide static visualizations. However, interactive data visualizations are required to achieve deeper and faster insights, beyond what is available in existing infrastructure, towards supporting decision-making by city authorities; while offering real time information to citizens.

Several design techniques, such as user centered design and iterative prototyping, as well as accessibility and usability guidelines, are overviewed and discussed. This analysis leads to the consideration that, in the context of web design, it is critical to provide design techniques and tools that can cope with a diverse user population in terms of social, cultural and personal characteristics. Towards addressing this need, the present Chapter proposes a Web User Interface (WUI) development toolkit, named EAGER, which embodies consolidated design knowledge and supports web designers in addressing diversity through WUI adaptation. The interfaces created are able to adapt to the interaction modalities, metaphors and user interface elements most appropriate to individual user and context profiles. The proposed design approach is analyzed in depth together with examples of design outcomes.",

Moreover, the term intelligent user interface typically implies the notion of dynamically enhancing the interaction with a single implemented artefact to suit different usage patterns, user groups, or contexts of use. This article extends this notion and describes how unified design artefacts can support the development of accessible and high quality user interfaces exhibiting the characteristics of multiple metaphor environments. To this effect, the article outlines the principles of unified user interface development and discusses how it can be used to advance Intelligent Interface Technology to account for diverse user requirements and interaction contexts.",

It is shown that out of the broad range of available evaluation techniques, only a few can be applied in the context of adaptable and adaptive user interfaces. The basic qualification criterion, which classifies a technique as being appropriate, is the degree to which it offers the constructs to assess situational and contextspecific aspects of user interface adaptations, thus determining its usefulness in a social context. Our claim is that evaluation of adaptable and adaptive behavior can only be informed by an analytical frame of reference, which offers a richer unit of analysis than that of the unaided and isolated users, with no access to other people or to artifacts and tools for accomplishing the task at hand.The advent of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), in the 1980s, contributed to the proliferation of a wide range of advanced interaction platforms enabling multimodal and multimedia user interactions across different contexts of use.

            "Abstract": "With the ever-advancing availability of digitized museum artifacts, the question of how to make the vast collection of exhibits accessible and explorable beyond what museums traditionally offer via their websites and exposed databases has recently gained increased attention. This research work introduces the Invisible Museum: a user-centric platform that allows users to create interactive and immersive virtual 3D/VR exhibitions using a unified collaborative authoring environment. The platform itself was designed following a Human-Centered Design approach, with the active participation of museum curators and end-users. Content representation adheres to domain standards such as International Committee for Documentation of the International Council of Museums (CIDOC-CRM) and the Europeana Data Model and exploits state-of-the-art deep learning technologies to assist the curators by generating ontology bindings for textual data. The platform enables the formulation and semantic representation of narratives that guide storytelling experiences and bind the presented artifacts with their socio-historic context. Main contributions are pertinent to the fields of (a) user-designed dynamic virtual exhibitions,(b) personalized suggestions and exhibition tours,(c) visualization in web-based 3D/VR technologies, and (d) immersive navigation and interaction. The Invisible Museum has been evaluated using a combination of different methodologies, ensuring the delivery of a high-quality user experience, leading to valuable lessons learned, which are discussed in the article.

            "Abstract": "User interface adaptation has been proposed in recent years as a means to achieve personalized accessibility and usability of user interfaces. Related user interface architectures, as well as a variety of related development method and tools, have also been elaborated. Admittedly, however, despite the recognized validity of the approach, which has been proved in practice in a series of prototype systems, the wider adoption and uptake of user interface adaptation approaches are still limited. One of the identified obstacles is the complexity intrinsic in designing such interfaces and the need of radically revising the current user interface design practice to account for (a) the alternative designs required for adaptation, (b) the parameters involved in driving adaptations (i.e., selecting among alternatives at a given point during interaction), and (c) the logic of adaptation at runtime.

Natural interaction between people and technology can be defined in terms of experience: people naturally communicate through gestures, expressions, movements. To this end, people should be able to interact with technology as they are used to interact with the real world in everyday life [19]. Additionally, AmI systems must be sensitive, responsive, and adaptive to the presence of people [16]. This paper presents the design and implementation of an interaction framework for ambient intelligence targeting to the provision of novel interaction metaphors and techniques in the context of AmI scenarios.

Computer games are usually far more demanding than typical interactive applications in terms of motor and sensory skills needed for interaction control, due to special-purpose input devices, complicated interaction techniques, and the primary emphasis on visual control and attention. This renders computer games inaccessible to a large percentage of people with disabilities. This article introduces the concept of universally accessible games, that is, games proactively designed to optimally fit and adapt to individual gamer characteristics and to be concurrently played among people with diverse abilities, without requiring particular adjustments or modifications. The concept is elaborated and tested through four case studies: a web-based chess game (UA-Chess), an action game (Access Invaders), a universally inaccessible game (Game Over \u2026",

An example for a location aware adaptive information system is presented and discussed and future directions for enriched multi-modal information presentation are proposed.",

Despite their high value and although users with visual impairments constitute an important market share, there are only few accessible crossword puzzles. Even these, however, are limited in providing alternative input and output modalities for users with disabilities and do not support equitable use, simplicity and intuitiveness, especially for blind users. This paper presents A-Cross, an accessible crossword puzzle for visually impaired users, aiming to support word solving in a novel and usable way. The evaluation process that was followed in order to assess the usability and accessibility of a functional yet early prototype of the A-Cross puzzle is also described.",

Whenever users are immersed in a virtual reality world, interactive features and content are usually presented as pop-up windows and floating-text notifications, immediately breaking user immersion, serving as a reminder they are navigating a computer-generated environment. In this paper we discuss how to introduce second screen experiences in VR by orchestrating interplay between using handheld devices while using a VR headset. This entails allowing the users to interface with the touchscreen display despite the opaque, view-obstructing visor. We propose achieving this through a \u201cmobile second-screen interreality system\u201d (MSIS), referring a virtual 3D smart device representation inside the VR world, which is tightly coupled with its real-world counterpart, allowing users to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "\u2018User Experience\u2019(UX) is a term that has been established in HCI research and practice, subsuming the term \u2018usability\u2019. UX denotes that interaction with a contemporary technological system goes far beyond usability, extending to one\u2019s emotions before, during, and after using the system and cannot be defined only by studying the fundamental usability attributes of effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. Measuring UX becomes a substantially more complicated endeavor when the interaction target is not just a technological system or application, but an entire intelligent environment and the systems contained therein. Motivated by the imminent need to assess, measure and quantify user experience in intelligent environments, this paper presents a methodological and conceptual framework that provides concrete guidance for UX research, design and evaluation, explaining which UX parameter should be measured, how, and when. An evaluation of the framework indicated that it can be valuable for researchers and practitioners, assisting them in planning, carrying out, and analyzing UX studies in a comprehensive and thorough manner, thus enhancing their understanding and improving the experiences they design for intelligent environments.

Its main goal is to promote a safe, healthy, and functional living environment for the elderly and people with disabilities who wish to live independently in their home. To achieve this goal, AAL environments utilize Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the emerging Ambient Intelligence (AmI) paradigm in order to provide sophisticated solutions that can support the needs of an elderly person or a person with disabilities, at home. This chapter will present examples of AAL environments found in research and academic literature and the solutions they offer to cater for the basic needs of people with motor impairments in order to support their independent living and quality of life.

This new paradigm gives rise to opportunities for novel, more efficient interactions with computing systems. At a technical level, the vision of Ambient Intelligence is realized by the seamless confluence of diverse computing platforms. In this context, a software framework (middleware) is essential to enable heterogeneous computing systems to interoperate. In this paper we first consider the basic requirements of a middleware that can effectively support the construction of Ambient Intelligence environments. Subsequently, we present a brief survey of existing, general-purpose middleware systems and evaluate them in terms of their suitability for serving as the low-level communication platform of an Ambient Intelligence middleware.

Therefore, there is a need for a systematic process in which alternative design decisions for different design parameters may be supported. The outcome of such a design process realizes a design space populated with appropriate designed dialogue patterns, along with their associated design parameters (e.g. user- and usage-context-attribute values).

            "Abstract": "User requirements elicitation is a fundamental phase of the development process of interactive product and services. This is evident in the principles of user-centered design (Norman and Draper, 1986), and has led to the development and practice of a wide variety of methods and techniques, mostly originating from the social sciences, psychology, organizational theory, creativity and arts, as well as from practical experience (Maguire and Bevan, 2002). Many of these techniques are based on the direct participation of users or user representatives in the process of formulating their own technological needs. However, the vast majority of available techniques has been developed with the \u201caverage\u201d able-bodied user and the working environment in mind.In universal access this precondition no longer holds, and, as pointed out in Chapter 1 of this handbook, the basic design principle of \u201cknowing the user\u201d becomes \u201cknowing the diversity of users.\u201d In this context, the issue of gathering and specifying user requirements needs to be revisited. First, the consideration of accessibility becomes of foremost importance to avoid exclusion from design. This is a difficult obstacle to overcome, because of the limited current experience of designers and developers in identifying and addressing accessibility issues and applying accessibility knowledge and guidelines in a user-oriented fashion (Zimmermann and Vanderheiden, 2008). Part II of this handbook provides an overview of the main accessibility issues related to various target user groups with disabilities.",

The apparatus consists of three high-resolution cameras, a light source, and accompanying software. Volume measurements of specific phantoms using volumetric tubes render slightly lower values than those obtained by our 3D imaging system (mean%\u00b1SD, 3.8%\u00b10.98, P<0.05). To examine the reproducibility of the method, sequential imaging of melanocytic lesions is carried out. The mean%\u00b1SD differences of area, major axis length, volume, and maximum height are 2.1%\u00b11.1, 0.9%\u00b10.8, 3.8%\u00b12.9, and 2.5%\u00b13.5 \u2026",

This path is intrinsically linked with (i) the progressive emergence of new, more general and systematic frameworks for studying and designing interaction, and (ii) technological evolution supporting the establishment of richer alternative interaction techniques and user interface styles.The concept of interactivity between humans and computers, contextually defined in this Chapter as the extent to which the characteristics of an interactive system affect the communication behaviour of both the user (s) and the system itself, plays a crucial role in this respect. Interactivity is not a new concept, as it has been investigated in the literature with respect to both human communication and various types of interactive systems.",

Reports on how such systems perform in actual home environments with ever-changing parameters and conditions are scarce and so are reports on what to take into consideration when planning the implementation of such complex evaluations. This paper will discuss some of the challenges that were faced by the experiment team during the home trials of an autonomously moving social robotic system. ",

However, they are typically developed in an ad-hoc, application-specific and vehicle-specific manner, resulting in tightly coupled implementations that are difficult to extend, while disallowing reuse of personalisation code or even personalisation logic across different setups. In this context, this paper proposes a framework for supporting personalised HMI interaction in ADAS systems, developed in the context of the H2020 ADAS&ME project. The framework is based on a rule engine that uses a customisable and extensible set of personalisation and adaptation rules, provided by automotive domain and HMI experts, and evaluates them according to the driver, vehicle and environment to produce HMI activation and GUI personalisation and adaptation decisions. Personalised HMI modality selection is realised by taking into account all available input and output modalities of the vehicle and maintaining bindings for their activation. At the same time, GUI personalisation is handled automatically through a GUI toolkit of personalisable and adaptable user controls that can be used for developing any GUI application requiring personalisation features. The paper presents the design and development of the framework and validates it by deploying it in two case studies.",

Arguably, the main drawback of existing evaluation methods and techniques is that they fail to provide adequate feedback into the AUI design process, or to generate empirical findings that can be reused across application boundaries. This paper proposes a new, modular approach to the evaluation of AUIs, which is specifically intended to cater for the aforementioned problems. The adaptive Nautilus Web browser, on which the approach will be applied is also briefly presented.",

Accordingly, an AR system:(i) combines real and virtual objects in a real environment,(ii) aligns real and virtual objects with each other so that as the view to a real object changes, the augmented object connected to it changes accordingly, and (iii) runs interactively, in three dimensions, and in real time. AR technologies enhance human perception and help seeing, hearing, and feeling the surrounding environment in new and enriched ways. This is achieved by making people sense virtual objects, which appear to coexist in the real world. AR can also be used to hide visual elements of the real world to allow people to focus on specific aspects (Diminished Reality).AR has been a very active research topic during the last decade, and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "High stress levels and sleep deprivation may cause several mental or physical health issues, such as depression, impaired memory, decreased motivation, obesity, etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented changes in our lives, generating significant stress, and worries about health, social isolation, employment, and finances. To this end, nowadays more than ever, it is crucial to deliver solutions that can help people to manage and control their stress, as well as to reduce sleep disturbances, so as to improve their health and overall quality of life. Technology, and in particular Ambient Intelligence Environments, can help towards that direction, when considering that they are able to understand the needs of their users, identify their behavior, learn their preferences, and act and react in their interest. This work presents two systems that have been designed and developed in the context of an Intelligent Home, namely CaLmi and HypnOS, which aim to assist users that struggle with stress and poor sleep quality, respectively. Both of the systems rely on real-time data collected by wearable devices, as well as contextual information retrieved from the ambient facilities of the Intelligent Home, so as to offer appropriate pervasive relaxation programs (CaLmi) or provide personalized insights regarding sleep hygiene (HypnOS) to the residents. This article will describe the design process that was followed, the functionality of both systems, the results of the user studies that were conducted for the evaluation of their end-user applications, and a discussion about future plans.

            "Abstract": "Smart home technology promises a brave new world where people control everything through smartphones. Recent surveys confirm that home automation is an emerging field with a current revenue of 30 million that will outreach 70 million by 2020, without yet reaching its full potential [2]. In general, smart environments users are expected to manage multiple places simultaneously (eg, residence, office, etc.) that incorporate a wide range of connected devices and artificial services, which they will have to monitor and control efficiently in a timely manner, regardless of their functional diversity. Despite, the abundance of mobile applications and frameworks that enable a user to control individual smart devices (eg, lights, locks, etc.), there is still the need for a unified interactive system that will aggregate them under a common roof and facilitate interaction through a simple, intuitive and consistent user interface. Therefore, the envisioned application aims to deliver a unified control center for the intelligent environment that focuses on enabling effective manipulation of a multitude of smart devices.",

As such, it can be easily integrated into existing, non-adaptive Web-publishing solutions. This chapter presents in detail several aspects of the framework, and provides an overview of its application in the European Commission-funded IST-1999-20656 PALIO project (\u201cPersonalised Access to Local Information and Services for Tourists\u201d). Furthermore, it discusses some of the lessons learned from our work on the framework thus far, as well as what we consider the most likely directions of future work in the area.",

Communication difficulties felt by deaf or hard of hearing members of the community lead to numerous problems including social isolation. Within the UK as a whole there is often desire or necessity to communicate with the deaf but there is a lack of experienced trained teachers to be able to train the hearing community to appropriate skilled levels where easy communication is possible. Furthermore, most of this training must be provided within people's leisure time so the training needs to be flexible and fun. This project through the use of web based materials will seek to reduce this training need gap. The main objective of this paper is to promote discussion on the topic of using the Internet to promote awareness of the communication difficulties of the deaf. The approaches to be adopted will be described within this paper, as will some of the some of the preliminary results obtained for early software feasibility studies. Some early conclusions are finally drawn regarding the direction in which the joint project will take.",

            "Abstract": "The development of online work and collaboration environments presents a number of opportunities as well as challenges, especially for diverse user populations. They can enhance the mobility of workers and, subject to their design, offer access to people with disability and contribute significantly to tackling existing barriers in employment and social inclusion. At present, a number of web-based work environments have been developed; nonetheless, they hardly reach people with disability due to their low conformance with Web accessibility principles. One of the reasons why incorporating accessibility in online environments remains elusive for most Web service providers is that it is difficult for them to choose among the alternative approaches. This paper examines two different approaches of Web accessibility engineering from a provider\u2019s perceptive and in relation to the resources required in each case. In the first approach, interfaces are made accessible by design, whereas the second approach involves the use of \u201cfilter and transformation tools\u201d as a means to transform existing non-accessible interfaces into ones that comply with de facto Web accessibility recommendations. Based on the authors\u2019 experience and hands-on practice on both approaches gained in the context of several European and national projects and through the development of fifteen accessible online tools in total, a study was conducted to examine the cost effectiveness of each approach. As a result, a set of practical guidelines are offered here for assisting web service providers in identifying the most appropriate approach with regards to the different needs of any given \u2026",

Games in general, and technologically augmented games in particular, can play a fundamental role in this process. This paper introduces the design, implementation and deployment of a new version of the popular Tower Game integrated within an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) simulation space, based on knowledge stemming from the processes and theories used in occupational therapy. An augmented interactive table and a three-dimensional avatar are employed in order to extend the purpose and objectives of the game, so that its applicability expands to the age group of preschool children from 3 to 6 years old. Various augmented artifacts, such as force-pressure sensitive interactive surface, and augmented pen, and a digital dice are integrated in the environment, aiming to enhance children\u2019s play experience.

            "Abstract": "Web services are an emerging technology which has attracted much attention from both the research and the industry sectors in recent years. The exploitation of web services as components in web applications facilitates development and supports applications interoperability, regardless of the programming language and platform used. However, existing web services development standards do not take into account the fact that the provided content and the interactive functionality should be accessible to, and easily operable by, people with disabilities. This paper presents a platform named myWebAccess, which provides a mechanism for the semi-automated \"repair\" of web services' interaction characteristics in order to support the automatic generation of interface elements that conform to the de facto standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. myWebAccess enhances interaction quality for specific target user groups, including people with visual and motor disabilities, and supports the use of web services on diverse platforms (e.g., mobile phones equipped with a browser). The users of myWebAccess can create a personalized environment containing their favourite services, and can interact with them through interfaces appropriate to their specific individual characteristics.",

This concept is of particular importance in a quickly changing world, in order to keep pace with innovation. A concept to adapt all products and services for those who cannot operate it is costly, time consuming and may lead to discrimination. It is further a more economic strategy to design and produce for as many as possible.

            "Abstract": "Play is a voluntary activity in which individuals involve for pleasure. It is very important for children because through playing they learn to explore, develop and master physical and social skills. Play development is part of the child\u2019s growth and maturation process since birth. As such, it is widely used in the context of Occupational Therapy (OT). Occupational therapists use activity analysis to shape play activities for therapeutic use and promote an environment where the child can approach various activities while playing. This paper builds on knowledge stemming from the processes and theories used in OT and activity analysis to present the design, implementation and deployment of a new version of the popular farm game as deployed within an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) simulation space. Within this space, an augmented interactive table and a three-dimensional avatar are employed to extend the purpose and objectives of the game, thus also expanding its applicability to the age group of preschool children from 3 to 6 years old. More importantly, through the environment, the game monitors and follows the progress of each young player, adapts accordingly and provides important information regarding the abilities and skills of the child and their development over time. The developed game was evaluated through a small scale study with children of the aforementioned age groups, their parents, and child care professionals. The outcomes of the evaluation were positive for all target groups and provided significant evidence regarding its potential to offer novel play experience to children, but also act as a valuable tool to child care professionals.",

The collection of widgets incorporates both common basic widgets (eg, buttons, images) and mini interfaces frequently used in educational applications, as ready-to-use modules. The designer can either (i) combine and customize widgets from both categories to build an interface just once, or (ii) build and incorporate it as a custom-made mini interface in the collection for future reuse \u2026",

The prototype was developed in the context of the IST-funded project WARD-INHAND and implements a PDA version of a ward information system. The evaluation, carried out by the IS4ALL project, was based on a usage scenario comprising mock-ups and textual descriptions of the typical tasks of the system. Although the evaluation revealed a range of usability issues to be addressed, in this paper we consider only those which feature prominent in the vast majority of PDA-based applications, such as adaptability, individualisation, user profiling, alternative dialogue styles, localisation, etc., and propose design solutions of general purpose, as a basis for improved design practice.",

Indeed, from a social perspective, considerable interest in examining the influences of Social Computing (SC) for Social Inclusion (SI) arises from researchers and designers. This paper addresses the existing literature on the use of SC for SI. Previous studies have been reviewed to report affordances of SC design in five different areas: (a) for the elderly, (b) for people with disabilities, (c) for gender studies, (d) for societal change, and (e) for the preservation of cultural heritage. Results from the literature overview provide some examples of applications of new technologies that were designed to reduce social exclusion.

            "Abstract": "This paper discusses technology acceptance in the context of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments. Determining what would make a technology acceptable by users was widely recognized as a significant field of research since the seventies. Ever since several models have been developed, while recent advances in technology have led to increased research interest in assessing technology acceptance in a variety of domains. This has resulted in a plethora of studies and an extensive number of parameters that can be considered important towards predicting the acceptance of a given technology by its target audience. An important concern is how to practically employ these models for the assessment of AmI environments, given their high complexity and the wide range of potential contexts and target users. To this end, this paper carries out a review of the most important models and their evolution over time, as well as a review of studies extending these models in a variety of domains beyond the workplace. Furthermore, a classification of the parameters studied across these models is carried out, identifying a common feature across existing technology acceptance studies, namely that all assessments are based on self-reported metrics. This highlights the need for a synergistic evaluation approach, where assessment will move beyond self-reported or observed metrics and will be supported and assisted by the AmI environment itself.",

The interaction may involve human-to-agent, agent-to-environment or agent-to-agent communication. The framework supports alternative roles for the virtual agents who may act as assistants for existing systems, standalone \u201capplications\u201d or even as integral parts of emerging smart environments.

            "Abstract": "Guidelines constitute a popular means of providing input for human factors design in the development of interactive computer-based products and services. In the mainstream human computer interaction (HCI) field, they have been in use for a number of years and have contributed substantially to the development of a human factors culture within commercial organisations and institutions. In the field of assistive technology, guidelines provide a consolidated body of knowledge reflecting the design of suitable computer access systems. Today, much of the accessibility work is based on general or contextspecific guidelines developed from experience, practice and, sometimes, experimentation.",

Towards reaching a successful and cost effective realization of this vision, it is critical to ensure that the future interface development tools provide all the necessary instrumentation to support inclusive design, i.e. facilitate inclusive development. In the meantime, it is crucial that both tool developers and interface developers acquire awareness regarding the key development features they should pursue when investigating for the most appropriate software engineering support in addressing such a largely demanding development goal (i.e. universally accessible interactions).

The identification and analysis of functional and non-functional requirements related to different life-cycle phases provide designers with appropriate clues for improving the usability and ultimately the acceptability of a Digital Library under design. This paper presents a generic usage life-cycle model for Digital Libraries, as well as a preliminary validation of the model based on the results of an empirical surveybased analysis of user requirements. The derived conclusions are that three main lifecycle phases (usage patterns) can be preliminary distinguished based on the correlation between user demographics such as usage experience and frequency and duration of use, and variations of users\u2019 interest in functional and non-functional requirements. These three phases can be characterised as exploration in width, occasional (but long term) use and exploration in depth of a Digital Library user interface and content. The practical impact of the derived conclusions on the design of user interfaces of Digital Libraries is briefly discussed leading to indications for future work needed.",

This chapter is concerned with adaptations intended to address the former objective, as this has been relatively unexplored by recent efforts addressing user interface adaptations. In particular, recent research on user interface adaptation has concentrated either on the dynamic modification of dialogue characteristics during user\u2014computer interaction (adaptivity), or on the provision of services through which the user can custom-ize the interactive application while using it (adaptability'). Adaptive system capabilities are typically supported by dedicated tools referred to as user-modeling components (see chap. 14, this volume), such as BGP-MS (Kobsa & Pohl, 1995), the um toolkit (Kay, 1995), and so on, or user-modeling servers (Orwant, 1995), which maintain assumptions about the user and \u2026",

The diversity of the potential artifacts introduces additional interaction challenges, stemming from the cross-device migration of the available applications, and outlines the need for a unified working environment for students. This work introduces CognitOS, a web-based application host that instantiates a common Look \u2018n\u2019Feel across the available artifacts, thus transforming the classroom into a unified environment rather than a group of isolated units. Additionally, leveraging on the ability of Attention-aware Intelligent Classrooms to identify unmotivated, tired or distracted students, CognitOS is able to intervene to draw the educator\u2019s attention in problematic situations, and re-engage the students in the educational process. This work describes CognitOS both as an application and an intervention host, and reports the usability findings of a heuristic evaluation experiment conducted by five user experience experts.",

            "Abstract": "Traditionally, adaptive behaviour in human-computer interaction was largely assigned to the human partner, as computer systems did not embody the required sophistication to identify the need for and subsequently implement adaptive behaviour during interaction. As a result, the hu-man operator was required to compensate for the shortcomings of the computer system behaviour and to exhibit the capabilities necessary to accomplish the required tasks. With the emergence of graphical user interfaces, there has been a wide proliferation of lexical technologies incorporating advanced multimedia interaction facilities, novel input/output devices and multi-modal interaction techniques. This has contributed to an ever increasing number of computer users, characterized by their diverse abilities, requirements and preferences. Additionally, the paradigm of usage is pro-gressively shifting from professional/business desktop use to communication-intensive nomadic use. Moreover, the tasks humans have to perform with interactive computer systems have substan-tially changed in structure and content: They have become more complex and knowledgedemanding.In the context of the emerging information society, there is a compelling need for comprehen-sive support for accessible and high-quality user interfaces. At the core of these two new usability goals is a revised notion of adaptation, according to which user interfaces adapt to different users, different platforms and different styles of interaction. To achieve these goals, the concept of user interfaces for all has been proposed following the principles of \u201cdesign for all\u201d and \u201cuniversal accessibility\u201d. The \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The continuous growth of the older population in Europe and the progressive ageing of society worldwide bring about the need for new technological solutions for improving the health, independent living, quality of life and active ageing of older citizens in the Information Society. Quality of life and active aging of elderly people is becoming an essential objective for today\u2019s European societies. In this scope, the term \u201cAmbient Assisted Living\u201d (AAL) is used to refer to the meaningful usage of information and communication technologies, in a way that they can improve the quality of life of older people by offering them safety and comfort to live longer at home and prologue their independence. Many studies have been carried out about empowering the elderly in AAL environments, concerning the aspects of facilitating everyday living, addressing medical conditions and taking appropriate actions in emergency situations. However, an equally important aspect of the elderly's lives is their active engagement in their surrounding environment and this implies interacting with different types of technology.Robotic platforms have been around for quite some time since researchers have been trying to overcome essential problems that are related to the nature of robotics and their usage in domestic environments. Successful integration of robotic platforms in a domestic environment has been the result of multidisciplinary efforts from various scientific fields ranging from computer vision to machine learning and information systems.

These clusters are subsequently mapped onto a set of implementation mechanisms and related functional properties, which should be embedded within user interface tools in orderto facilitate the development of Unified User| nter-faces. For each mechanism, we provide a review of the support offered by existing user interface software tools. The analysis identifies strong and weakpoints in existing user interface development tools and points out several future research areas, where additional findings are required in order to provide comprehensive support for the development of Unified User Interfaces.In chapter 19 of this volume, a unified user interface has been defined as an interactive system, which encapsulates alternative (user-and use-adapted) interactive behaviors into a single software implementation. By implication, a unified user interface exhibits the following properties:(a) it encompasses alternative implemented dialogue patterns, depicting alternatives within the design space;(b) it possesses the capability to automatically select the most suitable dialogue pattern based on user-and context-oriented information (ie, task-, user-, and use-specific); and (c) it realizes physical dialogue patterns in ways that are not bound to particular interaction platforms (eg, by \u201clinking\u201d to, rather than directly \u201ccalling\u201d an interaction platform).

For maximum educational efficiency, extensiveness and adaptation to the needs of their users, AmI systems in education need to be easily programmable. Considering that their users are primarily non-computer professionals, giving them the ability to program those environments is a task difficult by itself, as those environments are of high architectural and computational complexity. In addition, it is of high importance that those environments work as expected, making the testing and the validation of their behavioral aspects a crucial part of the development process. In this paper, we propose AmITest, a framework that effectively allows the testing and the validation of behavioral programs written by users in a simple, yet direct and effective way. AmITest is part of a complete end-user development suite named AmIClass, which allows the effective programming of AmI educational environments by non-computer professionals.",

This new user interface design method has been developed to enable the\" fusion\u201d of different design alternatives, resulting from the consideration of differing end-user attributes and contexts of use, into a single unified form, as well as to provide a design structure which can be easily translated into a target implementation by user interface developers. The Unified User Interface design method is elaborated here in terms of its primary objective, underlying process, techniques used, representation, and overall contributions to Human-Computer Interaction design.In its short history, human-computer interaction (HCI) has accumulated a substantial body of knowledge that provides insight into the design of user interfaces. There is an abundance of design techniques that differ with regard to at least two dimensions, namely (a) the underlying science base and (b) the type, range, and scope of design outcomes, as well as the feedback they offer into the (re) design process. Regarding the science base, there are techniques, such the hierarchical task decomposition (P. Johnson, H. Johnson, Waddington, & Shouls, 1988), which are influenced by the human factors evaluation view of information-processing psychology, and others, such as goals, operators, methods, and selection rules\u2014GOMS (Card, PT Moran, & Newell, 1983), task-action grammar_TAG (Payne, 1984), the user-action notation-UAN (Hartson, Siochi, & Hix, 1990), and so on, that adopt the methodological perspectives and assumptions of cogni-tive science.

            "Abstract": "The Information Society is bringing about radical changes in the way people work and interact with each other and with information. In contrast to previous information processing paradigms, where the vast majority of computer-mediated tasks were business-oriented and executed by office workers using the personal computer in its various forms (ie, initially alphanumeric terminals and later on graphical user interfaces), the Information Society signifies a growth not only in the range and scope of the tasks, but also in the way in which they are carried out and experienced. To address the resulting dimensions of diversity, the notion of universal access is critically important. Universal access implies the accessibility and usability of Information Society technologies by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Universal access aims to enable equitable access and active participation of potentially all citizens in existing and emerging computer-mediated human activities by developing universally accessible and usable products and services, which are capable of accommodating individual user requirements in different contexts of use and independently of location, target machine, or run-time environment. In the context of the emerging Information Society, universal access becomes predominantly an issue of design, pointing to the compelling need for devising systematic and cost-effective approaches to designing systems that accommodate the requirements of the widest possible range of end-users. Recent developments have emphasized the need to consolidate progress by means of establishing a common vocabulary and a code of design practice, which \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The increased importance of user-interface design methodologies, techniques, and tools in the context of the development and evolution of the Information Society has been widely recognized in recent years in the light of the profound impact that interactive technologies are progressively acquiring on individuals\u2019 lives and activities and of the difficulty in developing usable and attractive interactive products and services (eg, Winograd, 2001; Winograd, Bennett, De Young, & Hartfield, 1996). As the Information Society develops further, the issue of user-interface design becomes even more prominent when considering the notions of universal access (Stephanidis, 2001b) and universal usability (Shneiderman, 2000), aiming at the provision of access to anyone, from anywhere and at anytime, through a variety of computing platforms and devices, to diverse products and services. Design for Universal Access in the Information Society has been defined in recent research efforts as design for diversity (Stephanidis, 2001b), and methods, techniques, and codes of practice have been proposed that enable to proactively take into account and appropriately address diversity of users, contexts of use, and technological platforms in the design of interactive artifacts. One of the main concepts proposed in such a context is that of intelligent user-interface adaptation (Stephanidis, 2001b). In a Universal Access perspective, adaptation needs to be \u201cdesigned into\u201d the system rather than decided upon and implemented a posteriori, implying that the outcome of the design process is not a \u201csingular\u201d design but a design space populated with appropriate alternatives \u2026",

It is shown that out of the broad range of available evaluation techniques, only afewcan be applied in the context of adaptable and adaptive user interfaces. The basic qualification criterion, which classifies a technique as being appropriate, is the degree to which it offers the constructs to assess situational and context-specific aspects of user interface adaptations, thus determining its usefulness in a social context.

The objectives of the study were to assess the prototype\u2019s usability, and to further elaborate on the concept and the potential functionality offered by Virtual Prints. The evaluation was carried out using both immersive and non-immersive systems, and was based on a sequence of evaluation methods including expert-based review, cooperative evaluation (ie, including both experts and users), and user-based tests. The paper briefly introduces the reader to the concept of Virtual Prints and presents the employed approach and the tools used. Then, an overview of the findings of the study, both qualitative and quantitative, is provided along with the related emerging challenges for the future. The paper concludes with a critical review of the approach that was followed, providing insights on the methods and tools used, as well as on the study results and their impact on the improvement of Virtual Prints..",

In this paradigm, applications are required to continuously follow end users and provide high-quality interaction while migrating among different computing devices and dynamically utilizing the available input/output (I/O) resources of each device. In the context of such interaction scenarios, the principle of continuity, which emphasizes the uninterrupted sequence of dialogue activities, is put forward as a key design goal. This paper presents an application experiment demonstrating interface migration, distributed I/O control, and dynamic I/O reconfiguration. The adopted dialogue design approach is discussed, along with the identified interaction design requirements, from the perspective of dialogue continuity \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This article proposes and describes activity-oriented design environments (AODEs) as an integrated design platform for building consensus in the context of human-computer interaction (HCI) design activities. Principles and architectural properties of AODEs are illustrated by means of a reference scenario from the domain of accessibility. To this effect, a research prototype of an AODE is presented as a means to validate the proposition made. The research prototype integrates alternative design perspectives (e.g., user modeling, analytical HCI design, argumentation and critiquing) into an extensible design platform of interoperable computational modules to implement a method toward accessibility, which is best suited to specification-oriented user interface development practices. Using the reference scenario, this article describes how the prototype AODE facilitates a seamless bridge between design and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Game design process creates goals, rules, and challenges to define a game that produces desirable interactions among its participants. Modeling the way in which players interact with the game requires among others the definition of game rules, plot, connection between player and the game, etc. ACTA (ACTivity Analysis) is a general purpose finite state machine (FSM) description language for rapid prototyping of smart games. ACTA facilitates smart game design by intervention professionals who are not familiar with traditional programming languages. Professionals are able to model the game\u2019s logic and interaction using a straightforward and intuitive notation which can be customized for every different game. In order to support a customized scripting vocabulary, a reflection-oriented model was adopted allowing dynamic linking between ACTA generated rules and multiple data types. Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) is the \u201cglue layer\u201d connecting ACTA\u2019s scripting vocabulary with the application internals. Moreover, developers can use ACTA not only for developing event-driven sequential logic games, but also for applications of behavior composed of a finite number of states, transitions between those states and actions, as well as for applications based on rules driven workflows. As a case study illustrating the usefulness and benefits of ACTA, a body posture imitation game, called Mimesis game, was developed based on occupational therapy expertise and practice.",

Additionally, MAID is accompanied by a library of adaptable widgets \u2013 primitives and complex \u2013 that allow designers to develop the actual user interfaces used by the MAID framework, eliminating thus the need for developers to be experts in user interface design and accessibility, in order to implement dynamic applications.",

            "Abstract": "Designing on the basis of varying design parameters means that alternative design artifacts may need to be employed for different parameter values. In such situations, the potentially broad range of different parameter values renders impractical the production of distinct design versions. Consequently, there is a need for a design process which is capable of managing diversity within the design act itself. This paper presents the unified design process, which addresses systematically the management of design alternatives, by providing a framework for unifying diverging design decisions, based on the fundamental notion of design polymorphism. The Unified Design Method has been recently proposed and applied in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for the purpose of achieving universal access, and in particular for the design of interfaces capable of self-adapting to individual users and usage-contexts. The discussion in this paper will be based on the findings of recent research and development work, while some important issues for future research will be also addressed.",

Subsequently, the basic software components of the Unified User Interface architecture are described in terms of their functional role and communication patterns establishing the details of information flow through these components, in order to perform user-and usage context-oriented adaptation.",

The techniques are intended to bridge across design reflection and envisioning of new practices through use cases. They foster an exploratory approach to design, progressively leading to an understanding of the global execution context of tasks, thus towards universal access. In this paper, we elaborate on the rationale and basic concepts behind scenario screening and growth scenarios, and discuss their application in a small case study in the domain of Health Telematics.",

            "Abstract": "Today, many forms of art are influenced by the emergence of interactive technologies, including the mixing of physical media with digital technology for forming new hybrid works of art and the usage of mobile phones to create art projected on public spaces. Many artists and painters use digital technology to augment their work creatively and technically. Many believe that the time of transition from traditional analogue art to postmodern digital art that is, to an art grounded in codes rather than images has arrived*. The research work described in this paper contributes towards supporting, through the use of Ambient Intelligence technologies, traditional painters\u2019 creativity, as well as methods and techniques of art masters. The paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of an intelligent environment and its software infrastructure, to form a digitally augmented Art Workshop. Its practical deployment was conducted in an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) simulation space and four feasibility studies were conducted. In each of these studies an oil painting was created following an alternative, yet accredited by artists, approach. The workshop was also evaluated with the involvement of real users and artists in the context of a user based usability study.",

Programming the behavior of Smart Environments not only enables designers to create innovative interactive experiences for intelligent spaces, but also empowers their inhabitants to tailor the intelligent facilities according to their preferences. To that end, this paper presents the AmI-Solertis system that offers a complete suite of tools allowing management, programming, testing, and monitoring of all the individual artifacts (i.e., services, hardware modules, software components, etc.) of a Smart Environment, but also of the environment itself as a whole. In more details, it introduces a REST-based communication middleware that streamlines synchronous and asynchronous remote services usage. Moreover, it presents the AmI-Solertis web-IDE that aims to support users who wish to create, explore \u2026",
