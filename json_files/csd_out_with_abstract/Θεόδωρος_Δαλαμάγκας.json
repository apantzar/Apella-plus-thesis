However, the wide range of literature in life sciences, raises a barrier in extracting useful information from them. MirPub is a search engine that resolves this issue, providing lists of articles related to particular miRNA terms and useful filters to customise them. In this work, we extend mirPub by utilising publication ranking methods to provide insights about the importance of each publication. Moreover, we automatically identify the species referred to in each publication to serve researchers studying particular species.",

            "Abstract": "In the dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT), a set of transportation requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles. We use two cost metrics that capture both the company\u2019s and the customer\u2019s viewpoints regarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems, the rule of thumb is to apply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solution based on a graph-based formulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly, in this conceptual graph, the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to that of the delivery location. However, we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-like algorithms cannot be applied. Still, our method is able to find dPDPT solutions significantly faster than a conventional two-phase \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) provide a natural way to represent various relationships between entities of different types, thus they are valuable in many domains. Analysing and extracting knowledge from HINs typically relies on the concept of metapaths, which are paths in the network schema denoting relations of different semantics among entities. Moreover, real-world HINs are often extremely large, containing millions of nodes and edges. Therefore, exploring and analysing HINs not only requires interdisciplinary expertise, being able both to interpret and select appropriate metapaths in the network, but also to run the analysis in an efficient and scalable manner. However, there is a lack of tools to facilitate this task. To fill this gap, we present SciNeM, an open source, publicly available, scalable analysis tool for metapath-based knowledge discovery in HINs.",

In this paper, we present a method for semantically querying tree-structured data sources using partially specified tree patterns. Based on dimensions which are sets of semantically related nodes in tree structures, we define dimension graphs. Dimension graphs can be automatically extracted from trees and abstract their structural information. They are semantically rich constructs that support the formulation of queries and their efficient evaluation. We design a tree-pattern query language to query multiple tree-structured data sources.

Given two nodes s and t in a graph, we want to find a path from s to t. To this end, we propose a novel representation of a graph as a set of paths that preserve the reachability information and introduce P-Index to index and provide efficient access in this representation. Then, we extend the depth-first search algorithm to work with the paths of the representation, instead of the graph edges, for evaluating \u201cfind a path\u201d reachability queries. Finally, we conduct a preliminary set of experiments that indicate the advantage of exploiting a set of paths for efficiently answering \u201cfind a path\u201d reachability queries instead of using the edges of the graph.",

            "Abstract": "Motivation: miRNA functional enrichment is a type of analysis that is used to predict which biological functions may be affected by a group of miRNAs or validate whether a list of dysreg- ulated miRNAs are linked to a diseased state. The standard method for functional enrichment analysis uses the hypergeometric distribution to produce p-values, depicting the strength of the association between a group of miRNAs and a biological function. However, in 2015, it was shown that this approach suffers from a bias related to miRNA targets produced by target prediction algorithms and a new randomization test was proposed. Results: In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of another underlying bias which affects gene annotation data sets; additionally, we show that the statistical measure used for the estab- lished randomization test is not sensitive enough to account for it. For this reason, we propose the use of an alternative statistical measure, the \"two-sided overlap\", and we show that it is able to alleviate the aforementioned issue. Finally, we develop BUFET2, a miRNA enrichment analysis tool that leverages this measure (along with the old one); it is based on BUFET, a fast and scalable implementation of the established randomization test. Availability and Implementation: BUFET2 is written in C++ and is packaged with a Python wrapper script that facilitates experiment execution. Moreover, BUFET2 also comes pre-packaged in a Linux Docker image published on Docker Hub, thus eliminating the need for code compilation. Finally, BUFET2 is also publicly available to execute through a REST API. All datasets used in the experiments throught this \u2026",

An alternative approach, known as randomization tests, was introduced to alleviate this issue, however, such tests are computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce two novel indexing approaches that exploit frequently occurring patterns in classifications to avoid performing redundant computations during the analysis. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments using real datasets and application scenarios to show that our approaches always outperform the state-of-the-art, with one approach being faster by an order of magnitude.",

We exploit user feedback in terms of click data to cluster ranking models for historic queries according to user behavior and intent. Each cluster is finally represented by a single ranking model that captures the contained search interests expressed by users. Once new queries are issued, these are mapped to the clustering and the retrieval process diversifies possible intents by combining relevant ranking functions.

This paper presents a framework for clustering XML documents by structure.

In this paper, we present Captain Nemo, a fully-functionable metasearch engine that exploits personal user search spaces. Users can define their personal retrieval model and presentation style. They can also define topics of interest. Captain Nemo exploits several popular Web search engines to retrieve Web pages relevant to keywords given by the users. The resulting pages are presented according to the defined presentation style and retrieval model. For every page, Captain Nemo can recommend a relevant topic of interest to classify the page, exploiting nearest-neighbour classification techniques.",

In this work, we introduce an important class of such problems, the approximate regional sequence matching (ARSM) problem. Given a data and a pattern sequence, an ARSM result is an approximate occurrence of a region of the pattern in the data sequence under two conditions. First, the region must contain a predetermined area of the pattern sequence, termed core. Second, the allowable deviation between the region of the pattern and its occurrence in the data sequence depends on the length of the region. We propose the PS-ARSM method that processes holistically the regions of a pattern, taking advantage of their overlaps to efficiently identify the ARSM results. Its performance is evaluated with respect to existing techniques adapted to the ARSM problem.",

Accurate identification of miRNA targets is crucial to understanding their function. Currently, hundreds of thousands of miRNA:gene interactions have been experimentally identified.

DIANA-TarBase was initially released in 2006 and it was the first database aiming to catalog published experimentally validated miRNA:gene interactions. DIANA-TarBase v7.0 (http://www.microrna.gr/tarbase) aims to provide for the first time hundreds of thousands of high-quality manually curated experimentally validated miRNA:gene interactions, enhanced with detailed meta-data.

Querying capabilities are provided through tree-pattern queries. The need for querying tree-structured data sources when their structure is not fully known, and the need to integrate multiple data sources with different tree structures have driven, recently, the suggestion of query languages that relax the complete specification of a tree pattern. In this paper, we use a query language which allows partial tree-pattern queries (PTPQs). The structure in a PTPQ can be flexibly specified fully, partially or not at all. To evaluate a PTPQ, we exploit index graphs which generate an equivalent set of\" complete\" tree-pattern queries. In order to process PTPQs, we need to efficiently solve the PTPQ satisfiability and containment problems. These problems become more complex in the context of PTPQs \u2026",

Since many important diseases are related to the expression or non-expression of particular genes, knowing the miRNAs that affect these genes can help in finding possible treatments. In the last decade, a large amount of experimental studies trying to reveal the targets of several miRNAs has been published. A handful of curated databases that collect miRNA targets from the literature have been developed to make this information more easily available. However, due to the large number of existing published articles, maintaining these databases up-to-date is a tedious task that requires important resources. In this work we introduce TarMiner, a pipeline for automatic extraction of miRNA targets that can facilitate the curation process of databases that maintain miRNA validated targets.",

These query languages correspond to a fragment of XPath larger than TPQs for which efficient non-main-memory evaluation algorithms are not known.In this paper, we consider a query language, called Partial Tree-Pattern Query (PTPQ) language, which generalizes and strictly contains TPQs.

Up to now, portal catalogs have not been treated as full-fledged objects so as to allow for their manipulation. A major challenge is thus to complement catalog search and browsing with operations that manipulate structural information from similar vertical portal catalog sites, that is sites of a specific subject or domain.This work proposes models and operators that allow for structural manipulation of vertical portal catalog sites, considering them as first-class citizens in the information search space. First, we explore the algebraic properties of trees representing hierarchies of portal catalogs, and define a lattice algebraic structure on them. Then, turning this structure into a boolean algebra, we present the operators S-union, S-intersection and S-difference to support structural manipulation of such trees. These operators have certain algebraic properties to provide clear semantics and assist the transformation, simplification and optimization of sequences of operations, using laws similar to those of set theory. Finally, we identify the conditions under which this framework is applicable.",

The objective is to support decentralized sharing of data and services in a network of autonomous and heterogeneous DL nodes. P2P DLs can operate without a central coordination and offer important advantages such as a very dynamic environment where peers can join and leave the network at any time, while the network can scale up to a large number of peers. The advanced structuring and retrieval functionality of peers poses new challenges in query routing and processing over autonomous, distributed and dynamic networks of DL. The paper considers two fundamental aspects of P2P Digital Libraries (P2P DLs): query routing and processing. Specifically, we design and implement effective and efficient query routing in P2P DLs, exploiting intensional indexing of DL node views. Also, we study interleaved query routing and processing algorithms in P2P DLs to produce as quickly as possible the first query results.",

In order to exploit ontologies as a means to provide semantics to the data it is necessary not only to reason about concepts and their properties but also to be able to query the underlying data and efficiently obtain answers. We view ontologies as conceptual schemas that are populated with data. We define a generic graph-based representation for ontology schemas and provide a language for querying ontologies. This language is appropriate for ontology transformation and ontology integration. We show how ontologies can be integrated by defining views over multiple ontologies, and how user queries can be specified using views. Our approach can be easily implemented on top of a relational database management system.",

            "Abstract": "Estimating the expected impact of an article is valuable for various applications (e.g., article/cooperator recommendation). Most existing approaches attempt to predict the exact number of citations each article will receive in the near future, however this is a difficult regression analysis problem. Moreover, most approaches rely on the existence of rich metadata for each article, a requirement that cannot be adequately fulfilled for a large number of them. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that solving a simpler machine learning problem, that of classifying articles based on their expected impact, is adequate for many real world applications and we propose a simplified model that can be trained using minimal article metadata. Finally, we examine various configurations of this model and evaluate their effectiveness in solving the aforementioned classification problem.",

Members in those communities should be able to pose queries and gather results from all data sources in the network, where available. At the same time, data sources should have limited restrictions on how to organize their data. If a global schema is not available for such a network, query processing is strongly based on the existence of (hard to maintain) mapping rules between pairs of data sources. If a global schema is available, local schemas of data sources have to follow strict modelling restrictions posed by that schema.In this paper, we suggest an architecture to provide better support for distributed data management in loosely coupled data sources. In our approach, data sources can maintain diverse schemas. No explicit mapping rules between data sources are needed to facilitate query processing. Data sources can join \u2026",

DIANA-microT 3.0 is an algorithm for microRNA target prediction which is based on several parameters calculated individually for each microRNA and combines conserved and non-conserved microRNA recognition elements into a final prediction score, which correlates with protein production fold change.

Based on this viewpoint, we survey certain state-of-the-art tools from geometric and statistical computing in order to handle important and difficult problems in digital finance. Although our tools are quite general, in this paper we focus on two specific questions. The first concerns crisis detection, which is of prime interest for the public in general and for policy makers in particular because of the significant impact that crises have on the economy. Certain features in stock markets lead to this type of anomaly detection: Given the assets' returns, we describe the relationship between portfolios' return and volatility by means of a copula, without making any assumption on investor strategies. We examine a recent method relying on copulae to construct an appropriate indicator that allows us to automate crisis detection. On real data, the indicator detects all past crashes in the cryptocurrency market, whereas from the DJ600-Europe index, from 1990 to 2008, the indicator identifies correctly 4 crises and issues one false positive for which we offer an explanation. Our second contribution is to introduce an original computational framework to model asset allocation strategies, which is of independent interest for digital finance and its applications. Our approach addresses the crucial question of evaluating portfolio management, and is relevant to individual managers as well as financial institutions.

Existing algorithms for this operation focus almost exclusively on path patterns or tree patterns. Current applications of XML require querying of data whose structure is complex or is not fully known to the user, or integrating XML data sources with different structures. These applications have motivated recently the introduction of query languages that allow a partial specification of path patterns in a query. In this paper, we consider partial path queries, a generalization of path pattern queries, and we focus on their efficient evaluation under the indexed streaming evaluation model. Our approach explicitly deals with repeated labels (that is, multiple occurrences of the same label in a query). We show that partial path queries can be represented as rooted dags for which a topological ordering of the nodes exists \u2026",

In order to predict the involvement of microRNAs in biological functions many statistical approaches have been used that involve p-value calculations, with the most popular one being Fisher\u2019s exact test. However, it has been shown that data distribution does not match with any of the theoretical distributions used by the aforementioned approaches. Thus, an empirical randomization approach is preferred. Nevertheless, such analyses are computationally intensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach for microRNA enrichment analysis using Machine Learning techniques, in order to predict p-values instead of calculating them using randomization experiments.
