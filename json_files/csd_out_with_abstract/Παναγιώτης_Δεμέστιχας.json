            "Abstract": "An important issue in future cellular communication systems is the design of the interconnecting network of their access segment. This problem aims at finding the minimum-cost configuration of cell site switches (CSSs) and local exchanges (LEs) given the base transceiver station (BTS) layout. An extended version of the problem may also comprise the deployment of mobility and service control points-access (MSCPs-A), based on the assumption that CSSs and LEs are not fully capable of handling the logic of the cellular system. In this paper we solve the extended problem, under the additional assumption that the communication among the network elements is based on the ATM technique. The problem is formally defined, optimally formulated, and solved by computationally efficient heuristics. Finally, results are provided and subsequent conclusions are drawn.

The solutions proposed by SPEED-5G through extended dynamic spectrum access (eDSA) address traffic allocation over heterogeneous wireless technologies, better load balancing across available spectrum bands, and capacity boosting through aggregation of available resources while ensuring fair coexistence.

Multilayer traffic engineering mechanisms exploit this characteristic and perform traditional rerouting enriched with online IP logical topology reconfiguration. These mechanisms aim at optimizing resource usage and maximizing QoS, eg in terms of bandwidth, throughput and delay. Recently except from performance, energy efficiency in backbone core networks has gained much attention. In this article, we will examine how multilayer traffic engineering techniques can help to increase energy savings and minimize energy consumption. As we will present the simultaneous optimization of routing and minimization of the number of active network elements leads to significant energy savings. We will propose an adaptive algorithm for IP/MPLS/WDM with traffic grooming networks, which will aggregate traffic flows in the same LSPs and consequently in the same optical wavelengths. Additionally, this algorithm has the objective to reduce energy by switching off unused router line cards. In this way routing is optimized and the topology of IP layer is adapted to the variations of traffic in network. To achieve this, LSPs (links and optical channels) must be recomputed",

The burden imposed by the signaling operations supporting these services can severely degrade the system performance and lead to congestion problems in network equipment (switches, databases, gateways, etc.). Paging operations in a mobile cellular network are responsible for a large part of the signaling load and, therefore, the issue of how to conduct them efficiently becomes of critical importance. The key to its solution lies on the application of multiple-step paging schemes and on the \"proper\" planning of paging areas. We devise and solve a version of the paging area planning problem. In particular, we provide a low complexity algorithm capable of reducing the paging cost, at the price of a moderate increase in the call set-up delay.",

            "Abstract": "The evolution of wireless communications over the last years has resulted in a clear trend towards beyond third generation (B3G) systems, which support the co-existence and co-operation of multiple, diverse radio access technologies (RATs) in a common composite radio environment. The reconfigurability concept has been developed for facilitating B3G systems and enabling the seamless experience. Reconfigurability supports the B3G concept by providing equipment (terminals and network elements) with capabilities to dynamically select and adapt to the most appropriate RAT. Reconfigurability calls for enhanced equipment management and control functionality. The aim of this paper is to present a management and control system for reconfigurable equipment (MCS-RE) for enabling the realization of the seamless experience in a B3G context",

            "Abstract": "The objectives of the EndYtoYEnd Reconfigurability (E\u00f0R) research project are to bring the full benefits of the valuable diversity within the radio ecoYspace, composed of a wide range of systems (such as cellular, wireless local area and broadcast), and to devise, develop and trial architectural design of reconfigurable devices and supporting system functions to offer an expanded set of operational choices to the different actors of the value chain in the context of heterogeneous mobile radio systems. The E2R project will help operators to better exploit their investments on infrastructures and terminals and ensure that the infrastructure will be flexible and reconfigurable to accommodate evolving standards, applications and the endYuser needs. E2R is seen by many actors of the wireless industry as a core technology to enable the full potential of beyond 3G systems. It has the potential to revolutionize wireless just as the PC revolutionized computing. This paper presents the first results of the E2R project and the main fields of investigations and achievements across the different technical workpackages, following their start in January 2004.",

The management of traffic stands thus as a fundamental prerequisite for confronting those issues and enhancing transportation. This paper considers the concept of car pooling as a structured approach to this problem, by specifying, developing and validating a mobile-community-driven system for collaborative transportation, namely the \u201cTransportation Management-Car Pooling System\u201d. The system is capable of proposing optimal, reliable and secure community matches (taking into consideration personality features, talking interests, driving style, etc.), based on user profile and context information. The paper describes the Transportation Management-Car Pooling System, presenting its input parameters, decision making process and outcomes. Finally, indicative simulation results showcase its effectiveness.",

The so-called cognitive communications promise to offer fast and dependable handling of highly varying contexts and to boost resource utilization by offering intelligent resource assignment and operation. In order to achieve this goal, cognitive communications rely on knowledge, which is to be used by and/or shared between thoughtful (cognitive) devices and network elements. In most situations, knowledge needs to be built from the vast amount of raw data which stems from disparate sources including service, network and user/device domains. This is a complex task to accomplish, thus making advanced learning techniques indispensable for relaxing the complexity of the process and for building truly useful knowledge.The acquired knowledge can be then used to provide intelligent and qualitative decisions made by cognitive elements on resource usage and configuration. For instance, raw data generated by users/devices, services and networks can be combined with learning techniques in order to yield knowledge and provide answers to questions like the",

In particular, it goes through the basic features of cognitive networks and their operation principles. Then, it focuses on their management, by splitting the overall management process into some autonomous components, ie the context acquisition, the profiles management and the policy-based management. These components constitute the inputs to the adaptation process of cognitive infrastructures. The output lies in the configuration of the behavior of the infrastructure (or the mobile terminal). Last but not least, the knowledge features of the management approach components are outlined.In general, cognitive networking capabilities are a facilitator for the B3G vision, mostly targeting at the minimization of complexity associated with heterogeneous environments (and how they can be managed). To this effect, work on cognitive networks is ongoing and is believed to address even more innovative aspects during the coming years.",

Thus, networks need to be enhanced in order to deal with the increased traffic. In this study, the use of opportunistic networks (ONs) is studied. ONs are operator-governed, coordinated extensions of the infrastructure and are created dynamically for a limited time frame. The problem studied is the capacity extension of congested infrastructure via resource allocation to femtocells. More specifically, a macro base station (BS) is considered with deployed femtocells within its area. As soon as a problematic situation is discovered, the congested BS notifies the network management entity which will determine the solution method. In our case, a proportion of terminals that cause the congestion will be offloaded to the nearby femtocells relieving the macro BS. This is achieved through two approaches: a greedy algorithm that allocates the minimum possible power level to femtocells in order to acquire as much terminals as possible, and an energy-efficient algorithm that assigns the minimum possible power level to the femtocells that are required to cover specific terminals. Femtocells that are not needed are switched off.",

In this respect, the first objective of this paper is to discuss on the infrastructure-, application-, and business-driven motivation for the introduction of cognitive systems. A second objective is to introduce the basic engineering challenges for the successful introduction. The approach for presenting the motivations includes: (i) the basic features, and the consequent requirements for the management functionality, associated with the network infrastructure \u2026",

We exploit the great potentialities of opportunistic networks, which can be seen as operator-governed, temporary and probably infrastructure-less extensions of the infrastructure-based network, and we combine them with cognitive systems, both for managing the opportunistic networks and for coordinating with the infrastructure, through the use of control channels. This prototype implementation can show the merits of opportunistic networks in terms of enhanced service provision capabilities, higher resource utilization, lower transmission powers, and\" green\" network operation.",

The former assumes that different radio networks can be cooperating components in a heterogeneous wireless access infrastructure, through which network providers can more efficiently achieve the required capacity and QoS levels. Reconfigurability enables terminals and network elements to dynamically select and adapt to the most appropriate radio access technologies for handling conditions encountered in specific service area regions and time zones of the day. Both concepts pose new requirements on the management of wireless systems. This article presents a management system, which has been developed for enabling wireless systems to operate in a CR context.

            "Abstract": "As the first 5G networks are being deployed across the world, new services enabled by the superior performance of 5G in terms of throughput, latency and reliability are emerging. Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) services are perhaps among the most demanding applications that 5G networks will have to support and their deployment, performance and potential for improvement has been well investigated over the past few years. However, CAM operation in multi-operator environments and the inevitable inter-PLMN handover caused by the inherent mobility of CAM services have not been studied in length. Moreover, the multiple domains, multi-vendor components and inherent high mobility of the cross-border vehicular environment, introduce multiple challenges in terms of network management and dynamic slicing, making Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) solutions an attractive alternative for these environments. The work presented in this study attempts to analyse the requirements for cross-border CAM operation for the five main CAM use cases selected by 3GPP, based on input from key European stakeholders (Network Operators, vendors, Automotive Manufacturers etc.). A detailed analysis and categorization into four categories of the main challenges for cross-border CAM service provisioning is performed, namely Telecommunication, Application, Security/Privacy and Regulatory issues, while potential solutions based on existing and upcoming technological enablers are discussed for each of them. The role of standardization and relevant regulatory and administrative bodies is analysed, leading to insights \u2026",

This approach provides a useful categorization and an easy conceptual basis for their theoretical investigation, necessary for the deployment of advanced paging algorithms. Because of its suggested generality, the discussed framework is also laid as reference for further research. As modern networks evolve, more emphasis will be given towards optimization in all aspects of a network system.

Some of these initiatives pursued a holistic approach, while others focused on setting up functionalities for specific networking domains. These efforts did not succeed in being extensively deployed, because the goals of network operators were not satisfactorily met. These goals include unification of management operations, enablement of end\u2010to\u2010end management and enhancement of the overall system performance in a trusted way, while reducing management cost. In this paper, we analyse a set of existing autonomic management architectures and frameworks with respect to a selected set of criteria. We then identify missing parts and challenges and propose a framework to unify the most promising attributes towards a novel approach of realization of autonomic networking management.

The ANM and SDN paradigms, besides sharing a few common goals, have shown to be complementary to each other in terms of level of abstractions and expectations. In particular, we consider the Unified Management Framework (UMF) introduced in the FP7 UNIVERSELF project, which focuses on higher level self-* functionality, often assuming as given a fictional adaptation layer between such autonomics and the managed infrastructure. On the other hand, SDN architectures provide by design a uniform control substrate for the programmatic management of network resources through vendor-agnostic APIs.

            "Abstract": "Heterogeneous networks constitute a promising solution to the emerging challenges of 5G networks. According to the specific network architecture, a macro-cell base station (MBS) shares the same spectral resources with a number of small cell base stations (SBSs), resulting in increased co-channel interference (CCI). The efficient management of CCI has been studied extensively in the literature and various dynamic channel assignment (DCA) schemes have been proposed. However, the majority of these schemes consider a uniform approach for the users without taking into account the different quality requirements of each application. In this work, we propose an algorithm for enabling dynamic channel assignment in the 5G era that receives information about the interference and QoS levels and dynamically assigns the best channel. This algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithm. Results show an increase of performance, e.g., in terms of throughput and air interface latency. Finally, potential challenges and way forward are also discussed.",

On the other hand, cognitive features can be used to provide the system with knowledge that derives from past interactions with the environment. As a result, the system will be able to apply already known solutions in timely manner when identifying a problem that has been already addressed in the past.

Proposed control channels are conceived as an evolution of the already established cognitive pilot channel concept. As a result, new interfaces are discussed in order to convey information from the infrastructure to the terminals and vice versa or between terminals. Finally, the business benefits of the aforementioned approach are provided in order to strengthen the notion of the proposed control channels and consider future expansions.",

This large and dynamic availability of digital data is referred to as Big Data and is very promising in bringing forward new insights and knowledge. For obtaining these insights, the proper combination and processing of the data is required. However, the dynamicity and the increasing size of data start making their handling impossible for analysts and raise many concerns on the manner in which data will be processed from now on. Towards this direction, this paper proposes a tool that processes and combines disparate data in order to create insights regarding a future network load.

This paper presents the concept of Opportunistic Networks (ONs) as an energy efficient method to exploit wireless networks. The cases studied in this work comprise a macro base station and femtocells. The proposed solution will offload a proportion of the traffic of the base station to the femtocells, through the creation of an ON. Therefore, the base station will consume less energy since terminals will be rerouted to the femtocells. In addition, the femto-terminals will operate to lower power levels leading to battery savings. Results from simulations are provided to confirm the proposed solution.",

This paper starts from a transmitted-power allocation algorithm (TPAA) that considers a set of uplink transmissions, which should be supported by the system. In the sequel, the TPAA algorithm is used for training an Elman neural network, which, due to its internal characteristics, is applicable in the time critical context of power control. Simulations and numerical results are analysed for obtaining a solid basis for employing our scheme in the power control of CDMA systems.",

In this scheme, instead of rejecting users or degrading their quality of service levels, a network provider can direct them to an alternate radio technology that meets certain environmental, cost, and QoS criteria. To achieve such a system requires upgrading service and network resource management (SNRM). We present work areas for a new SNRM approach that comprises the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), high-performance wireless local area network (HiperLAN 2) technology, and terrestrial DVB (DVB-T) systems.",

            "Abstract": "5G networks will have to offer extremely high volumes of content, compared to those of today\u2019s. Moreover, they will have to support heterogeneous traffics, including machine-to-machine, generated by a massive volume of Internet-of-Things devices. Traffic demands will be variable in time and space. In this work, we argue that all this can be achieved in a cost-effective way if the network is flexible and reconfigurable. We present the Flex5Gware network architecture, designed to meet the above requirements. Moreover, we discuss the links between flexibility and reconfigurability, on the one side, and context awareness and content awareness, on the other; we show how two of the building blocks of the Flex5Gware architecture, namely on-the-fly MAC reconfiguration and dynamic multi-cell coordinated resource scheduling, can leverage context and content information to make reconfiguration decisions. Our evaluation, conducted by both prototyping and simulation, show that this brings significant benefits in terms of improved coexistence of heterogeneous access networks and reduced latency. We terminate our paper by discussing how the Flex5Gware architecture aims at influencing future system standardization and leveraging the benefits of some key 5G networking enablers described in the paper.",

For the management and control of operator-governed ONs the introduction of Cognitive Management Systems (CMSs), localized on the terminal and infrastructure side, is proposed.

            "Abstract": "The success of future generation networks will be driven by the provision of ubiquitous, personalized services that can offer an enhanced user experience. In order to support the provision of more and better services to users, and at the same time deal with the complexity of the infrastructure of network operators (NOs), advanced management functionality needs to be introduced in wireless systems, which will enable optimum, end-to-end operation. Numerous schemes for co-operative, reconfigurable and cognitive systems have been developed as a means for addressing many of the requirements of future networks. However, the vast majority of the corresponding implemented platforms and test beds are proprietary, custom solutions that focus only on some aspects of cognitive systems, e.g. on dynamic spectrum management capabilities.

This concept means that applications should be offered to users at the best possible Quality of Service (QoS) level, taking into account profile, context and policy information. The profiles provide the user requirements and preferences, the terminal capabilities, and the application requirements. The policies provide the objectives, constraints imposed by various stakeholders, for instance the network operator (NO). The context of operation designates relevant applications, available networks and their QoS capabilities. The \u201calways-best-connectivity\u201d concept can be achieved by directing user terminals to the most appropriate networks of the heterogeneous infrastructure of the NO. In this respect, advanced terminal management functionality is required. This paper presents management mechanisms for utility-based \u2026",

It will be characterized by powerful and complex network infrastructures, advanced applications, services and content, efficient power management as well as extensions in the business model. These characteristics entail that the management of the Future Internet world will be more complex, compared to today. The introduction of cognitive systems is believed to be an efficient response to the complexity. In this respect, the aims and contribution of this paper is to provide an approach for realizing the Future Internet era by means of cognitive systems. The basis and foundation will be work conducted in the area of cognitive wireless networks. This work constitutes a solid basis, on which the Future Internet era can be realized, through suitable expansions.",

            "Abstract": "The increased complexity of emerging and future networks and services requires the use of sophisticated but simplified management and control that will minimize the burden of human presence and manual operation. Autonomic network management (ANM), on the one hand, and software defined networking (SDN), on the other hand, have appeared with the promise to meet these requirements and enhance the efficiency of the control and operation of networks. These two emerging technologies share motivation and have confluent goals, e.g., increasing the reliability and efficiency of operation, simplifying network management and control, focusing on means for opening innovation and differentiation for vendors, and aiming at capital expenditures/operating expenditures (CAPEX/OPEX) reduction for providers.

            "Abstract": "This paper adopts the assumption that cellular, Broadband Fixed Wireless Access (BFWA) and DVB systems can be co-operating components of a composite-radio infrastructure. It is believed that through the composite radio concept operators will be enabled to offer very efficient, in terms of cost and Quality of Service (QoS), wireless access to broadband IP-based services. The exploitation of this infrastructure requires new service and network resource management functionality. In this context, this paper addresses a problem called Traffic Distribution in a Composite Radio Environment (TD-CRE). The paper includes a first approach to the definition, mathematical formulation and solution of a version of the TD-CRE problem.",
