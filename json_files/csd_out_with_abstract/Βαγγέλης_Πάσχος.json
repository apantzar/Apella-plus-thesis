We first show that the differential approximation ratio of the natural greedy algorithm for MIN SET COVER is bounded below by 1.365/\u0394 and above by 4/(\u0394+ 1), where \u0394 is the maximum set-cardinality in the MIN SET COVER-instance. Next, we study another approximation algorithm for MIN SET COVER that computes 2-optimal solutions, ie, solutions that cannot be improved by removing two sets belonging to them and adding another set not belonging to them. We prove that the differential approximation ratio of this second algorithm is bounded below by 2/(\u0394+ 1) and that this bound is tight. Finally, we study an approximation algorithm for MIN WEIGHTED SET COVER and provide a tight lower bound of 1/\u0394. Our results identically hold for MAX HYPERGRAPH INDEPENDENT SET in both the standard \u2026",

In the complexity theory case, algorithmic problems can be classified into three categories: 1) decision problems; 2) optimum value calculation problems; 3) optimization problems. The class NPO is the class of optimization problems for which the decisional variant is in NP. Therefore it is defined that the class PO of optimization problems for which the decisional variant belongs to the class P. In other words, PO is the class of problems that can be optimally solved in polynomial time. This chapter discusses the classic Karp reduction (for the class NP). It also discusses another reduction, known in the literature as the Turing reduction, which is better adapted to optimization problems. The chapter briefly presents a few supplementary complexity classes.",

In this context, we consider reductions for set covering and vertex covering hierarchies. Our results are then extended to hitting set and independent set hierarchies.

We also handle the case of split graphs. We show that probabilistic coloring is NP-hard, even under identical vertex-probabilities, that it is approximable by a polynomial time standard-approximation schema but existence of a fully a polynomial time standard-approximation schema is impossible, even for identical vertex-probabilities, unless P= NP.

A decision maker has to select which set, among the sets containing c, has to be put in the solution in order to cover the item. Such decision has to be taken before a new item arrives and is irrevocable. The problem consists in minimizing the number of chosen sets.

We define  natural reductions preserving approximation and prove completeness  results for the class of the NP optimization problems (class  NPO), as well as for DAPX, the differential counterpart of  APX, and for a natural subclass of DGLO, the differential  counterpart of GLO. We also define class 0-APX of the  NPO problems that are not differentially approximable within any ratio strictly greater than 0 unless P = NP. This  class is very natural for differential approximation, although has no  sense for the standard one. Finally, we prove the existence of hard problems  for a subclass of DPTAS, the differential counterpart of PTAS.",

We show that, if this running time could be significantly improved, the ETH would fail. For Max Minimal Vertex Cover we give a r-approximation in time 2 n/r. We match this with a similarly tight result. We also give a log\u2061 r-approximation for Min ATSP in time 2 n/r and an r-approximation for Max Grundy Coloring in time r n/r.

We present new approximation algorithms for several variants of the problem with respect to the class of the underlying graph. In particular, we deal with variants which either are known to be NP-hard (general and bipartite graphs) or are proven to be NP-hard in this paper (complete graphs with bi-valued edge weights) or their complexity question still remains open (trees).",

We also prove that any differential approximation algorithm for MAX minimal vertex cover can be transformed into a differential approximation algorithm for MIN kSAT achieving the same differential performance ratio. This leads us to study the differential approximability of MAX minimal vertex cover and MIN independent dominating set. Both of them are equivalent for the differential approximation.

This problem, when parameterized by k, can be easily shown to be W [2]-hard. Here, we settle the multiparameterized complexity of max k-set cover under pairs of parameters as max {k,\u2206}, where\u2206= maxi {| Si|} and max {k, f}, where f= maxi|{j| xi\u2208 Sj}|. We also study parameterized approximability of the problem with respect to parameters k and p. Then, we investigate some similar parameterizations of a satisfiability problem that is linked to max k-set cover in a sense explained in the paper. Finally, we sketch an enhancement of the classes of the W [\u00b7] hierarchy that seems more appropriate for showing completeness of cardinality constrained W [\u00b7]-hard problems.",

These problems can be seen as particular cases of set-covering. If the number of subgraphs is polynomial in the order n of the input-graph, then these problems can be approximated within logarithmic ratio by the classical greedy set-covering algorithm. We extend the class of problems approximable by this approach to covering problems where the number of candidate subgraphs is exponential in n, by revisiting an old technique called \u201cmaster-slave\u201d and extending it to weighted master or/and slave problems. Finally, we use the master-slave tool to prove some positive approximation results for two network-design and a VLSI-design graph-problems.",

The problem mentioned in the chapter is considerably simplified in the case of potential games. This family of games models covers a wide spectrum of problems in optimization; they always have pure Nash equilibria that coincide with local optima of their potential. The chapter focuses on Rosenthal's congestion model. The concept of non\u2010cooperative games, as formulated in the chapter, is sufficiently general to represent a vast family of games which, at first sight, do not fit this formulation. Indeed, several models of games, such as repeated games, stage games, games played by automata, or incomplete information games, can be reduced to this form with appropriate choices for the set of players, the strategies and the preferences.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we consider a robust version for STEINER TREE. Under it, the problem is defined in a two-stage setting over a complete weighted graph whose vertices are associated with a probability of presence in the second stage. A first-stage feasible solution on the input graph might become infeasible in the second stage, when certain vertices of the graph fail (with the specified probability). Therefore, a well defined modification strategy is devised which transforms a partial solution to a feasible second-stage solution. The objective is to devise an algorithm for the first-stage solution (sometimes called the a priori or anticipatory solution) so that the expected second-stage solution cost is minimized. An important feature of this framework is that the modification strategy is essentially a part of the problem, while algorithmic treatment is required in the construction of the anticipatory solution. We provide complexity and approximation results regarding a modification strategy based upon the well known depth-first-search algorithm.",

We first give some general properties dealing with the optimal solution. We then show that the unique 2-coloring achieves approximation ratio 2 in bipartite graphs under any system of vertex-probabilities and propose a polynomial algorithm achieving tight approximation ratio 8/7 under identical vertex-probabilities. Then we deal with restricted cases of bipartite graphs. Main results for these cases are the following. Under non-identical vertex-probabilities probabilistic coloring is polynomial for stars, for trees with bounded degree and a fixed number of distinct vertex-probabilities, and, consequently, also for paths with a fixed number of distinct vertex-probabilities. Under identical vertex-probabilities, probabilistic coloring is polynomial for paths, for even and odd cycles and for trees whose leaves are either at even or at odd levels. Next, we deal with split graphs and show that probabilistic coloring is NP-hard, even under identical vertex-probabilities. Finally, we study approximation in split graphs and provide a 2-approximation algorithm for the case of distinct probabilities and a polynomial time approximation schema under identical vertex-probabilities.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we focus on problems which do not admit a constant-factor approximation in polynomial time and explore how quickly their approximability improves as the allowed running time is gradually increased from polynomial to (sub-)exponential. We tackle a number of problems: For Min Independent Dominating Set, Max Induced Path, Forest and Tree, for any r(n), a simple, known scheme gives an approximation ratio of r in time roughly rn/r. We show that, for most values of r, if this running time could be significantly improved the ETH would fail. For Max Minimal Vertex Cover we give a nontrivial \u221ar-approximation in time 2n/r. We match this with a similarly tight result. We also give a log r-approximation for Min ATSP in time 2n/r and an r-approximation for Max Grundy Coloring in time rn/r. Furthermore, we show that Min Set Cover exhibits a curious behavior in this superpolynomial setting: for any \u03b4 > 0 it admits an m\u03b4-approximation, where m is the number of sets, in just quasi-polynomial time. We observe that if such ratios could be achieved in polynomial time, the ETH or the Projection Games Conjecture would fail. \u00a9 \u00c9douard Bonnet, Michael Lampis and Vangelis Th.

In its (standard) parameterized version, max $$k$$                 -vertex cover can be stated as follows: \u201cgiven $$G,$$                 $$k$$ and parameter $$\\ell ,$$ does $$G$$ contain $$k$$ vertices that cover at least $$\\ell $$ edges?\u201d. We first devise moderately exponential exact algorithms for max $$k$$                 -vertex cover, with time-complexity exponential in $$n$$ but with polynomial space-complexity by developing a branch and reduce method based upon the measure-and-conquer technique. We then prove that, there exists an exact algorithm for max $$k$$                 -vertex cover with complexity bounded above by the maximum among $$c^k$$ and $$\\gamma ^{\\tau },$$ for some $$\\gamma < \u2026",

In our model, at each step i, a new vertex v i is released, and we have to decide whether we will keep it or discard it. At any time of the process, only k vertices can be kept in memory; if at some point the current solution already contains k vertices, any inclusion of a new vertex in the solution must entail the definite deletion of another vertex of the current solution (a vertex not kept when released is definitely deleted). We propose algorithms for several natural classes of graphs (mainly regular and bipartite), improving on an easy 1 2-competitive ratio.

            "Abstract": "Given two strings A and B such that B is a permutation of A, the max duo-preservation string mapping (MPSM) problem asks to find a mapping \u03c0 between them so as to preserve a maximum number of duos. A duo is any pair of consecutive characters in a string and it is preserved by \u03c0 if its two consecutive characters in A are mapped to same two consecutive characters in B. This problem has received a growing attention in recent years, partly as an alternative way to produce approximation algorithms for its minimization counterpart, min common string partition, a widely studied problem due its applications in comparative genomics. Considering this favored field of application with short alphabet, it is surprising that MPSM^ \ud835\udcc1, the variant of MPSM with bounded alphabet, has received so little attention, with a single yet impressive work that provides a 2.67-approximation achieved in O (n)[Brubach, 2018], where n=| A|=| B|. Our work focuses on MPSM^ \ud835\udcc1, and our main contribution is the demonstration that this problem admits a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) when \ud835\udcc1= O (1). We also provide an alternate, somewhat simpler, proof of NP-hardness for this problem compared with the NP-hardness proof presented in [Haitao Jiang et al., 2012].",

We present algorithms for various metric spaces, and analyze their performance in the usual framework of the competitive analysis. In particular we present a 2-competitive algorithm that matches the lower bound for general metric spaces. In the case of the half-line metric space, we show that it is helpful not to move at full speed, and this approach is also used to derive the best on-line polynomial time algorithm known so far for the more general On-Line TSP problem (in the homing version).",

This measure has originally been introduced by Ausiello, D\u00c1tri and Protasi and more recently revisited, in a more systematic way, by the first and the third authors of the present paper. Under the differential ratio, bin-packing has a natural formulation as the problem of maximizing the number of unused bins. We first show that two basic fit bin-packing algorithms, the first-fit and the best-fit, admit differential approximation ratios 1/2. Next, we show that slightly improved versions of them achieve ratios 2/3. Refining our analysis we show that the famous first-fit-decreasing and best-fit decreasing algorithms achieve differential approximation ratio 3/4. Finally, we show that first-fit-decreasing achieves asymptotic differential approximation ratio 7/9.",

When inserting a node, we show that the reoptimization problem for MinTSP is approximable within ratio 4/3 if the distance matrix is metric. We show that, dealing with metric MaxTSP, a simple heuristic is asymptotically optimum when a constant number of nodes are inserted.

The first kind of approximation preserving reducibility that want to show is a very natural and simple transformation among problems that consists in two linear mappings, one between the values of the optimum solutions of the two problems and one between the errors of the corresponding approximate solutions: the linear reducibility.

For this problem, we show an exact solution method that runs within time  on graphs of average degree bounded by d. For the most specifically defined \u03b3-max quasi-independent set and k-max quasi-independent set problems, several results on complexity and approximation are shown, and greedy algorithms are proposed, analyzed and tested.",

Moreover, this objective function is a sum of 2|V | terms; hence, its computation is not immediately polynomial. We give sufficient conditions for large classes of graph-problems under which objective functions of their probabilistic counterparts are polynomially computable and optimal solutions are well-characterized.

We then study approximation of the problem by moderately exponential time algorithms and show that it can be approximated within ratio 1+ \u03f5, for any \u03f5> 0, in a time smaller than the one of exact computation and exponentially decreasing with \u03f5. We also propose approximation algorithms with better running times for ratios greater than 3 in general graphs and give improved moderately exponential time approximation results in triangle-free and bipartite graphs. These latter results are based upon a new bound on the number of maximal independent sets of a given size in these graphs, which is a result interesting per se.",

The reoptimization setting can generally be formulated as follows: given an instance of the problem for which we already know some optimal solution, and given some \u201csmall\u201d perturbations on this instance, is it possible to compute a new (optimal or at least near-optimal) solution for the modified instance without ex nihilo computation? We focus on two kinds of modifications: node-insertions and node-deletions. When k new nodes are inserted together with their incident edges, we mainly propose a fast strategy with complexity O (k n) which provides a max {2, 3\u2212(2/(k\u2212 1))}-approximation ratio, in complete metric graphs and another one that is optimal with complexity O (n log n). On the other hand, when k nodes are deleted, we devise a strategy which in O (n) achieves approximation ratio bounded above by 2\u2308| L max|/2\u2309 in complete metric \u2026",

In this paper we deal with on-line independent set. On-line models studied until now for this problem suppose that the input graph is initially empty and revealed either vertex-by-vertex, or cluster-by-cluster. Here we present a new on-line model quite different to the ones already studied. It assumes that a superset of the final graph is initially present (in our case the complete graph on the order n of the final graph) and edges are progressively removed until the achievement of the final graph. Next, we revisit the model introduced in [Demange, Paradon and Paschos, Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 1963 (2000) 326-334] and study relaxations assuming that some paying backtracking is allowed.",

Assume that an optimum solution of an instance is given and the goal is to determine if one can maintain a good solution when the instance is subject to minor modifications. We study the case where nodes are inserted in, or deleted from, the graph. When inserting a node, we show that the reoptimization problem for MinTSP is approximable within ratio 4/3 if the distance matrix is metric. We show that, dealing with metric MaxTSP, a simple heuristic is asymptotically optimum when a constant number of nodes are inserted. In the general case, we propose a 4/5-approximation algorithm for the reoptimization version of MaxTSP.",

A lower bound on the complexity of any \u03c1-approximation algorithm of (roughly) 2^ n^ 1-\u03f5 \u03c1 d for even d and 2^ n^ 1-\u03f5 \u03c1 (d+ \u03c1) for odd d (under the randomized ETH), complemented by \u03c1 \u2026",

These problems can be seen as particular cases of set-covering. If the number of subgraphs is polynomial in the order n of the input-graph, then these problems can be approximated within logarithmic ratio by the classical greedy set-covering algorithm. We extend the class of problems approximable by this approach to covering problems where the number of candidate subgraphs is exponential in n, by revisiting an old technique called ldquomaster-slaverdquo and extending it to weighted master or/and slave problems. Finally, we use the master-slave tool to prove some positive approximation results for two network-design and a VLSI-design graph-problems.",

Under the cluster-model, we then relax the constraint that the choice of the part of the final solution dealing with each cluster has to be irrevocable, by allowing backtracking.

In other words, heuristic computation consists of trying to find in reasonable time, not the best solution but one solution which is \"near\" the optimal one. Among classes of heuristic methods for NP-hard problems, the polynomial approximation algorithms aim at solving a given NP-hard problem in polynomial time by computing feasible solutions that are, under some predefined criterion, as near as possible to the optimal ones. The polynomial approximation theory deals with the study of such algorithms. This survey presents and analyzes in a first time approximation algorithms for some classical examples of NP-hard problems. In a second time, it shows how classical notions and tools of complexity theory, such as polynomial reductions, can be matched with polynomial approximation in order to devise structural results for NP-hard optimization problems. Finally, it presents a quick description of what it is commonly called inapproximability results. Such results provide limits on the approximability of the problems tackled.",

In this paper, we present algorithms for finding exact solutions of k-SUBGRAPH improving the trivial exponential time complexity of O *(2 n ) and using polynomial space. Two FPT algorithms are also proposed; the first considers as parameter the treewidth of the input graph and uses exponential space, while the second is parameterized by the size of the minimum vertex cover and uses polynomial space. Finally, we propose several approximation algorithms running in moderately exponential or parameterized time.",

For the third one defined on complete graphs with edge distances 1 or 2, we show that it is differentially approximable within 0.82.

This new proof is, in some sense, \u2018more constructive\u2019 than Cook's classical one, as we need only to show how an NP problem can be expressed in terms of a second-order logical formula. Next, inspired by Fagin's characterization, we propose a logical characterization for the class NP-optimization (NPO), i.e., the class of optimization problems, the decision versions of which are in NP.

In this paper, we study the on-line independent set under a model assuming that the input graph G is revealed by non-empty clusters, i.e., by induced subgraphs of G. We suppose that the order of the graph, as well as the number of clusters needed so that the whole of the graph is revealed are a priori known. The algorithm we propose implies approximation of the vertex-coloring problem in each cluster. We first establish a general result for the competitivity of the method studied. Next, we restrict ourselves in natural and well-known independent set sub-problems and perform a precise evaluation of the competitivity ratio of our algorithm for the sub-problems considered.",

We assume that an optimal solution is given for some instance of the problem and the objective is to maintain a good solution when the instance is subject to minor modifications, the simplest such modifications being vertex insertions and deletions. We propose fast reoptimization strategies for the case of vertex insertions and we show that maintenance of a good solution for the \u201cshrunk\u201d instance, without ex nihilo computation, is impossible when vertex deletions occur. We also provide lower bounds for the approximation ratios of the reoptimization strategies studied.",

The analysis was performed as a function of incident energy and of impact parameter, defined through the total transverse energy of light charged particles (Etrans 12, Z\u2a7d2). This observable was found to scale linearly with the collision energy up to a certain limit above which it saturates. Strong forward-backward asymmetries in the emission pattern with respect to the rapidities of the projectile and target residua were observed. Their possible relation to equilibration is discussed and interpreted in the framework of molecular dynamics and statistical multifragmentation models.

On the other hand, DPTAS-and Poly-DAPX-completeness have not been studied until now. We first prove in this paper the existence of natural Poly-APX-and Poly-DAPX-complete problems under the well known PTAS-reduction and under the DPTAS-reduction (defined in \u201cG. Ausiello, C.

We introduce approximation preserving reductions, called FT and DFT, respectively, and prove that, under these new reductions, natural problems are PTAS-complete, or DPTAS-complete. Then, we deal with the existence of intermediate problems under our reductions and we partially answer this question showing that the existence of NPO-intermediate problems under Turing-reduction is a sufficient condition for the existence of intermediate problems under both FT-and DFT-reductions.

            "Abstract": "We study the following on-line model for set-covering: elements of a ground set of size n arrive one-by-one and with any such element ci, arrives also the name of some set Si0 containing ci and covering the most of the uncovered ground setelements (obviously, these elements have not been yet revealed). For this model we analyze a simple greedy algorithm consisting of taking Si0 into the cover, only if ci is not already covered. We prove that the competitive ratio of this algorithm, that uses only O (log m) space, where m is the size of the set-system, is\u221a n and that it is asymptotically optimal for the model dealt, since no on-line algorithm can do better than\u221a n/2. We next show that this model can also be used for solving minimum dominating set with competitive ratio bounded above by the square root of the size of the input graph. We also study a slightly simplified, but more memory consuming, on-line model: any \u2026",

            "Abstract": "It has long been known, since the classical work of (Arora, Karger, Karpinski, JCSS~99), that \\MC\\ admits a PTAS on dense graphs, and more generally, \\kCSP\\ admits a PTAS on \"dense\" instances with  constraints. In this paper we extend and generalize their exhaustive sampling approach, presenting a framework for $(1-\\eps)$-approximating any \\kCSP\\ problem in \\emph{sub-exponential} time while significantly relaxing the denseness requirement on the input instance. Specifically, we prove that for any constants  and $\\eps > 0$, we can approximate \\kCSP\\ problems with  constraints within a factor of $(1-\\eps)$ in time $2^{O(n^{1-\\delta}\\ln n /\\eps^3)}$. The framework is quite general and includes classical optimization problems, such as \\MC, {\\sc Max}-DICUT, \\kSAT, and (with a slight extension) -{\\sc Densest Subgraph}, as special cases. For \\MC\\ in particular (where ), it gives an approximation scheme that runs in time sub-exponential in  even for \"almost-sparse\" instances (graphs with  edges). We prove that our results are essentially best possible, assuming the ETH. First, the density requirement cannot be relaxed further: there exists a constant  such that for all , \\kSAT\\ instances with  clauses cannot be approximated within a ratio better than  in time . Second, the running time of our algorithm is almost tight \\emph{for all densities}. Even for \\MC\\ there exists  such that for all , \\MC\\ instances with  edges cannot be approximated within a ratio better than  in time .",

Vertex pairs requiring connection are always present with probability 1. Our objective is to satisfy the connectivity requirements for every possibly materializable subgraph of the given metric graph, so as to optimize the expected total cost of edges used. This is a natural problem model for cost-efficient Steiner Forests on stochastic metric graphs, where uncertain availability of intermediate nodes requires fast adjustments of traffic forwarding. For this problem we allow a priori design decisions to be taken, that can be modified efficiently when an actual subgraph of the input graph materializes. We design a fast (almost linear time in the number of vertices) modification algorithm whose outcome we analyze probabilistically, and show that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The fact that polynomial time algorithm is very unlikely to be devised for an optimal solving of the NP-hard problems strongly motivates both the researchers and the practitioners to try to solve such problems heuristically, by making a trade-off between computational time and solution's quality. In other words, heuristic computation consists of trying to find not the best solution but one solution which is 'close to' the optimal one in reasonable time. Among the classes of heuristic methods for NP-hard problems, the polynomial approximation algorithms aim at solving a given NP-hard problem in poly-nomial time by computing feasible solutions that are, under some predefined criterion, as near to the optimal ones as possible. The polynomial approximation theory deals with the study of such algorithms. This survey first presents and analyzes time approximation algorithms for some classical examples of NP-hard problems. Secondly, it shows how classical notions and tools of complexity theory, such as polynomial reductions, can be matched with polynomial approximation in order to devise structural results for NP-hard optimization problems. Finally, it presents a quick description of what is commonly called inapproximability results. Such results provide limits on the approximability of the problems tackled.",

This measure has originally been introduced by Ausiello, D'Atri and Protasi and more recently revisited, in a more systematic way, by the first and the third authors of the present paper. Under the differential ratio, bin-packing has a natural formulation as the problem of maximizing the number of unused bins. We first show that two basic fit bin-packing algorithms, the first-fit and the best-fit, admit differential approximation ratios 1/2. Next, we show that slightly improved versions of them achieve ratios 2/3. Refining our analysis we show that the famous first-fit-decreasing and \u2026",

In particular, the survey focuses on two complementary frameworks. The first one is the reoptimization framework, where an instance I that is already solved undergoes some local perturbation. The goal is then to make use of the information provided by the initial solution to compute a new solution. The second framework is probabilistic optimization, where the instance to optimize is not fully known at the time when a solution is to be proposed, but results from a determined Bernoulli process. Then, the goal is to compute a solution with optimal expected value.",

This chapter outlines this result, which uses the main ingredients of many approximation schemes, and thus constitutes a significant example for geometric problems. It proposes a complete approximation scheme for the Boolean knapsack problem. The chapter presents a result concerning the approximation of the set covering problem.

Under non-identical vertex-probabilities probabilistic coloring is polynomial for stars, for trees with bounded degree and a fixed number of distinct vertex-probabilities, and, consequently, also for paths with a fixed number of distinct vertex-probabilities.

We present tight approximation results for this problem on general graphs, namely a polynomial approximation algorithm which guarantees an n \u2212\u20091/2 approximation ratio, while showing that unless P\u2009=\u2009NP, the problem is inapproximable within ratio n  \u03b5\u2009\u2212\u2009(1/2) for any strictly positive \u03b5. We also analyze the problem on various restricted classes of graph, on which we show polynomiality or constant-approximability of the problem. Finally, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the size of an optimal solution, to treewidth and to the size of a maximum matching.",

In its (standard) parameterized version, MAX k-VERTEX COVER can be stated as follows: \"given G, k and parameter \u2113, does G contain k vertices that cover at least \u2113 edges?\". We first devise moderately exponential exact algorithms for MAX k-VERTEX COVER, with complexity exponential to n (note that the known results concerned time bounds of the form ) by developing a branch and reduce method based upon the measure-and-conquer technique. We then prove that, interestingly enough, although MAX k-VERTEX COVER is non fixed parameter tractable with respect to \u2113, it is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the size \u03c4 of a minimum vertex cover of G. We also point out that the same happens for a lot of well-known problems quite different from MAX k-VERTEX COVER. We finally study approximation MAX k-VERTEX COVER by moderately exponential algorithms. The general goal of the issue of moderately exponential approximation is to catch-up on polynomial inapproximability, by providing algorithms achieving, with worst-case running times importantly smaller than those needed for exact computation, approximation ratios unachievable in polynomial time.",

The best such complexity is, to our knowledge, the  algorithm claimed by J.M. Robson (T.R. 1251-01, LaBRI, Univ. Bordeaux I, 2001) in his unpublished technical report. We also quote the  algorithm by Fomin and al. (in Proc. SODA'06, pages 18-25, 2006), that is the best published result about MIS. In this paper we settle MIS in (connected) graphs with \"small\" average degree, more precisely with average degree at most 3, 4, 5 and 6. Dealing with graphs of average degree at most 3, the best bound known is the recent  bound by N. Bourgeois and al. in Proc. IWPEC'08, pages 55-65, 2008). Here we improve this result down to  by proposing finer and more powerful reduction rules. We then propose a generic method showing how improvement of the worst-case complexity for MIS in graphs of average degree  entails improvement of it in any graph of average degree greater than  and, based upon it, we tackle MIS in graphs of average degree 4, 5 and 6. For MIS in graphs with average degree 4, we provide an upper complexity bound of  that outperforms the best known bound of  by R. Beigel (Proc. SODA'99, pages 856-857, 1999).

            "Abstract": "In this chapter we introduce the so-called differential approximation ratio as a measure of the quality of the solutions obtained by approximation algorithms. After providing motivations and basic definitions we show examples of optimization problems for which the evaluation of approximation algorithms based on the differential ratio appears to be more meaningful than the usual approximation ratio used in the classical approach to approximation algorithms. Finally, we discuss some structural results concerning approximation classes based on the differential ratio. Throughout the chapter we make use of the notations introduced in Chapter 15. Also, given an approximation algorithm A for an NP optimization problem \u03a0 (the class of these problems is called NPO), we denote by mA (x, y), the value of the solution y computed by A on instance x of \u03a0. When clear from the context, reference to A will be omitted. The definitions of most of the problems dealt in this chapter can be found in Refs.[1, 2]; also, for graph-theoretic notions, interested readers are referred to Ref.[3].In several cases, the commonly used approximation measure (called standard approximation ratio in what follows) may not be very meaningful in characterizing the quality of approximation algorithms. This happens, in particular, when the ratio of m (x, yw), the value of the worst solution for a given input x, to the value of the optimum solution opt (x) is already bounded (above, if goal (\u03a0)= min, below, otherwise). Consider, for instance, the basic maximal matching algorithm for MIN VERTEX COVER that achieves approximation ratio 2. In this algorithm, given a graph G (V, E), a maximal1 \u2026",

Formally, 17 we are given a sequence of edge-weighted graphs on the same set of vertices V , and are asked to 18 produce a perfect matching in each instance so that the total edge cost plus the transition cost 19 (the cost of exchanging edges), is minimized. This model was introduced by Gupta et al. (ICALP 20 2014), who posed as an open problem its approximability for bipartite instances. We completely 21 resolve this question by showing that Minimum Multistage Perfect Matching (Min-MPM) does 22 not admit an n 1\u2212-approximation, even on bipartite instances with only two time steps. 23 Motivated by this negative result, we go on to consider two variations of the problem. In 24 Metric Minimum Multistage Perfect Matching problem (Metric-Min-MPM) we are promised 25 that edge weights in each time step satisfy the triangle inequality. We show that this problem 26 admits a 3-approximation when the number of time steps is 2 or 3. On the other hand, we 27 show that even the metric case is APX-hard already for 2 time steps. We then consider the 28 complementary maximization version of the problem, Maximum Multistage Perfect Matching 29 problem (Max-MPM), where we seek to maximize the total profit of all selected edges plus the 30 total number of non-exchanged edges. We show that Max-MPM is also APX-hard, but admits 31 a constant factor approximation \u2026",

Two problems arise in the design of telecommunications networks: firstly, what network should be constructed to satisfy a given traffic demand; then, how should the various traffics be routed in the existing network.

We next show that the 2OPT, one of the most-known traveling salesman algorithms, approximately solves all these problems within differential-approximation ratio bounded above by 1/2.

            "Abstract": "Starting from a batch scheduling problem, we consider a weighted subcoloring in a graph G; each node v has a weight w (v); each color class S is a subset of nodes which generates a collection of node disjoint cliques. The weight w (S) is defined as max {w (K)=\u2211 v\u2208 K w (v)| K\u2208 S}. In the scheduling problem, the completion time is given by\u2211 k i= 1 w (Si) where S=(S1,..., Sk) is a partition of the node set of graph G into color classes as defined above. Properties of such colorings concerning special classes of graphs (line graphs of cacti, block graphs) are stated; complexity and approximability results are presented. The associated decision problem is shown to be NP-complete for bipartite graphs with maximum degree at most 39 and triangle-free planar graphs with maximum degree k for any k\u2265 3. Polynomial algorithms are given for graphs with maximum degree two and for the forests with maximum degree k. An \u2026",

This problem is W[2]-hard when parameterized by k, and FPT when parameterized by p. We investigate the parameterized approximability of the problem with respect to parameters k and p.

In particular, greediness-for-parameterization improves asymptotic running times for these problems upon random separation (that is a special case of color coding) and is more intuitive and simple. Then, we show how these results can be easily extended for getting standard-parameterization results (i.e., with parameter the value of the optimal solution) for a well known local graph partitioning problem.",
