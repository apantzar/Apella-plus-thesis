            "Abstract": "Ambient Intelligence environments consist of various devices that collect, process, change and share the available context information. The imperfect nature of context, the open and dynamic nature of ambient environments, and the special characteristics of the involved devices have introduced new research challenges in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, which have not yet been successfully addressed by current Ambient Intelligence systems.This thesis proposes a solution based on the Multi-Context Systems paradigm, in which local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories (contexts), and information ow between agents is achieved through mapping rules that associate concepts used by different contexts. To handle imperfect context, we extend Multi-Context Systems with non-monotonic features, such as local defeasible theories, defeasible mapping rules, and a preference ordering over the system contexts. On top of this model, we have developed an argumentation framework that exploits context and preference information to resolve potential con icts caused by the interaction of ambient agents through their mappings. We also provide an operational model in the form of a distributed algorithm for query evaluation, which is sound and complete with respect to the argumentation framework, as well as three alternative versions of the algorithm, each of which implements a different strategy for con ict resolution. The four strategies, which mainly differ in the type and extent of context and preference information that is used to resolve potential con icts, have been evaluated in a simulated peer-to-peer system and \u2026",

Agents therefore need to cooperate. Some of the questions then raised, such as, which agent to cooperate with, are addressed in the field of coalition formation. In this paper we go further and first, address the question of how to compute the solution space for the formation of coalitions using a contextual reasoning approach. We model agents as contexts in Multi-Context Systems (MCS) and dependence relations among agents as bridge rules. We then systematically compute all potential coalitions using algorithms for MCS equilibria. Finally, given a set of functional and non-functional requirements, we propose ways to select the best solutions. We illustrate our approach with an example from robotics.",

We suggest that, as these institutions' interest in Semantic Web technologies grows and associated applications are more widely adopted, the need to provide InfoVis tools for efficient overview and exploration of cultural data increases. We postulate that changes in the paradigms for interaction with cultural datasets are also needed, with more focus on users' needs and cognitive processes.

            "Abstract": "The human ability to repurpose objects and processes is universal, but it is not a well-understood aspect of human intelligence. Repurposing arises in everyday situations such as finding substitutes for missing ingredients when cooking, or for unavailable tools when doing DIY. It also arises in critical, unprecedented situations needing crisis management. After natural disasters and during wartime, people must repurpose the materials and processes available to make shelter, distribute food, etc. Repurposing is equally important in professional life (e.g. clinicians often repurpose medicines off-license) and in addressing societal challenges (e.g. finding new roles for waste products,). Despite the importance of repurposing, the topic has received little academic attention. By considering examples from a variety of domains such as every-day activities, drug repurposing and natural disasters, we identify some principle characteristics of the process and describe some technical challenges that would be involved in modelling and simulating it. We consider cases of both substitution, i.e. finding an alternative for a missing resource, and exploitation, i.e. identifying a new role for an existing resource. We argue that these ideas could be developed into general formal theory of repurposing, and that this could then lead to the development of AI methods based on commonsense reasoning, argumentation, ontological reasoning, and various machine learning methods, to develop tools to support repurposing in practice.",

In this paper, we introduce conviviality as a property of Multi-Context Systems (MCS). We first present how to use conviviality to model and evaluate interactions among different contexts, which represent heterogeneous entities in a distributed system. Then, as one cause of logical conflicts in MCS is due to the exchange of information between mutually inconsistent contexts, we show how inconsistency can be resolved using the conviviality property.

Taking advantage of these opportunities, this paper presents a context-aware navigation guide, strongly connected to the semantics behind user profile. Our approach, which focuses on indoor environments, uses OWL ontologies to capture and formally model profile and context information, and reasons on the ontology data using rules in order to support personalized context-aware navigation services. To test and demonstrate the approach, a prototype has been developed that documents the flexibility of the design.",

            "Abstract": "An ageing population with increased social care needs has provided recent impetus for research into assisted living technologies, as the need for different approaches to providing supportive environments for senior citizens becomes paramount. Ambient intelligence (AmI) systems are already contributing to this endeavour. A key feature of future AmI systems will be the ability to identify causes and explanations for changes to the environment, in order to react appropriately. We identify some of the challenges that arise in this respect, and argue that an iterative and distributed approach to explanation generation is required, interleaved with directed data gathering. We further argue that this can be realised by developing and combining state-of-the art techniques in automated distributed reasoning, activity recognition, robotics, and knowledge-based control.",

            "Abstract": "The development of the Semantic Web [Berners Lee et al., 2001] proceeds in layers, each layer being on top of the others. At present, the highest layer that has reached sufficient maturity is the ontology layer in the form of the description logic based languages, DAML+ OIL and OWL. The next step in the development of the Semantic Web will be the logic and proof layers. Rule systems can play a twofold role in the Semantic Web initiative:(a) they can serve as extensions of, or alternatives to, description logic based ontology languages; and (b) they can be used to develop declarative systems on top (using) ontologies. Defeasible reasoning is a simple rule-based approach to reasoning with incomplete and inconsistent information. It can represent facts, rules, and priorities among rules. Its main advantage is the combination of enhanced representational capabilities allowing one to reason with incomplete and contradictory information, coupled with low computational complexity compared to mainstream nonmonotonic reasoning.In this paper we report on the implementation of a defeasible reasoning system for reasoning on the Web. Its main characteristics are the following:(a) It is compatible with RuleML (details in full paper1);(b) It is based on Prolog. The core of the system consists of a well-studied translation [Antoniou et. al., 2001] of defeasible knowledge into logic programs under Well-Founded Semantics [van Gelder et al., 1991];(c) The main focus is on flexibility. Strict and defeasible rules and priorities are part of the interface and the implementation. Also, a number of variants are implemented (ambiguity blocking/propagation, conflicting \u2026",

Defeasible reasoning is a direction in nonmonotonic reasoning that is based on the use of rules that may be defeated by other rules. It is a simple, but often more efficient approach than other nonmonotonic rule systems for reasoning with incomplete and inconsistent information. This paper reports on the implementation of a system for defeasible reasoning on the Web. The system 1) is syntactically compatible with RuleML, 2) features strict and defeasible rules, priorities, and two kinds of negation, 3) is based on a translation to logic programming with declarative semantics, 4) is flexible and adaptable to different intuitions within defeasible reasoning, and 5) can reason with rules, RDF, RDF Schema, and (parts of) OWL ontologies",

This diversity raises additional research challenges in the study of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, we present an algorithm for reasoning with distributed rule theories in an ambient setting. The algorithm models the participating agents as nodes in a peer-to-peer system, and considers the potential conflicts that may arise during the integration of the distributed theories taking into account some special characteristics of context knowledge and ambient agents.",

The current paper proposes four alternative strategies for using context and preference information to resolve conflicts in a Multi-Context Framework, in which contexts are modeled as rule theories, mappings as defeasible rules, and global inconsistency is handled using methods of distributed defeasible reasoning.",

            "Abstract": "In multi-agent systems, agents often need to cooperate and form coalitions to fulfil their goals, for example by carrying out certain actions together or by sharing their resources. In such situations, some questions that may arise are: Which agent (s) to cooperate with? What are the potential coalitions in which agents can achieve their goals? As the number of possibilities is potentially quite large, how to automate the process? And then, how to select the most appropriate coalition, taking into account the uncertainty in the agents\u2019 abilities to carry out certain tasks? In this article, we address the question of how to identify and evaluate the potential agent coalitions, while taking into consideration the uncertainty around the agents\u2019 actions. Our methodology is the following: We model multi-agent systems as Multi-Context Systems, by representing agents as contexts and the dependencies among agents as bridge rules. Using methods and tools for contextual reasoning, we compute all possible coalitions with which the agents can fulfil their goals. Finally, we evaluate the coalitions using appropriate metrics, each corresponding to a different requirement. To demonstrate our approach, we use an example from robotics. View Full-Text",

The difficulty of implementing authorization policies lies in the open and dynamic nature of such environments. The information is distributed among various heterogeneous devices that collect, process, change, and share it. Previous work presented a fully distributed approach for reasoning with conflicts in ambient intelligence systems. This paper extends previous results to address authorization issues in distributed environments. First, the authors present the formal high-level authorization language DEAL to specify access control policies in open and dynamic distributed systems. DEAL has rich expressive power by supporting negative authorization, rule priorities, hierarchical category authorization, and nonmonotonic reasoning. The authors then define the language semantics through Defeasible Logic. Finally, they demonstrate the capabilities of DEAL in a use case Ambient Intelligence scenario regarding a hospital facility. services with other entities. The core difference between AmI and traditional systems is the formers\u2019 user centric approach. AmI systems adapt and respond to people by acknowledging their presence and gestures instead of the other way around.Ambient Intelligence is a multidisciplinary approach as presented in Aarts (2004) and Remagnino and Foresti (2005), since it requires the convergence of many areas of Computer Science in order to fulfill its purpose. Therefore, it has introduced new research challenges in many areas, including the field of access control. The DOI: 10.4018/jaci. 2011100102",

In this chapter, we review various works considering the notion of joint attacks from various perspectives, including abstract and structured frameworks.

Research is shifting towards the study of non-monotonic systems that are capable of handling conflicts among rules and reasoning with partial information. As for the proof layer of the Semantic Web, it can play a vital role in increasing the reliability of Semantic Web systems, since it will be possible to provide explanations and/or justifications of the derived answers.

The accomplishment of this task requires formal models that handle the involved entities as autonomous logic-based agents, and provide methods for handling the imperfect and distributed nature of context. We propose a solution based on the multi-context systems (MCS) formalism, in which local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories (contexts), and information flow between agents is achieved through mapping rules, associating concepts used by different contexts. To handle the imperfect nature of context, we extend MCS with non-monotonic features-local defeasible theories, defeasible mappings, and a preference ordering on the system contexts.

The system allows users or agents to issue queries, on a given RDF& rules knowledge base and automatically produces proof explanations for answers produced by a popular programming system (JENA), by interpreting the output from the proof\u2019s trace and converting it into a meaningful representation. It also supports an XML representation (a R2ML language extension) for agent communication, which is a common scenario in the Semantic Web. The system in essence implements a proof layer for rules on the Semantic Web empowering trust between agents and users.",

            "Abstract": "The imperfect nature of context in Ambient Intelligence environments and the special characteristics of the entities that possess and share the available context information render contextual reasoning a very challenging task. The accomplishment of this task requires formal models that handle the involved entities as autonomous logic-based agents and provide methods for handling the imperfect and distributed nature of context. This paper proposes a solution based on the Multi-Context Systems paradigm in which local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories (contexts), and information flow between agents is achieved through mapping rules that associate concepts used by different contexts. To handle imperfect context, we extend Multi-Context Systems with nonmonotonic features: local defeasible theories, defeasible mapping rules, and a preference ordering on the system contexts.

            "Abstract": "Uncertainty and ambiguity are two inherent properties of historical and archaeological data. It is very often that different researchers express conflicting opinions about an artifact\u2019s chronology, creation, origin, style or identification. Ontology-based models, such as CIDOC-CRM, are already widely used for the representation of cultural artifacts, offering significant benefits, such as formality, flexibility and extensibility. They were, though, specifically designed to represent factual cultural data, and not claims or conflicting opinions expressed about cultural artifacts. In this paper, we examine how such models may be extended to integrate information about the sources of cultural information (eg bibliographic data) enabling users to assess the validity of this information. We also propose an alternative approach based on a more expressive language, N3 Logic. Finally, we discuss argumentation theory as a tool for the natural representation of claims about cultural artifacts and the arguments they are associated with.",

            "Abstract": "This paper investigates techniques for knowledge injection into word embeddings learned from large corpora of unannotated data. These representations are trained with word cooccurrence statistics and do not commonly exploit syntactic and semantic information from linguistic knowledge bases, which potentially limits their transferability to domains with differing language distributions or usages. We propose a novel approach for linguistic knowledge injection through data augmentation to learn word embeddings that enforce semantic relationships from the data, and systematically evaluate the impact it has on the resulting representations. We show our knowledge augmentation approach improves the intrinsic characteristics of the learned embeddings while not significantly altering their results on a downstream text classification task.",

The numbers of entities and properties describing semantic relationships between entities within the linked data cloud have become very large. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-incentive approach for entity annotation in biomedicine, and present Me Detect, a prototype system that we developed based on this approach.

            "Abstract": "A Multi-Context System consists of a set of contexts and a set of inference rules (known as mapping or bridge rules) that enable information flow between different contexts. A context can be thought as a logical theory-a set of axioms and inference rules-that models local context knowledge. Different contexts are expected to use different languages and inference systems, and although each context may be locally consistent, global consistency cannot be required or guaranteed. Reasoning with multiple contexts requires performing two types of reasoning;(a) local reasoning, based on the individual context theories; and (b) distributed reasoning, which combines the consequences of local theories using the mappings. The most critical challenges of contextual reasoning are;(a) the heterogeneity of local context theories; and (b) the potential conflicts that may arise from the interaction of different contexts through the mappings. Our study mainly focuses on the second issue, by modeling the different contexts as peers in a P2P system, and performing some type of defeasible reasoning on the distributed peer theories.Two recent studies that deploy non-monotonic reasoning approaches in Multi-Context Systems are the nonmonotonic rule-based MCS framework, which supports default negation in the mapping rules, proposed in (Roelofsen and Serafini 2005), and the multi-context variant of Default Logic presented in (Brewka, Roelofsen, and Serafini 2007). The latter models the bridge relations between different contexts as default rules, and has the additional advantage that is closer to implementation due to the well-studied relation between Default \u2026",

Over a decade has passed since the European Agenda for Culture (2007) recognised digitisation as a fundamental driver for fostering cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue, but the promise of digitisation is yet to be realised by many small and regional museums across Europe. The chapter discusses the benefits and challenges of making the cultural heritage data of small regional museums findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Using the Archaeological Museum of Tripoli, Greece, as a case study, it demonstrates how the employment of semantic methods, such as semantic enrichment and linking to Linked Data resources, and semantic technologies, such as the CIDOC-Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) and other standard ontologies, can help alleviate some of these challenges and help small museums make their data FAIR. It also discusses how a semantics-based approach can facilitate collaboration between Digital Humanities and Information Studies researchers, and cultural heritage institutions, by providing a common means of communication that means cultural heritage data can be reused, repurposed, and redeployed efficiently.",

Two complementary and mutually exclusive rule-based approaches for enforcing energy-saving policies are proposed: a reactive agent based on production rules and a deliberative agent based on defeasible logic. The system was deployed at a Greek University, showing promising experimental results (at least 4% daily savings). Although the percentage of energy savings may seem low, the greatest merit of the method is ensuring that no energy is wasted by constantly enforcing the policies.",

A citation will be included here when that paper is accepted for publication. This report contains supplementary technical details (formal definitions and proposition proofs) omitted from that article, but omits the discussion of related work, informal commentary on the definitions, motivation, etc. The aim of both this report and the article referred to above is to describe the Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC for short), a probabilistic framework for reasoning about actions based on the Event Calculus. To introduce the main definitions and characteristics of our framework, we will use two example scenarios: a simple coin toss example and a more complex medical scenario. They are described informally as follows:Scenario 1 (Coin Toss). A coin initially (instant 0) shows Heads. A robot can attempt to toss the coin, but there is a small chance that it will fail to pick it up, leaving the coin unchanged. The robot attempts to toss the coin (instant 1).",

Existing models, however, do not capture gender-related concepts. This article presents an effort to fill this gap by developing a new ontology for the representation of gendered concepts in CH resources.1 The new ontology, named \u2018GenderedCHContents\u2019 resulted from combined research in women\u2019s studies, gender theory and computer science. Its primary aim is to draw attention to the presence of women within CH artefacts. The proposed ontology extends the Europeana Data Model (EDM) with twenty-two new classes, sixteen object properties and seven datatype properties. The article presents a demonstration of the \u2018GenderedCHContents\u2019 ontology\u2019s use in five different representation tasks, which describe five resources related to Pandora\u2019s myth. Lastly, the study stresses the benefits of reasoning support (i.e. enabling computers to infer further information from a set of asserted facts) in revealing different gender ideals and inferred relationships between metaphorical concepts, along with the benefits of the Semantic Web in making information about gendered contents more easily retrievable to the users.",

Resulting from this technical development, this paper asks the question, do they provide an opportunity for fundraising for galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM), by selling ownership of digital copies of their collections? Although NFTs in their current format were first invented in 2017 as a means for game players to trade virtual goods, they reached the mainstream in 2021, when the auction house Christie\u2019s held their first-ever sale exclusively for an NFT of a digital image, that was eventually sold for a record 69 million USD. The potential of NFTs to generate significant revenue for artists and museums by selling effectively a cryptographically signed copy of a digital image (similar to real-world limited editions, which are signed and numbered copies of a given artwork), has sparked the interest of the financially deprived museum and heritage sector with world-renowned institutions such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Hermitage Museum, having already employed NFTs in order to raise funds. Concerns surrounding the environmental impact of blockchain technology and the rise of malicious projects, exploiting previously digitised heritage content made available through OpenGLAM licensing, have attracted criticism over the speculative use of the technology.

The introduction of types gives rise to a new family of non-standard semantics which can support applications that classical approaches cannot, while also allowing classical semantics as a special case. The main novelty of the proposed semantics is the discrimination among two different roles that attacks play, namely an attack as a generator of conflicts, and an attack as a means to defend an argument. These two roles have traditionally been considered together in the argumentation literature. Allowing some attack types to serve one of those roles only, gives rise to the different semantics presented here.",

            "Abstract": "The study of Ambient Intelligence environments and pervasive computing systems has introduced new research challenges in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. These are mainly caused by the imperfect nature of context and the special characteristics of the entities that possess and share the available context knowledge. In such environments, context may be unknown, ambiguous, imprecise or erroneous. Ambient agents are expected to have different goals, experiences and perceptive capabilities and use distinct vocabularies to describe their context. Due to the highly dynamic and open nature of the environment and the unreliable wireless communications that are restricted by the range of transmitters, ambient agents do not typically know a priori all other entities that are present at a specific time instance nor can they communicate directly with all of them. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a fully distributed approach for contextual reasoning in Ambient Intelligence environments, which combines the virtues of Multi-Context Systems and Defeasible Argumentation. The general approach consists of three models:(a) a representation model, which is a nonmonotonic extension of Multi-Context Systems; according to this, local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories (contexts), and information flow between agents is achieved through defeasible mapping rules that associate concepts used by different contexts;(b) an argument-based reasoning model, in which conflicts that arise from the interaction of mutually inconsistent contexts are captured through attacking arguments, and conflict resolution is \u2026",

As the success of such systems often depends on the collection on personal data, privacy concerns threaten to hinder this new world from reaching its full potential. At the same time, accurately modelling the different types of contextual information proves to be of paramount importance in paving the way towards the maturity of Ambient Intelligence systems, with Semantic Web ontologies becoming a popular solution. This paper aims to explore the application of Semantic Web ontologies in modelling privacy-related information in the context of smart home environments. To this purpose, we have conducted a practical evaluation of three ontologies, in an attempt to determine their suitability within the stated domain. The paper concludes that the representation of privacy features within smart home environments is attainable through the use of ontologies; however, current models do not achieve sufficient coverage of the domain. Lastly, the paper provides insights into practical ways of enhancing future ontologies in order to reach the required capabilities.",

            "Abstract": "With the pervasive development of sociotechnical systems, such as Facebook, Twitter and digital cities, modelling and reasoning on social settings has acquired great significance. Hence, an independent soft objective of system design is to facilitate interactions. Conviviality has been introduced as a social science concept for multiagent systems to highlight soft qualitative requirements like user friendliness of systems. Roughly, more opportunity to work with other people increases the conviviality. In this paper, the question we address is how to design systems to increase conviviality by design. To evaluate conviviality, we model agent interactions using dependence networks, and define measures that quantify interdependence over time. To illustrate our approach we use a gaming example. Though, our methods can be applied similarly to any type of agent systems, which involve human or artificial agents cooperating to achieve their goals.",

            "Abstract": "Defeasible reasoning is a rule-based approach for efficient reasoning with incomplete and inconsistent information. Such reasoning is, among others, useful for ontology integration, where conflicting information arises naturally; and for the modeling of business rules and policies, where rules with exceptions are often used. This work describes these scenarios in more detail, and reports on the implementation of a system for defeasible reasoning on the Web. The system (a) is syntactically compatible with RuleML; (b) features strict and defeasible rules and priorities; (c) is based on a translation to logic programming with declarative semantics; and (d) is flexible and adaptable to different intuitions within defeasible reasoning.",

            "Abstract": "Information Visualisation (InfoVis) is defined as the interactive visual representation of abstract data. We view the end-users\u2019 interaction with InfoVis tools as a learning experience which is made up of a set of highly demanding cognitive activities. These activities assist the end-user in making sense and gaining knowledge of the represented domain. There is a consensus in the InfoVis community about the importance of user evaluation studies in measuring the effectiveness of InfoVis tools. However, usability studies, which are most commonly used in this domain, are not appropriate for capturing the end-user cognitive processes that occur during the learning experience. To address this issue this paper discusses work in progress in developing a cognitive based framework for evaluating the effectiveness of InfoVis tools on the user learning process, by employing metrics for measuring the peoples ability to remember, understand, analyse, and derive insights from the visualised data, applied in the Cultural Heritage domain.",

A major requirement for the success of such systems is that participating entities cooperate by sharing parts of their local knowledge. This paper presents a novel approach for modeling and enhancing cooperation in distributed information systems, which combines two formal models from the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning: a conviviality model and Multi-Context Systems. Our aim is two-fold. First, we develop a combined model for context-based representation and cooperation. Second, we provide the means for measuring cooperation leading to the design and evaluation of more convivial systems.",

Trust is a vital feature for Semantic Web. If users (humans and agents) are to use and integrate system answers, they must trust them. Thus, systems should be able to explain their actions, sources, and beliefs. Our system produces automatically proof explanations using a popular logic programming system (XSB), by interpreting the output from the proof\u2019s trace and convert it to a meaningfull representation. It presents the explanation of an answer for a user\u2019s query back to him using a graphical interface, and also it can use an XML representation for agent communication, that is a common scenario in the Semantic Web. One of the main benefits of our system is that it supports explanations in defeasible logic for both positive and negative answers in user queries. In the remaining of this report we present the design and implementation of the system, a novel XML language for the represantation of a proof explanation, and we give a variety of examples and use cases of our system.",

In this paper, we extend this framework and introduce the symmetric multi-Dimensional Comment Evaluation (s-mDiCE) framework, which has a more intuitive behavior and a wider scope, aiming to cover also the goal-oriented debates found in decision support systems or in debate portals, eg, in active citizenship portals. s-mDiCE combines features, such as voting on arguments, expert rating, supporting and attacking \u2026",

This position paper proposes a socio-technical solution based on collective awareness and informed consent, whereby data collection and data protection norms are configured by the users themselves, using a collaborative participatory process of argumentation. This refers to the ability of users to understand privacy-related documents and their implications via participatory processes, wisdom-of-the-crowds approaches and visual cues.

This study proposes a P2P rule-based reasoning model for MCS, which handles (a) incomplete or inconsistent local context information, by representing contexts as local theories of Defeasible Logic and performing local defeasible reasoning, and (b) global inconsistencies that result from the integration of local contexts, by representing mappings as defeasible rules and performing some type of distributed defeasible reasoning.

The paper discusses the process of semantically representing and enriching the available cultural heritage data, and reveals the challenges of semantically expressing interrelations and groupings among the physical items, the venue and the available digital resources. The paper also highlights the challenges in the creation of the conceptual model of the National Gallery as a Venue, which aims to i) describe and understand the correlation between the parts of a building and the whole; ii) to record and express the semantic relationships among the building components with the building as a whole; and iii) to be able to record the accurate location of objects within space and capture their provenance in terms of changes of location. The outcome of this research is the CrossCult venue ontology, a fully International Committee for Documentation Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM) compliant structure developed in the context of the CrossCult project. The proposed ontology attempts to model the spatial arrangements of the different types of cultural heritage venues considered in the project: from small museums to open air archaeological sites and whole cities.

We then formally compare our language with two established frameworks for probabilistic reasoning about action \u2013 the action language PAL by Baral et al., and the extension of the situation calculus to reason about noisy sensors and effectors by Bacchus et al. In both cases we prove a correspondence with EPEC for a class of domains representable in both frameworks.",

            "Abstract": "Multi-Context Systems (MCS) are logical formalizations of distributed context theories connected through a set of mapping rules, which enable information flow between different contexts. Reasoning in MCS introduces many challenges that arise from the heterogeneity of contexts with respect to the language and inference system that they use, and from the potential conflicts that may arise from the interaction of context theories through the mappings. This study proposes a P2P reasoning model for MCS, which represents contexts as peer theories in a P2P system, mapping rules as defeasible rules (rules that can be defeated in the existence of adequate contrary evidence), and uses a preference relation (which, eg, expresses trust information) to resolve the potential conflicts. It also provides a reasoning algorithm for query evaluation, analyzes its formal properties, and discusses alternative methods for conflict resolution, which differ in the type of information that they use to resolve the conflicts.",

            "Abstract": "Multi-Context Systems (MCS) are rule-based representation models for distributed, heterogeneous knowledge sources, called contexts, such as ambient intelligence devices and agents. Contexts interact with each other through the sharing of their local knowledge, or parts thereof, using so-called bridge rules to enable the cooperation among different contexts. On the other hand, the concept of conviviality, introduced as a social science concept for multiagent systems to highlight soft qualitative requirements like user friendliness of systems, was recently proposed to model and measure cooperation among agents in multiagent systems. In this paper, we introduce conviviality as a property to model and evaluate cooperation in MCS. We first introduce a formal model, then we propose conviviality measures, and finally we suggest an application consisting in a conviviality-driven method for inconsistency resolution.",

            "Abstract": "The current Web evolves rapidly from a Web of information to a Web of Opinions. People are constantly uploading their viewpoints, ratings and comments on any conceivable topic, via blogs, social media websites, commercial websites, wikis and others. Despite some recent efforts to give a more \u201cargumentative character\u201d to the Web, the opinions are still expressed in purely textual form, without any metadata or any other type of annotation that would make them machineunderstandable and processable. Moreover, their persuasive power, ie, the characteristics that determine how an opinion affects the viewpoint of the audience, is largely neglected. Improving Web experience towards this direction would give immense added-value, as it would allow searching for opinions for or against a given claim, understanding the interlinking and interrelationships between opinions (eg, support or opposition) and obtaining a better understanding of the various debates for a well-intended user. Ultimately, it can lead to increased participation of Web users in democratic, dialogical interchange of opinions, more informed decisions by professionals and decision-makers, as well as to an easier identification of biased, misleading or deceptive arguments. This paper presents the vision of the Persuasive Web, whose objective is to allow the above developments through the introduction and application of a formal, machine-readable representation of persuasive arguments that would allow the discovery, tracking, retrieval, combination, interrelation extraction and visualization of the vast variety of viewpoints that already exist on the Web, in a way that goes beyond \u2026",

A new bibliographic dataset based on BIBFRAME, which will be linked with other online datasets, has been created for that purpose. The learning resource, which will be publicly available under an open licence on completion, will allow learners to access, explore, query and update the dataset through an intuitive interface built on top of the SPARQL query language. This masterclass shares experience in converting MARC records to BIBFRAME using the Library of Congress\u2019s conversion tools [http://bibframe.org/tools/]. More fundamentally, it provides examples of how our model for Cataloguing is changing from linking record:record to field:field. Using publication data from library academics, we\u2019ll look at what\u2019s new in BIBFRAME and why this matters. Finally, we\u2019ll discuss the extent to which those responsible for inputting data may (or may not) need to get to grips with the new data structure and ways that the enthusiastic can keep up.",

The system (a) is syntactically compatible with RuleML;(b) features strict and defeasible rules and priorities;(c) is based on a translation to logic programming with declarative semantics; and (d) is flexible and adaptable to different intuitions within defeasible reasoning.",

Ambient intelligence (AmI) systems are already contributing to this endeavour. A key feature of future AmI systems will be the ability to identify causes and explanations for changes to the environment, in order to react appropriately. We identify some of the challenges that arise in this respect, and argue that an iterative and distributed approach to explanation generation is required, interleaved with directed data gathering. We further argue that this can be realised by developing and combining state-of-the art techniques in automated distributed reasoning, activity recognition, robotics, and knowledge-based control.",
