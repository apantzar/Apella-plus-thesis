This work introduces encoding methods for pedestrian recognition, based on statistical shape analysis of 3D LIDAR data.

The latter method derives more detailed cues, by enriching the \u2018gross\u2019 information reflected by overall statistics of local shape descriptors, with \u2018fine-grained\u2019 information reflected by statistics associated with spatial clusters. Experiments on artificial LIDAR datasets, which include challenging samples, as well as on a large scale dataset of real LIDAR data, lead to the conclusion that both variants of the proposed approach (i) obtain high recognition accuracy, (ii) are robust against low-resolution sampling, (iii) are \u2026",

The proposed scheme automatically detects specific facial landmarks and uses them to create a spatio-temporal descriptor. At first, geometric as well as topological information of the 3D face scans is captured by using the detected landmarks. In the sequel, the aforementioned spatial information is filtered by using wavelet transformation, resulting to our final spatio-temporal descriptor. Our descriptor is invariant to the number of the 3D face scans of a facial expression sequence. The proposed retrieval scheme exploits the Square of \u2026",

The original ALLT depends on fixed windows to extract essential features such as the character stroke width. Since characters with several different stroke widths may exist within a region, this can lead to erroneous results. In our approach, we use local adaptive binarization as a guide to our adaptive stroke width detection. The skeleton and the contour points of the binarization output are combined to identify locally the stroke width. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive local parameter ldquobetardquo that enhances the characters and improves the overall performance. In this way, we achieve more accurate binarization results in both handwritten and printed documents with a particular focus on degraded historical documents. Experimental results prove \u2026",

In this paper, a new approach is proposed which strives towards identifying and separating handwritten from machine printed text using the Bag of Visual Words model (BoVW). Initially, blocks of interest are detected in the document image. For each block, a descriptor is calculated based on the BoVW. The final characterization of the blocks as Handwritten, Machine Printed or Noise is made by a decision scheme which relies upon the combination of binary SVM classifiers.

Our methodology is the following: for each person or object, we perform 2 independent recordings, one used for learning and the other one for test purposes. For each recorded frame, a 3D-mesh is computed by simple triangulation from the filtered depth image. The feature we use for recognition is the normalized histogram of directions of normal vectors to the 3D-mesh facets. We consider each training frame as a separate example, and the training is done with a multilayer perceptron with 1 hidden layer. For our 3D person facial identification experiments, 3 different persons were used, and we obtain a global correct rank-1 recognition rate of up to 80%, measured on test frames from an independent 3D video. For our 3D object recognition experiment, we have considered 3 different objects, and obtain a correct single-frame recognition rate of 95%, and checked that the method is quite robust to variation of distance from depth camera to object. These first experiments show that 3D object recognition or 3D face identification, with a time-of-flight 3D camera, seems feasible, despite the high level of noise in the obtained real depth images.",

Motivated by this, we propose to measure the visual complexity of a 3D model by utilizing viewpoint entropy distribution of a set of sample views and based on the complexity value, we can adaptively decide the number of representative views.

Word segmentation is addressed as a two class problem. The distances between adjacent overlapped components in a text line are calculated using the combination of two distance metrics and each of them is categorized either as an inter- or an intra-word distance in a Gaussian mixture modeling framework. The performance of the proposed methodology is based on a consistent and concrete evaluation methodology that uses suitable performance measures in order to compare the text line segmentation and word segmentation results against the corresponding ground truth annotation.

Considering the huge amount of 3D models/scenes available in proprietary or public Webs, it is nearly impossible to create corresponding metadata with user annotation. Therefore, the development of a content-based search engine that permits queries of existing 3D models and supports a robust model representation based on content, can lead to an efficient solution regarding search and retrieval of 3D graphical models. Using off-the-shelf hardware as well as fast 3D feature extraction and matching algorithms, we present a robust content-based search engine for 3D models which can also be used via the Web.",

            "Abstract": "While approaches based on local features play a more and more important role for 3D shape retrieval, the problems of feature selection and similarity measurement between sets of local features still remain open tasks. Common algorithms usually measure the similarity between two such sets by either establishing feature correspondences or by using Bag-of-Features (BoF) approaches. While establishing correspondences often involves a lot of manually chosen thresholds, BoF approaches can hardly model the spatial structure of the underlying 3D object. In this paper focusing on retrieval of 3D models representing man-made objects, we try to tackle both of these problems. Exploiting the fact that man-made objects usually consist of a small set of certain shape primitives, we propose a feature selection technique that decomposes 3D point clouds into sections that can be represented by a plane, a sphere, a \u2026",

A part-based representation is proposed, where each object is segmented, and represented as a labeled graph, with nodes corresponding to parts, and edges connecting adjacent parts. The calculation of the distance between two segmented objects is formulated as a multi-label optimization problem, taking into account the aforementioned graphs. The proposed method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on several datasets, while it has a clear advantage in the case of articulated objects.",

Text detection is the most crucial step in a multimedia text extraction system and although it has been extensively studied the past decade still, it does not exist a generic architecture that would work for artificial and scene text in multimedia content. In this paper we propose a system for text detection of both artificial and scene text in images and video frames. The system is based on a machine learning stage which uses an Random Forest classifier and a highly discriminative feature set produced by using a new texture operator called Multilevel Adaptive Color edge Local Binary Pattern (MACeLBP). MACeLBP describes the spatial distribution of color edges in multiple adaptive levels of contrast. Then, a gradient-based algorithm is applied to achieve distinction \u2026",

This work introduces a supervised scheme for malignancy risk assessment of mammograms containing MCs. The proposed scheme employs shape and textural features as input to a support vector machine (SVM) ensemble, in order to perform content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of mammograms. The retrieval performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated by taking into account the variation of MCs morphology as defined in BI-RADS. In our experiments, we use a set of 87 mammograms containing MCs, obtained from the widely adopted DDSM database for screening mammography. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed supervised CBIR scheme addresses effective retrieval of MCs mammograms outperforming relevant unsupervised schemes.",

To this aim two main approaches are considered: global, and local ones. Global approaches are effective in describing the whole object, while local ones are more suitable to characterize small parts of the shape. Some strategies to combine these two approaches have been proposed recently but still no consolidate work is available in this field. With this paper we address this problem and propose a new method based on sparse coding techniques. A set of local shape descriptors are collected from the shape. Then a dictionary is trained as generative model. In this fashion the dictionary is used as global shape descriptor for shape retrieval purposes. Preliminary experiments are performed on a standard dataset by showing a drastic improvement of the proposed method in comparison with well known local-to-global and global approaches.",

Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network is used as an encoder for the input which is a textline image, while a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network followed by a fully connected neural network acts as the decoder for the prediction of a sequence of characters. This work was motivated by the need to transcribe historical Greek manuscripts that entail several challenges which have been extensively analysed. The proposed architecture has been tested for standard datasets, namely the IAM and RIMES, as well as for a newly created dataset, namely EPARCHOS, which contains historical Greek manuscripts and has been made publicly available for research purposes.

In this paper, we present a descriptor which can be used for content based retrieval of 3D pottery. The descriptor carries morphological features which are extracted from a set of sequential plane-based contours which are vertical to the vessel\u2019s axis of symmetry. The feature extraction is performed after the completion of a pre-processing phase, which involves scale and pose normalisation of the vessel. The latter is a recursive algorithm that takes advantage of the rotational symmetry property found in vessels. We developed a software tool that implements the above and we performed initial testing on vessel\u2019s main body shape matching using a 3D vessel database composed by both manually modelled and digitised 3D artefacts.",

We use modified shape distributions of [OFCD02] in conjunction with the interior distances and barycentroid potential that are based on barycentric coordinates [RLF09]. In our approach, shape distributions are aggregated throughout the entire volume contained within the shape thus capturing information conveyed by the volumes of shapes. Since interior distances and barycentroid potential are practically insensitive to various poses/deformations and to non-pervasive topological changes (addition of small handles), our shape descriptor inherits such insensitivity as well. In addition, if any other modes of information (eg electrostatic potential within the protein volume) are available, they can be easily incorporated into the descriptor as additional dimensions in the histograms.

            "Abstract": "The  traditional  approach  in  document  indexing  usually  involves  an  Optical  Character Recognition (OCR) step.  Although OCR performs well in modern printed documents and documents of high quality printing,  in the case of handwritten documents OCR, several factors affect the final performance like intense degradation, paper-positioning variations (skew, translations, etc.) and writing styles variety. Handwritten word spotting has attracted the attention of the research community in the field of document image analysis and recognition since it appears to be a feasible solution for indexing and retrieval of handwritten documents in the case that OCR-based methods fail to deliver satisfactory results. Handwritten keyword spotting (KWS) is the task of retrieving all instances of a given query word in handwritten document image collections without involving a traditional OCR step. There exist two basic variations for KWS approaches: (a) the Query by Example case (QbE) where the query is a word image and (b) the Query by String case (QbS) where, as the name implies, the query is a string.  The study presented in this chapter will focus on the QbE approach For a better understanding, QbE methods will be presented taking into account two different perspectives which relate to the use of segmentation and learning. The segmentation- based methods are divided into 2 subcategories based upon the segmented entity which could be either the word image or the textline.  They are strongly dependent on the segmentation  step,  so  that  to  compare  different  methods  regardless  of  segmentation  errors, many researchers do not implement a \u2026",

First, image pre-processing is performed in order to normalize the character images as well as to correct character slant. At the next step, two types of features are combined in a hybrid fashion. The first one divides the character image into a set of zones and calculates the density of the character pixels in each zone. In the second type of features, the area that is formed from the projections of the upper and lower as well as of the left and right character profiles is calculated. For the classification step Support Vectors Machines (SVM) are used. The performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated after testing with the CIL database (handwritten Greek character database), which was created from 100 different writers.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, the unsupervised human action retrieval problem in 3D mesh sequences is addressed. An action is represented by a mesh sequence wherein each frame is represented by a static shape descriptor. Six state-of-the-art static descriptors are used to extract meaningful information of the mesh objects in the sequence. These descriptors are first examined in terms of similarity performance using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Then, they are utilized in the action retrieval problem, where the query is a 3D mesh sequence. Each descriptor for an action, is considered as a multidimensional curve which traverses the corresponding points. The temporal similarity estimation is achieved by two variations of the descriptor's normalization in the context of Multidimensional Dynamic Time Warping. Experimental results are given for two standard datasets, one containing real data and another one \u2026",

Finally, an edge projection analysis is applied, refining the result and splitting text areas in text lines.

These images are compared to all the words in the digitized documents while user feedback is used in order to refine the search procedure. In order to improve the efficiency of accessing and searching, we have used natural language processing techniques that comprise (i) a morphological generator for early Modern Greek which provides the users with the ability to search documents using only a word stem and locate all the corresponding inflected word forms and (ii) a synonym dictionary which facilitates access to the semantic context \u2026",

Recently, it plays an important role in shape analysis community and especially in 3D-model retrieval. We present our approach for partial 3D-model retrieval using this technique based on closed curves. We define an invariant scalar function on the surface based on the commute-time distance. Our mapping function respects important properties in order to compute robust closed curves. Each scale of our scalar function detects a small region. The form of these regions are encoded in the form of the closed curves. We generate a collection of closed curves from a source point detected automatically. Based on the collection of all closed curves extracted, we construct our bag-of-features. Then we cluster the bag-of-features in the sense in accurate categorization. The centres of classes are defined as keyshapes. This method is particularly interesting in the sense of quantifying the 3D-model by its keyshapes that are accumulated into an histogram. The results shows the robustness of our method (BOF) compared to a method based on indexed closed curves (ICC) on various 3D-models with different poses.",

For a given 3D shape, the proposed approach considers a set of feature points uniformly sampled on the surface and associated with local Fourier descriptors; this descriptor is computed in the neighborhood of each feature point by projecting the geometry onto the eigenvectors of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, it is highly discriminative, robust to connectivity and geometry changes and also fast to compute. In a preliminary step, a visual dictionary is built by clustering a large set of feature descriptors, then each 3D shape is described by an histogram of occurrences of these visual words. The performances of our approach have been compared against very recent state-of-theart methods on several different datasets. For global shape retrieval our approach is comparable to these recent works, however it clearly outperforms them in the case of partial shape retrieval.",

Qualitative and experimental investigation in 3D data-sets has led us to the observation that most objects possess a single plane of symmetry. Our approach is thus guided by this observation. Initially, through an iterative procedure, the symmetry plane of a 3D model is estimated, thus computing the first axis of the model. This is achieved by rotating the 3D model and computing reflective symmetry scores on panoramic view images. The other principal axes of the 3D model are estimated by computing the variance of the 3D model\u2019s panoramic views. The proposed method is incorporated in a hybrid scheme, that serves as the pose normalization method in a state-of-the-art 3D object retrieval system.

In this way, we are able to combine scale and feature measures in a flexible way: the feature-set that is used to measure the dissimilarities may change as we progress in scale. We employ the earth mover's distance on a featureset that combines color, scale and contrast features to measure the dissimilarity between the nodes in the graph.

            "Abstract": "Two novel methods for fully unsupervised human action retrieval using 3D mesh sequences are presented. The first achieves high accuracy but is suitable for sequences consisting of clean meshes, such as artificial sequences or highly post-processed real sequences, while the second one is robust and suitable for noisy meshes, such as those that often result from unprocessed scanning or 3D surface reconstruction errors. The first method uses a spatio-temporal descriptor based on the trajectories of 6 salient points of the human body (i.e. the centroid, the top of the head and the ends of the two upper and two lower limbs) from which a set of kinematic features are extracted. The resulting features are transformed using the wavelet transformation in different scales and a set of statistics are used to obtain the descriptor. An important characteristic of this descriptor is that its length is constant independent of the \u2026",

The importance of this extension lies mainly on its ability to automatically select an optimum result out of a hierarchical stack. This achievement is realized through the introduction of new evaluation methods for the segmentation quality of each level of the hierarchy which considers a tradeoff between the preservation of details and the suppression of heterogeneity. The first method estimates the local color error of the regions and combines it with the amount of regions. The second evaluates the contrast of the segmented image by combining a region uniformity with an inter-region contrast measure for all regions. These two methods are compared with respect to an existing one. Experimental results demonstrate the \u2026",

Finally, horizontal and vertical projections are calculated on the edge map of every box and a threshold is applied, refining the result and splitting text areas in text lines. The whole algorithm is applied in multiresolution fashion to ensure text detection with size variability.

The object is projected to three perpendicular cylinders, each one aligned with one of its principal axes in order to capture the global shape of the object. For each projection we compute the corresponding 2D Discrete Fourier Transform as well as 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform.

We first evaluate how stable these metrics are under changes in mesh resolution, noise, and smoothing. We then analyze the discriminatory ability of the descriptors for the task of shape matching. Our conclusion is that sampling the normal distribution and the mean curvature, using 25 samples, and reducing this data to 5-10 samples via Principal Components Analysis provides robustness to noise and the best shape discrimination results.",

The proposed method is based on block-based document image descriptors that are used at a template matching process satisfying invariance in terms of translation, rotation and scaling. Improvement in terms of time expense is obtained by applying the matching process only on salient regions of the image.

            "Abstract": "Textual information that resides in natural images is an important knowledge for indexing and retrieval purposes. In this paper, a new approach is proposed using Mnemonic Cellular Automata (m-CA) which strives towards detecting scene text on natural images. Initially, an edge map is calculated and consequently binarized. Then, taking advantage of the Hybrid Cellular Automata (CA) flexibility, the transition rules are changed and are applied in different consecutive steps. Initially, its rules partially depend on Coordinating Logic Filters (CLF) and the majority state. Moreover, in the final steps of the m-CA evolution the update rules are modified as the history of past evolution steps is incorporated into each cell. Experimental work on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition dataset shows improved performance.",

In this paper, a new approach is proposed which strives towards identifying and separating handwritten from machine printed text using the Bag of Visual Words paradigm (BoVW). Initially, blocks of interest are detected in the document image. For each block, a descriptor is calculated based on the BoVW. The final characterization of the blocks as Handwritten, Machine Printed or Noise is made by a Support Vector Machine classifier.

Therefore, a Bag ofWords framework is introduced by clustering properly such descriptors in order to define the so called 3D visual vocabulary. In this fashion, the object signature is defined as a histogram of 3D visual word occurrences. Several examples on the [email protected] watertight dataset demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method in matching either 3D objects with articulated shape changes or partially occluded or compound objects.

These features are computed based on eight detected facial landmarks on each facial mesh that involve angles, areas and distances. Support vector machine classifiers are then trained using the above features in order to perform action unit detection. The proposed AU detection scheme is used in a dynamic 3D facial expression retrieval and recognition pipeline, highlighting the most important AU s, in terms of providing facial expression information, and at the same time, resulting in better performance than state-of-the-art methodologies.",

The projection of the curved surface on the plane is guided only by the textual content's appearance in the document image while incorporating a transformation which does not depend on specific model primitives or camera setup parameters.

The partitioning relies on processing each eigenvector of the heterogeneous graph Laplacian individually, taking into account the nodal set and nodal domain theory.

Then, a heat kernel signature is computed for each feature point which are associated to its semantic group by employing a learning-by-example procedure exploiting manual point labeling provided by an expert anthropometrist. Detected points are not clearly the same precise anatomical locations used in standard anthropometric procedures, but their matching can be useful for different applications like automatic model registration or simple body type evaluation.

Local shape similarity is quantified by averaging the minimum weighted distances associated with pairs of dFPFH values calculated on the partial query and the target object. Global shape similarity is derived by means of a weighted distance of Fisher vectors. Local and global distances are derived for multiple scales and are being combined to obtain a ranked list of the most similar complete 3D objects.

First, a graph is created which decomposes the image in scale and space using the concept of multiscale watersheds. In the subsequent step the obtained graph is partitioned using recursive graph cuts in a coarse to fine manner. In this way, we combine scale and feature measures in a flexible way. The dissimilarity between graph-nodes is estimated by using the Earth mover's distance on a featureset that combines color, scale and contrast.

In this paper, a two-step approach for efficient dewarping of camera document images is presented. At a first step, a coarse dewarping is accomplished with the help of a transformation model which maps the projection of a curved surface to a 2D rectangular area. The projection of the curved surface is delimited by the two curved lines which fit the top and bottom text lines along with the two straight lines which fit to the left and right text boundaries. At a second step, fine dewarping is achieved based on words detection. All words are pose normalized guided by the lower and upper word baselines.

The approach is based on the assumption that models belonging to the same class of shapes share the same salient features that discriminate them from the models of other classes. The main issue is learning these features. We propose a datadriven approach where the best view selection problem is formulated as a classification and feature selection problem; First a 3D model is described with a set of view-based descriptors, each one computed from a different viewpoint. Then a classifier is trained, in a supervised manner, on a collection of 3D models belonging to several shape categories. The classifier learns the set of 2D views that maximize the similarity between shapes of the same class and also the views that discriminate shapes of different classes. Our experiments using the LightField (LFD) descriptors and the Princeton Shape Benchmark demonstrate the performance of the approach and its suitability for classification and online visual browsing of 3D data collections.",

This measure is expressed by the integral over the dewarped text line curves.

The signatures to be compared are then segmented at landmarks obtained by corner matching based on similarity measures. In the last step, the corresponding pairs of segments are mapped by a point-to-point matching algorithm, minimising a curve deformation energy.

The core principle relies upon the ability of robust document-specific descriptors to produce meaningful similarities between a chosen word image for transcription and the corresponding word images in the full dataset under consideration. In the proposed framework, KWS is coupled with a relevance feedback mechanism which further enhances retrieval performance while being independent to the chosen KWS algorithm.

This descriptor is the concatenation of three sub-descriptors which capture topological as well as geometric information of the 3D face scans. The motivation behind the proposed hybrid facial expression descriptor is the fact that some facial expressions, like happiness and surprise, are characterized by obvious changes in the mouth topology while others, like anger, fear and sadness, produce geometric but no significant topological changes.

The proposed segmentation schemes consist of an extension to color images of an earlier multiscale hierarchical watershed segmentation for scalar images. Our segmentation scheme constructs a hierarchy among the watershed regions using the principle of dynamics of contours in scale-space. Each contour is valuated by combining the dynamics of contours over the successive scales. We conduct experiments on the scale-space stacks created by the Gaussian scale-space and the Perona and Malik anisotropic diusion scheme. Our experimental results consist of the comparison of both schemes with respect to the following aspects: size and information reduction between successive levels of the hierarchical stack, dynamics of contours in scale space and computation time.",

An action is composed of a mesh sequence, wherein each frame is represented by a static shape descriptor. Six state-of-the-art static descriptors are used to extract meaningful information for each sequence. Firstly, these descriptors are examined in terms of frame-to-frame similarity by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Then, they are utilized in the action retrieval problem, where the query is an entire 3D mesh sequence. Each action is a multidimensional curve which traverses the points defined by the vectors of each descriptor. The estimation of similarity between actions is achieved by calculating the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between the corresponding curves. The retrieval performance is further examined when the Sakoe band is used to constrain the search \u2026",

This is based on a novel combination of two different modes of word image normalization and robust hybrid feature extraction. Word image normalization is performed by using as a reference point the geometric center of the word image as well as by placing the baseline of the word in the center of a rectangular box. Additionally, image pre-processing is performed in order to correct word skew, word slant as well as to normalize the stroke thickness. At a next step, two types of features are combined in a hybrid fashion. The first one, divides the word image into a set of zones and calculates the density of the character pixels in each zone. In the second type of features, we calculate the area that is formed from the projections of the upper and lower profile of the word. The performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated after testing with the reference IAM cursive handwriting database.",

Connected component analysis is used to define the final binary images that mainly consist of text regions. The proposed methodology results in increased success rates for commercial OCR engines.

The proposed method introduces a bag of spatio-visual words representation (BoSVW) obtained by clustering of visual words' correlogram ensembles. Specifically, the spherical K-means clustering algorithm is employed accounting for the large dimensionality and the sparsity of the proposed spatio-visual descriptors. Experimental results on four standard datasets show that the proposed method significantly improves a state-of-the-art BoVW model and compares favorably to existing context-based scene classification approaches.",

            "Abstract": "Mammography is currently the dominant imaging modality for the early detection of breast cancer. However, its robustness in distinguishing malignancy is relatively low, resulting in a large number of unnecessary biopsies. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme, capable of visually justifying its results, is expected to aid the decision made by radiologists. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) accounts for a promising paradigm in this direction. Facing this challenge, we introduce a CBIR scheme that utilizes the extracted features as input to a support vector machine (SVM) ensemble. The final features used for CBIR comprise the participation value of each SVM. The retrieval performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated quantitatively on the basis of the standard measures. In the experiments, a set of 90 mammograms is used, derived from a widely adopted digital database for screening mammography. The experimental results show the improved performance of the proposed scheme.",

Also, a post-processing step includes the correction of possible false alarms, the creation of text lines that Hough Transform failed to create and finally the efficient separation of vertically connected characters using a novel method. Word segmentation is treated as a two class problem. The distances between adjacent overlapped components in a text line are calculated and each of these is categorized either as an inter-word or an intra-word distance after the comparison with a threshold. The performance of the proposed methodology is based on a consistent and concrete evaluation technique that relies on the comparison between the text line segmentation result and the corresponding ground truth annotation as well as the word segmentation result and the corresponding ground truth annotation.",

Furthermore, the algorithm is annotated with semantic information, ie a human-readable description of the object class it represents.

This fault location technique can used in a number of key industrial applications incorporating printed circuit boards, overhead transmission lines and underground cables in inaccessible locations which rely on a metallic conductor pathway for power transfer or signal propagation. As an improved method pseudonoise (PN) fault identification can be performed over several cycles at low amplitude levels online to reject normal signal traffic and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Recognition of handwritten manuscripts is essential for efficient content exploitation of the valuable old Greek historical collections. In this paper, we focus on the problem of recognizing old Greek handwritten manuscripts and propose a novel recognition technique that can be applied to a large number of important historical manuscript collections which are written in lower case letters and originate from St. Catherine's Mount Sinai Monastery. Based on an open and closed cavity character representation, we propose a novel, segmentation-free, fast and efficient technique for the detection and recognition of characters and character ligatures. First, we detect open and closed cavities that exist in the skeletonized character body. Then, the recognition of a specific character or character ligature is based on the protrusible segments that appear in the topological description of the character skeletons.

            "Abstract": "An important step for the document analysis and recognition pipeline is the document image binarization procedure. In the case of historical handwritten document images, the inherent degradation of the documents requires a preprocessing step aiming to enhance the image and improve the subsequent binarization step. To address this challenge a new document image enhancement method is proposed based on Bio-Inspired Models and especially on the OFF-center ganglion cells of the Human Vision System. Experimental results demonstrate the improvement of standard binarization methods when the proposed enhancement method is used.",

It is based on a meaningful segmentation procedure that can provide proper distributions for matching via the earth mover's distance as a similarity metric. The segmentation procedure is based on a hierarchical watershed-driven algorithm that extracts meaningful regions automatically. In this framework, the proposed robust feature extraction and the many-to-many region matching along with the novel region weighting for enhancing feature discrimination play a major role. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy.",

In this work, we present the first version of an integrated on-line content-based retrieval evaluation tool, named RETRIEVAL 3D, which can be used in order to quantify the performance of a retrieval method. The current version of the system offers a set of popular performance measures that can be accessed through a dynamic visualisation environment.

The proposed classifiers consist of robust visual feature extraction that feeds a support vector classification. In the case of indoor/outdoor classification, we combine color and texture information using the first three moments of RGB color space components and the low order statistics of the energy wavelet coefficients from a two-level wavelet pyramid. In the case of city/landscape classification, we combine the first three moments of L* a* b color space components and structural information (line segment orientation). Experimental results show that a high classification accuracy is achieved.",

The hybrid nature of the method is two-fold. First, a combination of 2D and 3D features is used as the shape descriptor of a 3D model and second, two alternative alignment techniques, CPCA and NPCA, are employed for rotation normalization. The 2D features are Fourier coefficients extracted from three pairs of depth buffers which are computed for each Cartesian plane capturing the model's thickness along each axis. The 3D features are spherical harmonic coefficients extracted from a spherical function based representation that captures the model's surface as well as volume information.",
