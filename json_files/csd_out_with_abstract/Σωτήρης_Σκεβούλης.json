            "Abstract": "This paper presents the results of a successfully completed funded project in the area of Computer Science and Formal Methods Education. The project was an effort to study the integration of formal methods software tools into an undergraduate curriculum. Our goals were to pioneer an innovative methodology that will increase the learning experience by introducing the use of mechanized approaches in teaching formal methods and to demonstrate the potential of undergraduate students for learning formal analysis techniques, by using these software tools. This methodology depends on the traditional teaching models and adds the use of automated software tools to enhance the student's learning experience. At the conclusion of this study we demonstrated increased student performance and understanding of difficult concepts in formal software analysis and design problems with the use of mechanized assistants \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The paper presents an invariant-based generic tool to statically analyze Java programs in order to detect potential errors (bugs). We briefly discuss the supporting theoretical framework and highlight the results of the tool. It can automatically detect potential bugs such as illegal dereference and array bounds and report them before the program is executed. For a Java class, invariants related to the category of error under examination are automatically generated and used to assess the validity of variable usage in the implementation of this class. The tool provides a practical and extensible generic mechanism for error detection to help industry practitioners who work with an object oriented language such as Java. The presented mechanism is capable of addressing error detection for a variety of error categories that cannot be caught by flow-based static analysis tools.",

            "Abstract": "We are well into the twenty-first century, and our technology is advancing at blazing speeds. Yet our education methodologies suffer the fate of remaining largely antiquated. Students and educators alike have become more sophisticated; the tools of learning must reflect and compensate for this intellectual advancement. Podcasts have greatly contributed towards that need. Podcasts are simple, effective, dynamic tools that will change the way that students and educators interact in the classroom and in cyberspace. This paper explores the possibilities and potential impact podcasts will have in educating students in the 21st century.",

For those who are newly entering the Deep Learning domain, the use of TensorFlow is an optimal way to enhance and learn about neural network designs and a way to deep dive into machine learning. Even though TensorFlow is early with its inception, it is however quickly becoming the direction in which many researchers are using for their open source machine-learning framework. The research, we take advantage of, is the capabilities of TensorFlow to enhance the processing of a substantial dataset that shows the growth and accuracy of cells of embryos in incubation. A typical approach to execute such a massive dataset, today\u2019s researchers would first go to directly to the cloud to accomplish this output.
