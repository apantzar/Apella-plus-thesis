Offline Signature Verification (OSV) is the task of verifying the signer using static signature images captured after the finish of signing process, with many applications especially in the domain of forensics. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can generate efficient feature representations, but their training is data-intensive. Since limited training data is an intrinsic problem of an OSV system\u2019s development, this work focuses on addressing the problem of learning informative features by employing prior knowledge from a similar task in a domain with an abundance of training data. In particular, we demonstrate that an appropriate pre-training of a CNN model in the task of handwritten text-based writer identification task, can dramatically improve the efficiency of the CNN in the OSV task \u2026",

A subset of the line, concave and convex family of curvature features is used to represent the signatures. Two major constraints are applied to the feature extraction algorithm in order to model the two step transitional probabilities of the signature pixels. Segmentation of the signature trace is enabled using a window which is centred upon the centre of mass of the thinned image. Partitioning of the image leads to a multidimensional feature vector which provides useful spatial details of the acquired handwritten image. The classification protocol followed in this work relies on a hard margin support vector machine. Our method was applied to two databases, the first taken from the literature while the second created by the authors. In order to provide comparable results for the first stage signature verification system, we have applied an already published feature extraction method while keeping the same classification protocol. Primary evaluation schemes on both corpuses provide very encouraging verification results for the Average Error.",

            "Abstract": "The handwritten signature is perhaps the most accustomed way for the acknowledgement of the consent of an individual or the authentication of the identity of a person in numerous transactions. In addition, the authenticity of a questioned offline or static handwritten signature still poses a case of interest, especially in forensic related applications. A common approach in offline signature verification system is to apply several predetermined image analysis models. Consequently, any offline signature sample which originates from either authentic persons or forgers, utilizes a fixed feature extraction base. In this proposed study, the feature space and the corresponding projection values depend on the training samples only; thus the proposed method can be found useful in forensic cases. In order to do so, we reenter a groundbreaking unsupervised learning method named archetypal analysis, which is connected to effective data analysis approaches such as sparse coding. Due to the fact that until recently there was no efficient implementation publicly available, archetypal analysis had only few cases of use. However, a fast optimization scheme using an active set strategy is now available. The main goal of this work is to introduce archetypal analysis for offline signature verification. The output of the archetypal analysis of few reference samples is a set of archetypes which are used to form the base of the feature space. Then, given a set of archetypes and a signature sample under examination archetypal analysis and average pooling provides the corresponding features.

Usually, the most important link in the chain of designing signature verification systems (SV's) is the feature extraction one, in which any static signature image is projected and measured onto a feature space. Feature extraction methods are divided in two main categories. The first one, inspired by different computer vision applications, includes handcrafted features. That is features manually engineered by scientists to be optimal for certain type of information extraction-summarization from signature images. Typical examples of this kind include global-local and/or grid-texture oriented features. The second feature category addresses signature modeling and verification with the use of dedicated features, usually learned directly from raw signature image data. Typical representatives include Deep Learning (DL) as well as Bag of Visual Words (BoW) or Histogram of Templates (HOT). Quite recently also sparse representation (SR) methods which include dictionary learning and coding have been introduced for signature modeling and verification with promising results. In this paper, we propose an extension of the classic SR conceptual framework by introducing the idea of embedding the atoms of a dictionary in a directed tree. For the purpose of this work, this is demonstrated by employing an l0 tree-structured sparse regularization norm which has been found to be useful in in a number of cases.

CT is a measure of the time taken for a random walk to setout and return between a pair of nodes on a graph. Its computation is considered here as a robust and accurate integration, over the FCG, of the individual pairwise measurements of functional coupling. To demonstrate the benefits from our approach, we attempted the characterization of time evolving connectivity patterns derived from EEG signals recorded while \u2026",

The management of a generic image database is pursued using a standard psychophysical experimental procedure followed by a well-suited data analysis methodology that is based on simple geometrical concepts. The end result is a cognitive discriminative biplot, which is a visualization of the intrinsic organization of the image database best reflecting the user's perception. The discriminating power of the introduced cognitive biplot constitutes an appealing tool for image retrieval and a flexible interface for visual data mining tasks. These ideas were evaluated in two ways. First, the separability of semantically distinct image classes was measured according to their reduced representations on the biplot. Then, a nearest-neighbor retrieval scheme was run on the emerged low-dimensional terrain to measure the suitability \u2026",

Recently, a variety of low-cost devices have been released, able to produce markerless real time pose estimation. Nevertheless, limitations of the incorporated RGB-D sensors can produce inaccuracies, necessitating the utilization of alternative representation and classification schemes in order to boost performance. In this context, we propose a method for action recognition where skeletal data are initially processed in order to obtain robust and invariant pose representations and then vectors of dissimilarities to a set of prototype actions are computed.

Among others, the offline or static signature is a valuable tool in forensic related studies. Thus, the importance of verifying static handwritten signatures still poses a challenging task. Throughout the literature, gray-level images, composed of handwritten signature traces are subjected to numerous processing stages; their outcome is the mapping of any input signature image in a so-called corresponding feature space. Pattern recognition techniques utilize this feature space, usually as a binary verification problem. In this work, sparse dictionary learning and coding are for the first time employed as a means to provide a feature space for offline signature verification, which intuitively adapts to a small set of randomly selected genuine reference samples, thus making it attractable for forensic cases. In this context, the K-SVD dictionary learning algorithm is employed in order to create a writer oriented lexicon. For any signature sample, sparse representation with the use of the writer's lexicon and the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm generates a weight matrix; features are then extracted by applying simple average pooling to the generated sparse codes. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated using the popular CEDAR, MCYT75 and GPDS300 signature datasets, delivering state of the art results.",

Experimental evidence demonstrates that the proposed technique is effective in different settings, including knowledge-transfer to smaller models, transfer between different deep architectures and harnessing knowledge from external data, producing models with increased accuracy compared to a typical training. Furthermore, results indicate that the presented method can work synergistically with methods such as knowledge distillation, further increasing the accuracy of the trained models.

STUDY DESIGN: The PR system was designed to assist in the physician's diagnosis for improving patient survival. The material comprised 55 verified cases of laryngeal cancer, 21 of low-grade and 34 of high-grade malignancy. Histopathology images were first processed for automatically segmenting p63 expressed nuclei. Fifty-two features were next extracted from the segmented nuclei, concerning nuclei texture, shape, and physical topology in the image. Those features and the Probabilistic Neural Network classifier were used to design the PR system on the multiprocessors of the Nvidia 580 GTX graphics processing unit (GPU) card using the Compute Unified Device Architecture parallel programming model and C++ programming language. RESULTS: PR system performance in classifying laryngeal cancer cases as low grade and high grade was 85.7% and 94.1%, respectively. The system's overall accuracy was 90.9%, using 7 features, and its estimated accuracy to\" unseen\" by the system cases was 80%.

In this paper, a modified version of the partially ordered set feature extraction procedure is presented by enabling distant range interactions between preceded relations of pixel groups. In this way, the spatial diversity of correlation that exists among signature features can be exploited. The motive behind this approach is related to our belief that the particular idiosyncratic writing style characteristics of each individual will be present over the whole length of the signature.

In this work, we propose a new method for cloud type classification from all-sky images. Appropriate versions of two descriptors, Regional Local Binary Pattern (R-LBP) and Four Patch-Local Binary Pattern (FP-LBP), are employed on the images in order to extract not only global but also local textural information from the observed cloud type patterns. In the classification stage, a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) scheme and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers are adopted for the assignment of the corresponding cloud type label. Our method is evaluated against two state-of-the-art methods and their datasets consisting of 5000 and 2500 images, respectively.

The graph construction by NNLS (Nonnegative Least Squares) coding technique is at the core of our method. Using graph-based encoding techniques and well-known shape descriptors, a framework is presented here which is applied to 3D shape clustering. Provided a shape database, a graph is first constructed. Weights in the graph are calculated so as to approximate each shape as a sparse linear combination of the remaining dataset objects. This framework is further enhanced by using the multilayer graphs process combining NNLS with L2graph. The L2graph is a sparse similarity graph, which conveys complementary information to NNLS coding.

            "Abstract": "The problem of image similarity has become a challenging task in the field of computer vision through the last two decades. The assessment of (dis) similarity between color (or multichannel, in general) images or parts of images has been studied on several image processing application domains such as image indexing and retrieval, classification and unsupervised segmentation (Rubner et al., 2001). The basic operations that need to be carried out in order to estimate the similarity between two color images are three-fold (Stricker & Orengo, 1995): first, choose an appropriate color space for image representation; then, extract a signature for each image (using, commonly, low-level features) to construct a theoretically valid distribution; finally, establish pairwise comparisons based on these signatures. Each signature constitutes the content description of a corresponding image. It is summarized based on pixel attributes and provides a representation of the image in a multidimensional feature space. There, a proper (dis) similarity measure is defined in order to act as a general rule for comparing any given pair of images. In these directions, several (dis) similarity measures have been developed and used as empirical estimates of the distribution of image features, confirming that distribution-based measures exhibit excellent performance in all areas (Rubner et al., 2001). In the context of visual image similarity, we make use of a nonparametric test from the field of multivariate statistics that deals with the \u201cMultivariate Two-Sample Problem\u201d, originally presented by Friedman and Rafsky (1979).

A data-driven feature-extraction procedure, taking the form of a simple projection operator, is in the core of our methodology. Provided a shape database, a graph encapsulating the structural relationships among all the available shapes, is first constructed and then employed in defining low-dimensional sparse projections. The recently introduced method of CRPs (collaborative representation based projections), which is based on L2-Graph, is the first variant that is included towards this end. A second algorithm, that particularizes the CRPs to shape descriptors that are inherently nonnegative, is also introduced as potential alternative. In both cases, the weights in the graph reflecting the database structure are calculated so as to approximate each shape as a sparse linear combination of the remaining dataset objects. By way of solving a generalized eigenanalysis problem, a linear matrix operator is designed that will act as the feature extractor. Two popular, inherently high dimensional descriptors, namely ShapeDNA and Global Point Signature (GPS), are employed in our experimentations with SHREC10, SHREC11 and SCHREC 15 datasets, where shape recognition is cast as a multi-class classification problem that is tackled by means of an SVM (support vector machine) acting within the reduced dimensional space of the crafted projections.

            "Abstract": "The novel technique of Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) is studied as a means of improving the clustering-based segmentation of color images. Taking advantage of the ability of the LE algorithm to learn the actual manifold of the multivariate data, a computationally efficient scheme is introduced. After embedding the local image characteristics, extracted from overlapping regions, in a high-dimensional feature space, the skeleton of the intrinsically low-dimensional manifold is constructed using spectral graph theory. Using the LE-based dimensionality reduction technique, a low-dimensional map is computed in which the variations of the local image characteristics are presented in the context of global image variation. The nonlinear projections on this map serve as inputs to the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm, boosting its clustering performance significantly. The final segmentation is produced by a simple labeling \u2026",

A number of notable research approaches provide advanced results up to a certain point which allow us to assert with confidence that the performance attained by signature verification (SV) systems is comparable to those provided by any other biometric modality. Up to now, the mainstream trend for offline SV is shared between standard-or handcrafted-feature extraction methods and popular machine learning techniques, with typical examples ranging from sparse representation to Deep Learning. Recent progress in graph mining algorithms provide us with the prospect to re-evaluate the opportunity of utilizing graph representations by exploring corresponding graph features for offline SV. In this paper, inspired by the recent use of image visibility graphs for mapping images into networks, we introduce for the first time in offline SV literature their use as a parameter free, agnostic representation for exploring global as well as local information. Global properties of the sparsely located content of the shape of the signature image are encoded with topological information of the whole graph. In addition, local pixel patches are encoded by sequential visibility motifs-subgraphs of size four, to a low six dimensional motif profile vector.

Four images were digitized from each patient\u2019s IHC specimens. P63 positively expressed nuclei were identified, the percentage of P63 expressed nuclei was computed, and 118 textural, morphological, shape, and architectural features were calculated from each one of the 55 laryngeal lesions.

With advancing grade, P63 expression decreased, P63 stained nuclei appeared of lower image intensity, more inhomogeneous, of higher local contrast, contained smaller randomly distributed dissimilar structures and had irregular shape.

The basic operations that need to be carried out in order to estimate the similarity between texture images and thereafter assess the classification problem are (a) choose an appropriate feature space for texture representation,(b) construct a theoretically valid distribution in the texture feature space, ie the texture signature, which provide a representation of the texture image in a multivariate feature space,(c) perform pairwise comparisons between corresponding texture signatures that constitute the consequent content distributions of the texture images and (d) choose an experimentally valid classifier for the subsequent evaluation.The scope of this chapter is the survey of a recently introduced methodology for distributional-based classification of texture images (Pothos et al., 2007), its enhancement via the incorporation of a self-organizing module and its adaptation so as to work in multivariate feature spaces. The original approach is based on an efficient strategy for analyzing texture patterns within a distributional framework and the use of a statistical distributional measure for comparing \u2026",

Feature extraction is directly provided from the JPEG discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain, without involving full decompression or inverse DCT.

At first, the image is decomposed by a bank of Gabor filters and, at every pixel, its spectral information is extracted in vectorial form. In order to reduce redundancy, a neural-based vector quantizer is used to select representative samples that encode the multivariable fingerprint spectral distribution. Similarity between image distributions, utilized as a distance measure by the classification task, is then assessed in pairwise form by means of a non-parametric statistical test between the corresponding code-vectors. The presented multi-scale vectorial representation allows the inclusion of higher order dependencies among image pixels that describe in a unique way individual features of fingerprint images.",

By summarizing the texture information using standard feature extraction methodologies, the similarity measure provides a comprehensive estimate of the match between different images based on graph theory. The proposed\" distributional metric\" is shown to handle efficiently the texture space dimensionality and the limited sample size drawn from a given image.

Sky images observation is used for cloud coverage short-term forecasting and therefore by predicting the future frames of a sky image sequence, a better estimate of the available solar resource for renewables could be achieved. For this purpose, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) topology is trained with an Adversarial loss in order to produce realistic future frames of the input image sequences. The prediction of future frames is incurred by two different approaches. In the first approach, a network is receiving 4 frames and predicting the next frame and in the second approach, given a sequence of 8 input images a network is predicting the next 8 frames. In order to evaluate the quality of the generated images, a criterion based on cloud coverage is proposed. This cloud coverage metric provides an \u2026",

One of the key inspirations for the current research lies on the observation that, usually, the most significant man-made structures in a wide-field aerial image resemble the low-level features that can be detected with a bottom-up saliency map. Aerial photography comprises, hence, a natural domain of application for a method that computationally models low-level saliency. With the employment of mechanisms analogous to the neural functions that drive human attention, we propose a bioinspired framework based on sparse coding for the extraction of information about saliency. The suggested algorithm is then evaluated on a novel data set that has been constructed with the utilization of aerial images and the corresponding manually designed ground truth binary maps of salient \u2026",

We demonstrate that NDD can outperform standard (dis)similarity measures based on color histograms or color distributions.",

Inspired by the notion of a clique as a strict cluster definition, the dominant sets algorithm is invoked, slightly modified to comport with the specific problem of defining shape parts. The cluster cohesiveness and a node participation vector are two important outputs of the proposed graph partitioning method. Opposed to most of the existing techniques, the final number of the clusters is determined automatically, by estimating the cluster cohesiveness on a random network generation process.

Beyond the accuracy improvements, several major parameters associated with sparse representation; such as selected formulation, dictionary size, sparsity level and positivity priors are investigated. Besides, it is evinced that 2nd order statistics can be a powerful pooling function for the formation of the global signature descriptor. Also, a thorough evaluation of the effects of preprocessing is introduced by an automated algorithm in order to select the optimum thinning level. Finally, a segmentation strategy which employs a special form of spatial pyramid tailored to the problem of sparse representation is presented along with the enhancing of the produced descriptor on meaningful areas of the signature as emerged from the BRISK key-point detection mechanism.
