Unfortunately, experimental determination of protein function is expensive and time consuming. For this reason, algorithms for computational function prediction have been developed to focus and accelerate this effort. These algorithms are comparison techniques which identify matches of geometric and chemical similarity between motifs, representing known functional sites, and substructures of functionally uncharacterized proteins (targets). Matches of statistically significant geometric and chemical similarity can identify targets with active sites cognate to the matching motif. Unfortunately statistically significant matches can include false positive matches to functionally unrelated proteins.

Existing methods require a significant amount of time to extract the most relevant motion information from such data sets. In this work, we provide a practical tool for molecular motion analysis. The proposed method builds upon the recent ScIMAP (Scalable Isomap) method, which, by using proximity relations and dimensionality reduction, has been shown to reliably extract from simulation data a few parameters that capture the main, linear and/or nonlinear, modes of motion of a molecular system. The results we present in the context of protein folding reveal that the proposed method characterizes the folding process essentially as well as ScIMAP.

            "Abstract": "We present a novel and scalable policy synthesis approach for robots. Rather than producing single-path plans for a static environment, we consider changing environments with uncontrollable agents, where the robot needs a policy to respond correctly over the infinite-horizon interaction with the environment. Our approach operates on task and motion domains, and combines actions over discrete states with continuous, collision-free paths. We synthesize a task and motion policy by iteratively generating a candidate policy and verifying its correctness. For efficient policy generation, we use grammars for potential policies to limit the search space and apply domain-specific heuristics to generalize verification failures, providing stricter constraints on policy candidates. For efficient policy verification, we construct compact, symbolic constraints for valid policies and employ a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to check the validity of these constraints. Furthermore, the SMT solver enables quantitative specifications such as energy limits. The results show that our approach offers better scalability compared to a state-of-the-art policy synthesis tool in the tested benchmarks and demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speedup from our heuristics for the tested mobile manipulation domain.",

AutoDock is a widely used docking program that can dock small ligands, with upto 5 or 6 rotatable bonds, accurately and quickly. Docking of larger ligands, however, is not very accurate and is computationally expensive. In this paper we present an AutoDock-based incremental docking protocol which docks a large ligand to its target protein in increments. A fragment of the large ligand is first chosen and then docked. Best docked conformations are incrementally grown and docked again, and this process is repeated until all the atoms of the ligand are docked. Each docking operation is performed using AutoDock. However, in each docking operation only a small number of rotatable bonds are allowed to rotate.

These strategies typically consist of several fields employed in sequence to achieve a desired final pose. The length of the sequence depends on the complexity of the part. We show that unique part poses can be achieved with just one field. First, we exhibit a single field that positions and orients any part (except certain symmetric parts) into two stable equilibrium poses.

The framework decomposes the planning problem into two stages: an offline phase that reasons only over action uncertainty and an online phase that quickly reacts to the uncertain environment. Offline, a bounded-parameter Markov decision process (BMDP) is employed to model the evolution of the stochastic system over a discretization of the environment. Online, an optimal control policy over the BMDP is computed. Upon the discovery of an unknown environment feature during policy execution, the BMDP is updated and the optimal control policy is efficiently recomputed. Depending on the desired quality of the control policy, a suite of methods is presented to incorporate new information into the BMDP with varying degrees of detail online. Experiments confirm that the framework recomputes high-quality policies in seconds and is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.",

            "Abstract": "Structural genomics projects such as the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) yield many new structures, but often these have no known molecular functions. One approach to recover this information is to use 3D templates \u2013 structure-function motifs that consist of a few functionally critical amino acids and may suggest functional similarity when geometrically matched to other structures. Since experimentally determined functional sites are not common enough to define 3D templates on a large scale, this work tests a computational strategy to select relevant residues for 3D templates. Based on evolutionary information and heuristics, an Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) pipeline built templates for 98 enzymes, half taken from the PSI, and sought matches in a non-redundant structure database. On average each template matched 2.7 distinct proteins, of which 2.0 share the first three Enzyme Commission digits as the template's enzyme of origin. In many cases (61%) a single most likely function could be predicted as the annotation with the most matches, and in these cases such a plurality vote identified the correct function with 87% accuracy. ETA was also found to be complementary to sequence homology-based annotations. When matches are required to both geometrically match the 3D template and to be sequence homologs found by BLAST or PSI-BLAST, the annotation accuracy is greater than either method alone, especially in the region of lower sequence identity where homology-based annotations are least reliable. These data suggest that knowledge of evolutionarily important residues improves functional annotation among distant enzyme \u2026",

Describing the exact details of these conformational changes, however, remains a central challenge for computational biology due the enormous computational requirements of the problem. This has engendered the development of a rich variety of useful methods designed to answer specific questions at different levels of spatial, temporal, and energetic resolution. These methods fall largely into two classes: physically accurate, but computationally demanding methods and fast, approximate methods. We introduce here a new hybrid modeling tool, the Structured Intuitive Move Selector (sims), designed to bridge the divide between these two classes, while allowing the benefits of both to be seamlessly integrated into a single framework. This is achieved by applying a modern motion planning algorithm, borrowed from the field of robotics, in tandem with a well-established protein modeling library. sims can combine precise energy calculations with approximate or specialized conformational sampling routines to produce rapid, yet accurate, analysis of the large-scale conformational variability of protein systems. Several key advancements are shown, including the abstract use of generically defined moves (conformational sampling methods) and an expansive probabilistic conformational exploration.

            "Abstract": "Determining the function of all proteins is a recurring theme in modern biology and medicine, but the sheer number of proteins makes experimental approaches impractical. For this reason, current efforts have considered in silico function prediction in order to guide and accelerate the function determination process. One approach to predicting protein function is to search functionally uncharacterized protein structures (targets), for substructures with geometric and chemical similarity (matches), to known active sites (motifs). Finding a match can imply that the target has an active site similar to the motif, suggesting functional homology.An effective function predictor requires effective motifs \u2013 motifs whose geometric and chemical characteristics are detected by comparison algorithms within functionally homologous targets (sensitive motifs), which also are not detected within functionally unrelated targets \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Structural variations caused by a wide range of physico-chemical and biological sources directly influence the function of a protein. For enzymatic proteins, the structure and chemistry of the catalytic binding site residues can be loosely defined as a substructure of the protein. Comparative analysis of drug-receptor substructures across and within species has been used for lead evaluation. Substructure-level similarity between the binding sites of functionally similar proteins has also been used to identify instances of convergent evolution among proteins. In functionally homologous protein families, shared chemistry and geometry at catalytic sites provide a common, local point of comparison among proteins that may differ significantly at the sequence, fold, or domain topology levels. This paper describes two key results that can be used separately or in combination for protein function analysis. The Family-wise Analysis of SubStructural Templates (FASST) method uses all-against-all substructure comparison to determine Substructural Clusters (SCs). SCs characterize the binding site substructural variation within a protein family. In this paper we focus on examples of automatically determined SCs that can be linked to phylogenetic distance between family members, segregation by conformation, and organization by homology among convergent protein lineages. The Motif Ensemble Statistical Hypothesis (MESH) framework constructs a representative motif for each protein cluster among the SCs determined by FASST to build motif ensembles that are shown through a series of function prediction experiments to improve the function prediction power \u2026",

While preserving its main modules (mapping, planning and mission handler), the framework now considers motion constraints to plan feasible paths, i.e., those that meet vehicle's motion capabilities. The new framework also incorporates a risk function to avoid navigating close to nearby obstacles, and reuses the last best known solution to eliminate time-consuming pruning routines. To evaluate this approach, we use the Sparus II AUV, a torpedo-shaped vehicle performing autonomous missions in a 2-dimensional workspace. We validate the framework's new features by solving tasks in both simulation and real-world in-water trials and comparing results with our previous approach.",

To understand why voters could not cast a vote 42% of the time and verify that their ballots were cast and counted with the tested e2e systems 53% of the time, we reviewed data collected during a system usability study. An analysis of the findings revealed subjects were most often not able to vote with Helios because they did not log in after encrypting their ballot but before casting it. For both Pr\u00eat \u00e0 Voter and Scantegrity II, failing to vote was most frequently attributed to not scanning the completed ballot. Across all three systems, the most common reason participants did not verify their vote was due to not casting a ballot in the first place. While there were numerous usability failures identified in the study, these errors can likely be designed out of the systems. This formative information can be used to avoid making the same types of mistakes in the next generation of voting systems\u2014ultimately resulting in more usable e2e methods.",

The underlying geometric model for the volume is provided by a mass-spring representation. It is augmented by a realistic mechanical model. The latter permits the computation of the shape of the considered object with respect to the grasping constraints by minimizing the energy function of the deformation of the object. Previous research in planning for deformable objects considered the case of elastic plates and proposed a randomized framework for planning paths for plates under manipulation constraints. The present paper modifies and extends the previously proposed framework to handle simple volumes. Our planner builds a roadmap in the configuration space.

The problem is compounded by the fact that algorithm performance can be highly dependent on parameter settings. This paper shows that hyperparameter optimization is an effective tool in both algorithm selection and parameter tuning over a given set of motion planning problems. We present different loss functions for optimization that capture different notions of optimality. The approach is evaluated on a broad range of scenes using two different manipulators, a Fetch and a Baxter. We show that optimized planning algorithm performance significantly improves upon baseline performance and generalizes broadly in the sense that performance improvements carry over to problems that are very different from the ones considered during optimization.",

Randomized techniques have shown great performance in high-dimensional configuration spaces and are now the methods of choice for complex problems.

PRM is a simple and widely used planner applicable to virtually any kind of robot. The underlying idea is to build a roadmap in the configuration space. The nodes in the roadmap correspond to feasible configurations selected at random, and the edges correspond to feasible path segments. In the query phase, the initial and goal configurations are connected to the roadmap, and then the planner searches for a shortest path. The contribution of this paper is a new scheme for the lazy evaluation of the feasibility of the roadmap. We apply the scheme to PRM and obtain a planner called Lazy PRM. The overall theme of the algorithm is to increase speed by only exploring the part of the roadmap that is necessary for the current query. Lazy PRM is tailored to efficiently answer single planning queries, but can also be used for multiple queries. Experimental results provided in this paper show that our lazy method is very efficient in practice.",

Employing this result, we are able to cast the problem of kinodynamic motion planning to a geometric one, which can be usually solved more efficiently since it does not take into account the robot dynamics (a.k.a. differential constraints).

Because of the high degree of binding site similarity shared among protein kinases, designing drug compounds with high specificity among the kinases has proven difficult. However, computational approaches to comparing the 3-dimensional geometry and physicochemical properties of key binding site residue positions have been shown to be informative of inhibitor selectivity. The Combinatorial Clustering Of Residue Position Subsets (ccorps) method, introduced here, provides a semi-supervised learning approach for identifying structural features that are correlated with a given set of annotation labels. Here, ccorps is applied to the problem of identifying structural features of the kinase atp binding site that are informative of inhibitor binding. ccorps is demonstrated to make perfect or near-perfect predictions for the binding affinity profile of 8 of the 38 kinase inhibitors studied, while only having overall poor predictive ability for 1 of the 38 compounds. Additionally, ccorps is shown to identify shared structural features across phylogenetically diverse groups of kinases that are correlated with binding affinity for particular inhibitors; such instances of structural similarity among phylogenetically diverse kinases are also shown to not be rare among kinases. Finally, these function-specific structural features may serve as potential starting points for the development of highly specific kinase inhibitors.",

Knot untangling can be viewed as a high-dimensional planning problem in reparameterizable configuration spaces. In the past, simulated annealing and other energy minimization methods have been used to find knot untangling paths. We develop a probabilistic planner that is capable of untangling knots described by over four hundred variables and known difficult benchmarks in this area more quickly than has been achieved with minimization in the literature. The use of motion planning techniques was critical for the untangling. Our planner defines local goals and makes combined use of energy minimization and randomized tree-based planning. We also show how to produce candidates with minimal number of segments for a given knot. Finally, we discuss some possible applications of our \u2026",

Current approaches have however either assumed the knowledge of differential one-forms related to a skeletonization of the collision space, or have relied on a simplicial representation of the free space. Both of these approaches are currently however not yet practical for higher dimensional configuration spaces. We propose 2D topological task projections (TTPs): mappings from the configuration space to 2-dimensional spaces where simplicial complex filtrations and persistent homology can identify topological properties of the high-dimensional free configuration space. Our approach only requires the availability of collision free samples to identify winding centers that can be used to determine homotopy inequivalent trajectories. We \u2026",

The planner uses sampling-based techniques and game-theoretic approaches to generate a series of plans and decision choices that increase the chances of success within a fixed time budget. The planning algorithm consists of two phases: exploration and strategy improvement. During the exploration phase, a search tree is grown in the hybrid state space by sampling state and control spaces for a fixed amount of time. An initial strategy is then computed over the search tree using a game-theoretic approach. To mitigate the effects of nondeterminism in the initial strategy, the strategy improvement phase extends new tree branches to the goal, using the data that is collected in the first phase. The efficacy of this planner is demonstrated on simulation of two hybrid and nondeterministic car-like robots in \u2026",

The setup in this work considers that each robot replans its own trajectory for the next replanning cycle. The planning process must guarantee the robot\u2019s safety by ensuring collision-free paths for the considered period and by not bringing the robot to states where collisions cannot be avoided in the future.

In this paper, we propose a computational screening method that predicts whether a given pair of molecules form a caging complex.

A reason might be an often overlooked factor in these computational efforts: receptor flexibility. To address this issue we have implemented a computational tool for ensemble docking with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We have extracted representative ensembles of protein conformations from the Protein Data Bank and from in silico molecular dynamics simulations.

Docking tools are largely used for virtual screening of small drug-like molecules, but their accuracy and efficiency greatly decays for ligands with more than 10 flexible bonds. This prevents a broader use of these tools to dock larger ligands, such as peptides, which are molecules of growing interest in cancer research. To overcome this limitation, our group has previously proposed a meta-docking strategy, called DINC, to predict binding modes of large ligands. By incrementally docking overlapping fragments of a ligand, DINC allowed predicting binding modes of peptide-based inhibitors of transcription factors involved in cancer.

However, many metabolic pathfinding tools that assist in identifying possible solution pathways fail to facilitate the grouping and interpretation of these pathway results. Clustering possible solution pathways can help users of pathfinding tools quickly identify major patterns and unique pathways without having to sift through individual results one by one. In this paper, we assess the ability of three separate clustering methods (hierarchical, k-means, and k-medoids) along with three pair-wise distance measures (Levenshtein, Jaccard, and n-gram) to expertly group lysine, isoleucine, and 3-hydroxypropanoic acid (3-HP) biosynthesis pathways. The quality of the resulting clusters were quantitatively evaluated against expected pathway groupings taken from the literature. Hierarchical clustering and Levenshtein distance seemed to best match external pathway labels across the three biosynthesis pathways. The lysine biosynthesis pathways, which had the most distinct separation of pathways, had better quality clusters than isoleucine and 3-HP, suggesting that grouping pathways with more complex underlying topologies may require more tailored clustering methods.",

The framework combines a multi-scaling geometric sampling and energetic refinement of protein conformations with a statistical mechanics formulation to obtain a Boltzmann distribution of the conformations that are feasible at equilibrium. The framework readily allows for integration of various sampling strategies with energetic refinement through different force fields. Applications on proteins of various folds and sizes reveal that the framework generates equilibrium ensembles that are in very good quantitative agreement with NMR-measured macroscopic properties of various timescales. The good agreement between obtained equilibrium fluctuations with order parameters, scalar couplings, and residual dipolar couplings indicates that the framework can complement current standard simulation techniques in pushing the timescale limitation of modeling protein motions beyond nanoseconds. Latest advances in the development of this framework and representative applications will be presented.",

            "Abstract": "In automated assembly, before parts can be put together, they often have to be appropriately oriented and positioned. The device performing this task is generally referred to as a part feeder. A new class of devices for non-prehensile distributed manipulation, such as MEMS actuator arrays, vibrating plates, etc., provide an alternative to traditional mechanical platforms for part feeding. These devices can be abstracted as programmable vector fields. Manipulation plans for these devices can therefore be considered as strategies for applying a sequence of fields to bring parts to some desired configurations. Typically, to uniquely orient and position a part, several fields have to be sequentially employed. Previously, it has been proven that there exists a combination of the unit radial field and a constant field that induces a unique stable equilibrium for almost any part. However, that work focuses mainly on an existential \u2026",

In this paper we study how to efficiently derive three-dimensional molecular conformations from the values of torsional angles. This case is of broad interest as torsional angles greatly affect molecular shape and are always taken into account during simulations. We first review two widely used methods for deriving molecular conformations, the simple rotations scheme and the Denavit-Hartenberg local frames method. We discuss their disadvantages which include extensive bookkeeping, accumulation of numerical errors, and redundancies in the local frames used. Then we introduce a new, fast, and accurate method called the atomgroup local frames method. This new method not only eliminates the disadvantages of earlier approaches but also \u2026",

However, determining an optimal policy for POMDPs is often intractable for robotic tasks due to the PSPACE-complete nature of the computation required. Several recent solvers have been introduced that expand the size of problems that can be considered. Although these POMDP solvers can respect complex motion constraints in theory, we show that the computational cost does not provide a benefit in the eventual online execution, compared to our alternative approach that relies on a policy that ignores some of the motion constraints. We advocate using the POMDP framework where it is critical--to find a policy that provides the optimal action given all past noisy sensor observations, while abstracting some of the motion constraints to reduce solution time. However, the actions of an abstract robot are generally not executable under its true motion constraints. The problem is addressed offline with a less-constrained POMDP, and navigation under the full system constraints is handled online with replanning. We empirically demonstrate that the policy generated using this abstracted motion model is faster to compute and achieves similar or higher reward than addressing the motion constraints for a car-like robot as used in our experiments directly in the POMDP.",

The motion of the system is abstracted to a class of uncertain Markov models known as bounded-parameter Markov decision processes (BMDPs). During the abstraction, an efficient sampling-based method for stochastic optimal control is used to construct several policies within a discrete region of the state space in order for the system to transit between neighboring regions. A BMDP is then used to find an optimal strategy over the local policies by maximizing a continuous reward function; a new policy can be computed quickly if the reward function changes. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated using a sequence of online tasks, showing that highly desirable policies can be obtained by reconfiguring existing local policies in just a few seconds.",

Robotics has traditionally treated these issues in isolation. Reasoning about discrete events is referred to as task planning, while reasoning about and computing continuous motions is in the realm of motion planning.

            "Abstract": "The Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a central protein in immunology as it binds to intracellular peptides and displays them at the cell surface for recognition by T-cells. The structural analysis of bound peptide-MHC complexes (pMHCs) holds the promise of interpretable and general binding prediction (ie, testing whether a given peptide binds to a given MHC). However, structural analysis is limited in part by the difficulty in modelling pMHCs given the size and flexibility of the peptides that can be presented by MHCs. This article describes APE-Gen (Anchored Peptide-MHC Ensemble Generator), a fast method for generating ensembles of bound pMHC conformations. APE-Gen generates an ensemble of bound conformations by iterated rounds of (i) anchoring the ends of a given peptide near known pockets in the binding site of the MHC,(ii) sampling peptide backbone conformations with loop modelling, and then (iii) performing energy minimization to fix steric clashes, accumulating conformations at each round. APE-Gen takes only minutes on a standard desktop to generate tens of bound conformations, and we show the ability of APE-Gen to sample conformations found in X-ray crystallography even when only sequence information is used as input. APE-Gen has the potential to be useful for its scalability (ie, modelling thousands of pMHCs or even non-canonical longer peptides) and for its use as a flexible search tool. We demonstrate an example for studying cross-reactivity. View Full-Text",

Our algorithm employs the heuristic that nearby configurations are likely to be invalidated by the same change. To find diverse short paths, the algorithm finds the shortest detour avoiding a collection of balls imposed on the graph as simulated obstacles. Different collections yield different short paths. Paths may then be checked for validity as a cheap alternative to checking or reconstructing the entire roadmap.

The first relates to the use of motion planning algorithms to determine whether robots can reach \u201cgood\u201d positions that offer the most informative measurements. The second concerns the use of predictive sensing to decide where sensor measurements should be taken. The problem is formulated similar to a next-best-view problem with differential constraints on the robots\u2019 motion, with additional layers of complexity due to visual occlusions as well as navigational obstacles. We propose a new distributed sensing strategy that exploits the structure of image manifolds to predict the utility of the measurements at a given position. This information is encoded in a cost map that guides a motion planning algorithm. Coordination among robots is achieved by incorporating additional information in each robot\u2019s cost map.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their modifications are often used to learn latent state representations from high-dimensional observations such as images of the scene. This approach uses the similarity between observations in the space of images as a proxy for estimating similarity between the underlying states of the system. We argue that, despite some successful implementations, this approach is not applicable in the general case where observations contain task-irrelevant factors of variation. We compare different methods to learn latent representations for a box stacking task and show that models with weak supervision such as Siamese networks with a simple contrastive loss produce more useful representations than traditionally used autoencoders for the final downstream manipulation task.",

To address this problem, we present the Match Augmentation algorithm (MA). Given a structural motif of interest, such as a functional site, MA searches a target protein structure for a match: the set of atoms with the greatest geometric and chemical similarity. MA is extremely efficient because it exploits the fact that the amino acids in a structural motif are not equally important to function. Using motif residues ranked on functional significance via the Evolutionary Trace (ET), MA prioritizes its search by initially forming matches with functionally significant residues, then, guided by ET, it augments this partial match stepwise until the whole motif is found. With this hierarchical strategy, MA runs considerably faster than other methods, and almost always identifies matches in homologs known to have cognate \u2026",

It is now widely accepted that conformational changes of proteins can critically affect their ability to bind other molecules and that any progress in modeling protein motion and flexibility will contribute to the understanding of key biological functions. However, modeling protein flexibility has proven a very difficult task. Experimental laboratory methods such as X-ray crystallography produce rather few structures, while computational methods such as Molecular Dynamics are too slow for routine use with large systems. A medium sized protein typically has a few thousands of degrees of freedom. This paper shows how to obtain a reduced basis representation of protein flexibility.

This work automatically extracts structural reaction coordinates from the analysis of a sample of conformations from a protein folding simulation, using only conformational shape similarity. This is achieved by applying non-linear dimensionality reduction to the set of conformational samples. A free energy surface computed this way effectively captures important features in the folding landscape of the SH3 protein domain, such as the main folding route and the transition state ensemble, verified trough an independent analysis of folding probability. The coordinates also capture other features not easily retrievable by classic methods, such as alternate folding routes.",

            "Abstract": "Docking large ligands, and especially peptides, to protein receptors is still considered a challenge in computational structural biology. Besides the issue of accurately scoring the binding modes of a protein-ligand complex produced by a molecular docking tool, the conformational sampling of a large ligand is also often considered a challenge because of its underlying combinatorial complexity. In this study, we evaluate the impact of using parallelized and incremental paradigms on the accuracy and performance of conformational sampling when docking large ligands. We use five datasets of protein-ligand complexes involving ligands that could not be accurately docked by classical protein-ligand docking tools in previous similar studies. Our computational evaluation shows that simply increasing the amount of conformational sampling performed by a protein-ligand docking tool, such as Vina, by running it for longer is rarely beneficial. Instead, it is more efficient and advantageous to run several short instances of this docking tool in parallel and group their results together, in a straightforward parallelized docking protocol. Even greater accuracy and efficiency are achieved by our parallelized incremental meta-docking tool, DINC, showing the additional benefits of its incremental paradigm. Using DINC, we could accurately reproduce the vast majority of the protein-ligand complexes we considered. Our study suggests that, even when trying to dock large ligands to proteins, the conformational sampling of the ligand should no longer be considered an issue, as simple docking protocols using existing tools can solve it. Therefore, scoring should \u2026",

A top-down framework is proposed that abstracts the motion of a continuous stochastic system to a discrete, bounded-parameter Markov decision process (bmdp), and then computes a control policy over the product of the bmdp abstraction and a dfa representing the temporal logic specification. Analysis of the framework reveals that as the resolution of the bmdp abstraction becomes finer, the policy obtained converges to optimal.

            "Abstract": "Robot software combines the challenges of general purpose and real-time software, requiring complex logic and bounded resource use. Physical safety, particularly for dynamic systems such as humanoid robots, depends on correct software. General purpose computation has converged on unix-like operating systems -- standardized as POSIX, the Portable Operating System Interface -- for devices from cellular phones to supercomputers. The modular, multi-process design typical of POSIX applications is effective for building complex and reliable software. Absent from POSIX, however, is an interproccess communication mechanism that prioritizes newer data as typically desired for control of physical systems. We address this need in the Ach communication library which provides suitable semantics and performance for real-time robot control. Although initially designed for humanoid robots, Ach has broader applicability to complex mechatronic devices -- humanoid and otherwise -- that require real-time coupling of sensors, control, planning, and actuation. The initial user space implementation of Ach was limited in the ability to receive data from multiple sources. We remove this limitation by implementing Ach as a Linux kernel module, enabling Ach's high-performance and latest-message-favored semantics within conventional POSIX communication pipelines. We discuss how these POSIX interfaces and design principles apply to robot software, and we present a case study using the Ach kernel module for communication on the Baxter robot.",

Within this class of algorithms, many variants have been proposed over the last 20 years, yet there is still no characterization of which algorithms are well-suited for which classes of problems. This has motivated us to develop a benchmarking infrastructure for motion planning algorithms. It consists of three main components. First, we have created an extensive benchmarking software framework that is included with the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL), a C++ library that contains implementations of many sampling-based algorithms. Second, we have defined extensible formats for storing benchmark results. The formats are fairly straightforward so that other planning libraries could easily produce compatible output. Finally, we have created an interactive, versatile visualization tool for compact presentation of collected benchmark data. The tool and underlying database facilitate the analysis of performance across benchmark problems and planners.",

A robot must have the capability to move autonomously and make decisions on how to accomplish its task without any human intervention. From this perspective, examples would include mobile robots used in space exploration, or looking a bit into the future, autonomous intelligent cars. Other people think of robots more in the context of industrial automation. In this context, a robot is typically a robotic arm used in assembly lines, for example in car manufacturing. Those robots tend to perform the same repetitive motions in their highly controlled and predictable environment. Precision and accuracy are paramount for this kind of robots. Finally, it is not uncommon to treat a part or even a molecule as a robot. A major issue in production lines is how to process parts that arrive at random orientations and have to be oriented in a certain way before they are used for assembly. During the last few years, it has become a very important area of research to identify how big molecules-such as proteins-move, by adapting ideas that were initially developed for robots. This chapter covers some of the fundamental principles and presents several examples of algorithms that are currently used in robotics.Robot algorithms differ in significant ways from traditional computer algorithms. The latter have full control over, and perfect access to the data they use, letting aside, for example, problems related to floating-point arithmetic. In contrast, robot algorithms eventually apply to physical objects in the real world, which they attempt to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Protein conformational motions play a critical role in biochemical catalysis. Through anharmonic conformational deformations during the course of its function a protein can change the chemical environment of its reactive site in order to bind substrates and catalyze reactions. An illustrative example of these changes is the opening and closing of the binding site of HIV-1 protease (HIV Pr) that results from conformational changes in the flaps region covering the reactive site. HIV Pr is a protease which plays a vital role in the maturation of the HIV-1 virus by targeting amino acid sequences in the gag and gag-pol polyproteins. Cleavage of these polyproteins produces proteins that contribute to the structure of the virion, RNA packaging, and condensation of the nucleoprotein core. Due to its large medical importance this protein has been studied extensively by experimental as well as computational methods and has been a successful target for rational drug design. In this work we analyzed a molecular dynamics trajectory (1.4 ns) of a fully hydrated HIV Pr homodimer using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method. Given the large number of degrees of freedom in a protein, the best way to analyze conformational motions is to obtain a representation for the dynamics trajectory in a lower dimensional basis. One method to achieve this simplification is to use the SVD method to perform a change of basis from individual cartesian degrees of freedom for each atom in the protein to a basis formed by an equal number of collective modes of motion. Using this formulation the conformational space accessible to a protein is separated into two subspaces \u2026",

Typical strategies either build a roadmap, or a tree as the underlying search structure that connects sampled configurations, with a focus on guaranteeing completeness and optimality as the number of samples tends to infinity. Roadmap-based planners allow preprocessing the space, and can solve multiple kinematic motion planning problems, but need a steering function to connect pairwise-states. Such steering functions are difficult to define for kinodynamic systems, and limit the applicability of roadmaps to motion planning problems with dynamical systems. Recent advances in the analysis of single-query tree-based planners has shown that forward search trees based on random propagations are asymptotically optimal. The current work \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Immunotherapy has become one of the most promising avenues for cancer treatment, making use of the patient\u2019s own immune system to eliminate cancer cells. Clinical trials with T-cell-based immunotherapies have shown dramatic tumor regressions, being effective in multiple cancer types and for many different patients. Unfortunately, this progress was tempered by reports of serious (even fatal) side effects. Such therapies rely on the use of cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes, an essential part of the adaptive immune system. Cytotoxic T-cells are regularly involved in surveillance and are capable of both eliminating diseased cells and generating protective immunological memory. The specificity of a given T-cell is determined through the structural interaction between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and a peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC); i.e., an intracellular peptide-ligand displayed at the cell surface by an MHC receptor. However, a given TCR can recognize different peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes, which can sometimes trigger an unwanted response that is referred to as T-cell cross-reactivity. This has become a major safety issue in T-cell-based immunotherapies, following reports of melanoma-specific T-cells causing cytotoxic damage to healthy tissues (e.g., heart and nervous system). T-cell cross-reactivity has been extensively studied in the context of viral immunology and tissue transplantation. Growing evidence suggests that it is largely driven by structural similarities of seemingly unrelated pMHC complexes. Here we review recent reports about the existence of pMHC \"hot-spots\" for cross-reactivity and propose the existence of \u2026",

Unfortunately, experimental determination of protein function is expensive and time consuming. For this reason, algorithms for computational function prediction have been developed to focus and accelerate this effort. These algorithms are comparison techniques which identify matches of geometric and chemical similarity between motifs, representing known functional sites, and substructures of functionally uncharacterized proteins (targets). Matches of statistically significant geometric and chemical similarity can identify targets with active sites cognate to the matching motif. Unfortunately, statistically significant matches can include false positive matches to functionally unrelated proteins. We target this problem by presenting Cavity Aware Match Augmentation (CAMA), a technique which uses C-spheres to represent active clefts which must remain vacant for ligand binding. CAMA rejects matches to targets without similar binding volumes. On 18 sample motifs, we observed that introducing C\u2014spheres eliminated 80% of false positive matches and maintained 87% of true positive matches found with identical motifs lacking C-spheres. Analyzing a range of C-sphere positions and sizes, we observed that some high-impact C\u2013spheres eliminate more false positive matches than others. High-impact C-spheres can be detected with a geometric analysis we call Cavity Scaling, permitting us to refine our initial cavity-aware motifs to contain only high-impact C\u2014spheres.

In this paper, we study the combination of a unit radial field with a small constant force field. In prior work we proved that such a combination can uniquely position a class of non-symmetric parts. In this paper, we propose a more complete modeling of this combination which allows us to devise a method to determine all the equilibrium configurations of a part in the above force fields. This method works for both symmetric and non-symmetric parts.

            "Abstract": "Planning robust executions under uncertainty is a fundamental challenge for building autonomous robots. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a standard framework for modeling uncertainty in many applications. In this work, we study POMDPs with safe-reachability objectives, which require that with a probability above some threshold, a goal state is eventually reached while keeping the probability of visiting unsafe states below some threshold. This POMDP formulation is different from the traditional POMDP models with optimality objectives and we show that in some cases, POMDPs with safe-reachability objectives can provide a better guarantee of both safety and reachability than the existing POMDP models through an example. A key algorithmic problem for POMDPs is policy synthesis, which requires reasoning over a vast space of beliefs (probability distributions). To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of a goal-constrained belief space, which only contains beliefs reachable from the initial belief under desired executions that can achieve the given safe-reachability objective. Our method compactly represents this space over a bounded horizon using symbolic constraints, and employs an incremental Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to efficiently search for a valid policy over it. We evaluate our method using a case study involving a partially observable robotic domain with uncertain obstacles. The results show that our method can synthesize policies over large belief spaces with a small number of SMT solver calls by focusing on the goal-constrained belief space.",

To address this problem, we present the Match Augmentation algorithm (MA). Given a structural motif of interest, such as a functional site, MA searches a target protein structure for a match: the set of atoms with the greatest geometric and chemical similarity. MA is extremely efficient because it exploits the fact that the amino acids in a structural motif are not equally important to function. Using motif residues ranked on functional significance via the Evolutionary Trace (ET), MA prioritizes its search by initially forming matches with functionally significant residues, then, guided by ET, it augments this partial match stepwise until the whole motif is found. With this hierarchical strategy, MA runs considerably faster than other methods, and almost always identifies matches in homologs known to have cognate functional sites. Second, in order to interpret matches, we further introduce a statistical method using nonparametric density estimation of the frequency distribution of structural matches. Our results show that the hierarchy of functional importance within structural motifs speeds up the search within targets, and points to a new method to score their statistical significance.",

A grid-based discretization is used to estimate the coverage of the state space. The coverage estimates help the planner detect the less-explored areas of the state space. An important characteristic of this discretization is that it keeps track of the boundary of the explored region of the state space and focuses exploration on the less covered parts of this boundary. Extensive experiments show that KPIECE provides significant computational gain over existing state-of-the-art methods and allows us to solve some harder, previously unsolvable problems. For some problems, KPIECE is shown to be up to two orders of magnitude \u2026",

The vehicles are able to communicate within limited range. Their objective is to avoid collisions between them and with the obstacles, while the vehicles move towards their goals. An important issue of real-time planning for systems with bounded acceleration is that inevitable collision states must also be avoided. The focus of this paper is to guarantee safety despite the dynamic constraints with a decentralized motion planning technique that employs only local information. We propose a coordination framework that allows vehicles to generate and select compatible sets of valid trajectories and prove that this scheme guarantees collision-avoidance in the specified setup.

The first approach, Path-Directed Subdivision Tree (PDST-EXPLORE), introduced a deterministic selection process for expanding a tree data-structure in the state space. PDST-EXPLORE quickly covers the state space by combining information from an adaptive subdivision mechanism and a priority scheme. It avoids the use of metrics, which are difficult to define for such systems, and is probabilistically complete. The planner has been integrated with maneuver automata and physical simulators to generate trajectories for different types of vehicles. An alternative version of the planner uses low-dimensional kinematic information to bias exploration, while still achieving probabilistic completness with the help of the same priority scheme. The Greedy Incremental Path-Directed planner (GRIP) uses the biased exploration strategy to solve problems that require online replanning. GRIP reuses computations between consecutive planning cycles and guarantees collision avoidance when replanning among static obstacles. It follows a lazy evaluation approach to reduce the overhead of avoiding inevitable collision states.",

This means many problems are multi-modal and in particular have a continuous infinity of modes. For example, in a pick-and-place manipulation domain, every grasp and placement of an object is a mode. Usually manipulation problems require the robot to transition into different modes, e.g., going from a mode with an object placed to another mode with the object grasped. To successfully find a manipulation plan, a planner must find a sequence of valid single-mode motions as well as valid transitions between these modes.

In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of these solvers in integrated task and motion planning (ITMP) for robots performing mobile manipulation. Specifically, we present a system\u2014called ROBOSYNTH\u2014for integrated task and motion planning that uses discrete search based on SMT-solvers as a complement to motion planning algorithms. As far as we know, this is the first application of SMT-solving in ITMP. The inputs to our version of ITMP are:(1) a scene description that specifies the physical space that the robot manipulates;(2) a plan outline that syntactically defines a space of plausible integrated plans; and (3) a set of logical requirements that we want the generated plan to satisfy. Given these inputs, our method uses a motion planning algorithm to construct a discrete placement graph whose paths represent feasible, lowlevel motion plans. An SMT-solver is now used to symbolically explore the space of all integrated plans that correspond to paths in the placement graph, and also satisfy the constraints demanded by the plan outline and the requirements. We have evaluated our approach on a generalization of an ITMP problem investigated in prior work. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of generating integrated plans that are interesting in a qualitative sense. We also find the method to scale well with an increase in the number of objects and locations manipulated, as well as the size of the space of plausible integrated plans.",

However, identifying suitable printing conditions for new materials requires extensive experimentation in a time and resource-demanding process. This study investigates the use of Machine Learning (ML) for distinguishing between printing configurations that are likely to result in low quality prints and printing configurations that are more promising as a first step towards the development of a recommendation system for identifying suitable printing conditions. The ML-based framework takes as input the printing conditions regarding the material composition and the printing parameters and predicts the quality of the resulting print as either\" low\" or\" high\". We investigate two ML-based approaches: a direct classification-based approach that trains a classifier to distinguish between\" low\" and\" high\" quality prints and an indirect approach that uses a regression ML model that approximates the values of a printing quality metric. Both models are built upon Random Forests. We trained and evaluated the models on a dataset that was generated in a previous study which investigated fabrication of porous polymer scaffolds by means of extrusion-based 3D printing with a full-factorial design. Our results show that both models were able to correctly label the majority of the tested configurations while a simpler linear ML model was not effective. Additionally our analysis showed that a full factorial design for data collection can lead to redundancies in the data, in the context of ML, and we propose a more efficient data collection \u2026",

Knot untangling can be viewed as a high-dimensional planning problem in reparametrizable configuration spaces. In the past, simulated annealing and other energy minimization methods have been used to find knot untangling paths. We have developed a probabilistic planner that is capable of untangling knots described by over 400 variables. We have tested on known difficult benchmarks in this area and untangled them more quickly than has been achieved with minimization in the literature. In this work, the use of motion planning techniques is critical for the untangling. Our planner defines local goals and makes combined use of energy minimization and randomized tree-based planning. We also show how to produce candidates with a minimal number of segments for a given knot. The planner developed in this work is novel in that it is used to study issues arising in practical motion planning for high-dimensional and reparametrizable geometry. The use of energy methods, local goals and tree-based expansion is also novel and may suggest solutions in other planning applications.

Compared with other fields, robotics is special in that it aims to enable an embodied agent to interact with the world physically. Traditionally, the field of robotics has been dominated by the desire to find strong models based on first principles such as rigid body dynamics or multiple-view geometry that relate the perceptual input to the action output or to predict the perceptual response to a certain action. This worked well in a factory world with well-defined inputs and outputs. Yet, for years, it has been a challenge for robots to move out of \u2026",

The recognition of these peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes by T-cells is the cornerstone of cellular immunity, enabling the elimination of infected or tumoral cells. T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer, which leverage this mechanism, can greatly benefit from structural analyses of pMHC complexes. Several attempts have been made to use molecular docking for such analyses, but pMHC structure remains too challenging for even state-of-the-art docking tools. To overcome these limitations, we describe the use of an incremental meta-docking approach for structural prediction of pMHC complexes. Previous methods applied in this context used specific constraints to reduce the complexity of this prediction problem, at the expense of generality. Our strategy \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning is a promising paradigm for robotic control which has been shown to be capable of learning policies for high-dimensional, continuous control of unmodeled systems. However, RoboticReinforcement Learning currently lacks clearly defined benchmark tasks, which makes it difficult for researchers to reproduce and compare against prior work. ``Reacher'' tasks, which are fundamental to robotic manipulation, are commonly used as benchmarks, but the lack of a formal specification elides details that are crucial to replication. In this paper we present a novel empirical analysis which shows that the unstated spatial constraints in commonly used implementations of Reacher tasks make it dramatically easier to learn a successful control policy with DeepDeterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), a state-of-the-art Deep RL algorithm. Our analysis suggests that less constrained Reacher tasks are significantly more difficult to learn, and hence that existing de facto benchmarks are not representative of the difficulty of general robotic manipulation.",

The Bug1 and Bug2 algorithms [289] are among the earliest and simplest sensor-based planners with provable guarantees. These algorithms assume the robot is a point operating in the plane with a contact sensor or a zero range sensor to detect obstacles. When the robot has a finite range (non-zero range) sensor, then the Tangent Bug algorithm [208] is a Bug derivative that can use that sensor information to find shorter paths to the goal. The Bug and Bug-like algorithms are straightforward to implement; moreover, a simple analysis shows that their success is guaranteed, when possible. These algorithms require two behaviors: move on a straight line and follow a boundary. To handle boundary-following, we introduce a curve-tracing technique based on the implicit function theorem at the end of this chapter. This technique is general to following any path, but we focus on following a boundary at a fixed distance.",

Thus dynamic and localized force fields can be used for part manipulation. This paper presents a novel strategy to assemble two parts with a sequence of static and dynamic programmable force fields.

Synthesizing these traditionally plant-derived compounds in genetically modified yeast cells introduces the possibility of significantly reducing the total time and resources required for their production, and in turn, allows these valuable compounds to become cheaper and more readily available. Most biosynthesis pathways used in metabolic engineering applications have been discovered manually, requiring a tedious search of existing literature and metabolic databases. However, the recent rapid development of available metabolic information has enabled the development of automated approaches for identifying novel pathways. Computer-assisted pathfinding has the potential to save biochemists time in the initial discovery steps of metabolic engineering. In this paper, we review the parameters and heuristics used to guide the search in recent pathfinding algorithms. These parameters and heuristics capture information on the metabolic network structure, compound structures, reaction features, and organism-specificity of pathways. No one metabolic pathfinding algorithm or search parameter stands out as the best to use broadly for solving the pathfinding problem, as each method and parameter has its own strengths and shortcomings.

This chapter reviews a class of methods for studying the folding process called roadmap methods. The goal of these methods is not to predict the folded structure of a protein, but rather to analyze the folding kinetics. It is assumed that the folded state is known. Roadmap methods maintain a graph representation of sampled conformations. By analyzing this graph one can predict structure formation order, the probability of folding, and get a coarse view of the energy landscape.",

            "Abstract": "We present a subdivision scheme for the construction of 3D minimal-energy curves of given length that satisfy endpoint constraints. When given desired positions and tangents for the endpoints, and the length of the curve, the scheme iteratively builds up a minimal-energy curve. During each iteration the algorithm solves a low-dimensional optimization problem, whereby the energy of the curve is lowered and at the same time the endpoint constraints are satisfied. The energy of the curve is defined as the integral of the curvature squared and the torsion squared. With this energy function, minimal-energy curves correspond to stable configurations of flexible inextensible wires. A curve is represented by segments of piecewise constant curvature and torsion. The representation is adaptive in the sense that the number of parameters automatically varies with the complexity of the underlying curve. This scheme has been implemented and simulation results show that it typically quickly converges to very smooth curves. Our minimal-energy curve framework can be extended to minimal-energy curves of fixed length that pass through several control points and tangents. This work has applications in modeling flexible inextensible wires such as surgical sutures.",

We also present an algorithm for computing all achievable velocities at the end of a path given an initial range of velocities. This algorithm effectively computes bundles of feasible trajectories for a given path and is a first step toward a new generation of more efficient kinodynamic motion planning algorithms.

However, observations commonly contain task-irrelevant factors of variation which are nonetheless important for reconstruction, such as varying lighting and different camera viewpoints. In this work, we define relevant evaluation metrics and perform a thorough study of different loss functions for state representation learning.

            "Abstract": "Programmable force fields have been used as an abstraction to represent a whole new class of devices that have been proposed for part manipulation. The general idea behind these devices is that a force field is implemented in a plane upon which the part is placed. The forces and torques exerted on the contact surface of the part translate and rotate the part. Manipulation plans for these devices can therefore be considered as strategies for applying a sequence of force fields to bring parts to some desired configuration. Instances of these novel devices are currently implemented using microelectromechanical systems technology, small airjets, vibration, and small motors. Manipulation in this case is sensorless and nonprehensile and promises to address the handling of very small or very fragile parts, such as electronics components, that cannot be handled with conventional pick-and-place robotics techniques. In this paper, the authors consider the problem of bringing a part to a stable equilibrium configuration using force fields. The authors study the combination of a unit radial field with a small constant field. A part placed on the radial field moves toward the origin of the radial field but cannot be oriented due to symmetry. Perturbing the radial field with a constant force field breaks the symmetry and gives rise to a finite number of equilibria. Under certain conditions, there is a unique stable equilibrium configuration. For the case in which these conditions are not fulfilled, the authors provide a comprehensive and unified analysis of the problem that leads to an algorithm to compute all stable equilibrium configurations.

Each robot communicates with its neighbors to select a trajectory that is safe over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach does not require synchronization and allows the robots to dynamically change their cycles over time.

For instance, a humanoid robot can open a door with its left arm or with its right arm. Thus, motion planning can be performed in the left arm's state space or in the right arm's state space. Given the specification of a task, it is shown how to encode the available motion planning options in a task motion multigraph.

The simplicity constraint can be enforced by allowing topological changes or by restricting motions of the curve.

Such problems can be modeled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with quantitative and qualitative objectives. In this paper, we present a new policy synthesis algorithm, called Policy Synthesis with Statistical Model Checking (PO-SMC), for such POMDPs. While previous policy synthesis approaches for this setting use symbolic tools (for example satisfiability solvers) to meet the qualitative requirements, our approach is based on Monte Carlo sampling and uses statistical model checking to ensure that the qualitative requirements are satisfied with high confidence. An appeal of statistical model checking is that it can handle rich temporal requirements such as safe-reachability, while being far more scalable than symbolic methods. The safe-reachability property combines the safety and reachability requirements as a single qualitative requirement. While our use of sampling introduces approximations that symbolic approaches do not require, we present theoretical results that show that the error due to approximation is bounded. Our experimental results demonstrate that PO-SMC consistently performs orders of magnitude faster than existing symbolic methods for policy synthesis under qualitative and quantitative requirements.",

Trajectories returned from the motion planner are followed using a path-following controller guaranteeing robustness. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with experiments based on floor plans gathered from real buildings.",

A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is employed to find optimal sensing and recognition actions with the goal of long-term classification accuracy. Heterogeneous resource constraints\u2014such as motion, number of measurements and bandwidth\u2014are explicitly modeled in the state variable, and a prohibitively high penalty is used to prevent the violation of any resource constraint. To improve recognition performance, we further incorporate discriminative classification models with POMDP, and customize the reward function and observation model correspondingly. The proposed model is validated on several data sets for multi-view, multi-modal vehicle classification and multi-view face recognition, and demonstrates improvement in both recognition and resource management over greedy methods and previous POMDP formulations.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes can be classified in two distinct categories that we will call class I and class II. Class I genes are housekeeping genes, often characterized by stable, noise resistant expression levels. In contrast, class II genes are stress-related genes and often have noisy, unstable expression levels. In this work we analyze the large scale transcription-regulatory networks (TRN) of E. coli and S. cerevisiae and preliminary data on H. sapien. We find that stable, housekeeping genes (class I) are preferentially utilized as transcriptional inputs while stress related, unstable genes (class II) are utilized as transcriptional integrators. This might be the result of convergent \u2026",

Data produced by HDX experiments is often interpreted using a crystal structure of the protein, when available. However, it has been shown that the correspondence between experimental HDX data and crystal structures is often not satisfactory. This creates difficulties when trying to perform a structural analysis of the HDX data. In this paper, we evaluate several strategies to obtain a conformation providing a good fit to the experimental HDX data, which is a premise of an accurate structural analysis. We show that performing molecular dynamics simulations can be inadequate to obtain such conformations, and we propose a novel methodology involving a coarse-grained conformational sampling approach instead. By extensively exploring the intrinsic flexibility of a protein with this approach, we produce a conformational ensemble from which we extract a single conformation providing a good fit to the experimental HDX data. We successfully demonstrate the applicability of our method to four small and medium-sized proteins.",

Firstly, we use a geometric planner to obtain a high-level safe path in a user-defined extended free space. Secondly, we develop a low-level funnel control algorithm that guarantees safe tracking of the path by the system. Neither the planner nor the control algorithm use information on the underlying dynamics of the system, which makes the proposed scheme easily distributable to a large variety of different systems and scenarios. Intuitively, the funnel control module is able to implicitly accommodate the dynamics of the system, allowing hence the deployment of purely geometrical motion planners. Extensive computer simulations and experimental results with a 6-DOF robotic arm validate the proposed approach.",

            "Abstract": "Efficiently maintaining molecular conformations is important for molecular modeling and protein engineering. This paper reviews the widely used simple rotations scheme, simple local frames method, and introduces a new atom group local frames method for maintaining the molecular conformation changes due to the changes of torsional angles. The simple rotations scheme applies a sequence of rotations to update all atom positions. The order of the updates is important and some bookkeeping of the atom positions is necessary. Numeric errors can accumulate as rotations around the bonds are repeated. The simple local frames method builds local frames at the bonds, and relational matrices between parents and children frames are constructed. The atom positions are computed by chaining series of such matrices. No bookkeeping is necessary and numeric errors do not accumulate upon rotations. Multiple local frames are needed at a bond if it has more than one child. This paper introduces a new atom group local frames method to efficiently maintain molecular conformations. A single local frame is attached to each atom group. Bookkeeping is not necessary and numeric errors do not accumulate upon rotations. This method also provides lazy evaluations for atom positions. Thus, the conformational maintenance cost is greatly reduced, especially when many conformations are generated and updated such as in a minimization process.",

Understanding this role is important for successful applications of DSLX to increasingly complex robotic systems. This work shows that the granularity of the workspace decomposition directly impacts computational efficiency: DSLX is faster when the decomposition is neither too fine-nor too coarse-grained. Finding the right level of granularity can require extensive fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that significant computational efficiency can instead be obtained with no fine-tuning by using conforming Delaunay \u2026",

Our curve representation is adaptive in the sense that the number of parameters automatically varies with the complexity of the underlying curve. We introduce a planner that computes paths from one minimal-energy curve to another such that all intermediate curves are also minimal-energy curves.

While the best performing predictors are based on machine learning algorithms trained on peptide-HLA (pHLA) sequences, the use of structure for training predictors deserves further exploration. Given enough pHLA structures, a predictor based on the residue-residue interactions found in these structures has the potential to generalize for alleles with little or no experimental data. We have previously developed APE-Gen, a modeling approach able to produce pHLA structures in a scalable manner. In this work we use APE-Gen to model over 150,000 pHLA structures, the largest dataset of its kind, which were used to train a structure-based pan-allele model. We extract simple, homogenous features based on residue-residue distances between peptide and HLA, and build a random forest model for predicting stable pHLA binding. Our model achieves competitive AUROC values on leave-one-allele-out validation tests using significantly less data when compared to popular sequence-based methods. Additionally, our model offers an interpretation analysis that can reveal how the model composes the features to arrive at any given prediction. This interpretation analysis can be used to check if the model is in line with chemical intuition, and we showcase particular examples. Our work is a significant step towards using structure to achieve generalizable and more interpretable prediction for stable pHLA binding.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel analysis of the probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) for path planning. We formulate the problem in terms of computing the transitive closure of a relation over a probability space, and give a bound on the expected number iterations of PRM required to find a path, in terms of the number of intermediate points and the probability of choosing a point from a certain set. Explicit geometric assumptions are not necessary to complete this analysis. As a result, the analysis provides some unification of previous work. We provide an upper bound which could be refined using details specific to a given problem. This bound is of the same form as that proved in previous analyses, but has simpler prerequisites and is proved on a more general class of problems. Using our framework, we analyze some new path-planning problems, 2k-degree-of-freedom kinodynamic point robots, polygonal robots with \u2026",

The overall theme of the algorithm, called Lazy PRM, is to minimize the number of collision checks performed during planning and hence minimize the running time of the planner. Our algorithm builds a roadmap in the configuration space, whose nodes are the user-defined initial and goal configurations and a number of randomly generated nodes. Neighboring nodes are connected by edges representing paths between the nodes. In contrast with PRMs, our planner initially assumes that all nodes and edges in the roadmap are collision-free, and searches the roadmap at hand for a shortest path between the initial and the goal node. The nodes and edges along the path are then checked for collision. If a collision with the obstacles occurs, the corresponding nodes and edges are removed from the roadmap.

To interpret and refine C3d's HDX-MS data, we look for a conformation (or conformational ensemble) of C3d that allows computationally replicating this data.

Our approach builds upon the previous work that represents POMDPs with Boolean objectives using symbolic constraints.

This paper describes the design, implementation and analysis of a system for determining position from measured RF signal strengths in the IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet network. Previous approaches in the location-aware field with RF signals have been severely hampered by non-linearity, noise and complex correlations due to multi-path effects, interference and absorption. The design of our system begins with the observation that determining position from complex, noisy and non-linear signals is a well-studied problem in the field of robotics. Using only off-the-shelf hardware, we achieve robust position estimation to within a meter in our experimental context and after adequate training of our system. Also, we can coarsely determine our orientation and can track our position as we move. By applying recent advances in probabilistic inference of position and sensor fusion from noisy signals, we show that the RF emissions from base stations as measured by off-the-shelf wireless Ethernet cards are sufficiently rich in information to permit a mobile device to reliable track its location.",

This paper presents an approach which addresses these types of systems by building on existing motion planning approaches. Guided Expansive Spaces Trees are introduced to search for a low cost and relatively straight path in a space with motion constraints. Path Gradient Descent, which builds on the idea of Elastic Strips, finds the locally optimal path for an existing path. These techniques are tested on simulations of rendezvous and docking of the space shuttle to the International Space Station and of a 4-foot fan-controlled blimp in a factory setting.",

Molecular docking is widely used to predict the structure of protein\u2013ligand complexes, and protein flexibility stands out as one of the most important and challenging issues for binding mode prediction.

Our work allows us to deal with the unknown environmental restrictions only when they are discovered and without the need to repeat the computation that is related to the temporal logic specification. In addition, we define a metric for satisfaction of a specification. We use this metric to plan a trajectory that satisfies the specification as closely as possible in cases in which the discovered constraint in the environment renders the specification unsatisfiable.

            "Abstract": "STAT3 is a transcription factor that has been found to be constitutively activated in a number of human cancers. Dimerization of STAT3 via its SH2 domain and the subsequent translocation of the dimer to the nucleus leads to transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. Prevention of the dimerization is thus an attractive strategy for inhibiting the activity of STAT3. Phosphotyrosine-based peptidomimetic inhibitors, which mimic pTyr-Xaa-Yaa-Gln motif and have strong to weak binding affinities, have been previously investigated. It is well-known that structures of protein-inhibitor complexes are important for understanding the binding interactions and designing stronger inhibitors. Experimental structures of inhibitors bound to the SH2 domain of STAT3 are, however, unavailable. In this paper we describe a computational study that combined molecular docking and molecular dynamics to model structures of 12 peptidomimetic inhibitors bound to the SH2 domain of STAT3. A detailed analysis of the modeled structures was performed to evaluate the characteristics of the binding interactions. We also estimated the binding affinities of the inhibitors by combining MMPB/GBSA-based energies and entropic cost of binding. The estimated affinities correlate strongly with the experimentally obtained affinities. Modeling results show binding modes that are consistent with limited previous modeling studies on binding interactions involving the SH2 domain and phosphotyrosine(pTyr)-based inhibitors. We also discovered a stable novel binding mode that involves deformation of two loops of the SH2 domain that subsequently bury the C-terminal end of one of the stronger \u2026",

Earlier work has shown that to efficiently find a task-motion plan, the discrete search can leverage information about the continuous geometry. However, incorporating continuous elements into discrete planners presents challenges. We improve the scalability of TMP algorithms in tabletop scenarios with a fixed robot by introducing geometric knowledge into a constraint-based task planner in a robust way. The key idea is to learn a classifier for feasible motions and to use this classifier as a heuristic to order the search for a task-motion plan. The learned heuristic guides the search toward feasible motions and, thus, reduces the total number of motion planning attempts. A critical property of our approach is allowing robust planning in diverse scenes. We train the classifier on minimal exemplar scenes and then use principled \u2026",

While there is significant work on how to plan under state uncertainty for low-DOF robots, existing methods cannot be easily translated into the high-DOF case, due to the complex geometry of the robot\u2019s body and its environment. In this paper, we present a method that enhances optimization-based motion planners to produce robust trajectories for high-DOF robots for convex obstacles. Our approach introduces robustness into planners that are based on sequential convex programming: We reformulate each convex subproblem as a robust optimization problem that \u201cprotects\u201d the solution against deviations due to sensing uncertainty. The parameters of the robust problem are estimated by sampling from the distribution of noisy obstacles, and performing a first-order approximation of the signed distance function. The original merit function is updated to account for the new costs of the robust formulation at every step. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on two simulated experiments that involve a full body square robot, that moves in randomly generated scenes, and a 7-DOF Fetch robot, performing tabletop operations. The results show nearly zero probability of collision for a reasonable range of the noise parameters for Gaussian and Uniform uncertainty.",

Despite the growing number of papers on three-dimensional conformational search, several questions remain open. In this paper we investigate one such question relating to molecular inverse kinematics problems. In these problems we are given an initial conformation of a molecule and the target positions of some feature atoms of the molecule. We wish to automatically compute a new conformation of the molecule that brings the feature atoms to their target positions. We first show how to derive a system of polynomial equations from the geometric constraints of the feature atoms. In contrast with previous work, we do not attempt to solve the system of equations directly, which is computationally expensive. Instead, we adopt a technique based on the Groebner basis from algebraic geometry and develop a novel subdivision algorithm to approximate the real solutions. The approximated solutions can then be used as the starting conformations for existing(heuristic) energy minimization procedures that try to satisfy the target positions of feature atoms and reduce the overall energy of the conformation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a rigorous algebraic methodology has been used to approximate molecular inverse kinematics solutions and the first time that a subdivision algorithm has been developed to efficiently locate the solutions.",

            "Abstract": "Many systems are naturally modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), combining probabilities and strategic actions. Given a model of a system as an MDP and some logical specification of system behavior, the goal of synthesis is to find a policy that maximizes the probability of achieving this behavior. A popular choice for defining behaviors is Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Policy synthesis on MDPs for properties specified in LTL has been well studied. LTL, however, is defined over infinite traces, while many properties of interest are inherently finite. Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) has been used to express such properties, but no tools exist to solve policy synthesis for MDP behaviors given finite-trace properties. We present two algorithms for solving this synthesis problem: the first via reduction of LTLf to LTL and the second using native tools for LTLf. We compare the scalability of these two approaches for synthesis and show that the native approach offers better scalability compared to existing automaton generation tools for LTL.",

A challenging aspect of this problem is how to utilize communication so that vehicles do not reach states from which collisions cannot be avoided due to second-order motion constraints. This paper provides a distributed communication protocol for realtime planning that guarantees collision avoidance with obstacles and between vehicles. It can also allow the retainment of a communication network when the vehicles operate as a networked team. The algorithm is a novel integration of sampling-based motion planners with message-passing protocols for distributed constraint optimization. Each vehicle uses the motion planner to generate candidate feasible trajectories and the messagepassing protocol for selecting a safe and compatible trajectory.

            "Abstract": "We present an approach to endow an autonomous underwater vehicle with the capabilities to move through unexplored environments. To do so, we propose a computational framework for planning feasible and safe paths. The framework allows the vehicle to incrementally build a map of the surroundings, while simultaneously (re)planning a feasible path to a specified goal. To accomplish this, the framework considers motion constraints to plan feasible 3D paths, that is, those that meet the vehicle\u2019s motion capabilities. It also incorporates a risk function to avoid navigating close to nearby obstacles. Furthermore, the framework makes use of two strategies to ensure meeting online computation limitations. The first one is to reuse the last best known solution to eliminate time-consuming pruning routines. The second one is to opportunistically check the states\u2019 risk of collision. To evaluate the proposed approach, we use the Sparus II performing autonomous missions in different real-world scenarios. These experiments consist of simulated and in-water trials for different tasks. The conducted tasks include the exploration of challenging scenarios such as artificial marine structures, natural marine structures, and confined natural environments. All these applications allow us to extensively prove the efficacy of the presented approach, not only for constant-depth missions (2D), but, more important, for situations in which the vehicle must vary its depth (3D)",

Our method provides a smooth spectrum between the PRM and BI-RRT techniques and obtains the advantages of both. We observed that the performance differences are most notable in planning instances with several rigid nonconvex robots in a scene with narrow passages.

PDST-EXPLORE is a general purpose planner but is designed to overcome difficulties inherent in planning for robots with non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, our planner represents samples as path segments rather than individual states and uses non-uniform subdivisions of the state space to estimate coverage. This change avoids many of the problems that previous sampling-based planners have had with milestone placement, metrics and coverage estimation.

The method assumes that the robot tracks visual features in panoramic views of the environment that it acquires as it moves. By exploiting only angular information regarding the tracked features, a local control strategy moves the robot between two positions, provided that there are at least three features that can be matched in the panoramas acquired at these positions. The strategy is successful when certain geometric constraints on the configuration of the two positions relative to the features are fulfilled. In order to achieve long-range homing, the features\u2019 trajectories are organized in a visual memory during the execution of the \u201cprior\u201d path.

In its simplest form, the solution to this problem consists of finding a path connecting two states, and the only constraint is to avoid collisions. Even for this version of the motion planning problem, there is no efficient solution for the general case [1]. The addition of differential constraints on robot motion or more general goal specifications makes motion planning even harder. Given its complexity, most planning algorithms forego completeness and optimality for slightly weaker notions such as resolution completeness, probabilistic completeness [2], and asymptotic optimality.",

            "Abstract": "Sampling-based search has been shown effective in motion planning, a hard continuous state-space problem. Motion planning is especially challenging when the robotic system obeys differential constraints, such as an acceleration controlled car that cannot move sideways. Methods that expand trajectory trees in the state space produce feasible solutions for such systems. These planners can be viewed as continuous-space analogs of traditional uninformed search as their goal is to explore the entire state space. In many cases, the search can be focused on the part of the state-space necessary to solve a problem by employing heuristics. This paper proposes an informed framework for tree-based planning that successfully balances greedy with methodical search. The framework allows the use of a broad set of heuristics for goaldirected problem solving, while avoiding scaling issues that appear in continuous space heuristic search. It also employs an appropriate discretization technique for continuous statespace problems, based on an adaptive subdivision scheme. Although greedy in nature, the method provides with probabilistic completeness guarantees for a very general class of planning problems. Experiments on dynamic systems simulated with a physics engine show that the technique outperforms uninformed planners and existing informed variants. In many cases, it also produces better quality paths.",

In this work, Markov Decision Processes are used in conjunction with TMMs to select sequences of actions that solve the STAMP problem such that the resulting solutions have higher probability of feasibility. Experimental evaluation indicates significantly improved probability of feasibility for solutions to the STAMP problem, compared to algorithms that ignore uncertainty information when selecting possible sequences of actions.

            "Abstract": "This paper presents the Discrete Search Lead-ing continuous eXploration (DSLX) planner, a multi-resolution approach to motion planning that is suitable for challenging problems involving robots with kinodynamic constraints. Initially the method decomposes the workspace to build a graph that encodes the physical adjacency of the decomposed regions. This graph is searched to obtain leads, that is, sequences of regions that can be explored with sampling-based tree methods to generate solution trajectories. Instead of treating the discrete search of the adjacency graph and the exploration of the continuous state space as separate components, DSLX passes information from one to the other in innovative ways. Each lead suggests what regions to explore and the exploration feeds back information to the discrete search to improve the quality of future leads. Information is encoded in edge weights, which indicate the importance of including the regions associated with an edge in the next exploration step. Computation of weights, leads, and the actual exploration make the core loop of the algorithm. Extensive experimentation shows that DSLX is very versatile. The discrete search can drastically change the lead to reflect new information allowing DSLX to find solutions even when sampling-based tree planners get stuck. Experimental results on a variety of challenging kinodynamic motion planning problems show computational speedups of two orders of magnitude over other widely used motion planning methods.",

In our approach, the user writes a high-level specification that captures partial knowledge about a mobile manipulation setting. In particular, this specification includes a plan outline that syntactically defines a space of plausible integrated plans, a set of logical requirements that the generated plan must satisfy, and a description of the physical space that the robot manipulates. A synthesis algorithm is now used to search for an integrated plan that falls within the space defined by the plan outline, and also satisfies all requirements. Our synthesis algorithm complements continuous motion planning algorithms with calls to a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver. From the scene description, a motion planning algorithm is used to construct a placement graph, an abstraction of a manipulation graph whose paths represent feasible, low-level motion plans. An SMT-solver is now used to symbolically explore the space of all integrated plans that correspond to paths in the placement graph, and also satisfy the constraints demanded by the plan outline and the requirements. Our approach is implemented in a system called ROBOSYNTH. We have evaluated ROBOSYNTH on a generalization of an ITMP problem investigated in prior work. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of generating integrated plans for a number of interesting variations on the problem.",

            "Abstract": "The framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offers a standard approach to model uncertainty in many robot tasks. Traditionally, POMDPs are formulated with optimality objectives. However, for robotic domains that require a correctness guarantee of accomplishing tasks, boolean objectives are natural formulations. We study POMDPs with a common boolean objective: safe-reachability, which requires that, with a probability above a threshold, the robot eventually reaches a goal state while keeping the probability of visiting unsafe states below a different threshold. The solutions to POMDPs are policies or conditional plans that specify the action to take contingent on every possible event. A full policy or conditional plan that covers all possible events is generally expensive to compute. To improve efficiency, we introduce the notion of partial conditional plans that only cover a sampled subset of all possible events. Our approach constructs a partial conditional plan parameterized by a replanning probability. We prove that the probability of the constructed partial conditional plan failing is bounded by the replanning probability. Our approach allows users to specify an appropriate bound on the replanning probability to balance efficiency and correctness. We validate our approach in several robotic domains. The results show that our approach outperforms a previous approach for POMDPs with safe-reachability objectives in these domains.",

The 6 degree-of-freedom rendezvous and docking problem, using impulsive control, and avoidance of known obstacles and plume impingement is solved. Our solution is then extended to real-time obstacle avoidance. The space is searched by expanding from the start location by applying only feasible controls and coasts, reducing by nearly 50% the variables perturbed in the search. A guided randomized expansion technique explores the search space. A gradient descent approach smooths the path and avoids new obstacles in real-time by\" stretching\" the best precomputed path in a locally optimal manner.",

This is done by using a two level approach, a PRM of PRMs. The first level builds a manipulation graph, whose nodes represent stable placements of the manipulated objects while the edges represent transfer and transit actions. The actual motion planning for the transfer and transit paths is done by PRM planners at the second level. The approach is made possible by the introduction of a new kind of roadmap, called the fuzzy roadmap. The fuzzy roadmap contains edges which are not verified by a local planner during construction. Instead, each edge is assigned a number which represents the probability that it is feasible. Later, if the edge is part of a solution path, the edge is checked for collisions. The overall effect is that our roadmaps evolve iteratively until they contain a solution. The \u2026",

A challenging aspect of this problem is how to utilize communication so that vehicles do not reach states from which collisions cannot be avoided due to second-order motion constraints. This paper initially shows how it is possible to provide theoretical safety guarantees with a priority-based coordination scheme. Safety means avoiding collisions with obstacles and between vehicles. This notion is also extended to include the retainment of a communication network when the vehicles operate as a networked team. The paper then progresses to extend this safety framework into a fully distributed communication protocol for real-time planning.

Numerous methods have been proposed to sample a protein's conformational space, including techniques developed in the field of robotics and known as sampling-based motion-planning algorithms (or sampling-based planners). However, these algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality when applied to large proteins. Many sampling-based planners attempt to mitigate this issue by keeping track of sampling density to guide conformational sampling toward unexplored regions of the conformational space. This is often done using low-dimensional projections as an indirect way to reduce the dimensionality of the exploration problem. However, how to choose an appropriate projection and how much it influences the planner's performance are still poorly understood issues. In this article, we introduce two methodologies \u2026",

We introduce a local planner to find smooth minimal energy deformations for these curves that can be used by a general path planning algorithm. Using a simplified model for obstacles, we can find minimal energy curves of fixed length that pass through specified tangents at given control points.

            "Abstract": "Using the popular program AutoDock, computer-aided docking of small ligands with 6 or fewer rotatable bonds, is reasonably fast and accurate. However, docking large ligands using AutoDock's recommended standard docking protocol is less accurate and computationally slow. In our earlier work, we presented a novel AutoDock-based incremental protocol (DINC) that addresses the limitations of AutoDock's standard protocol by enabling improved docking of large ligands. Instead of docking a large ligand to a target protein in one single step as done in the standard protocol, our protocol docks the large ligand in increments. In this paper, we present three detailed examples of docking using DINC and compare the docking results with those obtained using AutoDock's standard protocol. We summarize the docking results from an extended docking study that was done on 73 protein-ligand complexes comprised of large ligands. We demonstrate not only that DINC is up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than AutoDock's standard protocol, but that it also achieves the speed-up without sacrificing docking accuracy. We also show that positional restraints can be applied to the large ligand using DINC: this is useful when computing a docked conformation of the ligand. Finally, we introduce a webserver for docking large ligands using DINC. Docking large ligands using DINC is significantly faster than AutoDock's standard protocol without any loss of accuracy. Therefore, DINC could be used as an alternative protocol for docking large ligands. DINC has been implemented as a webserver and is available at                      http://dinc.kavrakilab.org \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Part positioning and orientation is a key issue in manufacturing. Extensive recent work has investigated a series of force fields for part positioning and orientation. Typically, a strategy that brings a part to a unique equilibrium consists of several force fields that are employed in sequence. Bohringer and Donald conjectured a few years ago that the combination of a unit radial field with a constant field would give rise to a unique equilibrium. Such a field is extremely interesting as it positions and orients parts without the need of sensing or a clock. We (2000) have proved this conjecture for nonsymmetric parts. In this paper, we focus our attention on symmetric parts and show that some of them can be uniquely positioned and oriented using the same field. Our work further explores the capabilities and limits of force fields and provides additional evidence that force fields are a powerful tool for parts manipulation.",

Determining their function would have a significant impact on understanding diseases and designing new therapeutics. However, experimental protein function determination is expensive and very time-consuming. Computational methods can facilitate function determination by identifying proteins that have high structural and chemical similarity. We present LabelHash, a novel algorithm for matching substructural motifs to large collections of protein structures. The algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase the proteins are preprocessed in a fashion that allows for instant lookup of partial matches to any motif. In the second phase, partial matches for a given motif are expanded to complete matches. The general applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated with three different case studies.

The key idea of IDTMP is to leverage incremental constraint solving to efficiently add and remove constraints on motion feasibility at the task level. We validate IDTMP on a physical manipulator and evaluate scalability on scenarios with many objects and long plans, showing order-of-magnitude gains compared to the benchmark planner and a four-times self-comparison speedup from our extensions. Finally, in addition to describing a new method for TMP and its implementation on a physical robot, we also put forward requirements and abstractions for the development of similar planners in the future.",

A major problem is finding valid configurations in tight areas, and many methods have been proposed to more effectively sample these regions. By constructing a skeleton-like subset of the free regions of the workspace, these heuristics can be strengthened. The skeleton provides a concise description of the workspace topology and an efficient means of finding points with maximal clearance from the obstacles. We examine the medial axis as a skeleton, including a method to compute an approximation to it. The medial axis is a two-equidistant surface in the workspace.

Knot untangling can be viewed as a                     high-dimensional planning problem in reparametrizable configuration spaces. In                     the past, simulated annealing and other energy minimization methods have been                     used to find knot untangling paths. We have developed a probabilistic planner                     that is capable of untangling knots described by over 400 variables. We have                     tested on known difficult benchmarks in this area and untangled them more                     quickly than has been achieved with minimization in the literature.

Nonetheless, most of the existing work in human-robot interaction with AR devices is still limited to robot motion programming or teleoperation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to command and collaborate with robots. Our approach uses an AR interface that allows a user to specify high-level requests to a robot, to preview, approve or modify the computed robot motions.

In the absence of any prior information, sampling-based planners are forced to explore uniformly or heuristically, which can lead to degraded performance. One way to improve performance is to use prior knowledge of environments to adapt the sampling strategy to the problem at hand. In this work, we decompose the workspace into local primitives, memorizing local experiences by these primitives in the form of local samplers, and store them in a database.

Many recent algorithms use projections of the state space to estimate properties such as coverage, as it is impractical to compute and store this information in the original space. Such estimates help motion planners determine the regions of space that merit further exploration. In general, the employed projections are user-defined, and to the authors' knowledge, automatically computing them has not yet been investigated. In this work, the feasibility of offline-computed random linear projections is evaluated within the context of a state-of-the art sampling-based motion planning algorithm.

The common practice for elucidating the structure of a chemical compound is to obtain a mass spectrum and subsequently retrieve its structure from spectral databases. However, database retrieval methods fail to identify novel molecules that are not present in the reference database. In this work, we propose Spec2Mol, a deep learning architecture for molecular structure recommendation given mass spectra alone. Spec2Mol is inspired by the Speech2Text deep learning architectures for translating audio signals into text. Our approach is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder learns the spectra embeddings, while the decoder, pre-trained on a massive dataset of chemical structures for translating between different molecular representations, reconstructs SMILES sequences of the recommended chemical structures. We have evaluated Spec2Mol by assessing the molecular similarity between the recommended structures and the original structure. Our analysis showed that Spec2Mol is able to identify the presence of key substructures in the molecule from its mass spectrum, and shows on par performance, when compared to existing fragmentation tree based methods, in recommending molecules for a given mass spectrum.",

            "Abstract": "The specification of complex motion goals through temporal logics is increasingly favored in robotics to narrow the gap between task and motion planning. A major limiting factor of such logics, however, is their Boolean satisfaction condition. To relax this limitation, we introduce a method for quantifying the satisfaction of co-safe linear temporal logic specifications, and propose a planner that uses this method to synthesize robot trajectories with the optimal satisfaction value. The method assigns costs to violations of specifications from user-defined proposition costs. These violation costs define a distance to satisfaction and can be computed algorithmically using a weighted automaton. The planner utilizes this automaton and an abstraction of the robotic system to construct a product graph that captures all possible robot trajectories and their distances to satisfaction. Then, a plan with the minimum distance to satisfaction is generated by employing this graph as the high-level planner in a synergistic planning framework. The efficacy of the method is illustrated on a robot with unsatisfiable specifications in an office environment.",

            "Abstract": "Programmable vector fields are an abstraction to represent a new class of devices for distributed, non-prehensile manipulation for applications in parts feeding, sorting, positioning, and assembly. Unlike robot grippers, conveyor belts, or vibratory bowl feeders, these devices generate force vector fields in which the parts move until they may reach a stable equilibrium pose.Recent research in the theory of programmable vector fields has yielded open-loop strategies to uniquely position, orient, and sort parts. These strategies typically consist of several fields that have to be employed in sequence to achieve a desired final pose. The length of the sequence depends on the complexity of the part. In this paper, we show that unique part poses can be achieved with just one field. First, we exhibit a single field that positions and orients any laminar part (with the exception of certain symmetric parts) into two stable equilibrium poses. Then we show that for any laminar part there exists a field in which the part reaches a unique stable equilibrium pose (again with the exception of symmetric parts). Besides giving an optimal upper bound for unique parts positioning and orientation, our work gives further evidence that programmable vector fields are a powerful tool for parts manipulation. Our second result also leads to the design of\\universal parts feeders,\" proving an earlier conjecture about their existence. We argue that universal parts feeders are relatively easy to build, and we report on extensive simulation results which indicate that these devices may work very well in practice.

The framework employs a multilayered synergistic planner to generate trajectories that satisfy the specification and adopt an iterative replanning strategy to deal with unknown obstacles. When the discovery of an obstacle renders the specification unsatisfiable, a division between the constraints in the specification is considered. The cosafety component of the specification is treated as a soft constraint, whose partial satisfaction is allowed, while the safety component is viewed as a hard constraint, whose violation is forbidden. To partially satisfy the cosafety component, inspirations are taken from indoor-robotic scenarios, and three types of (unexpressed) restrictions on the ordering of \u2026",

However, experimentally observing and computationally modeling large proteins remain critical challenges for structural biology. Our work aims at addressing these challenges by combining computational and experimental techniques relying on each other to overcome their respective limitations. Indeed, despite its advantages, an experimental technique such as hydrogen-exchange monitoring cannot produce structural models because of its low resolution. Additionally, the computational methods that can generate such models suffer from the curse of dimensionality when applied to large proteins. Adopting a common solution to this issue, we have recently proposed a framework in which our computational method for protein conformational sampling is biased by experimental hydrogen-exchange data. In this paper, we present our latest application of this computational framework: generating an atomic-resolution structural model for an unknown protein state. For that, starting from an available protein structure, we explore the conformational space of this protein, using hydrogen-exchange data on this unknown state as a guide. We have successfully used our computational framework to generate models for three proteins of increasing size, the biggest one undergoing large-scale conformational changes. View Full-Text",

One common difficulty of all protein structural comparison techniques is the computational cost of obtaining a match.

            "Abstract": "IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet is rapidly becoming the standard for in-building and short-range wireless communication. Many mobile devices such as mobile robots, laptops and PDAs already use this protocol for wireless communication. Many wireless Ethernet cards measure the signal strength of incoming packets. This paper investigates the feasibility of implementing a localization system using this sensor. Using a Bayesian localization framework, we show experiments demonstrating that off-the-shelf wireless hardware can accurately be used for location sensing and tracking with about one meter precision in a wireless-enabled office building.",
