            "Abstract": "Perhaps the first question to ask on reading this chapter is why should we consider nonlinear methods as offering any insight into speech signals given the success of current, mostly linear-based, speech analysis methods. There are known to be a number of nonlinear effects in the speech production process. Firstly, it has been accepted for some time that the vocal tract and the vocal folds do not function independently of each other, but that there is in fact some form of coupling between them when the glottis is open [27] resulting in significant changes in formant characteristics between open and closed glottis cycles [7]. More controversially, Teager and Teager [69] have claimed (based on physical measurements) that voiced sounds are characterized by highly complex air flows in the vocal tract involving jets and vortices, rather than well-behaved laminar flow. In addition, the vocal folds will themselves be responsible for further nonlinear behavior, since the muscle and cartilage which comprise the larynx have nonlinear stretching qualities. Such nonlinearities are routinely included in attempts to model the physical process of vocal fold vibration, which have focused on two or more mass models [24, 28, 65], in which the movement of the vocal folds is modeled by masses connected by springs, with nonlinear coupling. Observations of the glottal waveform have shown that this waveform can change shape at different amplitudes [59] which would not be possible in a strictly linear system where the waveform shape is unaffected by amplitude changes. Models of the glottal pulse also include nonlinearities, for example, the use of nonlinear shaping \u2026",

At first, a Lyapunov function is derived for the asymptotically stable deterministic Max-Product Systems. This Lyapunov function is then adjusted to derive sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability of Max-Product systems with Markovian Jumps. Many step Lyapunov functions are then used to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic stability. The results for the Max-Product systems are then applied to Max-Plus systems with Markovian Jumps, using an isomorphism and almost sure bounds for the asymptotic behavior of the state are obtained. A numerical example illustrating the application of the stability results on a production system is also given.",

To that end, we introduce the process of Maxpolynomial Division, a geometric method which simulates division of polynomials in the max-plus semiring, while highlighting its key properties and noting its connection to neural networks. Afterwards, we generalize this method and apply it in the context of neural network minimization, for two-layer networks used for binary classification problems, attempting to reduce the size of the hidden layer before the output. A tractable method to find an appropriate divisor and perform the division is introduced and evaluated in the IMDB Movie Review and MNIST datasets, with preliminary experiments demonstrating a capacity of this method to reduce the size of the network, without major loss of performance.",

Audio saliency is captured by signal modulations and related multi-frequency band features, extracted through nonlinear operators and energy tracking. Visual saliency is measured by means of a spatiotemporal attention model driven by various feature cues (intensity, color, motion). Audio and video curves are integrated in a single attention curve, where events may be enhanced, suppressed or vanished. The presence of salient events is signified on this audiovisual curve by geometrical features such as local extrema, sharp transition points and level sets. An audiovisual saliency-based movie summarization algorithm is proposed and evaluated. The algorithm is shown to perform very well in terms of summary informativeness and enjoyability for movie clips of various genres.",

In typical multi-room domestic environments, SAD may also convey spatial intelligence to the interaction, in addition to its traditional temporal segmentation output, by assigning speech activity at the room level. Such room-localized SAD can, for example, disambiguate user command referents, allow localized system feedback, and enable parallel voice interaction sessions by multiple subjects in different rooms.

As a result, such approaches do not scale up on different settings and specifications. We propose a three-stage pipeline that employs Multi-Head Attention driven by language and spatial features, Translation Embeddings and Multi-Tasking to detect an interacting pair of objects. Our attentional scheme is able to maximize the visual features' interpretability, as well as to capture the nature of datasets of different scales, while multi-tasking robustly resolves the bias of the background class. We present an experimental overview of the related literature, unveil a multitude of evaluation inconsistencies and provide quantitative and qualitative support with experiments on a variety of datasets, where our approach performs on par or even outperforms current state-of-the-art.",

            "Abstract": "We investigate the automatic phonetic modeling of sign language based on phonetic sub-units, which are data driven and without any prior phonetic information. Visual processing is based on a probabilistic skin color model and a framewise geodesic active contour segmentation; occlusions are handled by a forward-backward prediction component leading finally to simple and effective region-based visual features. For sign-language modeling we propose a modeling structure for data-driven sub-unit construction. This utilizes the cue that is considered crucial to segment the signal into parts; at the same time we also classify the segments by implicitly assigning labels of Dynamic or Static type. This segmentation and classification step disentangles Dynamic from Static parts and allows us to employ for each type of segment the appropriate cue, modeling and clustering approach. The constructed Dynamic segments are exploited at the model level via hidden Markov models (HMMs). The Static segments are exploited via k-means clustering. Each Dynamic or Static part, exploits the appropriate cue related to the movement. We propose that the movement cues are normalized in order to be translation and scale invariant. We apply the proposed modeling for further combination of the movement trajectory individual cues. The proposed approaches are evaluated in recognition experiments conducted on the continuous sign language corpus of Boston University (BU-400) showing promising preliminary results.",

Our framework utilizes a laser range finder sensor to detect and track the human legs, and an appropriately synthesized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for state estimation, and recognition of the gait patterns. We demonstrate the applicability of this setup using real data, collected from an ensemble of different elderly persons with a number of pathologies.

Since this kind of articulatory information is difficult to acquire in typical speech recognition setups we only consider it to be available in the training phase.

            "Abstract": "In contrast to the all-discrete approaches that dominated image processing in the recent past, in computer vision since the mid 1980\u2019s there have been proposed continuous models for several vision tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs). The discrete part of such approaches comes only in the corresponding difference equations (numerical algorithms) that approximate the solution of these PDEs. Motivations for using PDEs in image analysis and vision include better and more intuitive mathematical modeling, connections with physics, better approximation to the Euclidean geometry of the problem, and existence of efficient numerical algorithms for solving them. One major effort [30] was the use of PDEs in problems of shape from shading and optical flow. However, the most well known vision problem modeled via PDEs is that of multiscale image analysis, ie scale-spaces. While many such continuous approaches have been linear, the majority and the most useful ones are nonlinear.Several classes of nonlinear PDEs used in image analysis and vision are based on or related to morphological operations. Morphological image processing has been based traditionally on modeling images as sets or as points in a complete lattice of functions and viewing morphological image transformations as set or lattice operators. Thus, the two classic approaches to analyze or design the deterministic systems of mathematical morphology have been (i) geometry by viewing them as image set transformations in Euclidean spaces and (ii) algebra to analyze their properties using set or lattice theory. Geometry was used mainly for intuitive \u2026",

We introduce a linear method to self-calibrate and find the metric reconstruction of a camera pair. We assume unknown and different focal lengths but otherwise known internal camera parameters and a known projective reconstruction of the camera pair. We recover two possible camera configurations in space and use the Cheirality condition, that all 3D scene points are in front of both cameras, to disambiguate the solution. We show in two Theorems, first that the two solutions are in mirror positions and then the relations between their viewing directions. Our new method performs on par (median rotation error ) with the standard approach of Kruppa equations () for self-calibration and 5-Point algorithm for calibrated metric reconstruction of a camera pair. We reject erroneous image correspondences by introducing a method to examine whether point correspondences appear in the same order along  image axes in image pairs. We evaluate this method by its precision and recall and show that it improves the robustness of point matches in architectural and general scenes. Finally, we integrate all the introduced methods to a 3D reconstruction pipeline. We utilize the numerous camera pair metric recontructions using rotation-averaging algorithms and a novel method to average focal length estimates.",

            "Abstract": "This chapter highlights the application of some advanced morphological filters to several problems of image enhancement and feature detection. There are several motivations for using morphological filters for such problems. First, it is of paramount importance to preserve, uncover, or detect the geometric structure of image objects. Thus, morphological filters that are more suitable than linear filters for shape analysis play a major role for geometry-based enhancement and detection. Further, they offer efficient solutions to other nonlinear tasks such as non-Gaussian noise suppression. Although this denoising task can also be accomplished (with similar improvements over linear filters) by the closely related class of median-type and stack filters, morphological operators provide the additional feature of geometric intuition. Finally, the elementary morphological operators are the building blocks for \u2026",

It has been shown that the inclusion of a talking face, increases the intelligibility of speech and the naturalness of human-computer interaction. Furthermore, an agent capable of expressing emotions has a stronger appeal to the human party and affects the interlocutor's emotional state. The proposed demonstration is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based photorealistic audio-visual speech synthesis system, capable of expressing emotions [1, 2]. The system is capable of generating a talking head speaking in three emotions: happiness, anger, and sadness, plus in neutral speaking style. Further capabilities of the system include 1) the usage of HMM interpolation [3] in order to generate speech with mixtures of the original emotions (e.g., both anger and happiness), and speech with different levels of \u2026",

The deep network contains a recurrent layer, in order to exploit the rich temporal information contained in the pose data. The resulting method outperforms a number of baseline classifiers and provides a promising tool for better automatic understanding of a child's attitude, interest and attention while cooperating with a robot.

The seminar took place in February 2014. The purpose of the seminar was to allow disparate communities working on problems related to morphologically rich languages to meet to discuss an important research problem, translation to morphologically rich languages. While statistical techniques for machine translation have made significant progress in the last 20 years, results for translating to morphologically rich languages are still mixed versus previous generation rule-based systems, so this is a critical and timely topic. Current research in statistical techniques for translating to morphologically rich languages varies greatly in the amount of linguistic knowledge used and the form of this linguistic knowledge. This varies most strongly by target language, for instance the resources currently used for translating to Czech are very different from those used for translating to German. The seminar met a pressing need to discuss the issues involved in these translation tasks in a more broad venue than the ACL Workshops on Machine Translation, which are primarily attended by statistical machine translation researchers. The report describes the introductory material presented to the group, the organization of break-out discussion groups by topic, and the results of the seminar.",

Further, we concatenate the new non-linear speech features with the standard linear ones (melfrequency cepstrum) to develop an augmented set of acoustic features and demonstrate its efficacy by showing improvements in HMM-based phoneme recognition over speech databases. The continuous-time models retain the excellent time resolution of the ESAs, based on discrete energy operators, but perform better in the presence of noise.",

In the time/space domain, these systems are found equivalent to a max-plus or min-plus convolution with their impulse response, and a class of nonlinear difference/differential equations is introduced to describe their dynamics. The hyperplanes< a., v>+ b are eigenfunctions of such morphological systems, which leads to developing a slope response for them, as a function of the slope o, and related slope transforms for arbitrary signals. These ideas provide a transform (slope) domain for morphological systems, where dilation and erosion in time/space corresponds to addition of slope transforms, time/space hyperplanes transform into slope impulses, time/space cones become bandpass slope-selective filters, and distance transforms correspond to ideal slope filters. The paper summarizes results for 1D signals/systems and extends them to the 2D case and to sampling.",

In this paper, we present a multimodal video database, namely COGNIMUSE, annotated with sensory and semantic saliency, events, cross-media semantics, and emotion. The purpose of this database is manifold; it can be used for training and evaluation of event detection and summarization algorithms, for classification and recognition of audio-visual and cross-media events, as well as for emotion tracking. In order to enable comparisons with other computational models, we propose state-of-the-art algorithms, specifically a unified energy-based audio-visual framework and a method for text saliency computation, for the detection of perceptually salient events from videos. Additionally, a movie summarization system for the automatic production of summaries is presented. Two kinds of evaluation were performed, an objective based on the saliency annotation of the database and an extensive qualitative human evaluation of the automatically produced summaries, where we investigated what composes high-quality movie summaries, where both methods verified the appropriateness of the proposed methods.

            "Abstract": "Over the last decade, it has become increasingly affordable to digitize 2D and 3D shape information using multiple modalities, such as (video) cameras, image-based reconstruction systems, laser-range scanners, or depth cameras. If these dense models can be processed and described in an efficient and informative way, they can be used in applications, such as ergonomic design, virtual shopping, scientific and medical visualization, realistic simulation, photo-realistic rendering, the design of natural user interfaces, and semantic scene understanding. Traditionally, the notion of shape has been studied either by analyzing projections of shapes in images or by analyzing a sparse set of marker positions on 3D shapes. Typical tasks in 2D shape analysis include segmenting objects in images and tracking objects across a sequence of images, and typical tasks in 3D shape analysis include reconstructing the three-dimensional object depth from input images and identifying corresponding points on different 3D models. The analysis and processing of shape data becomes especially challenging because of the increasing amount of data captured by sensors used to acquire shapes, and because modern applications such as natural user interfaces require real-time processing of the input shapes. Meeting these challenges requires models of shape analysis that are compact and informative, thereby allowing the development of algorithms that can process large datasets efficiently. To achieve these goals, interdisciplinary approaches are needed that use concepts from a variety of research areas, including numerical computing, differential geometry \u2026",

Towards identifying camera configurations that would perplex solution disambiguation, we show in two Theorems, first that the two solutions are in mirror positions and then the relations between their viewing directions. We validate our approach in synthetic and real scenes. In camera pair self-calibration and metric reconstruction, our method performs on par (median rotation error \u0394 R= 3. 49\u00b0) with the standard approach \u2026",

We propose a novel framework to address this problem that is based on the combination of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and generative models for object categories. Using a concise formulation of the interaction between these two processes, segmentation is interpreted as the E step, assigning observations to models, whereas object detection/analysis is modelled as the M-step, fitting models to observations. We present in detail the segmentation and detection processes comprising the E and M steps and demonstrate results on the joint detection and segmentation of the object categories of faces and cars.",

The first approach takes a finite difference path and proposes geometric approximations of the fundamental continuous differential operators that are involved in active contour PDEs, namely gradient and curvature, on graphs with arbitrary vertex and edge configuration. The second approach leverages finite elements to approximate the solution of these PDEs on graphs with arbitrary vertex configuration that constitute a triangulation.

Generating a talking head which is both realistic and expressive appears to be a considerable challenge, due to both the high complexity in the acoustic and visual streams and the large non-discrete number of emotional states we would like the talking head to be able to express. In order to cover all the desired emotions, a significant amount of data is required, which poses an additional time-consuming data collection challenge. In this paper we attempt to address the aforementioned problems in an audio-visual context. Towards this goal, we propose two deep neural network (DNN) architectures for Video-realistic Expressive Audio-Visual Text-To-Speech synthesis (EAVTTS) and evaluate them by comparing them directly both to traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) based EAVTTS, as well as \u2026",

Aural or auditory saliency is assessed by cues that quantify multifrequency waveform modulations, extracted through nonlinear operators and energy tracking. Visual saliency is measured through a spatiotemporal attention model driven by intensity, color, and orientation. Textual or linguistic saliency is extracted from part-of-speech tagging on the subtitles information available with most movie distributions.

Computer techniques, despite recent advances, still significantly lag humans in understanding multimedia and performing high-level cognitive tasks. Some of these limitations are inborn, ie, stem from the complexity of the data and their multimodality.

The proposed network uses a unified architecture that includes global and task specific layer and produces multiple output types, ie, saliency maps or classification labels, by employing the same video input. Moreover, one additional contribution is that the proposed network can be deeply supervised through an attention module that is related to human attention as it is expressed by eye-tracking data. From the extensive evaluation, on seven different datasets, we have observed that the multi-task network performs as well as the state-of-the-art single-task methods (or in some cases better), while it requires less computational budget than having one independent network per each task.",

Automatically selecting the most appropriate scale for a particular problem is a central issue for the practical applicability of such scale-space techniques.

The problem is studied in a statistical model selection framework and cross-validation techniques are utilized to address it in a principled way. The proposed novel algorithms do not require knowledge of the noise variance and have acceptable computational cost.

Within the last years, there have been many rapid developments in the field of shape representation, shape correspondence and shape manipulation with technical applications ranging from laser-range scanners to 3-D printing. Classic shape analysis tools from differential geometry have a fresh influence in the field, often powered by modern methods from optimization and numerical computing. At the same time, discrete geometric methods and related techniques such as from mathematical morphology have evolved significantly. Moreover, techniques like deep learning gained a significant influence in the development of corresponding methods and tools. New developments from tropical geometry have a high potential for use in shape analysis. The topics in our seminar addressed the sketched challenges and developments that will be useful for shape analysis. Especially we aimed to discuss the possibilities of combining fields like tropical geometry with more classical techniques as for instance from mathematical morphology. We discussed possibilities of applying machine learning methods in this context and considered recent advances from more classical fields like differential geometry and partial differential equations that can be useful for setting up and understanding shape analysis methods in all of these approaches.

Our approach is particularly fruitful in multimodal fusion scenarios, such as audiovisual speech recognition, where multiple streams of complementary time-evolving features are integrated. For such applications, provided that the measurement noise uncertainty for each feature stream can be estimated, the proposed framework leads to highly adaptive multimodal fusion rules which are easy and efficient to implement.

            "Abstract": "Viscous morphological operators have shown very good performance in regularizing various image analysis tasks such as detection of intensity-varying boundaries and segmentation. This paper presents a novel formulation of viscous morphological operators as solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) of the hyperbolic type with level-varying speed. Efficient numerical algorithms are also developed to solve these PDEs and generate the viscous operations. It also generalizes the viscous operators by studying the class of intensity level-varying operators, of which special cases are intensity adaptive connected operators such as volume openings and viscous reconstruction filters. We present both theoretical aspects and applications of the above ideas.",

Our functional is based on the eigenvalues of the structure tensor, therefore it penalizes image variation at every point by taking into account the information from its neighborhood. It generalizes several existing variational penalties, such as the Total Variation and vectorial extensions of it. By introducing the concept of patch-based Jacobian operator, we derive an equivalent formulation of the proposed regularizer that is based on the Schatten norm of this operator. Using this new formulation, we prove convexity and develop a dual definition for the proposed energy, which gives rise to an efficient and parallelizable minimization algorithm. Moreover, we establish a connection between the minimization of the proposed convex regularizer and a generic type of nonlinear anisotropic diffusion that is \u2026",

Exploiting this model leads to improved performance in several image analysis and computer vision problems. In this paper we propose alternative approaches for u+ v decomposition based on levelings and texture energy. First, we propose an efficient method for obtaining a multiscale cartoon component using hierarchies of levelings based on Gaussian scale-space markers. We show that this corresponds to a constrained minimization driven by PDEs and link the leveling cartoons with total variation minimization. Second, we extract the texture component from levelings of the residuals between the image and its multiscale levelings. Further, we employ instantaneous nonlinear operators to estimate the spatial modulation energy in the most active texture frequency bands and use this as a new type of texture markers that yield an improved texture component from the leveling residuals. Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed image decomposition methods.",

Towards this goal, we investigate three focal HRI perception modules operating on data from multiple audio-visual sensors that observe the HRI scene from the far-field, thus bypassing limitations and platform-dependency of contemporary robotic sensing. In particular, the developed modules fuse intra- and/or inter-modality data streams to perform: (i) audio-visual speaker localization; (ii) distant speech recognition; and (iii) visual recognition of hand-gestures.

It consists of a broad and coherent collection of theoretical concepts, nonlinear signal operators, and algorithms aiming at extracting, from images or other geometrical objects, information related to their shape and size. Its mathematical origins stem from set theory, lattice algebra, and integral and stochastic geometry. MM was initiated in the late 1960s by G. Matheron and J. Serra at the Fontainebleau School of Mines in France. Originally it was applied to analyzing images from geological or biological specimens. However, its rich theoretical framework, algorithmic efficiency, easy implementability on special hardware, and suitability for many shape-oriented problems have propelled its widespread diffusion and adoption by many academic and industry groups in many countries as one among the dominant image analysis methodologies. The purpose of Mathematical Morphology and its Applications to Image and Signal Processing is to provide the image analysis community with a sampling from the current developments in the theoretical (deterministic and stochastic) and computational aspects of MM and its applications to image and signal processing.

In this paper, we attempt to incorporate cues such as intensity contrast, region size, and texture in the segmentation procedure and derive improved results compared to using individual cues separately. We emphasize on the overall segmentation procedure, and we propose efficient simplification operators and feature extraction schemes, capable of quantifying important characteristics, like geometrical complexity, rate of change in local contrast variations, and orientation, that eventually favor the final segmentation result.

We construct SA images representing the hand\u2019s shape and appearance without landmark points. We model the variation of the images by linear combinations of eigenimages followed by affine transformations, accounting for 3D hand pose changes and improving model\u2019s compactness. We also incorporate static and dynamic handshape priors, offering robustness in occlusions, which occur often in signing. The approach includes an affine signer adaptation component at the visual level, without requiring training from scratch a new singer-specific model. We rather employ a short development data set to adapt the models for a new signer. Experiments on the Boston-University-400 continuous SL corpus demonstrate improvements on handshape classification when compared to other feature extraction approaches. Supplementary evaluations of sign recognition experiments, are conducted on a multi-signer, 100-sign data set, from the Greek sign language lemmas corpus.

Each of the algorithms contained in these modules has been independently applied to the problem of speech recognition in noise, significantly improving the recognition rates. In this work, these algorithms are merged in a single front-end and their combined performance is demonstrated. Specifically, the proposed advanced front-end extracts noise-invariant features via the following modules: Wiener filtering, voice-activity detection, robust feature extraction (nonlinear modulation or fractal features), parameter equalization and frame-dropping. The advanced front-end is applied to extremely adverse environments where most feature extraction schemes fail. We show that by combining speech enhancement, robust feature extraction and feature normalization up to a fivefold error rate reduction can be achieved for certain tasks.",

            "Abstract": "The advent of deep learning has led to the prevalence of deep neural network architectures for monaural music source separation, with end-to-end approaches that operate directly on the waveform level increasingly receiving research attention. Among these approaches, transformation of the input mixture to a learned latent space, and multiplicative application of a soft mask to the latent mixture, achieves the best performance, but is prone to the introduction of artifacts to the source estimate. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose a hybrid time-domain approach, termed the HTMD-Net, combining a lightweight masking component and a denoising module, based on skip connections, in order to refine the source estimated by the masking procedure. Evaluation of our approach in the task of monaural singing voice separation in the musdb18 dataset indicates that our proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to methods based purely on masking when trained under the same conditions, especially regarding the behavior during silent segments, while achieving higher computational efficiency.",

Exact spectrum estimation is usually inefficient as it requires sampling rates at or above the Nyquist rate. Using prior information on the structure of the signal could allow near exact reconstruction at much lower sampling rates. Sparsity of the sampled signal in the frequency domain is one of the popular priors studied for cognitive radio applications. Reconstruction of signals under sparsity assumptions has been studied rigorously by researchers in the field of compressed sensing (CS). CS algorithms that operate on batches of samples are known to be robust but can be computationally costly, making them unsuitable for cheap low power cognitive radio devices that require spectrum sensing in real time. On the other hand, online algorithms that are based on variations of the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm have very simple updates so \u2026",

Our approach incorporates the effect of the training optimizer used and offers quantitative and qualitative explanations. Finally, we study how the architectural structure of a morphological network can affect shape constraints, focusing on monotonicity. Via Maslov Dequantization, we obtain a softened version of a known architecture and show how this approach can improve training convergence and performance.",

For fricatives, we are mainly interested in the higher end of the spectrum where the planar wave propagation assumption that is accepted in the one\u2010dimensional simulation cannot provide accurate results. This is the main reason why we explore 3D acoustic field simulation. Proper incorporation of noise sources is considered to account for frication. Their placement and acoustic properties are investigated. Motivated by measurements of the airflow during fricative production, we also explore the influence of mean flow to acoustics in the tract. Sound propagation in moving medium is considered for this purpose. The applied vocal tract geometry is determined from 3D MRI images. We present computational considerations for the analyzed \u2026",

The various modality curves are integrated in a single attention curve, where the presence of an event may be signified in one or multiple domains.

Towards this goal, in this paper we use textual cues as means of supervision, introducing two weakly supervised techniques that extend the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework: the Fuzzy Sets Multiple Instance Learning (FSMIL) and the Probabilistic Labels Multiple Instance Learning (PLMIL). The former encodes the spatio-temporal imprecision of the linguistic descriptions with Fuzzy Sets, while the latter models different interpretations of each description\u2019s semantics with Probabilistic Labels, both formulated through a convex optimization algorithm. In addition, we provide a novel technique to extract weak labels in the presence of complex semantics, that consists of semantic similarity computations. We evaluate our methods on two distinct problems, namely face and action recognition, in the challenging and realistic setting of movies accompanied by their screenplays, contained in the COGNIMUSE database. We show that, on both tasks, our method considerably outperforms a state-of-the-art weakly supervised approach, as well as other baselines.",

An important part of our digital restoration system is the damaged and missing areas detector. It is used in combination with total variation inpainting at first for the missing area extraction and repair, and secondly for the elimination of minor defects on the retrieved part in the non-local inpainting mechanism.

            "Abstract": "Scene Graph Generators (SGGs) are models that, given an image, build a directed graph where each edge represents a predicted subject predicate object triplet. Most SGGs silently exploit datasets' bias on relationships' context, ie its subject and object, to improve recall and neglect spatial and visual evidence, eg having seen a glut of data for person wearing shirt, they are overconfident that every person is wearing every shirt. Such imprecise predictions are mainly ascribed to the lack of negative examples for most relationships, fact that obstructs models from meaningfully learning predicates, even those which have ample positive examples. We first present an in-depth investigation of the context bias issue to showcase that all examined state-of-the-art SGGs share the above vulnerabilities. In response, we propose a semi-supervised scheme that forces predicted triplets to be grounded consistently back to the image, in a closed-loop manner. The developed spatial common sense can be then distilled to a student SGG and substantially enhance its spatial reasoning ability. This Grounding Consistency Distillation (GCD) approach is model-agnostic and profits from the superfluous unlabeled samples to retain the valuable context information and avert memorization of annotations. Furthermore, we ascertain that current metrics disregard unlabeled samples, rendering themselves incapable of reflecting context bias, then we mine and incorporate during evaluation hard-negatives to reformulate precision as a reliable metric.

However, these models are vulnerable to certain inputs, the adversarial examples, which although are not easily perceived by humans, they can lead a neural network to produce faulty results. This paper focuses on the detection of adversarial examples, which are created for convolutional neural networks that perform image classification. We propose three methods for detecting possible adversarial examples and after we analyze and compare their performance, we combine their best aspects to develop an even more robust approach. The first proposed method is based on the regularization of the feature vector that the neural network produces as output. The second method detects adversarial examples by using histograms, which are created from the outputs of the hidden layers of the neural network. These histograms create a feature vector which is used as the input of an SVM classifier, which classifies the original input either as an adversarial or as a real input. Finally, for the third method we introduce the concept of the residual image, which contains information about the parts of the input pattern that are ignored by the neural network. This method aims at the detection of possible adversarial examples, by using the residual image and reinforcing the parts of the input pattern that are ignored by the neural network. Each one of these methods has some novelties and by combining them we can further improve the detection results. For the proposed methods and their combination, we \u2026",

To facilitate this analysis and generalize the approach, we use a harmonic noise model to approximate the noise component.

            "Abstract": "Visual relationship detection has been motivated by the \u201cinsufficiency of objects to describe rich visual knowledge\u201d. However, we find that training and testing on current popular datasets may not support such statements; most approaches can be outperformed by a naive image-agnostic baseline that fuses language and spatial features. We visualize the errors of numerous existing detectors, to discover that most of them are caused by the coexistence and penalization of antagonizing predicates that could describe the same interaction. Such annotations hurt the dataset\u2019s causality and models tend to overfit the dataset biases, resulting in a saturation of accuracy to artificially low levels. We construct a simple architecture and explore the effect of using language on generalization. Then, we introduce adaptive local-context-aware classifiers, that are built on-the-fly based on the objects\u2019 categories. To improve context awareness, we mine and learn predicate synonyms, ie different predicates that could equivalently hold, and apply a distillation-like loss that forces synonyms to have similar classifiers and scores. The last also serves as a regularizer that mitigates the dominance of the most frequent classes, enabling zero-shot generalization. We evaluate predicate accuracy on existing and novel test scenarios to display state-of-the-art results over prior biased baselines.",

            "Abstract": "We investigated how the physical differences associated with the articulation of speech affect the temporal aspects of audiovisual speech perception. Video clips of consonants and vowels uttered by three different speakers were presented. The video clips were analysed using an auditory-visual signal saliency model in order to compare signal saliency and behavioural data. Participants made temporal order judgments (TOJs) regarding which speech-stream (auditory or visual) had been presented first. The sensitivity of participants\u2019 TOJs and the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) were analyzed as a function of the place, manner of articulation, and voicing for consonants, and the height/backness of the tongue and lip-roundedness for vowels. We expected that in the case of the place of articulation and roundedness, where the visual-speech signal is more salient, temporal perception of speech would be modulated by the visual-speech signal. No such effect was expected for the manner of articulation or height. The results demonstrate that for place and manner of articulation, participants\u2019 temporal percept was affected (although not always significantly) by highly-salient speech-signals with the visual-signals requiring smaller visual-leads at the PSS. This was not the case when height was evaluated. These findings suggest that in the case of audiovisual speech perception, a highly salient visual-speech signal may lead to higher probabilities regarding the identity of the auditory-signal that modulate the temporal window of multisensory integration of the speech-stream.",

The interpolation solution is restricted to the subspace of functions that can recover the discrete input image, after an appropriate smoothing and sampling. The proposed nonlinear diffusion flow lies on this subspace while its strength and anisotropy adapt to the local variations and geometry of image structures. The derived method effectively reconstructs the real image structures and yields a satisfactory interpolation result. Compared to classic and other existing PDE-based interpolation methods, our proposed method seems to increase the accuracy of the result and to reduce the undesirable artifacts, such as blurring, ringing, block effects and edge distortion.

First we briefly review the most common models of neurons and neural networks and the function of cells in the V1/V2 areas of the visual cortex. Subsequently, we present the biologically plausible models for image segmentation that have been proposed by Stephen Grossberg and his collaborators during the previous two decades in a series of papers. We have implemented the B.C.S. (Boundary Contour System) and F.C.S. (Feature Contour System) models that form the basic building blocks of this model of biological vision, known as FACADE (Form And Colour and DEpth) theory. During their implementation, we faced several problems, like a large number of parameters and instability with respect to these; this was not traded off with a higher performance when compared to classical computer vision algorithms. This has led us to propose a simplified version of the B.C.S./F.C.S. system, and to explore the merits of using nonlinear recurrent dynamics. The biologically plausible model we propose is paralleled with classical computational vision techniques, while a link with the variational approach to computer vision is established. By interpreting the network's function in a probabilistic manner we derive an algorithm for learning the network weights using manually determined segmentations excerpted from the Berkeley database. This facilitates learning the terms involved in the variational criterion that quantifies edge map quality from ground truth data. Using the learned weights our network outperforms classical edge detection algorithms, when evaluated on the Berkeley \u2026",

These two tasks are performed iteratively, thereby simultaneously segmenting an image and reconstructing it in terms of objects. We model objects using Active Appearance Models (AAMs) as they capture both shape and appearance variation. During the E-step, the fidelity of the AAM predictions to the image is used to decide about assigning observations to the object. For this, we propose two top-down segmentation algorithms. The first starts with an oversegmentation of the image and then softly assigns image segments to objects, as in the common setting of EM \u2026",

We propose some improvements to deal with problems due to high reverberation, noise and use of a limited number of microphones. These consist of a pre-filtering stage for dereverberation and an iterative procedure that aims to increase accuracy. Experiments carried out in relatively large databases with both simulated and real recordings of sources in various positions indicate that the proposed method exhibits a better performance compared to others under challenging conditions while also being computationally efficient. It is demonstrated that although reverberation degrades localization performance, this degradation can be compensated by identifying the reliable microphone pairs and disposing of the outliers.",

The problem is studied from a statistical model selection viewpoint and cross-validation techniques are utilized to address it in a principled way. The proposed novel algorithms do not require knowledge of the noise variance, have acceptable computational cost and are readily integrated with a wide class of scale-space inducing processes which require setting of a scale parameter.

Comparisons with size distributions based on conventional morphological operators indicate that the generalized histograms provide a more direct and informative description of the image content in objects with scale-dependent geometric attributes. Applications are also developed for studying the structure of soilsection images.",

Experimentation is carried out in both clean and simulated far-field speech offering insight about the acoustic modeling under adverse conditions with reverberation and additive ambient noise. Beyond the baseline implementation, a first step is made in exploring how standard (MFCCs and PLPs) and modulation features (AM-FM) behave in a LVCSR framework when the input speech is distant, like in real life home applications.",

This new energy-based saliency measure of action videos leads to the extraction of local spatio-temporal interest points that give promising results for the task of action recognition.

Proceeding to the most general form of the proposed functional, we prove that its minimization leads to a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion that is regularized, in the sense that its diffusion tensor contains convolutions with a kernel. Using this result we propose two novel diffusion methods, the Generalized Beltrami Flow and the Tensor Total Variation.

In this paper we contribute such a variational formulation and show that the PDEs generating multiscale dilations and erosions can be derived as gradient flows of variational problems with nonlinear constraints.

A major drawback of these two speech enhancement algorithms is that the noise power spectrum at the beamformer\u2019s output is over-estimated and therefore the derived filters are sub-optimal in the Wiener sense. The proposed method deals with this problem and can be considered as an optimal post-filter that is appropriate for a wide variety of different noise fields.

Emotion constitutes one of the main driving factors of social life and it is expressed mainly through facial expressions. Synthesis of a talking head capable of expressive audio-visual speech is challenging due to the data overhead that arises when considering the vast number of emotions we would like the talking head to express. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose the usage of two methods, namely Hidden Markov Model (HMM) adaptation and interpolation, with HMMs modeling visual parameters via an Active Appearance Model (AAM) of the face.

A drawback in previous two post-filters is that the noise power spectrum at the beamformer's output is over-estimated and therefore the derived filters are sub-optimal in the Wiener sense. The proposed method overcomes this problem and can be used for the construction of an optimal post-filter which is also appropriate for a variety of different noise fields.

            "Abstract": "In this work we propose an audio-visual model for pre-dicting temporal saliency in videos, that we validate and evaluate in an alternative way by employing fMRI data. We intend to bridge the gap between the large improve-ments achieved during the last years in computational mod-eling, especially in deep learning, and the neurobiological and behavioral research regarding human vision. The pro-posed audio-visual model incorporates both state-of-the-art deep architectures for visual saliency, which were trained on eye-tracking data, and behavioral findings concerning audio-visual integration in multimedia stimuli. A new fMRI database has been collected for evaluation purposes, that includes various videos and subjects. This dataset may prove useful not only for saliency but for other computer vision problems as well. The evaluation of our model us-ing the new fMRI database under a mixed-effect analysis shows that the proposed saliency model has strong cor-relation with both the visual and audio brain areas, that confirms its effectiveness and appropriateness in predicting audio-visual saliency for dynamic stimuli.",

For a deployable intelligent assistant robot it is necessary to have a precise gait analysis system, providing real-time monitoring of the user and extracting specific gait parameters, which are associated with the rehabilitation progress and the risk of fall. In this paper, we present a completely non-invasive framework for the on-line analysis of pathological human gait and the recognition of specific gait phases and events. The performance of this gait analysis system is assessed, in particular, as related to the estimation of double support phases, which are typically difficult to extract reliably, especially when applying non-wearable and non-intrusive technologies.

While many state-of-the-art works have managed to deeply elaborate on these features independently, to the best of our knowledge, no work has adequately combined all these three information channels, particularly in 3D, to efficiently recognize Sign Language. In this work, we employ SMPL-X, a contemporary parametric model that enables joint extraction of 3D body shape, face and hands information from a single image. We use this holistic 3D reconstruction for SLR, demonstrating that it leads to higher accuracy than recognition from raw RGB images, or 2D skeletons. Simultaneously, we demonstrate the importance of combining the information from all three channels, to achieve the best recognition results.",

Given the importance of such facial events in SL analysis, we apply ESC to detect visual events on SL videos, including both American (ASL) and Greek (GSL) corpora, yielding promising qualitative and quantitative results.

In this work we explicitly take into account uncertainty in feature measurements and we show in a rigorous probabilistic framework how the models used for classification should be adjusted to compensate for this effect. Our approach proves to be particularly fruitful in multimodal fusion scenarios, such as audio-visual speech recognition, where multiple streams of complementary features are integrated. For such applications, provided that an estimate of the measurement noise uncertainty for each feature stream is available, we show that the proposed framework leads to highly adaptive multimodal fusion rules \u2026",

This class sparsity constraint is used to guarantee that the NMF solutions at a given time will contain only a few classes activated across all channels. This indirectly forces the channels to seek solutions on which they agree, thus increasing robustness.

We prove convergence in probability of our gradient approximation to the true gradient value and derive an asymptotic upper bound for the error of this approximation for the class of random geometric graphs. Two different approaches for the approximation of curvature are presented, and both are also proved to converge in probability in the case of random geometric graphs. We propose neighborhood-based filtering on graphs to \u2026",

We explore these networks mathematically from a tropical geometry perspective as well as mathematical morphology. Our contributions are threefold. First, we examine the training of morphological networks via Difference-of-Convex programming methods and extend a binary morphological classifier to multiclass tasks. Second, we focus on the sparsity of dense morphological networks trained via gradient descent algorithms and compare their performance to their linear counterparts under heavy pruning, showing that the morphological networks cope far better and are characterized with superior compression capabilities. Our approach incorporates the effect of the training optimizer used and offers quantitative and qualitative explanations. Finally, we study how the architectural structure of a morphological network can affect shape constraints, focusing on monotonicity. Via Maslov Dequantization, we obtain a softened version of a known architecture and show how this approach can improve training convergence and performance.",

The interpolation solution is restricted to the subspace of functions that can recover the discrete input image, after an appropriate smoothing and sampling. The proposed nonlinear diffusion flow lies on this subspace and its strength and anisotropy effectively adapt to the local variations and geometry of image structures. The derived model efficiently reconstructs the real image structures, leading to a natural interpolation, with reduced blurring, staircase and ringing artifacts of classic methods. This method also outperforms other existing PDE-based interpolation methods. We present experimental results that prove the potential and efficacy of the method as applied to graylevel and color images.",

Meanwhile, numerous models describing the human emotional states have been proposed by the psychology community. However, we have no clear evidence as to which representation is more appropriate and the majority of FER systems use either the categorical or the dimensional model of affect. Inspired by recent work in multi-label classification, this paper proposes a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework that exploits the dependencies between these two models using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to recognize facial expressions in-the-wild. Specifically, a shared feature representation is learned for both discrete and continuous recognition in a MTL setting. Moreover, the facial expression classifiers and the valence-arousal regressors are learned through a GCN that explicitly captures the dependencies between them. To evaluate the performance of our method under real-world conditions we train our models on AffectNet dataset. The results of our experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on discrete FER.",

The main thesis of this chapter is that by integrating shape with linguistic information shape recognition can be improved in performance. It broadens the concept of shape to visual shapes that include both geometric and optical information and explores ways that additional linguistic information may help with shape recognition. Towards this goal, it briefly describes some shape categories which have the potential of better recognition via language, with emphasis on gestures and moving shapes of sign language, as well as on cross-modal relations between vision and language in videos. It also draws inspiration from psychological studies that explore connections between gestures and human languages. Afterwards, it focuses on the broad class of multimodal gestures that combine spatio-temporal \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A combination of techniques that is becoming increasingly popular is the construction of part-based object representations using the outputs of interest-point detectors. Our contributions in this paper are twofold: first, we propose a primal-sketch-based set of image tokens that are used for object representation and detection. Second, top-down information is introduced based on an efficient method for the evaluation of the likelihood of hypothesized part locations. This allows us to use graphical model techniques to complement bottom-up detection, by proposing and finding the parts of the object that were missed by the front-end feature detection stage. Detection results for four object categories validate the merits of this joint top-down and bottom-up approach.",

Alternative fusion schemes are investigated to account for asynchrony between the modalities and allow independent modeling of the dynamics of the involved streams. Visual cues are extracted from the speaker's face by means of active appearance modeling. We report experiments on the QSMT database which contains audio, video, and electromagnetic articulography data recorded in parallel.

Specifically the following algorithms are presented and evaluated: beamforming for multi-microphone speech recognition, robust modulation and fractal features, Teager energy cepstrum coefficients, parametric feature equalization, speech enhancement, and acoustic modeling for non-native speech recognition. Also the problem of feature fusion and voice activity detection are discussed. Evaluation results on the AURORA databases under the auspices of the HIWIRE project show that significant gains can be achieved under adverse or mismatched conditions using these algorithms. Relative error rate reduction of up to 50% was shown for multi-microphone speech recognition, robust feature combination and speech enhancement. 30-40% reduction was shown for parametric feature equalization and non-native acoustic models.",

Standard methodologies that rely solely on the extraction of bodily and facial features often fall short of accurate emotion prediction in cases where the aforementioned sources of affective information are inaccessible due to head/body orientation, low resolution and poor illumination. We aspire to alleviate this problem by leveraging visual context in the form of scene characteristics and attributes, as part of a broader emotion recognition framework. Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) constitute the backbone of our proposed model. Apart from the RGB input modality, we make use of dense Optical Flow, following an intuitive multi-stream approach for a more effective encoding of motion. Furthermore, we shift our attention towards skeleton-based learning and leverage action-centric data as means of pre-training a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) for the task of emotion recognition. Our extensive experiments on the challenging Body Language Dataset (BoLD) verify the superiority of our methods over existing approaches, while by properly incorporating all of the aforementioned modules in a network ensemble, we manage to surpass the previous best published recognition scores, by a large margin.",

The continous-time models retain the excellent time resolution of the ESAs based on discrete energy operators and perform better in the presence of noise. We also introduce a robust algorithm based on the ESAs for amplitude compensation of the filtered signals.

We explore nonlinear methods, such as the AM-FM model and ideas from fractal theory, so as to model the time-varying harmonic structure of musical signals and the geometrical complexity of the music waveform. The different feature representations' efficacy is compared regarding their recognition properties for the specific task. The proposed features are evaluated against and in combination with Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), using both static and dynamic classifiers, accomplishing an error reduction of 28%, illustrating that they can capture important aspects of music.",

In this paper, we develop two new robust methods for energy-based speech demodulation and compare their performance on both test and actual speech signals. The first method uses smoothing splines for discrete-to-continuous signal approximation. The second (and best) method uses time-derivatives of Gabor filters. Further, we apply the best demodulation method to explore the statistical distribution of speech modulation features and study their properties regarding applications of speech classification and recognition. Finally, we present some preliminary recognition results and underline their improvements when compared to the corresponding MFCC results.",

Both the lattice algebraic and the scale-space properties of levelings are analyzed and illustrated. We also develop a nonlinear partial differential equation that models the generation of levelings as the limit of a controlled growth starting from an initial seed signal.

Thus the detection of such attacks and the localisation of attackers have been objects of recent study. After an attack has been detected, various algorithms have been proposed in order to localise the attacker. In this work we propose a new adaptive pruning algorithm inspired by the tropical and geometrical analysis of the traditional Viterbi pruning algorithm to solve the localisation problem. In particular, the proposed algorithm tries to localise the attacker by adapting the leniency parameter based on estimates about the state of the solution space. These estimates stem from the enclosed volume and the entropy of the solution space, as they were introduced in our previous works.",

Poor illumination conditions, head/body orientation and low image resolution constitute factors that can potentially hinder performance in case of methodologies that solely rely on the extraction and analysis of facial features. In order to alleviate this problem, we leverage both bodily and contextual features, as part of a broader emotion recognition framework. We choose to use a standard CNN-RNN cascade as the backbone of our proposed model for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning. Apart from learning through the RGB input modality, we construct an aural stream which operates on sequences of extracted mel-spectrograms. Our extensive experiments on the challenging and newly assembled Aff-Wild2 dataset verify the validity of our intuitive multi-stream and multi-modal approach towards emotion recognition in-the-wild. Emphasis is being laid on the the beneficial influence of the human body and scene context, as aspects of the emotion recognition process that have been left relatively unexplored up to this point. All the code was implemented using PyTorch and is publicly available.",

Further we examine the classification capability of related nonlinear features over broad phoneme classes. The results of these preliminary experiments indicate that the information carried by these novel nonlinear feature sets is important and useful.",

It generalizes several existing variational penalties, including the total variation seminorm and vectorial extensions of it. Meanwhile, thanks to the structure tensor's ability to capture first-order information around a local neighborhood, the STV functionals can provide more robust measures of image variation. Further, we prove that the STV regularizers are convex while they also satisfy several invariance properties w.r.t. image transformations. These properties qualify them as ideal candidates for imaging applications. In addition, for the discrete version of the STV functionals we derive an \u2026",

In this work we explicitly take into account feature measurement uncertainty and we show how classification rules should be adjusted to compensate for its effects. Our approach is particularly fruitful in multimodal fusion scenarios, such as audiovisual speech recognition, where multiple streams of complementary time-evolving features are integrated. For such applications, provided that the measurement noise uncertainty for each feature stream can be estimated, the proposed framework leads to highly adaptive multimodal fusion rules which are widely applicable and easy to implement. We further show that previous multimodal fusion methods relying on stream weights fall under our scheme under certain assumptions; this provides novel insights into their applicability for various tasks and suggests new practical ways for estimating the stream weights adaptively. The potential of our approach is demonstrated in audio-visual speech recognition using either synchronous or asynchronous models.",

Previous definitions and constructions of levelings were either discrete or continuous using a PDE. We bridge this gap by introducing generalized levelings based on triphase operators that switch among three phases, one of which is a global constraint. The triphase operators include as special cases useful classes of semilattice erosions. Algebraically, levelings are created as limits of iterated or multiscale triphase operators \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a new and improved synergistic approach to the problem of audio-visual salient event detection and movie summarization based on visual, audio and text modalities. Spatio-temporal visual saliency is estimated through a perceptually inspired frontend based on 3D (space, time) Gabor filters and frame-wise features are extracted from the saliency volumes. For the auditory salient event detection we extract features based on Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator, while text analysis incorporates part-of-speech tagging and affective modeling of single words on the movie subtitles. For the evaluation of the proposed system, we employ an elementary and non-parametric classification technique like KNN. Detection results are reported on the MovSum database, using objective evaluations against ground-truth denoting the perceptually salient events, and human evaluations of the movie summaries \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The classical case of morphological segmentation is based on the watershed transform, constructed by flooding the gradient image, which is seen as a topographic surface, with constant height speed. Changing the flooding criteria, (e.g. constant-speed height, area or volume) yields different segmentation results. In the field of PDEs and curve evolution the classic watershed transform can be modelled as the solution of an eikonal PDE. In this paper we model the watershed segmentation based on a volume flooding criterion via a different eikonal PDE. Then we solve this PDE using the fast marching method, which is a specific algorithm from the methodology of level sets. In addition, we attempt to exploit the advantages of image segmentation using PDE-based volume flooding over the classic height flooding.",

In this paper, we present a nonlinear algorithm for the separation and demodulation of discrete-time multicomponent AM-FM signals. Our approach divides the demodulation problem into two independent tasks: algebraic separation of the components based on periodicity assumptions and then monocomponent demodulation of each component by instantaneously tracking and separating its source energy into its amplitude and frequency parts.

The proposed features measure the amount of amplitude and frequency modulation that exists in speech resonances and attempt to model aspects of the speech acoustic information that the commonly used linear source-filter model fails to capture. The robustness and discriminability of the AM-FM features is investigated in combination with mel cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs). It is shown that these hybrid features perform well in the presence of noise, both in terms of phoneme-discrimination (J-measure) and in terms of speech recognition performance in several different tasks. Average relative error rate reduction up to 11% for clean and 46% for mismatched noisy conditions is achieved when AM-FM features are combined with MFCCs.",

Such measures can capture valuable information for the characterisation of the multidimensional phase space since they are sensitive on the frequency that the attractor visits different regions. Further, we integrate some of these chaotic-type features with the standard linear ones (based on cepstrum) to develop a generalized hybrid set of shorttime acoustic features for speech signals and demonstrate its efficacy by showing slight improvements in HMM-based phoneme recognition without the use of any language model.",

The developed PDE models these nonlinear filters as the limit of a controlled growth starting from an initial seed signal. This growth is of the multiscale dilation or erosion type and the controlling mechanism is a switch that reverses the growth when the difference between the current evolution and a reference signal switches signs.

Our results indicate superior performance of the hexagonal geometry. Then, MEMS microphones are compared to Electret Condenser Microphones (ECMs), using the ATHENA database, which contains speech recorded in realistic smart home noise conditions with hexagonal-type arrays of both microphone types. MEMS microphones exhibit performance similar to ECMs. Good \u2026",

The aim of this paper is to present the solution of the forecasting problem through the application of the fuzzy/neurofuzzy methodologies. In particular, two very effective techniques are discussed based on the Takagi-Sugeno (functional reasoning) fuzzy model. The first uses the orthogonal least squares (OLS) technique to identify the structure of the fuzzy system (input variables selection and input space partitioning), and the second one uses the adaptive resonance theory (ART) technique for the same purpose. A power load forecast and a refinery product quality forecast case study are included to demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by fuzzy/neurofuzzy forecasting methods.",

Specifically, we utilize the OpenPose framework to extract 2D lip keypoints and hand skeletal coordinates of the signer, and we also infer 3D hand skeletal coordinates from the latter exploiting own earlier work on 2D-to-3D hand-pose regression.

The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness (coverage, step effectiveness) and user satisfaction (After-Scenario Questionnaire, ASQ) with three operation modes (autonomous operation, shared control, tele-manipulation) for the HRI with a bathing robot in potential users. Twenty-five older adults who require bathing assistance tested these operation modes in a water rinsing task for the upper back. Autonomous operation led to maximum effectiveness (100%), which was significantly worse in the shared control (51.6\u201379.4%, p \u2264 0.001) and tele-manipulation mode (43.9\u201364.4%, p < .001).

            "Abstract": "Emotion Recognition from EEG signals has long been researched as it can assist numerous medical and rehabilitative applications. However, their complex and noisy structure has proven to be a serious barrier for traditional modeling methods. In this paper, we employ multifractal analysis to examine the behavior of EEG signals in terms of presence of fluctuations and the degree of fragmentation along their major frequency bands, for the task of emotion recognition. In order to extract emotion-related features we utilize two novel algorithms for EEG analysis, based on Multiscale Fractal Dimension and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. The proposed feature extraction methods perform efficiently, surpassing some widely used baseline features on the competitive DEAP dataset, indicating that multifractal analysis could serve as basis for the development of robust models for affective state recognition.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, a feature extraction algorithm for robust speech recognition is introduced. The feature extraction algorithm is motivated by the human auditory processing and the nonlinear Teager-Kaiser energy operator that estimates the true energy of the source of a resonance. The proposed features are labeled as Teager Energy Cepstrum Coefficients (TECCs). TECCs are computed by first filtering the speech signal through a dense non constant-Q Gammatone filterbank and then by estimating the \u201ctrue\u201d energy of the signal\u2019s source, ie, the short-time average of the output of the Teager-Kaiser energy operator. Error analysis and speech recognition experiments show that the TECCs and the mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) perform similarly for clean recording conditions; while the TECCs perform significantly better than the MFCCs for noisy recognition tasks. Specifically, relative word error rate improvement of 60% over the MFCC baseline is shown for the Aurora-3 database for the high-mismatch condition. Absolute error rate improvement ranging from 5% to 20% is shown for a phone recognition task in (various types of additive) noise.",

First, we proceed to the modeling of face and eyes region by training and fitting Global and Local Active Appearance Models (LAAM). Next, we propose a system for eye gaze estimation based on a machine learning approach. In the first stage of our method, we classify gaze into discrete classes using GMMs that are based either on the parameters of the LAAM, or on HOG descriptors for the eyes region. We also propose a method for computing gaze direction angles from GMM log-likelihoods.

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, the interaction between humans and robots is constantly expanding, requiring more and more human motion recognition applications to operate in real time. However, most works on temporal action detection and recognition perform these tasks in offline manner, i.e. temporally segmented videos are classified as a whole. In this paper, based on the recently proposed framework of Temporal Recurrent Networks, we explore how temporal context and human movement dynamics can be effectively employed for online action detection. Our approach uses various state-of-the-art architectures and appropriately combines the extracted features in order to improve action detection. We evaluate our method on a challenging but widely used dataset for temporal action localization, THUMOS'14. Our experiments show significant improvement over the baseline method, achieving state-of-the art results on THUMOS'14.",

First, we propose the use of a morphological partial differential equation-based segmentation scheme based on seeded region-growing and level curve evolution with speed depending on image contrast. Second, we analyze surface texture information by modeling image variations as local modulation components and using multifrequency filtering and instantaneous nonlinear energy-tracking operators to estimate spatial modulation energy.

These states are captured and represented in terms of communicative behavioural patterns that influence, and in turn are adapted to the interaction flow with the goal to feed a multimodal human-robot communication system.

However, their complex and noisy structure has proven to be a serious barrier for traditional modeling methods. In this paper we employ multifractal analysis to examine the behavior of EEG signals in terms of presence of fluctuations and the degree of fragmentation along their major frequency bands, for the task of emotion recognition. In order to extract emotion-related features we utilize two novel algorithms for EEG analysis, based on Multiscale Fractal Dimension and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. The proposed feature extraction methods perform efficiently, surpassing some widely used baseline features on the competitive DEAP dataset, indicating that multifractal analysis could serve as basis for the development of robust models for affective state recognition.",

We further argue that using a Region Adjacency Graph (RAG) exploits the clustering properties and leads to a dimensionality reduction. Finally, we propose a novel method called Normalized Random Walker (NRW) algorithm which extends the RW method.

Our deep-learning based method uses hierarchical multi-label annotations and multi-stage losses, can be trained both jointly and separately, and offers us computational models for both individual modalities, as well as for the whole body emotion. We evaluate our method on a challenging child\u2013robot interaction database of emotional expressions collected by us, as well as on the GEneva multimodal emotion portrayal public database of acted emotions by adults, and show that the proposed method achieves significantly better results than facial-only expression baselines.",

Our theoretical approach establishes their representation in state and input-output spaces using monotone lattice operators, finds analytically their state and output responses using nonlinear convolutions, studies their stability, and provides optimal solutions to solving max-product matrix equations.

In the latter one, the approximation is quantified by the \u21131 residual error norm, which is shown to have supermodular properties under some convex constraints, called lateness constraints. Thus, greedy approximation algorithms of polynomial complexity can be employed for both problems with guaranteed bounds of approximation.

The acoustic events include in-domain sentences of different typologies uttered by native speakers in four different languages and non-speech events representing typical domestic noises. To increase the realism of the resulting corpus, background noises were recorded in the real home environment and then added to the generated sequences.
