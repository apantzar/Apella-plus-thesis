            "Abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries. Every year, one million people in the US experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease, which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently, there is no reliable screening method to identify the \u201cvulnerable patient\u201d who may have silent heart disease and therefore is at the risk of suffering a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack.Non-contrast cardiac CT is used worldwide to assess coronary artery calcium, a subclinical marker of coronary atherosclerosis. It has been recommended for screening asymptomatic individuals with intermediate-high Framingham risk, due to its high prognostic value, low radiation burden, and simplicity. In this chapter, we review technical aspects of imaging \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The availability of 3D facial datasets is rapidly growing, mainly as a result of medical and biometric applications. These applications often require the retrieval of specific facial areas (such as the nasal region). The most crucial step in facial region retrieval is the detection of key 3D facial landmarks (eg, the nose tip). A key advantage of 3D facial data over 2D facial data is their pose invariance. Any landmark detection method must therefore also be pose invariant. In this paper, we present the first 3D facial landmark detection method that works in datasets with pose rotations of up to 80\u25e6 around the y-axis. It is tested on the largest publicly available 3D facial datasets, for which we have created a ground truth by manually annotating the 3D landmarks. Landmarks automatically detected by our method are then used to robustly retrieve facial regions from 3D facial datasets.",

A baseline approach wherein disparate spatial features are treated as an input vector to trained HMMs is used to compare three different independent feature models. In addition, an action transition constraints is introduced to stabilize the developed models and allow for continuity in recognized actions.

The number of distance metric learning algorithms proposed keeps growing due to their effectiveness and wide application.

Moreover, existing surveys do not conduct comprehensive experimental comparisons. On the other hand, individual distance metric learning papers compare the performance of the proposed approach with only a few related methods and under different settings. This highlights the need for an experimental evaluation using a common and challenging protocol. To this end, we conduct face verification experiments, as \u2026",

The workshop was supported by the BioASQ project1, which organizes the corresponding annual challenge. The goals of the workshop were to present the results of the fourth BioASQ challenge and further the interaction with the wider community of biomedical semantic indexing and question answering. The presenters represented research teams from different parts of the globe and with different viewpoints to the problem. This contributed to a very lively and interesting discussion among the participants of the workshop. Six papers were presented during the workshop. All were selected by peer review for presentation. This volume includes 7 papers and one abstract: The first paper gives an overview of the challenge, including especially the datasets that were used throughout the challenges and the overall results achieved by the participants.The remaining six papers are those presented at the workshop. The first of these papers is a new extension of the MTI system. In particular, Learning to Rank methodology is used as a boosting component of the MTI system. The second paper present a system which includes several multi-label classifiers (MLC) that are combined in ensembles. Elastic-Search for indexing is the object of discourse of the third workshop paper. The fourth paper presents a system which uses TmTool in addition to MetaMap, to identify possible biomedical named entities, especially out-of-vocabulary concepts.

We define the long-axis of the heart as the local frame of reference. The shape of the LAD is modeled as a parametric curved axis with Frenet-Serret frame. The motion of the LAD (due to heart motion) is modeled as a composite of primitive shape-motion components: 1) longitudinal elongation, 2) radial displacement, and 3) twist with respect to the heart\u2019s local frame of reference. The three-dimensional shape-motion components are parameterized along the LAD\u2019s length.

            "Abstract": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is currently the gold-standard for assessing the morphology of blood vessels and atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. IVUS combined with contrast agents in form of microbubbles is used for the detection of neovessels in plaques, which are markers of inflammation and plaque vulnerability. Recently, differential imaging techniques have been developed for the detection of microbubbles in stationary sequences. However, these methods work with the gray scale B-mode IVUS images and involve several preprocessing steps as gating and registration. In this work, we investigate the feasibility (using two approaches) of detecting microbubbles in IVUS data by acoustic characterization using one-class cost-sensitive learning. In the first approach, we build a model for the microbubbles from samples taken from the lumen during the contrast agent injection. In the second approach, we detect the microbubbles as a change from the baseline IVUS data model (learned using random samples from different tissues within frames before injection). Using the first approach, we obtained an average accuracy of 99.17% for the detection of microbubbles and 91.67% for the classification of pre-injection frames as not containing microbubbles. Using the second approach, the average accuracy on the detection of baseline IVUS data was 89.65% and 96.78% on the classification of microbubbles as change. Our results indicate that it is possible to identify microbubbles in IVUS data using one-class cost-sensitive learning.",

People in a scene can be intuitively represented by an undirected graph where vertices are people and the edges between two people are weighted by how much they are interacting. Social signaling cues are used to describe the degree of interaction between people. We propose a graph-based clustering algorithm to discover interacting groups in crowded scenes. The grouping of people in the scene serves to isolate the groups engaged in the dominant activity, effectively eliminating dataset contamination. Using discovered interacting groups, we create a descriptor capturing the motion and interaction of people within it. A bag-of-words approach is used to represent group activity and a SVM classifier is used for activity recognition. The proposed framework is evaluated in its ability to discover interacting groups and perform group activity recognition using two public datasets. The results of both the steps show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for group discovery and achieves recognition rates comparable to state-of-the-art methods for group activity recognition.",

Traditional approaches to pedestrian tracking assume that each pedestrian walks independently and the tracker predicts the location based on an underlying motion model, such as a constant velocity or autoregressive model. Recent approaches have begun to leverage interaction, especially by modeling the repulsion forces among pedestrians to improve motion predictions. However, human interaction is more complex and is influenced by multiple social effects. This motivates the use of a more complex human interaction model for pedestrian tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel human tracking method by modeling complex social interactions. We present an algorithm that decomposes social interactions into multiple potential \u2026",

Due to the complex appearance of the gene expression images, these approaches require a pre-processing step to determine landmark correspondences in order to incorporate landmark-based geometric constraints.

Although pericardial fat is routinely imaged during computed tomography (CT) for coronary calcium scoring, it is currently ignored in the analysis of CT images. The primary reason for this is the absence of a tool capable of automatic quantification of pericardial fat. Recent studies on pericardial fat imaging were limited to manually outlined regions-of-interest and preset fat attenuation thresholds, which are subject to inter-observer and inter-scan variability. In this paper, we present a method for automatic pericardial fat burden quantification and classification. We evaluate the performance of our method using data from 23 subjects with very encouraging results",

A neuron is composed primarily of a cell body (soma) from which emanates a collection of branching structures (dendrites). How neuronal signals are processed is dependent on the dendrites\u2019 specific morphology and distribution of voltage-gated ion channels. To understand this processing, it is necessary to acquire an accurate structural analysis of the cell. Toward this end, we present an automated reconstruction system which extracts the morphology of neurons imaged from confocal and multiphoton microscopes. As we place emphasis on this being a rapid (and therefore automated) process, we have developed several techniques that provide high-quality reconstructions with minimal human interaction. In addition to generating a tree of connected cylinders representing the reconstructed neuron, a computational model is also created for purposes of performing functional simulations. We present visual and statistical results from reconstructions performed both on real image volumes and on noised synthetic data from the Duke-Southampton archive. 1",

The fat is imaged with Computed Tomography (CT) as part of coronary calcium scoring but it is not included in routine clinical analysis due to the lack of automatic tools for fat quantification. Previous attempts to create such an automated tool have the limitations of either assuming a preset threshold or a Gaussian distribution for fat. In order to overcome these limitations, we present a novel approach using a classification-based method to discriminate fat from other tissues. The classifier is constructed from three binary SVM classifiers trained separately for multiple tissues (fat, muscle/blood and calcium), and a specific code is assigned to each tissue type based on the number of classifiers. The decisions of these binary classifiers are combined and compared with previously determined codes using a minimum \u2026",

Among existing approaches of pose-invariant face recognition, 3D-aided methods have been demonstrated effective and promising. In this paper, we present an extensive evaluation of two widely adopted frameworks of 3D-aided face recognition in order to compare the state-of-the-art, identify remaining issues, and offer suggestions for future research. Specifically, we compare the pose normalization and the pose synthesis (rendering) based methods in an empirical manner. The database (UHDB31) that we use covers 21 well-controlled pose variations, half of which show a combination of yaw and pitch. Through the experiments, we present the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods to provide solid data \u2026",

In this study, a method for localization, centerline extraction, and segmentation of the thoracic aorta in noncontrast cardiac-computed tomography (CT) images, toward the detection of aortic calcification, is presented. The localization of the right coronary artery ostium slice is formulated as a regression problem whose input variables are obtained from simple intensity features computed from a pyramid representation of the slice. The localization, centerline extraction, and segmentation of the aorta are formulated as optimal path detection problems. Dynamic programming is applied in the Hough space for localizing key center points in the aorta which guide the centerline tracing using a fast marching-based minimal path extraction framework.

            "Abstract": "3D-Model-Aided 2D face recognition (MaFR) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. By registering a 3D model, facial textures of the gallery and the probe can be lifted and aligned in a common space, thus alleviating the challenge of pose variations. One obstacle preventing accurate registration is the 3D-2D pose estimation, which is easily affected by landmarks. In this work, we present the performance that state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithms could reach using state-of-the-art automatic landmark localization methods. We generated an application-specific dataset with more than 59,000 synthetic face images and ground truth camera pose and landmarks, covering 45 poses and six illumination conditions. Our experiments compared four recently proposed pose estimation algorithms using 2D landmarks detected by two automatic methods. Our results highlight one near-real-time landmark detection \u2026",

The key steps of our approach are: i) restoration of the original data by deconvolution, ii) robust Frame-shrinkage denoising, iii) registration of the data, iv) dendrite detection by learning and predicting generalized 3D tubular models, and v) a novel skeletonization algorithm.

Face recognition is one of the most widely researched topics in biometrics, along with iris recognition, supported by a plethora of new sensors, databases, algorithms, and evaluation frameworks. 1\u20133 In an automatic face recognition system, the data for the enrolled users is stored in a gallery, and each biometric sample from a user that needs to be identified or verified constitutes a probe. Conventional 2D face recognition methods for data acquired under controlled conditions have pushed performance to the limit. 4 For example, with nearly frontal view faces and specified illumination, identification performance reaches the high 90th percentile on average. To overcome constraints of pose and lighting, 3D face recognition systems based on depth images or 3D meshes have emerged as a distinct option5\u20137 because of the availability of improved 3D sensors, publicly available databases, and systematic evaluation benchmarks such as the Face Recognition Grand Challenge and the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT). 8 We have been carrying out research on 3D face recognition (3DFR), 9 3DFR for partial data, 10 3D-2D face recognition, 11 4D facial expression analysis, 12 profile-based face recognition, 13 and ear recognition. 14 The common denominator of our approaches is the use of an annotated face model (AFM) to describe facial data through deformation and fitting (see Figure 1).

We model the relationship between each node\u2019s global prediction and the local predictions of all the nodes as a multi-variable regression problem. The simplest version of our model leads to a ridge regression problem. It can be extended using the kernel trick, which explores the complex correlation between global and local prediction. In addition, we introduce a binary constraint model to restrict the optimal weight matrix learning. The proposed models have been applied to image annotation and gene function prediction datasets. The experimental results indicate that our models achieve better performance when compared with other baseline methods.",

However, in recent years there have been considerable achievements in data driven approaches to computational linguistics, which exploit the redundancy in the encoded information and the structures used.

The novelty of the technique is that the model's elastic parameters are not constant, but spatio-temporally varying. The variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance. Each pass of the algorithm uses physics-based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data. By augmenting the state equations of an extended Kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables, we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation. Therefore, the model's elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and \u2026",

A 3D to 2D face recognition system explicitly relies on 3D facial data to account for uncontrolled image conditions related to head pose or illumination. We build upon such a system, which matches relit gallery textures with pose-normalized probe images, using the gallery facial meshes. The relighting process, however, is based on an assumption of indoor lighting conditions and limits recognition performance on outdoor images. In this paper, we propose a novel method for minimizing illumination difference by unlighting a 3D face texture via albedo estimation using lighting maps.

            "Abstract": "Numerous recent reports have noted the potential uses of contrast imaging in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In IVUS contrast studies, a particular region-of-interest in the vessel wall or surrounding tissues is monitored over time in order to assess the perfusion of a contrast agent introduced during imaging. However, as this procedure is often carried out in the coronary arteries, the resulting IVUS frame sequences suffer from a wide variety of motion artifacts which confound their analysis. As the majority of these artifacts are due to the activity of the heart, the most common method for reducing their effect is ECG gating. However, this gating method bears several known problems. We introduce an alternative, image-based method which addresses these problems by grouping frames from stationary-catheter IVUS sequences into sets of stabilized ensembles. Each ensemble contains frames captured when the catheter and vessel are similarly oriented. Our method requires only the ability to quantify pairwise differences in frame appearance and requires no secondary signals (eg, ECG) or segmentation of the images.",

This incurs prohibitively large user costs, and severely limits the scope of biological studies. There is a need for developing vision algorithms that can address specific needs of marine biologists, such as fine-grained categorization of fish motion patterns. This is a difficult problem, because of very small inter-class and large intra-class differences between fish motion patterns. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we apply our new fish detector to identify and localize fish occurrences in each frame, under partial occlusion, and amidst dynamic texture patterns formed by whirls of sand on the sea bed. Then, we conduct tracking-by-detection. Given the similarity between fish detections, defined in terms of fish appearance and motion properties, we formulate fish tracking as \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel method for human face modeling and its application to face relighting and recognition. An annotated face model is fitted onto the raw 3D data using a subdivision-based deformable model framework. The fitted face model is subsequently converted to a geometry image representation. This results in regularly sampled, registered and annotated geometry data. The albedo of the skin is retrieved by using an analytical skin reflectance model that removes the lighting (shadows, diffuse and specular) from the texture. Additional provisions are made such that if the input contains over-saturated specular highlights, an inpainting method with texture synthesis is used as a post-processing step in order to estimate the texture. The method is fully automatic and uses as input only the 3D geometry and texture data of the face, as acquired by commercial 3D scanners. No measurement or calibration of the lighting environment is required. The method's fully automatic nature and its minimum input requirements make it applicable to both computer vision applications (e.g., face recognition) and computer graphics applications (i.e., relighting, face synthesis and facial expressions transfer). Moreover, it allows the utilization of existing 3D facial databases. We present very encouraging results on a challenging dataset .",

Among the various types of prior information, the incorporation of prior information about shape, in particular, is very challenging. In this paper, we present an explicit shape-constrained MAP-MRF-based contour evolution method for the segmentation of organs in 2-D medical images.

Our method is different from existing methods as we estimate the high-frequency components, rather than studying the direct relationship between the high-and low-resolution images.

            "Abstract": "For many computer vision applications, such as image description and human identification recognizing the visual attributes of humans is an essential yet challenging problem. Its challenges originate from its multi-label nature, the large underlying class imbalance and the lack of spatial annotations. Existing methods follow either a computer vision approach while failing to account for class imbalance, or explore machine learning solutions, which disregard the spatial and semantic relations that exist in the images. With that in mind, we propose an effective method that extracts and aggregates visual attention masks at different scales. We introduce a loss function to handle class imbalance both at class and at an instance level and further demonstrate that penalizing attention masks with high prediction variance accounts for the weak supervision of the attention mechanism. By identifying and addressing these challenges, we achieve state-of-the-art results with a simple attention mechanism in both PETA and WIDER-Attribute datasets without additional context or side information.",

It can be achieved by fitting an object-specific geometric atlas that is constructed using a partitioned, high-resolution deformable mesh and tagging each of its polygons with a region label. Subdivision meshes have been used to construct such an atlas because they can provide a compact representation of a partitioned, multi-resolution, object-specific mesh structure using only a few control points. However, automated fitting of a subdivision mesh-based geometric atlas to an anatomical structure in an image is a difficult problem and has not been sufficiently addressed.

Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several landmark-free pose estimation methods and achieves competitive accuracy in terms of estimating pose parameters.

ROBONAUT is an anthropomorphic robot developed at NASA-JSC, which is capable of dextrous, human-like maneuvers to handle common extravehicular activity tools. The human operator is represented using an articulated three-dimensional model consisting of rigid links connected by spherical joints. The shape of a link is described by a triangular mesh and its motion by six parameters: one three-dimensional translation vector and three rotation angles. The motion parameters of the links are estimated by maximizing the conditional probability of the frame-toframe intensity differences at observation points. The algorithm was applied to synthetic and real test sequences of a moving arm with very encouraging results. Specifically, the mean error for the derived wrist position (using the estimated motion parameters) was 0.6\u00b11.0 mm for the synthetic image sequences and 0.57\u00b10.31 cm for the real test sequences.

Not only is face recognition one of the most widely accepted modalities, but also advances in processing power have allowed the development of more complex algorithms while still providing a relatively rapid response to queries. Ear recognition, on the other hand, is a relatively new field. However, it holds a lot of promise as the complexity of the human ear is even higher than that of the face, and ears are subject to fewer deformations. In addition, the problem of recognizing an ear is not too different from that of recognizing a face. Therefore, part of the large body of research available in 3D face recognition can be inherited to 3D ear recognition. Both face and ear recognition require no contact with the subject, thus being more easily accepted by the public, compared to other biometrics such as fingerprints.Face \u2026",

Individual tasks are grouped based on their correlation so that two groups of strongly and weakly correlated tasks are formed. The two groups of tasks are learned in a curriculum learning setup by transferring the acquired knowledge from the strongly to the weakly correlated. The learning process within each group is performed in a multitask classification setup. The proposed method learns better and converges faster than learning all the tasks in a typical multi-task learning paradigm.

We invoke the theory of stochastic dominance along with results of prior research to demonstrate when and why our approach yields increased performance.

In this paper, we present a generalization of that estimation algorithm that exploits pairwise geometric relationships of body segments to allow estimation from a broader class of images. In addition, we refine our search space by constructing a fully populated discrete hyper-ellipsoid of stick human body models in order to capture the variance of the statistical anthropometric information. As a result, a better initial estimate can be computed by our algorithm and thus the number of iterations needed during minimization are reduced tenfold.

            "Abstract": "Face is one of the most popular biometric modalities. However, up to now, color is rarely actively used in face recognition. Yet, it is well-known that when a person recognizes a face, color cues can become as important as shape, especially when combined with the ability of people to identify the color of objects independent of illuminant color variations. In this paper, we examine the feasibility and effect of explicitly embedding illuminant color information in face recognition systems. We empirically examine the theoretical maximum gain of including known illuminant color to a 3D-2D face recognition system. We also investigate the impact of using computational color constancy methods for estimating the illuminant color, which is then incorporated into the face recognition framework. Our experiments show that under close-to-ideal illumination estimates, one can improve face recognition rates by 16%. When the \u2026",

A Fully Associative Patch-based Signature Matcher (FAPSM) is proposed so that the local matching identity of each patch contributes to the global matching identities of all the patches. The proposed matcher consists of three steps. First, based on the signature, the local matching identity and the corresponding matching score of each patch are computed. Then, a fully associative weight matrix is learned to obtain the global matching identities and scores of all the patches. At last, the l1-regularized weighting is applied to combine the global matching identity of each patch and obtain a final matching identity. The proposed matcher has been integrated with the UR2D system for evaluation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed matcher \u2026",

In this paper, we present a pose-invariant 3D-aided 2D face recognition system (3D2D-PIFR) that is robust to pose variations as large as 90\u00b0 by leveraging deep learning technology. We describe the architecture and the interface of 3D2D-PIFR, and introduce each module in detail. Experiments are conducted on the UHDB31 and IJB-A, demonstrating that 3D2D-PIFR outperforms existing 2D face recognition systems such as VGG-Face, FaceNet, and a commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) by at least 9% on UHDB31 and 3% on IJB-A dataset on average. It fills a gap by providing a 3D-aided 2D face recognition system that has compatible results with 2D face recognition systems using deep learning techniques.",

In this paper, we propose a general learning-based framework for reliable landmark localization on 3-D facial data under challenging conditions (i.e., facial expressions and occlusions). Our approach relies on a statistical model, called 3-D statistical facial feature model, which learns both the global variations in configurational relationships between landmarks and the local variations of texture and geometry around each landmark. Based on this model, we further propose an occlusion classifier and a fitting algorithm.

In this paper, we introduce two 3D local image descriptors which can be computed simultaneously for every voxel in a volume. Both our proposed descriptors are extensions of the DAISY descriptor, a popular descriptor that is based on the histograms of oriented gradients and was named after its daisy-flower-like configuration. Our experiments on mouse brain gene expression images indicate that our descriptors are discriminative and are able to reduce the detection errors of landmark points more than 30% when compared with SIFT-3D, an extension in 3D of SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform).

Finally, the probe sequence is categorized to the learned action with the maximum similarity using a nearest neighbor classification scheme.

Since the values of the anthropometric measurements are difficult to be estimated accurately from state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, ratios of anthropometric measurements were used as features. Additionally, since several measurements will not be available at test time in a real-life scenario, we opted for the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm. During training, we used as features, ratios from all the available anthropometric measurements, whereas at test time only ratios of measurable (i.e., observable) quantities were used. We show that by using the LUPI framework, the estimation of soft biometric characteristics such as gender is possible. Gender classification from human metrology is also tested on real images with promising results.",

            "Abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) surfaces can be sampled parametrically in the form of range image data. Smoothing/denoising of such raw data is usually accomplished by adapting techniques developed for intensity image processing, since both range and intensity images comprise parametrically sampled geometry and appearance measurements, respectively. We present a transform-based algorithm for surface denoising, motivated by our previous work on intensity image denoising, which utilizes a non-separable Parseval frame and an ensemble thresholding scheme. The frame is constructed from separable (tensor) products of a piecewise linear spline tight frame and incorporates the weighted average operator and the Sobel operators in directions that are integer multiples of 45\u00b0. We compare the performance of this algorithm with other transform-based methods from the recent literature. Our results indicate that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Image segmentation is, in general, an ill-posed problem and additional constraints need to be imposed in order to achieve the desired result. Particularly in the field of medical image segmentation, a significant amount of prior knowledge is available that can be used to constrain the solution space of the segmentation problem. However, most of this prior knowledge is, in general, vague or imprecise in nature, which makes it very difficult to model. This is the problem that is addressed in this paper. Specifically, in this paper, we present fuzzy-cuts, a novel, knowledge-driven, graph-based method for medical image segmentation. We cast the problem of image segmentation as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of a Markov random field (MRF) which, in essence, is equivalent to the minimization of the corresponding Gibbs energy function.

In many scenarios, such as determining gene expression patterns by in situ hybridization, the images are collected from multiple subjects over a common anatomical region, such as the brain. A fundamental challenge in comparing spatial data from different images is how to account for the shape variations among subjects, which make direct image-to-image comparisons meaningless. In this paper, we describe subdivision meshes as a geometric means to efficiently organize 2D images and 3D volumes collected from different subjects for comparison. The key advantages of a subdivision mesh for this purpose are its light-weight geometric structure and its explicit modeling of anatomical boundaries, which enable efficient and accurate \u2026",

Atherosclerotic plaque formation is considered to be a part of an inflammatory process.

Hence, the detection and measurement of VV in plaque has the potential to enable the development of an index of plaque vulnerability.

            "Abstract": "This paper focuses on improving face recognition performance with a new signature combining implicit facial features with explicit soft facial attributes. This signature has two components: the existing patch-based features and the soft facial attributes. A deep convolutional neural network adapted from state-of-the-art networks is used to learn the soft facial attributes. Then, a signature matcher is introduced that merges the contributions of both patch-based features and the facial attributes. In this matcher, the matching scores computed from patch-based features and the facial attributes are combined to obtain a final matching score. The matcher is also extended so that different weights are assigned to different facial attributes. The proposed signature and matcher have been evaluated with the UR2D system on the UHDB31 and IJB-A datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed signature achieve better performance than using only patch-based features. The Rank-1 accuracy is improved significantly by 4% and 0.37% on the two datasets when compared with the UR2D system.",

Recent methods employ deep convolutional networks to extract robust features for each step, while the whole system could be regarded as a deep cascaded regression architecture. In this work, instead of employing a deep regression network, a Globally Optimized Dual-Pathway (GoDP) deep architecture is proposed to identify the target pixels through solving a cascaded pixel labeling problem without resorting to high-level inference models or complex stacked architecture. The proposed end-to-end system relies on distance-aware soft-max functions and dual-pathway proposal-refinement architecture. Results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art cascaded \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a catheter-based medical imaging technique that produces cross-sectional images of blood vessels and is particularly useful for studying atherosclerosis. In this paper, we present a novel method for segmentation of the luminal border on IVUS images using the radio frequency (RF) raw signal based on a scattering model and an inversion scheme. The scattering model is based on a random distribution of point scatterers in the vessel. The per-scatterer signal uses a differential backscatter cross-section coefficient (DBC) that depends on the tissue type. Segmentation requires two inversions: a calibration inversion and a reconstruction inversion. In the calibration step, we use a single manually segmented frame and then solve an inverse problem to recover the DBC for the lumen and vessel wall (\u03ba  l  and \u03ba  w \u2026",

Today, the geometry of intracranial aneurysms is typically quantified manually based on three-dimensional (3D) Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) images. Since the repeatability of manual measurements is not guaranteed and their accuracy is dependent on the experience of the treating physician, we propose a semi-automated approach for computer-aided measurement of these parameters. In particular, a tubular deformable model, initialized based on user-provided points, is first fit to the surface of the parent artery. An initial estimate of the aneurysmal segment is obtained based on differences between the two surfaces. A 3D deformable contour model is then used to localize the aneurysmal neck and to separate its dome \u2026",

Two social signaling cues are presented and compared for group discovery. The grouping of people in the scene serves to isolate the groups engaged in the dominant activity, effectively eliminating dataset contamination. Using discovered interacting groups, we create a descriptor capturing the motion and interaction of people within it.

Such an automated process is essential when conducting studies on large patient databases where manual volume estimation is both tedious and subjective. In this paper, we present a noninvasive automatic breast volume estimation method. It employs 3D scanned data of the torso. First, a surface underneath the breast that resembles a 'breast-less' torso is automatically constructed, and then the volume of the breast is estimated as a function of the difference between the new surface and the actual breast.

The main contribution of the presented method is the automatic and pose-invariant detection of landmarks on 3D facial scans under large yaw variations (that often result in missing facial data), and its robustness against large facial expressions. Three-dimensional information is exploited by using 3D local shape descriptors to extract candidate landmark points. The shape descriptors include the shape index, a continuous map of principal curvature values of a 3D object's surface, and spin images, local descriptors of the object's 3D point distribution. The candidate landmarks are identified and labeled by matching them with a Facial Landmark Model (FLM) of facial anatomical landmarks. The presented method is extensively evaluated against a variety of 3D facial databases and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (4.5-6.3 mm \u2026",

Automated myocardial contour delineation often suffers from misalignment of slices, nonuniform coil sensitivity, blood-flow-related inter- and intraslice intensity inhomogeneities, blurring due to motion, partial voluming, and a need to circumscribe the papillary muscles and the trabeculae. In this paper, we propose a novel method for data-driven localization and segmentation of the left ventricle in the cine-MR images toward automated computation of ejection fraction (EF). Our hybrid segmentation method combines intensity- and texture-based fuzzy affinity maps obtained from a novel multiclass, multifeature fuzzy connectedness method with dynamic-programming-based boundary detection to delineate the myocardial contours.

It is shown that general object retrieval methods are inadequate for intraclass retrieval tasks. We advocate that such intraclass problems require a specialized method that can exploit the basic class characteristics in order to achieve higher accuracy. A novel 3D object retrieval method is presented which uses a parameterized annotated model of the shape of the class objects, incorporating its main characteristics. The annotated subdivision-based model is fitted onto objects of the class using a deformable model framework, converted to a geometry image and transformed into the wavelet \u2026",

The third step produces a set of plausible poses based on joint limit constraints using a geometric method. In the fourth step, pose and anthropometric measurements are obtained by minimizing an appropriate cost function subject to the associated constraints. The novelty of our approach is the use of anthropometric statistics to constrain the estimation process that allows the simultaneous estimation of both anthropometry and pose.

            "Abstract": "Facial expression analysis has interested many researchers in the past decade due to its potential applications in various fields such as human\u2013computer interaction, psychological studies, and facial animation. Three-dimensional facial data has been proven to be insensitive to illumination condition and head pose, and has hence gathered attention in recent years. In this paper, we focus on discrete expression classification using 3D data from the human face. The paper is divided in two parts. In the first part, we present improvement to the fitting of the Annotated Face Model (AFM) so that a dense point correspondence can be found in terms of both position and semantics among static 3D face scans or frames in 3D face sequences. Then, an expression recognition framework on static 3D images is presented. It is based on a Point Distribution Model (PDM) which can be built on different features. In the second part \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a simple but effective face detector (dubbed SSFD), which can localize multi-scale faces. Unlike other multi-scale feature detectors which learn multi-scale features or feature pyramids aggregated from different scale feature maps, SSFD only depends on a single-scale input image and a single-scale feature map to detect faces of various scales. In SSFD, transposed convolutions are leveraged to increase the resolution of feature maps with different strides, which can maintain adequate information for occluded and small faces. In addition, dilated convolutions are deployed to increase the receptive field size, which contributes to obtaining discriminative contextual information. SSFD, which is based on the VGG-16 network, outperforms the ResNet101-based Scale-Face as well as the VGG16-based HR on the WIDER FACE validation dataset.",

Our approach consists of: i) learning the structural patterns of a tubular-like object, and ii) estimating the centerline of a tubular object as the path with minimal cost with respect to outward flux in gray level images. Such shortest path is found by solving the Eikonal equation. We compare the performance of our method with existing approaches in synthetic, CT, and multiphoton 3D images, obtaining substantial improvements, especially in the case of irregular tubular objects.",

However, the concatenated facial template increases in size and contains redundant information. Previous solutions aim to reduce the dimensionality of the facial template without considering the occlusion pattern of the facial patches. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-guided compact template learning (OGCTL) approach that only uses the information from visible patches to construct the compact template. The compact face representation is not sensitive to the number of patches that are used to construct the facial template and is more suitable for incorporating the information from different view angles for image-set based face recognition. Instead of using occlusion masks in face matching (e.g., DPRFS [38]), the proposed method uses occlusion masks in template construction and achieves significantly better image-set based face verification performance on a challenging database with a template size that is an order-of-magnitude smaller than DPRFS.",

Surveillance cameras are generally low resolution and hence impose restrictions on the ability to identify sufficient features and descriptors for effective tracking. In such applications, reliable estimate of the object height from a single uncalibrated camera can prove to be a very useful feature. Several approaches have been developed to obtain height information of an object from image sequences, but are limited in their utility due to errors arising from varying image and object properties. In this paper, we present a simplified error model dependent on the location of the object in the image and the estimated camera height. Further, the developed model is used to obtain reliable height estimates of objects in different image sequences and the result is compared to estimates obtained without the use of the model.

However, both primary and privileged information are rarely derived from the same distribution. In this paper, we present a novel learning paradigm that leverages privileged information in a domain adaptation setup. The proposed framework named Adaptive SVM+ combines the advantages of both the learning using privileged information paradigm and the domain adaptation framework, which are naturally embedded in the objective function of a regular SVM.

We present a novel method that automatically constructs a surface network from curve networks with arbitrary topology and partitions an arbitrary number of materials. The surface network exactly interpolates the curve network on each plane and is guaranteed to be free of gaps or self-intersections. In addition, our method provides a flexible framework for user interaction so that the surface topology can be modified conveniently when necessary. As \u2026",

The method and system includes enrolling a face of a subject into a gallery database using raw 3D data. The method also includes verifying and/or identifying a target face form data produced by a 2D imagining or scanning device. A statistically derived annotated face model is fitted using a subdivision-based deformable model framework to the raw 3D data. The annotated face model is capable of being smoothly deformed into any face so it acts as a universal facial template. During authentication or identification, only a single 2D image is required. The subject specific fitted annotated face model from the gallery is used to lift a texture of a face from a 2D probe image, and a bidirectional relighting algorithm is employed to change the illumination of the gallery texture to match that of the probe.

It has been demonstrated that the 3D face can be reconstructed efficiently using a PCA-based subspace model for facial shape representation and facial landmarks for model parameter estimation. However, due to the limited expressiveness of the subspace model and the inaccuracy of landmark detection, most existing methods are not robust to pose and illumination variation. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a coupled-dictionary model for parametric facial shape representation and a two-stage framework for 3D face reconstruction from a single 2D image by using facial landmarks. Motivated by image super-resolution, the proposed coupled-model consists of two dictionaries for the sparse and the dense 3D facial shapes, respectively. In the first stage, the sparse 3D face is estimated \u2026",

However, a face often exhibits prominent specularities, especially in outdoor environments. These specular highlights can compromise an identity authentication. In this work, we analyze the impact of such highlights on a 3D-2D face recognition system. First, we investigate three different specularity removal methods as preprocessing steps for face recognition. Then, we explicitly model facial specularities within the face detection system with the Cook-Torrance reflectance model. In our experiments, specularity removal increases the recognition rate on an outdoor face database by about 5% at a false alarm rate of 10-3. The integration of the Cook-Torrance model further improves these results, increasing the verification rate by 19% at a FAR of 10-3.",

In this work, we present an algorithm for robust detection of facial component-landmarks. Specifically, we address the variation due to extreme pose and illumination. To achieve robust detection for extreme poses, we use a set of independent pose and landmark specific detectors. Each component-landmark detector is applied independently and the information obtained is used to make inferences about the layout of multiple components. In addition, we incorporate a multi-view representation based on an aspect graph approach. The performance of our algorithm is assessed using data from a publicly available database.

However, in the state of the art, ConvNet based methods employ only depth images of the hand without leveraging color and texture information from the RGB domain. In this paper, we investigate whether ConvNets can learn more rich and discriminative em-beddings, by combining RGB and depth information. To answer this question, we propose the fusion of RGB and depth information in a double-stream architecture. More specifically, RGB and depth images are fed into two separate networks by extracting features, which are subsequently fused at an intermediate layer of the ConvNet, implementing input-level fusion, feature-level fusion and score-level fusion. The double-stream scheme is coupled with a deep ConvNet, contrary to the shallow networks \u2026",

In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances in the field of human activity classification. We propose a categorization of human activity methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide human activity classification methods into two large categories according to whether they use data from different modalities or not. Then, each of these categories is further analyzed into sub-categories, which reflect how they model human activities and what type of activities they are interested in. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing, publicly available human activity classification datasets and examine the requirements for an ideal human activity recognition dataset.

However, this technique may be suboptimal for a number of reasons, among which is the difficulty of determining the optimal fraction at which to gate. This value is generally nonobvious. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a frame-gating method for IVUS pullbacks that mimics ECG (i.e., in the sense that it selects only one frame per cardiac cycle), but will automatically choose the fraction of the cycle that renders the most stable gated frame set. Stability here is gauged by measuring interframe similarity. Our method \u2026",

First, three luminance components are estimated using Bidimensional Intrinsic Mode Functions residuals. Second, a shadow removal procedure using recursive Retinex is applied. Third, the reflectance part is denoised using mean-Gaussian filters. After that, a new image is created multiplying each shadow-free luminance by the reflectance.

Two different types of patch divisions and signatures are introduced for 2D facial image and texture-lifted image, respectively. The matcher training consists of three steps. First, local classifiers are built to learn the local matching of each patch. Second, the hierarchical relationships defined between local patches are used to learn the global matching of each patch. Three ways are introduced to learn the global matching: majority voting, \u21131-regularized weighting, and decision rule. Last, the global matchings of different levels are combined as the final matching. Experimental results on different face recognition tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed matcher at the cost of gallery generalization. Compared with the UR2D system, the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a catheter-based modality which is used to produce high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the interior of blood vessels. By capturing 2-D IVUS images continually while translating the catheter, a volumetric image of a vessel may be digitally reconstructed. To improve the quality of these volumes, electrocardiogram (ECG)-based frame gating is often applied to alleviate motion artifacts caused by the beating heart. However, there are several issues surrounding the use of ECG signals which make their use for this purpose potentially suboptimal. We introduce a method which gates pullback sequences by examining the imaging data alone, without requiring synchronous ECG, and guarantees that frames will be collected at those points in time when the heart is maximally motionless (i.e., regardless of the fraction of cardiac phase associated with those points).

Within an image set, different images contain various levels of discriminative information and thus should contribute differently to the results. However, the discriminative level is not accessible directly. To this end, we propose a confidence driven network to perform point-to-set matching. The proposed system comprises a feature extraction network (FEN) and a performance prediction network (PPN). Given an input image, the FEN generates a template, while the PPN generates a confidence score which measures the discriminative level of the template. At matching time, the template is used to compute a point-to-point similarity. The similarity scores from different samples in the set are integrated at a score level, weighted by the predicted confidence scores.

            "Abstract": "Human interaction dynamics are known to play an important role in the development of robust pedestrian trackers that are applicable to a variety of applications in video surveillance. Traditional approaches to pedestrian tracking assume that each pedestrian walks independently and the tracker predicts the location based on an underlying motion model, such as a constant velocity or autoregressive model. Recent approaches have begun to leverage interaction, especially by modeling the repulsion force, among pedestrians to improve motion predictions. However, human interaction is more complex and is influenced by both repulsion and attraction effects. This motivates the use of a more complex human interaction model for pedestrian tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel visual tracking method by leveraging complex social interactions. We present an algorithm that decomposes social interactions into multiple potential interaction modes. We integrate these multiple social interaction modes into an interactive Markov Chain Monte Carlo tracker. We demonstrate how the developed method translates into a more informed motion prediction, resulting in a robust tracking performance. We test our method on videos from unconstrained outdoor environments and compare it against popular multi-object trackers.",

Intuitively, a collective understanding of human part movements can lead to better understanding and representation of any human action. In this paper, we propose a generative representation of the motion of the human body parts to learn and classify human actions. The proposed representation combines the advantages of both local and global representations, encoding the relevant motion information as well as being robust to local appearance changes. Our work is motivated by the pictorial structures model and the framework of sparse representations for recognition. Human part movements are represented efficiently through quantization in the polar space. The key discrimination within each action is efficiently encoded by sparse representation to perform classification. The proposed method is evaluated on both the KTH and the UCF action datasets and the results are compared against other state-of-the-art methods.",

To this end, we propose a method that learns coupled distance metrics in two steps. In addition, we propose to jointly learn two semi-coupled bases that yield optimal representations. In particular, the HR images are used to learn a basis and a distance metric that result in increased class-separation. The LR images are then used to learn a basis and a distance metric that map the LR data to their class-discriminated HR pairs. Finally, the two distance metrics are refined to simultaneously enhance the class-separation of both HR class-discriminated and LR projected \u2026",

Since many anthropometric measurements are not available at test time in real-life scenarios, we employ a learning using privileged information (LUPI) framework in a regression setup. Instead of using the LUPI paradigm for regression in its original form (i.e., \u03b5-SVR+), we train regression models that predict the privileged information at test time. The predictions are then used, along with observable features, to perform height estimation. Once the height is estimated, a mapping to classes is performed.

The method relies on Convolutional Point-set Representation (CPR), a carefully designed matrix representation to summarize different layers of information encoded in the set of detected points in the annotated image. The CPR disentangles the dependencies of shape and different pose parameters and enables updating different parameters in a sequential manner via convolutional neural networks and recurrent layers. When updating the pose parameters, we sample reprojection errors along with a predicted direction and update the parameters based on the pattern of reprojection errors. This technique boosts the model's capability in searching a local minimum under challenging scenarios. We also demonstrate that annotation from different sources can be merged under the framework of CPR and contributes to outperforming the current state-of-the-art solutions for 3D face alignment. Experiments indicate the proposed CPRFA (CPR-based Face Alignment) significantly improves 3D alignment accuracy when the densely annotated image contains noise and missing values, which is common under \"in-the-wild\" acquisition scenarios.",

Initially, a geometry-image representation is used to effectively resample the raw 3D data. Subsequently, a wavelet transform is applied and a biometric signature composed of 7,200 wavelet coefficients is extracted. Finally, we apply a second linear dimensionality reduction step to the wavelet coefficients using Linear Discriminant Analysis and compute a compact biometric signature. Although this biometric signature consists of just 57 coefficients, it is highly discriminant. Our approach, UR3D-C, is experimentally validated using four publicly available databases (FRGC vl, FRGC v2, Bosphorus and BU-3DFE). State-of-the-art performance is reported in all of the above databases.",

However, the face unlocking feature of devices using regular 2D camera sensors exhibits poor performance in low light environments. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised low light face enhancement method to improve face verification performance on low light face images. The proposed method is a network with two components: decomposition and reconstruction. The decomposition component splits an input low light face image into face normals and face albedo, while the reconstruction component enhances and reconstructs the lighting condition of the input image using the spherical harmonic lighting coefficients of a direct ambient white light. The network is trained in a semi-supervised manner using both labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real data. Qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method produces more \u2026",

In addition, we present two versions of our framework that: (i) use gallery-based information (i.e., gallery versus gallery scores), and (ii) update available information in an online fashion. We use the theory of Stochastic Dominance to illustrate that the proposed framework can increase the system's performance.

To relieve the observer of such a labor-intensive task, an automated tool is needed that can detect and quantify the coronary calcifications.

An important part of any such system is the component that performs the Human Motion Capture (HMC); in order for human motion to be processed and semantically analyzed, a mathematical representation of the observed motion needs to be extracted. There are two separate aspects to a HMC system; sensing (hardware) and processing (software). The processing itself comprises of an initialization (anthropometry and pose estimation) and a tracking phase. In this chapter, we present methods for three-dimensional model-based human motion capture from uncalibrated passive optical sensors with semi-antomatic initialization and tracking.

Starting from an initial number of hidden states and increasing their number incrementally, the Viterbi path is computed for each HMM.

We utilize several different evaluation methods, both analytical and experimental. The former includes the order of decay of the global error, the local spatial error, and the behavior of the filters in the frequency domain. In the experimental part, visualizations of both synthetic and medical data are produced and studied. We show that the HDAFs exhibit superior behavior if the volumetric data are distorted by high frequency noise, and perform well under noise free conditions. This due to their ability to adjust the range of recovered frequencies.",

In the United States, sudden heart attack remains the number one cause of death and accounts for the majority of the $280 billion burden of cardiovascular diseases. In spite of the advancements in cardiovascular imaging techniques, the rate of deaths due to unpredicted heart attack remains high. Thus, novel computational tools are of critical need, in order to mine quantitative parameters from the imaging data for early detection of persons with a high likelihood of developing a heart attack in the near future (vulnerable patients). In this paper, we present our progress in the research of computational methods for the extraction of cardiovascular risk biomarkers from cardiovascular imaging data. In particular, we focus on the methods developed for the analysis of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) data.",

Due to this disparity of interest, existing methods for retrieval based on demographic attributes tend to lag behind the more well-studied algorithms designed purely for face matching. The question this raises is whether a face recognition system could be leveraged to solve these other problems and, if so, how effective it could be.

To accomplish this task, we systematically analyze the impact of facial attributes on the performance of a state-of-the-art face recognition method and through extensive experimentation, quantitatively analyze the performance degradation under different types of occlusion. Our proposed Occlusion-aware face REcOgnition (OREO) approach improves the generalization ability of the facial embedding generator by learning discriminative embeddings despite the presence of such occlusions. The contributions of our occlusion-aware approach are two-fold. First, an attention mechanism is proposed that extracts local identity-related features from the global feature representations. The local features are then aggregated with the global representations to form a single facial embedding. Second, a simple, yet effective, training strategy is introduced to balance the non-occluded and occluded facial images. Extensive experiments with comparisons to strong baselines demonstrate that OREO improves the generalization ability of face recognition under occlusions by 10.17% in a single-image-based setting and outperforms the baseline by approximately 2% in terms of rank-1 accuracy in an image-set-based scenario.",

            "Abstract": "Monocular 3D facial shape reconstruction from a single 2D facial image has been an active research area due to its wide applications. Inspired by the success of deep neural networks (DNN), we propose a DNN-based approach for End-to-End 3D FAce Reconstruction (UH-E2FAR) from a single 2D image. Different from recent works that reconstruct and refine the 3D face in an iterative manner using both an RGB image and an initial 3D facial shape rendering, our DNN model is end-to-end, and thus the complicated 3D rendering process can be avoided. Moreover, we integrate in the DNN architecture two components, namely a multi-task loss function and a fusion convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve facial expression reconstruction. With the multi-task loss function, 3D face reconstruction is divided into neutral 3D facial shape reconstruction and expressive 3D facial shape reconstruction. The neutral 3D facial shape is class-specific. Therefore, higher layer features are useful. In comparison, the expressive 3D facial shape favors lower or intermediate layer features. With the fusion-CNN, features from different intermediate layers are fused and transformed for predicting the 3D expressive facial shape. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our end-to-end framework in improving the accuracy of 3D face reconstruction.",

Our method is different from conventional methods as we estimate the high-frequency components, that are not used in other methods, to reconstruct a higher-resolution image, rather than studying the direct relationship between the high and low resolution images. Quantitative and qualitative results are reported for both synthetic and surveillance facial image databases.",

We cast the problem of image segmentation as the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation of a Markov Random Field which, in essence, is equivalent to the minimization of the corresponding Gibbs energy function. We then incorporate a set of constraints into the Gibbs energy function that collectively force the resulting segmentation contour/surface to have a shape similar to that of a given shape template. In particular, we introduce a flux-maximization constraint and a generalized template-based star-shape constraint that are encoded into the first- and second-order clique potentials of the Gibbs energy function, respectively.

            "Abstract": "Statistical shape models, such as Active Shape Models (ASMs), suffer from their inability to represent a large range of variations of a complex shape and to account for the large errors in detection of model points. We propose a novel method (dubbed PDM-ENLOR) that overcomes these limitations by locating each shape model point individually using an ensemble of local regression models and appearance cues from selected model points. Our method first detects a set of reference points which were selected based on their saliency during training. For each model point, an ensemble of regressors is built. From the locations of the detected reference points, each regressor infers a candidate location for that model point using local geometric constraints, encoded by a point distribution model (PDM). The final location of that point is determined as a weighted linear combination, whose coefficients are learnt from the training data, of candidates proposed from its ensemble's component regressors. We use different subsets of reference points as explanatory variables for the component regressors to provide varying degrees of locality for the models in each ensemble. This helps our ensemble model to capture a larger range of shape variations as compared to a single PDM. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on the challenging problem of segmenting gene expression images of mouse brain.",

On the lifted facial texture we then extract various local features, which are further enhanced by the occlusion encodings computed on the self-occlusion mask, resulting in a pose-robust face signature, a novel feature representation of the original 2D facial image.

Current methods for determining efficacy of experimental antibiotics on C. difficile involve antibiotic killing rates and do not give insight into the drug's pharmacologic effects. Considering this, we hypothesized that by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in tandem to drug killing curves, we would be able to determine efficacy and visualize the phenotypic response to drug treatment. To test this hypothesis, supraMIC kill curves were conducted using vancomycin, metronidazole, fidaxomicin, and ridinilazole.

Even though some cross-spectral datasets were presented in the past, they were acquired in a constrained setup, which limited the performance of methods for the aforementioned problems under a cross-spectral setting. This work introduces a new dataset, named EDGE20, that can be used in addressing the problems of pedestrian detection, face detection, and face recognition in images captured using trail cameras under the VIS and NIR spectra. Data acquisition was performed in an outdoor environment, during both day and night, under unconstrained acquisition conditions. The collection of images is accompanied by a rich set of annotations, consisting of person and facial bounding boxes, unique subject identifiers, and labels that characterize facial images as frontal, profile, or back faces. Moreover, the performance of several state-of-the-art methods was evaluated for each of the scenarios covered by our dataset. The baseline results we obtained highlight the difficulty of current methods in the tasks of cross-spectral pedestrian detection, face detection, and face recognition due to unconstrained conditions, including low resolution, pose variation, illumination variation, occlusions, and motion blur.",

Early detection and aggressive treatment of hidden (asymptomatic) atherosclerotic plaques that cause heart attack or stroke are most needed. However, existing clinical tools are not sufficient to address this need. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a catheter-based medical imaging tool that is capable of providing cross-sectional images of arteries. It is by far the most powerful clinical tool available for characterization of atherosclerotic plaques. However, existing IVUS is unable to detect plaque inflammation which is a key factor in complications of atherosclerotic plaques. Contrast enhanced IVUS (CE-IVUS) for detection of Vasa Vasorum (VV), microvessles that feed the vessel wall, can indirectly image plaque \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance low quality images. Specifically, we focus on facial images. Low quality images are often degraded by motion artifacts, sensor limitations, and noise contamination leading to loss of higher order information that is essential for face recognition. First, we demonstrate that conventional denoising and deblurring methods are not able to fully recover the latent image resulting in residual artifacts in the image. Then, we present a novel approach for image enhancement that removes these residual artifacts using sparse encoding methods. The potential of the method is demonstrated through promising results on facial images for face recognition application.",

The shape information in 3-D facial data can reduce or even overcome these challenges. However, high expenses of 3-D cameras prevent their widespread use. Fortunately, 2.5-D facial data from emerging portable RGB-D cameras provide a good balance for this dilemma.

Samples from RF signal corresponding to contrast-free baseline IVUS and contrast agent were acquired and used to compute spectral-based and wavelet-based features over a three-dimensional window of size. The samples were used to compute two contrast detection classifiers (CDC) based on a one-class cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVM) method. For the first contrast detection classifier (CDC1), we train the oneclass SVM to recognize the contrast agent RF signal. For the second contrast detection classifier (CDC2) we train the SVM to recognize baseline IVUS RF signal and detect the contrast agent by the rejection from this model. The performance of these models was evaluated for frequency-domain and wavelet-based features using different window sizes by computing the rate of the detection of contrast-agent (CD) and the rejection of baseline IVUS (BR) for CDC1 and the rate of the detection of baseline IVUS (BD) and the rejection of contrast agent (CR) for CDC2 in two 40MHz IVUS sequences from swine on which a bolus injection of contrast agent (SonoVue\u00ae) was employed. Using frequency-domain features, the best average performances for CDC1 (CD= 96.61% and BR= 95.67%) and CDC2 (BD= 96.79% and CR= 94.24%) were obtained for a window of size:(r= 255, \u03b8= 7, t= 13).

The recognition task is even more challenging when there is insufficient training data available in the gallery, or when the gallery dataset originates from one side of the face while the probe dataset originates from the other. The authors present a new method for computing the distance between two biometric signatures acquired under such challenging conditions. This method improves upon an existing Semi-Coupled Dictionary Learning method by computing a jointly-optimized solution that incorporates the reconstruction cost, the discrimination cost, and the semi-coupling cost.

We introduce a probabilistic classification approach based on conditional random fields (CRFs) to indirectly propagate knowledge from privileged to regular feature space.

A Mahalanobis metric is learned simultaneously to measure the similarity between sets more accurately. In particular, each gallery set is represented as a regularized affine hull spanned by the learned prototypes.

Coronary calcification burden has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular risk. Currently, an observer has to identify the coronary calcifications among a set of candidate regions that are obtained by thresholding and connected component labeling. To relieve the observer of such a laborintensive task, an automated tool is desired that can detect and quantify the coronary calcifications. However, the diverse and heterogeneous nature of the candidate regions poses a significant challenge to the accurate detection of coronary calcifications. In this paper, we investigate a supervised hierarchical classification-based approach to distinguish the coronary calcifications from all the candidate regions. At each level of the hierarchy we learn an ensemble of classifiers where each classifier is a cost-sensitive learner trained on a distinct asymmetrically sampled data subset. Our method attained the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.95%, 90.76%, and 98.35%, respectively, on a dataset of electron beam computed tomography scans from 205 subjects.",

Face Recognition Vendor Tests (FRVT) are organized at regular intervals by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and cooperating institutions. The last FRVT (2002) showed that no system was capable of offering the accuracy desired for field deployment. Thus the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) was set up with the aim to build systems with an order of magnitude higher accuracy. We have applied our previous work on deformable models and 3D representations to the problem of recognizing faces, based on 3D and infrared facial data.

            "Abstract": "Environmental factors affecting nutrient availability during development can cause predisposition to diseases later in life. To identify chemicals in the environment capable of altering nutrient mobilization, we analyzed yolk malabsorption in the zebrafish embryo, which relies on maternally-derived yolk for nutrition during its first week of life. Embryos of the transgenic zebrafish line HGn50D, which fluoresce in the yolk syncytial layer, were exposed from two to five days post fertilization to different chemicals. We developed a software package to automatically and accurately segment and quantify the area of the fluorescing yolk in images captured at the end of the treatment period. Based on this quantification, we found that prochloraz decreased yolk absorption, while butralin, tetrabromobisphenol A, tetrachlorobisphenol A and tributyltin increased yolk absorption. Given the number and variety of industrial chemicals in \u2026",

The first random field provides a binary segmentation of the image to superpixels that are candidates belonging to cells, and to superpixels that are part of the background, by imposing a prior on the smoothness of the texture features. The second random field selects the superpixels whose boundaries are more likely to form elongated cell walls by imposing a smoothness prior onto the orientations of the boundaries. The method is evaluated on a dataset of Clostridium difficile cell images and is compared to CellDetect.",

            "Abstract": "Dynamics of development can be followed by confocal time-lapse microscopy of live transgenic zebrafish embryos expressing fluorescence in specific tissues or cells. A difficulty with imaging whole embryo development is that zebrafish embryos grow substantially in length. When mounted as regularly done in 0.3-1% low melt agarose, the agarose imposes growth restriction, leading to distortions in the soft embryo body. Yet, to perform confocal time-lapse microscopy, the embryo must be immobilized. This article describes a layered mounting method for zebrafish embryos that restrict the motility of the embryos while allowing for the unrestricted growth. The mounting is performed in layers of agarose at different concentrations. To demonstrate the usability of this method, whole embryo vascular, neuronal and muscle development was imaged in transgenic fish for 55 consecutive hours. This mounting method can be used for easy, low-cost imaging of whole zebrafish embryos using inverted microscopes without requirements of molds or special equipment.",

However, the concatenated facial template increases in size and contains redundant information. Previous solutions aim to reduce the dimensionality of the facial template without considering the occlusion pattern of the facial patches. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-guided compact template learning (OGCTL) approach that only uses the information from visible patches to construct the compact template. The compact face representation is not sensitive to the number of patches that are used to construct the facial template, and is more suitable for incorporating the information from different view angles for image-set based face recognition. Instead of using occlusion masks in face matching (e.g., DPRFS [38]), the proposed method uses occlusion masks in template \u2026",

These prior models are very effective for Bayesian image estimation and lead to an improved estimation performance over related earlier techniques.",

Each label represents images of a specific domain. In particular, a set of two labels per subject, one for the NIR images and one for the VIS images, are used for training a NIR-VIS face recognition model. The classification of images into different domains reduces the intra-class variation and lessens the negative impact of data imbalance in training.

Specifically, we propose a method for age classification which integrates a frontalization algorithm before feature extraction.

In addition, we develop a new validation strategy for denoising of photon-limited images containing sparse structures, such as neurons (the structure of interest is less than 5% of total volume). The validation method, based on tubular neighborhoods around the structure, is used to determine the optimal threshold of the proposed denoising algorithm.

The user initially selects a set of image points that constitute the projection of selected landmarks. Using this information, along with a priori statistical information about the human body, a set of plausible segment length estimates is produced. In the third step, a set of plausible poses is inferred using a geometric method based on joint limit constraints. In the fourth step, pose and anthropometric measurements are obtained by minimizing an appropriate cost function subject to the associated constraints. The novelty of our approach is the use of anthropometric statistics to constrain the estimation process that allows the simultaneous estimation of both anthropometry and pose. We demonstrate the accuracy, advantages, and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (C. diff) is the most common cause of death due to secondary infection in hospital patients in the United States. Detection of C. diff cells in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images is an important task to quantify the efficacy of the under-development treatments. However, detecting C. diff cells in SEM images is a challenging problem due to the presence of inhomogeneous illumination and occlusion. An Illumination normalization pre-processing step destroys the texture and adds noise to the image. Furthermore, cells are often clustered together resulting in touching cells and occlusion. In this paper, DETCID, a deep cell detection method using adversarial training, specifically robust to inhomogeneous illumination and occlusion, is proposed. An adversarial network is developed to provide region proposals and pass the proposals to a feature extraction network. Furthermore, a modified IoU metric is developed to allow the detection of touching cells in various orientations. The results indicate that DETCID outperforms the state-of-the-art in detection of touching cells in SEM images by at least 20 percent improvement of mean average precision.",

The main reasons for this trend are the ever increasing new range of applications (e.g., human-robot interaction, gaming, sports performance analysis) which are driven by current technological advances. Although recent approaches have dealt with several challenges and have reported remarkable results, 3D pose estimation remains a largely unsolved problem because real-life applications impose several challenges which are not fully addressed by existing methods. For example, estimating the 3D pose of multiple people in an outdoor environment remains a largely unsolved problem.

In this paper, we propose a similarity-based appearance-prior to fit a compartmental geometric atlas of the mouse brain in gene expression images. A subdivision mesh which is used to model the geometry is deformed using a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework. The proposed appearance-prior is computed as a function of the similarity between local patches at corresponding atlas locations from two images. In addition, we introduce a similarity-saliency score to select the mesh points that are relevant for the computation of the proposed prior. Our method significantly improves the accuracy of the atlas fitting, especially in the regions that are influenced by the selected similarity-salient points, and outperforms the previous subdivision mesh fitting methods for gene expression images.",

We propose a feature pruning method for removing irrelevant and redundant features based on the spatio-temporal neighborhood of each feature in a video sequence. The proposed framework assumes that human movements are highly correlated with sound emissions. For this reason, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is employed to find correlation between the audio and video features prior to fusion.

To address these challenges, we propose a method that jointly learns prototypes and a Mahalanobis distance. The prototypes learned represent the gallery image sets using fewer samples, while the classification accuracy is maintained or improved. The distance learned ensures that the notion of similarity between sets of images is reflected more accurately. Specifically, each gallery set is modeled as a hull spanned by the learned prototypes. The prototypes and distance metric are alternately updated using an iterative scheme.

            "Abstract": "For many computer vision applications such as image captioning, visual question answering, and person search, learning discriminative feature representations at both image and text level is an essential yet challenging problem. Its challenges originate from the large word variance in the text domain as well as the difficulty of accurately measuring the distance between the features of the two modalities. Most prior work focuses on the latter challenge, by introducing loss functions that help the network learn better feature representations but fail to account for the complexity of the textual input. With that in mind, we introduce TIMAM: a Text-Image Modality Adversarial Matching approach that learns modality-invariant feature representations using adversarial and cross-modal matching objectives. In addition, we demonstrate that BERT, a publicly-available language model that extracts word embeddings, can successfully be applied in the text-to-image matching domain. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art cross-modal matching performance on four widely-used publicly-available datasets resulting in absolute improvements ranging from 2% to 5% in terms of rank-1 accuracy.",
