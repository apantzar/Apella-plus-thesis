In this paper, the simultaneous detection of seismic events contained in a given data record is formulated as such a problem and an approximation of the probability density function under the null hypothesis, of a ratio based test statistic is proposed. By exploiting some interesting properties satisfied by the ratio of identical distributed Random Variables, as well as the sparsity of the seismic events in the data record, we succeed in obtaining such an approximation. From a series of experiments we have conducted in both synthetic and real seismic data, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is confirmed.",

Most existing L 2-based filter design techniques utilize this flexibility in order to improve their performance. In this paper we propose a new general method for the weighted L 2-based design of arbitrary FIR filters. In particular, we propose a well-defined optimization criterion that depends on the selection of the desired response inside the transition regions. By optimizing our criterion we obtain desired responses that produce weighted mean square error optimum filters with extremely good characteristics. The proposed method is computationally simple since it requires the solution of a linear system of equations.",

            "Abstract": "The eye center localization is a challenging problem faced by many computer vision applications. The challenges typically stem from the scene variability, such as, the wide range of shapes, the lighting conditions, the view angles and the occlusions. Nowadays, the increasing interest on deep neural networks requires a large volume of training data. However, a significant issue is the dependency on labeled data, which are expensive to obtain and susceptible to errors. To address these issues, we propose a deep network, dubbed PupilTAN, that performs image-to-heatmap Translation and an Adversarial training framework that solves the eye localization problem in a few-shot unsupervised way. The key idea is to estimate, by using only a few ground-truth shots, the heatmaps centers' pdf and use it as a generator to create random heatmaps that follow the same probability distribution of the real ones. We showcase that training the deep network with these artificial heatmaps in an adversarial framework not only makes us less dependent on labeled data, but also leads to a significant accuracy improvement. The proposed network achieves realtime performance in a general-purpose computer environment and improves the state-of-the-art accuracy for both MUCT and BioID datasets, even compared with supervised techniques. Furthermore, our model is robust even in the case of reducing its size of up to 1/16 of the original network (0.2 M parameters), demonstrating comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art with high practical value to real-time applications.",

Specifically, for a pair of mesh nodes, this novel surface representation is constructed by computing the joint visibility among all nodes of the geodesic path connecting them and are at a certain absolute distance each other. By considering different such distances, multiple joint visibility values are computed, organized in a sequence. Although the proposed mesh descriptor can be used in many different \u2026",

In this work we improve upon the state-of-the-art pixel-level, Least-Squares (LS) based groupwise image registration methods. Specifically, we propose a new iterative algorithm which outperforms in terms of its computational cost, a recently introduced LS based iterative congealing scheme. Namely, the particle system that was introduced in that work is used and by imposing its \u201ccenter of mass\u201d to be motionless, during each iteration of the minimization process, a sequence of \u201ccentroid\u201d images whose limit is the unknown \u201cmean\u201d image is optimally in closed form defined, thus solving in a reduced computational cost the groupwise problem. Moreover, the registration technique is properly adapted by the use of Self Quotient Images (SQI) in order to become capable for solving the groupwise registration of multimodal images. Since the proposed congealing technique is invariant to the size of the image set, it can be used for the successful solution of the problem on large image sets with low complexity. From the application of the proposed technique on a series of experiments for the groupwise registration of face, unimodal and multimodal magnetic resonance image sets its performance seems to be very good.",

            "Abstract": "A series of strong earthquakes took place at the Trichonis lake area, during April 2007. Three events, with M~ 5.0 occurred within one day, causing damages to almost all nearby villages and especially at the small town of Thermo. The sequence lasted for more than one month with small to moderate size events. It was recorded by regional networks and results related to its time and space evolution have already been published. Just after the major events a microseismic network was deployed in the area, by the University of Patras, Seismology Laboratory. Eight stations were installed, with short period, three component sensors and portable digital recorders. The network was in operation for a period of one month and a lot of events were recorded by enough stations to provide a reliable location. We present here the analysis of these data using modern methodologies like waveform cross-correlation techniques and further relocation of the events using waveform based differential time. The results partially support the findings of the regional networks, as regards the gross characteristics of the aftershock sequence, but provide an enhanced description of it. The space time evolution of the aftershock sequence reveals the activation of more than one fault in the area and suggests the connection of the sequence with an unmapped fault.",

More specifically, the time (t)-parameterized Frennet-Serret frame for tracking the signer\u2019s wrist is used and the curvature of the trajectory, is proposed for the identification of the Sign Language (SL) video keyframes. Specifically, a video frame is characterized as keyframe if on that time instance the t-parameterized curvature function attains a maximum value. Finally, in order to properly define the wrist 2-D motion model, a skeleton tracker is used. The proposed scheme is adaptable, ie, the number of extracted keyframes varies according to the complexity of the signs, while preserving the semantic content. This in turn makes it attractive for applications like video-calling. Its performance in terms of the achieved compression and intelligibility ratios was evaluated on a ground-truth sequence and outperformed its s-parameterized counterpart (s is the arc length); it also outperformed a moment-based SL summarization technique. Furthermore, the proposed scheme was experimentally evaluated on a dataset containing 5500 signs by SL specialists with very promising results. Finally, the proposed keyframe extraction was evaluated against the aforementioned techniques on the same dataset via the use of a GRU neural network on the gloss classification problem; its superior accuracy in identifying the gloss meaning was confirmed.",

            "Abstract": "The invariance of the similarity measure in photometric distortions as well as its capability in producing subpixel accuracy are two desired and often required features in most stereo vision applications. In this paper we propose a new correlation-based measure which incorporates both mentioned requirements. Specifically, by using an appropriate interpolation scheme in the candidate windows of the matching image, and using the classical zero mean normalized cross correlation function, we introduce a suitable measure. Although the proposed measure is a nonlinear function of the sub-pixel displacement parameter, its maximization results in a closed form solution, resulting in reduced complexity for its use in matching techniques. Application of the proposed measure in a number of benchmark stereo pair images reveals its superiority over existing correlation-based techniques used for subpixel accuracy.",

The notion of visibility context is used as the shape signature, which actually provides a physical meaning to the representation. The visibility serves as a means to manipulate on the shape parts applying clustering techniques to the corresponding graph. Therefore, the decomposition problem is re-casted as a clustering problem. An unsupervised Diffusion Clustering Algorithm is proposed, which efficiently achieves to capture the functional shape parts. Although the proposed algorithm is developed and fits very well to the specific problem of the shape partitioning, its utility is undoubtedly much more general. Experimental results conducted on two and three dimensional shape databases are very promising.",

            "Abstract": "Compared with pairwise registration, the groupwise one is capable of handling a large-scale population of images simultaneously in an unbiased way. In this work we improve upon the state-of-the-art pixel-level, Least-Squares (LS)-based groupwise image registration methods. Specifically, the registration technique is properly adapted by the use of Self Quotient Images (SQI) in order to become capable for solving the groupwise registration of photometrically distorted, partially occluded as well as unimodal and multimodal images. Moreover, the proposed groupwise technique is linear to the cardinality of the image set and thus it can be used for the successful solution of the problem on large image sets with low complexity. From the application of the proposed technique on a series of experiments for the groupwise registration of photometrically and geometrically distorted, partially occluded faces as well as unimodal and multimodal magnetic resonance image sets and its comparison with the Lucas\u2013Kanade Entropy (LKE) algorithm, the obtained results look very promising, in terms of alignment quality, using as figures of merit the mean Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (m P S N R) and mean Structural Similarity (m S S I M), and computational cost.

            "Abstract": "The amplitude of the Fourier acceleration spectrum decays rapidly at high frequencies. This has been modeled by the parameter \u03bar (Anderson and Hough, 1984). The site-specific component of \u03bar, named \u03ba0, describes the contribution of the first few km of the geological profile beneath a certain site. \u03ba0 is an important parameter in characterizing high-frequency ground motion, crucial for certain structures such as nuclear facilities and small concrete dams. Large scatter has been observed in the values of \u03ba0 published in literature, which may be due to different analysts, different approaches and frequency bands used for its estimation, and the different regions data may come from, the trade-offs with the source (stress drop) or the site (amplification). As it is the case with any parameter estimation problem, the presence of noise in the data constitutes an important factor of uncertainty in the obtained estimates. Nevertheless, despite the extensive research on the topic of kappa, a detailed study treating the impact of noise on the problem of kappa estimation is missing from the literature. This is exactly the goal of the present work. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments using various synthetic noise models, both correlated and uncorrelated, as well as noise from real records. The kappa estimations were based on \u2018noisy\u2019 versions of a high-quality real dataset. We used recordings from an accelerometric downhole array in the Corinth Gulf, Greece, whose high sampling rate and high SNR render it \u2018best-case\u2019 scenario in practice.

In such cases the replacement of the unknown probability density function under the null hypothesis by its empirical counterpart, constitutes a possibility. In this work, a two stage procedure is proposed. The first one concerns the estimation of the empirical functions of the noise process itself as well as its whitened counterpart.

First we demonstrate (mathematically and through simulations) that, under the stochastic\u2010signal assumption, the periodogram ordinates of the noisy recording can be considered independent exponential random variables with a frequency\u2010dependent mean. Using this finding, the estimation of seismological parameters is translated into a well\u2010defined maximum likelihood (ML) problem, allowing a fast, accurate, and robust solution. Although the proposed ML methodology constitutes a general estimation framework that we believe can improve any spectral analysis, here we specifically apply it to the high\u2010frequency attenuation parameter (\u03ba), crucial for understanding rock ground motion.

Its performance, in terms of the quality of the achieved clustering, does not depend on the distribution of the cluster's size.

Our analysis implies that fractality may possess an aesthetic value that affected Mondrian, perhaps in a similar way as it inspired Jackson Pollock, another famous painter who incorporated fractality in several of his paintings. In recent years there has been a stimulating debate among scientists arguing for and against the thesis that Jackson Pollock's drip paintings when analysed at small scales can be described by the mathematics of fractal geometry. Our suggestion that fractal patterns exist in the paintings of a second famous artist - in this case Piet Mondrian - further supports the hypothesis that the beauty which exists in fractality may affect consciously or subconsciously such great painters as Jackson Pollock and Piet Mondrian.",

            "Abstract": "Event relocation (or relative location) techniques exploit the particularities of similar (i.e. closely spaced) seismic events in order to minimize the impact of unmodelled velocity errors in the estimation of the hypocenter parameters. The location uncertainty obtained from relocation procedures is typically orders of magnitude lower than that obtained from conventional event location methods. The relocation of hypocentral parameters constitutes a complex procedure that comprises of three main steps. The first step involves the examination the available data set of seismic records with the goal of recognizing groups of similar events. It can be further decomposed in smaller tasks involving the detection of seismic events from continuous records, the assessment of the pairwise similarity of the events and the clustering of similar pairs of event. The second step of the relocation procedure concerns the estimation of travel time differences between event pairs of the same cluster, at the same station. Finally, the third (and final) step of the relocation procedure consists of solving the inverse problem for the estimation of the relative locations that best fit the differential times obtained from the second step. The main contributions of the present thesis can be summarized as follows: Event detection and picking. In the present thesis we treat the detection problem as a problem of record segmentation by exploiting the particular nature of seismic signals, as well as a number of very interesting properties possessed by exchangeable random variables.

The main drawback of this mode of operation is that there is no guarantee that the model-set is free of noise and outliers, which contaminates the estimation of the registration parameters. Unlike previous work, the proposed method treats all the point sets on an equal footing: they are realizations of a Gaussian mixture (GMM) and the registration is cast into a clustering problem.
