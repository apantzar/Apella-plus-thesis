            "Abstract": "24 In this paper a seizure detector using EEG and ECG signals, as a module of a healthcare system, is 25 presented. Specifically, the module is based on short-time analysis with time-domain and 26 frequency-domain features and classification using support vector machines. The seizure detection 27 module was evaluated on three subjects with diagnosed idiopathic generalized epilepsy manifested with 28 absences. The achieved seizure detection accuracy was approximately 90% for all evaluated subjects. 29 Feature ranking investigation and evaluation of the seizure detection module using subsets of features 30 showed that the feature vector composed of approximately the 65%-best ranked parameters provides a 31 good trade-off between computational demands and accuracy. This configurable architecture allows 32 the seizure detection module to operate as part of a healthcare system in offline mode as well as in online 33 mode, where real-time performance is needed.",

Specific 3D image editing tools can be used to manipulate the liver models and create virtual surgical cases. Objective. The aim of our study was to create virtual hepatic surgery scenarios using a novel liver segmentation and preoperative planning application and evaluating it as an educational tool. Method. A liver segmentation and preoperative planning application was developed on MATLAB\u00ae 2013a. Special image editing tools were designed to allow manipulation of the exported 3D liver models. Three pathological and two liver imaging datasets from healthy patients were used for the validation. The 3D liver models which have been created after liver segmentation were then manipulated by; 1) changing tumors\u2019 volumes, 2) adding tumors and 3) designing liver injuries. Addition \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML) and the European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (PKDD) were jointly organized this year for the? fth time in a row, after some years of mutual independence before. After Freiburg (2001), Helsinki (2002), Cavtat (2003) and Pisa (2004), Porto received the 16th edition of ECML and the 9th PKDD in October 3\u20137. Having the two conferences together seems to be working well: 585 di? erent paper submissions were received for both events, which maintains the high s-mission standard of last year. Of these, 335 were submitted to ECML only, 220 to PKDD only and 30 to both. Such a high volume of scienti? c work required a tremendous e? ort from Area Chairs, Program Committee members and some additional reviewers. On average, PC members had 10 papers to evaluate, and Area Chairs had 25 papers to decide upon. We managed to have 3 highly qua-? edindependentreviewsperpaper (withveryfewexceptions) andoneadditional overall input from one of the Area Chairs. After the authors\u2019 responses and the online discussions for many of the papers, we arrived at the? nal selection of 40 regular papers for ECML and 35 for PKDD. Besides these, 32 others were accepted as short papers for ECML and 35 for PKDD. This represents a joint acceptance rate of around 13% for regular papers and 25% overall. We thank all involved for all the e? ort with reviewing and selection of papers.

            "Abstract": "In this article we present a methodology for the automatic classification of sleep stages. The methodology relies on short-time analysis with time and frequency domain features followed by unsupervised feature subspace clustering. For each cluster of the feature space a different classification setup is adopted thus fine-tuning the classification algorithm to the specifics of the corresponding feature subspace area. The experimental results showed that the proposed methodology achieved a sleep stage classification accuracy equal to 92.53%, which corresponds to an improvement of approximately 3% compared to the best performing single classifier without applying clustering of the feature space.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new approach for content-based similarity search for brain images. Based on the keyblock representation, our framework employs the principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality and improve the computational efficiency. Moreover, the \"similarity\" between two images is measured using both the histogram model and the summed Euclidean distance. We performed experiments on different fMRI datasets, and compared the proposed framework with the keyblock approach. The results of the experiments demonstrated the improved effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in similarity searches.",

            "Abstract": "Large graphs can be found in a wide array of scientific fields ranging from sociology and biology to scientometrics and computer science. Their analysis is by no means a trivial task due to their sheer size and complex structure. Such structure encompasses features so diverse as diameter shrinking, power law degree distribution and self similarity, edge interdependence, and communities. When the adjacency matrix of a graph is considered, then new, spectral properties arise such as primary eigenvalue component decay function, eigenvalue decay function, eigenvalue sign alternation around zero, and spectral gap. Graph mining is the scientific field which attempts to extract information and knowledge from graphs through their structural and spectral properties. Graph modeling is the associated field of generating synthetic graphs with properties similar to those of real graphs in order to simulate the latter. Such simulations may be desirable because of privacy concerns, cost, or lack of access to real data. Pivotal to simulation are low-and high-level software packages offering graph analysis and visualization capabilities. This survey outlines the most important structural and spectral graph properties, a considerable number of graph models, as well the most common graph mining and graph learning tools.",

Standard techniques for analysis have traditionally focused on finding the most significant areas of brain activation, and have only recently begun to explore the importance of their spatial characteristics. We compare fMRI contrast images and significance maps to training sets of similar maps using the spatial distribution of activation values. We demonstrate that a Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) classifier for either type of map can differentiate patients from controls accurately for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, schizophrenia, and mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI).",

This paper investigates the sparsity patterns of a multilayer perceptron netwrok trained to mount a man-on-the-middle attack on the DES symmetric cryptosystem. The notions of absolute and effective synaptic weight sparsity are introduced and their importance to network learning procedure is explained. Finally, the results from the training of the actual multilayer perceptron are outlined and discussed.

            "Abstract": "Gene expression signatures in the mammalian brain hold the key to understanding neural development and neurological diseases, and gene expression profiles have been widely used in functional genomic studies. However, not much work in traditional gene expression profiling takes into account the location information of a gene's expressions in the brain. Gene expression maps, which are obtained by combining voxelation and microarrays, contain spatial information regarding the expression of genes in mice's brain. We study approaches for identifying the relationship between gene expression maps and gene functions, for mining association rules, and for predicting certain gene functions and functional similarities based on the gene expression maps obtained by voxelation. First, we identified the relationship between gene functions and gene expression maps. On one side, we chose typical genes as queries and aimed at discovering the groups of the genes which have similar gene expression maps to the queries. Then we study the relationship between functions and maps by checking the similarities of gene functions in the detected gene groups. The similarity between a pair of gene expression maps was identified by calculating the Euclidean Distance between the pair of feature vectors which were extracted by wavelet transformation from the hemispheres averaged gene expression maps. Similarities of gene functions were identified by Lin's method based on gene ontology structures. On the other side, we proposed a multiple clustering approach, combined with hierarchical clustering method to detect significant clusters of genes \u2026",

            "Abstract": "During the past decade, with the significant progress of computational power as well as ever-rising data availability, deep learning techniques became increasingly popular due to their excellent performance on computer vision problems. The size of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has increased more than 15-fold since 1999, which enabled the expansion of models that aim at predicting enzymatic function via their amino acid composition. Amino acid sequence, however, is less conserved in nature than protein structure and therefore considered a less reliable predictor of protein function. This paper presents EnzyNet, a novel 3D convolutional neural networks classifier that predicts the Enzyme Commission number of enzymes based only on their voxel-based spatial structure. The spatial distribution of biochemical properties was also examined as complementary information. The two-layer architecture was investigated on a large dataset of 63,558 enzymes from the PDB and achieved an accuracy of 78.4% by exploiting only the binary representation of the protein shape.

            "Abstract": "Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in ageing population that carries an increased risk for adverse health outcomes including falls, hospitalization, disability, and mortality. As these outcomes affect the health and social care planning, during the last years there is a tendency of investing in monitoring and preventing strategies. Although a number of electronic health record (EHR) systems have been developed, including personalized virtual patient models, there are limited ageing population oriented systems. We exploit the openEHR framework for the representation of frailty in ageing population in order to attain semantic interoperability, and we present the methodology for adoption or development of archetypes. We also propose a framework for a one-to-one mapping between openEHR archetypes and a column-family NoSQL database (HBase) aiming at the integration of existing and newly developed archetypes into it. The requirement analysis of our study resulted in the definition of 22 coherent and clinically meaningful parameters for the description of frailty in older adults. The implemented openEHR methodology led to the direct use of 22 archetypes, the modification and reuse of two archetypes, and the development of 28 new archetypes. Additionally, the mapping procedure led to two different HBase tables for the storage of the data. In this work, an openEHR-based virtual patient model has been designed and integrated into an HBase storage system, exploiting the advantages of the underlying technologies.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting spatial regions that are highly discriminative among different classes of three dimensional (3D) image data. The main idea of our approach is to treat the initial 3D image as a hyper-rectangle and search for discriminative regions by adaptively partitioning the space into progressively smaller hyper-rectangles (sub-regions). We use statistical information about each hyper-rectangle to guide the selectivity of the partitioning. A hyper-rectangle is partitioned only if its attribute cannot adequately discriminate among the distinct labeled classes, and it is sufficiently large for further splitting. To evaluate the discriminative power of the attributes corresponding to the detected regions, we performed \u2026",

Modern approaches in medical image segmentation tend to consider fuzziness as a characteristic and inherent feature of the depicted object, instead of an undesirable trait. In this paper, a novel technique for efficient image retrieval in the context of images in which segmented objects are either crisp or fuzzily bounded is presented. Moreover, the proposed method is applied in the case of multiple, even conflicting, segmentations from field experts. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested method in retrieving similar objects from the aforementioned categories while taking into account the fuzzy nature of the depicted data.",

We present current results about the correlation between topological and textural properties of clinical breast images. This correlation was assessed for 41 galactograms and 56 mammograms from 13 patients. Topology was characterized using feature extraction techniques arising from text-mining, validated previously in the classification of normal, benign, and malignant galactograms. In addition, we calculated 26 texture descriptors using an automated breast image analysis pipeline.

In the field of medical image analysis, automatic methods have been developed to discover features of ductal trees that are correlated with radiological findings regarding breast cancer. In this study, a data mining approach is proposed that captures a new set of geometrical properties of ductal trees. The extracted features are employed in an ensemble learning scheme in order to classify galactograms, medical images which visualize the tree structure of breast ducts. For classification, three variants of the AdaBoost algorithm are explored using as weak learner the CART decision tree.

Although the Euclidean distance and its variants have been most frequently used as similarity measures, they are relatively sensitive to noise and fail to provide meaningful information in many cases. Moreover, for time series with high dimensionality, the similarity calculation may be extremely inefficient. To solve this problem, we introduce a new method which gives a symbolic representation of the time series and can dramatically reduce its dimensionality. The method employs Vector Quantization to encode time series using symbols prior to performing similarity analysis. Due to the symbolic representation, we can apply string matching algorithms to calculate the similarities more efficiently and accurately. We propose a similarity measure that is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) model. The experimental results on real and simulated data demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed technique.",

For each dental CBCT volume, a set of features including fractal dimension, multi-fractal spectrum and gradient based features are extracted from eight regions-of-interest (ROI) to address the low image quality of trabecular patterns. Then, we use generalized multi-kernel learning (GMKL) to effectively fuse these features for distinguishing trabecular patterns from different groups. To validate the proposed method, we apply it to distinguish trabecular patterns from different gender-age groups.

We propose statistical as well as non-statistical methods for classifying three dimensional probability distributions of regions of interest (ROIs) in brain images. The statistical methods are based on computing the Mahalanobis distance and Kullback-Leibler distance between a new subject and historic data sets related to each considered class. The new subject is predicted to belong to the class corresponding to the dataset that has the smaller distance from the given subject. The non-statistical methods consist of a sequence of partitioning the brain image into hyper-rectangles followed by applying supervised neural network models. Experiments performed on synthetic data representing mixtures of nine distributions as well as on realistic brain lesion distributions from a study of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after closed head injury showed that all proposed methods are capable of providing accurate classification of the subjects with the Kullback-Leibler distance being the least sensitive on the size of the training set and on information about the new subject.

In this paper, a multi-step framework is presented to classify tree topologies introducing the idea of elastic matching of their sequence encodings. Initially, representative sequences of the branching topologies are obtained using node labeling and tree traversal schemes. The similarity between tree topologies is then quantified by applying elastic matching techniques. The resulting sequence alignment reveals corresponding node groups providing a better understanding of matching tree topologies. The new similarity approach is explored using various classification algorithms and is applied to a medical dataset outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by at least 6.6% and 3.5% in terms of absolute specificity and accuracy correspondingly.",

However, determination of the MGMT promoter methylation status requires tissue obtained via surgical resection or biopsy. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of quantitative and qualitative imaging variables in predicting MGMT methylation status noninvasively.A retrospective analysis of MR images from GBM patients was conducted. Multivariate prediction models were obtained by machine-learning methods and tested on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.The status of MGMT promoter methylation was predicted with an accuracy of up to 73.6%.

Although several scientific giants examine how to handle the enormous pile of information in their cupboards, the problem remains unsolved. On a daily basis, there is a massive quantity of permanent loss of extensive information due to infrastructure and storage space problems. The motivation for sequencing has fallen behind. Sometimes, the time that is spent to solve storage space problems is longer than the one dedicated to collect and analyse data. To bring sequencing to the foreground, scientists have to slide over such obstacles and find alternative ways to approach the issue of data volume.

            "Abstract": "Time series data are ubiquitous and their analysis necessitates the use of effective data mining methods to aid towards decision making. The mining problems that are studied in this paper are lag correlation discovery and classification. For the first problem, a new lag correlation algorithm for time series, the Highly Sparse Lag Correlation (HSLC) is proposed. This algorithm is a combination of Boolean Lag Correlation (BLC) and Hierarchical Boolean Representation (HBR) algorithms and aims to improve the time performance of Pearson Lag Correlation (PLC) algorithm. The classification algorithm that is employed for data streams is an incremental support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed schemes, the lag correlation discovery algorithm is experimentally tested on electroencephalography (EEG) data, whereas the classification algorithm that operates on streams is tested on real financial data. The HSLC algorithm achieves better time performance than previous state-of-the-art methods such as the PLC algorithm and the incremental SVM learning algorithm that we adopt, increases the accuracy achieved by non-incremental models.",

The Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever outbreak of 2014 is listed as the biggest one in history with almost 9000 reported human cases and a 53% rate of fatality. The Ebola virus is classified in the genus of Ebolovirus, in the family of Filoviridae and order Mononegavirales (Kuhn et al. 2010). Five viruses of this class are known to be disease-causing in humans; Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Reston ebolavirus (RESTV), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ebolavirus (TAFV) and Uganda ebolavirus (BDBV). In the case of the current outbreak, all listed cases have been infected by EBOV. The latter is the most lethal of all.

The proposed method is based on computing the Mahalanobis distance between a new sample and datasets related to each considered class (condition). We predict that the new sample belongs to the class corresponding to the dataset that has the smaller Mahalanobis distance from the given subject. We also compared this method to an alternative classification method based on computing the Kullback-Leibler probabilistic distance between distributions estimated through a non-parametric procedure. After the normalization of image data to a common coordinate system, the proposed method can be applied to both structural and functional brain imaging. Here, we applied it to lesion-deficit analysis and MR datasets, performing classification of realistic brain lesion distributions generated using a lesion-deficit simulator [l]. The spatial statistical model of lesion distributions conformed to the Frontal Lobe Injury in Childhood (FLIC) study [2]. The subjects were classified into two classes according to the subsequent development of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after closed head injury. Given a new subject with a set of lesioned voxels, the goal was to determine the more plausible class.",

Prime examples of such data are biosignals which are characterized by large volume, high volatility, and inherent multidimensionality. This paper reviews how biomedical engineering has recently taken advantage of HBase, with an emphasis over cloud, in order to reliably host cardiovascular and respiratory time series. Moreover, the deployment of offline biomedical analytics such as the Hilbert-Huang transform over HBase is explored.",

The proposed framework can be used by a network of healthcare centers, where some can be remotely located, assisting in diagnosis without the necessary transfer of patients. Security and confidentiality issues of medical data are expected, which are handled at the local site following the procedures and protocols of each institution. To make the search more effective, the authors introduce a distributed index based on features that are extracted from each image. Considering network bandwidth limitations and other restrictions that are associated with handling medical data, the images are processed locally and a pointer is distributed in the network. For the distribution of this pointer, the authors propose a function that maps the pointer of each image to a node with similar contents.",

Although such a representation is widely utilized and heavily entrenched both within neuroimaging and in the wider data mining community, the strong interactions among space, time, and categorical modes such as subject and experimental task inherent in functional imaging yield a dataset with \u201chigh-order\u201d structure, which matrix models are incapable of exploiting. Reasoning across all of these modes of data concurrently requires a high-order model capable of representing relationships between all modes of the data in tandem. We thus propose to model functional MRI data using tensors, which are high-order generalizations of matrices equivalent to multidimensional arrays or data cubes.

Starting with a single or a few seed points in each cluster, all the data points are dynamically assigned to the cluster that has the highest fuzzy connectedness value (strongest connection). With an efficient heuristic algorithm, the time complexity of the clustering process is O(NlogN), where N is the number of data points. The value of fuzzy connectedness is calculated using both the Euclidean distance and the statistical properties of clusters. This unsupervised learning method allows the discovery of clusters of any shape. Application of the method in intrusion detection demonstrates that it can \u2026",

The main idea of this technique is to extract a k-dimensional feature vector using concentric spheres in 3D (or circles in 2D) radiating out of the ROI's center of mass. These vectors form characterization signatures that can be used to represent the initial ROIs.

However, not much work has considered the connection between gene functions and location of a gene's expression in the mammalian tissues. On the other hand, although unsupervised learning methods have been commonly used in functional genomics, supervised learning cannot be directly applied to a set of normal genes without having a target (class) attribute. Here, we propose a supervised learning methodology to predict pair-wise gene functional similarity from multiplex gene expression maps that provide information about the location of gene expression. The features are extracted from expression maps and the labels denote the functional similarities of pairs of genes. We make use of wavelet features, original expression values, difference and average values of neighboring voxels and other features to perform boosting analysis. The experimental results show that with increasing similarities of gene expression maps, the functional similarities are increased too. The model predicts the functional similarities between genes to a certain degree. The weights of the features in the model indicate the features that are more significant for this prediction. By considering pairs of genes, we propose a supervised learning methodology to predict pair-wise gene functional similarity from multiplex gene expression maps. We also explore the relationship between similarities of gene maps and gene functions. By using AdaBoost coupled with our proposed weak classifier we \u2026",

Towards such a goal in this study we propose incorporating prior knowledge of biological functions of certain proteins into early stages of data analysis process. As the first aim of our study, a novel method aimed at functionally characterizing gene patterns over time is proposed. Our approach is based on analysis of functional expression profiles (FEP), each defined as the average of expression patterns for genes annotated with a given function. A FEP is computed only over significantly correlated patterns that also vary significantly in time. In our study an effective clustering method is proposed to automatically discover the most informative groups of FEPs. The new method is evaluated on several important time-course gene expression datasets (including development cycle of \u2026",

Curvilinear structure analysis is often challenging due to large variations in their appearances and profiles, as well as image noise. Also, low visibility and poor image quality due to a low dose of radiations in interventional imaging make the task more difficult, especially in breast mammographic images and dynamic X-ray images. Furthermore, for curvilinear structure tracking, these structures undergo complex deformable motion as a result of complex 3D anatomical movements projected onto the 2D image plane.

To address these challenges, we propose a solution by combining heterogeneous context-aware features with a discriminative learning framework. Our solution is characterized by three key ingredients: First, we design a hybrid feature pool containing recently invented descriptors including the stroke width transform (SWT) and Weber\u2019s local descriptors (WLD), as well as classical local features including intensity values, Gabor responses and vesselness measurements. Second, we encode context information by sampling the hybrid features from an orientation invariant local context. Third, we treat pixel-level vessel segmentation as a discriminative classification problem, and use a random forest to fuse the rich information \u2026",

First, we use the bag-of-words model for image representation, which captures the texture information by collecting local patch statistics. Then, we propose using normalized histogram intersection (HI) as a similarity measure with the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the fact that HI forms a Mercer kernel, we combine HI with support vector machines (SVM), which further improves the classification performance. The proposed methods are evaluated on a galactographic dataset and are compared with several previously used methods. In a thorough evaluation containing about 288 different experimental configurations, the proposed methods demonstrate promising results.",

Our approach employs the statistical techniques of Bootstrapping simulation, Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to select the most informative features according to their discriminative power across distinct classes of data. This reduces the dimensionality of the initial feature space and also improves the classification of the ROIs, since features providing irrelevant information with respect to class membership are discarded. We also introduce a weighted Euclidean Distance designed to effectively classify the ROIs. We evaluate the proposed technique using experiments that involve synthetic spatial regions and real ROIs extracted from medical images. We demonstrate its effectiveness in classification \u2026",

The seizure detection module was evaluated on three subjects with diagnosed idiopathic generalized epilepsy manifested with absences. The achieved seizure detection accuracy was approximately 90% for all evaluated subjects. Feature ranking investigation and evaluation of the seizure detection module using subsets of features showed that the feature vector composed of approximately the 65%-best ranked parameters provides a good trade-off between computational demands and accuracy. This configurable architecture allows the seizure detection module to operate as part of a healthcare system in offline mode as well as in online mode \u2026",

In this paper, we present an approach for identifying the relation between gene expression maps obtained by voxelation and gene functions. To analyze the dataset, we chose typical genes as queries and aimed at discovering similar gene groups.

To capture the large variation in vessel patterns not only across subjects, but also within a subject, we create a feature pool containing local, Gabor and Haar features extracted from mammographic images generating a feature space of very high dimension. We also employ a huge number of training samples, which essentially contains the pixels in the training images. To deal with the very high dimensional feature space and the huge number of training samples, we apply a forest with boosting trees for vessel segmentation. Specifically, we use the standard AdaBoost algorithm for each tree in the forest. The randomness is encoded, when training each AdaBoost tree, using randomly sampled training set (pixels) and randomly selected features from the whole feature pool.

Usually clinicians differentiate between generalized epileptic seizures and PNES based on clinical features and video-EEG. In this work, we investigate the use of machine learning techniques for automatic classification of generalized epileptic and non-epileptic events based only on multi-channel EEG data. For this purpose, we extract the signal patterns in the time domain and in the frequency domain and then combine all features across channels to characterize the spatio-temporal manifestation of seizures.

Similar to Discrete Wavelet Transform, MVQ keeps both local and global information about the data. However, instead of keeping low-level time series values, it maintains high-level feature information (key subsequences), facilitating the introduction of more meaningful similarity measures. The method is fast and scales linearly with the database size and dimensionality. Contrary to previous methods, the vast majority of which use the Euclidean distance, MVQ uses a multiresolution/hierarchical distance function. In our experiments, the proposed technique consistently outperforms the other major methods.",

The proposed algorithm adopts a combined, two-step pruning (filtering) strategy to further reduce data dimensionality by discarding irrelevant time series (ie, false alarms). At a first level, the time series are represented by line segments and filtered by the triangular inequality property. Then, a Vector Quantization like \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei brucei (TBB) belongs to the unicellular parasitic protozoa organisms, specifically to the Trypanosoma genus of the Trypanosomatidae class. A variety of different vertebrate species can be infected by TBB, including humans and animals. Under particular conditions, the TBB can be hosted by wild and domestic animals; therefore, an important reservoir of infection always remains available to transmit through tsetse flies. Although the TBB parasite is one of the leading causes of death in the most underdeveloped countries, to date there is neither vaccination available nor any drug against TBB infection. The subunit RPB1 of the TBB DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (DdRpII) constitutes an ideal target for the design of novel inhibitors, since it is instrumental role is vital for the parasite\u2019s survival, proliferation, and transmission. A major goal of the described study is to provide insights for novel anti-TBB agents via a state-of-the-art drug discovery approach of the TBB DdRpII RPB1. In an attempt to understand the function and action mechanisms of this parasite enzyme related to its molecular structure, an in-depth evolutionary study has been conducted in parallel to the in silico molecular designing of the 3D enzyme model, based on state-of-the-art comparative modelling and molecular dynamics techniques. Based on the evolutionary studies results nine new invariant, first-time reported, highly conserved regions have been identified within the DdRpII family enzymes. Consequently, those patches have been examined both at the sequence and structural level and have been evaluated in regard to their pharmacological targeting \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Fall detection is typically based on temporal and spectral analysis of multi-dimensional signals acquired from wearable sensors such as tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes which are attached at several parts of the human body. Our aim is to investigate the location where such wearable sensors should be placed in order to optimize the discrimination of falls from other Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). To this end, we perform feature extraction and classification based on data acquired from a single sensor unit placed on a specific body part each time. The investigated sensor locations include the head, chest, waist, wrist, thigh and ankle. Evaluation of several classification algorithms reveals the waist and the thigh as the optimal locations. ",

The first method uses measures of similarity, such as the Mahalanobis distance and the Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence, to compute the difference between spatial probability distributions of ROIs in an image of a new subject and each of the considered classes represented by historical data (e.g., normal versus disease class). A new subject is predicted to belong to the class corresponding to the most similar dataset. The second method employs the maximum likelihood (ML) principle to predict the class that most likely produced the dataset of the new subject.The proposed methods have been experimentally evaluated on three \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Known as the most common bone disease, osteoporosis is affecting millions of people every year. Clinical diagnostic methods for osteoporosis are expensive and therefore have limited availability in population. Recent studies have shown that Dental Panoramic Radiography (DPR) images can provide the bone density change clues in trabecular bone structure analysis. We collected 108 DPR images from 108 different subjects with 52 osteoporosis and 56 normal subjects, and aim to use the powerful deep neural network (DNN) on these DPR images for osteoporosis classification. However, DNN, such as AlexNet, requires millions of images for model learning. For many clinical related tasks, the available amount of data is far from adequate to train a DNN from scratch. One common solution is to use a pre-trained DNN and fine-tune it on the target dataset. Due to limited number of images and the big difference in image styles between ImageNet and our DPR dataset, direct fine-tuning of DNN can hardly achieve promising performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-task scheme to transfer the network pre-trained on ImageNet to our DPR dataset and improve the accuracy in osteoporosis pre-screening. Specifically, the AlexNet pre-trained on ImageNet is first fine-tuned on the task of (patient) identity classification using the abundant patches extracted from 108 DPR images. Features learned from such task are more dental-data friendly and are better for our main task, ie, osteoporosis pre-screening. For this purpose, the Octuplet Siamese Network (OSNet) is built on top of such features and trained on eight regions of interest (ROIs) in each DPR \u2026",

The proposed framework can be used by a network of healthcare centers, where some can be remotely located, assisting in diagnosis without the necessary transfer of patients. Security and confidentiality issues of medical data are expected, which are handled at the local site following the procedures and protocols of each institution. To make the search more effective, the authors introduce a distributed index based on features that are extracted from each image. Considering network bandwidth limitations and other restrictions that are associated with handling medical data, the images are processed locally and a pointer is distributed in the network. For the distribution of this pointer, the authors propose a function that maps the pointer of each image to a node with similar contents.",

In this paper, a multi-step framework is presented to classify tree topologies introducing the idea of elastic matching of their sequence encodings. Initially, representative sequences of the branching topologies are obtained using node labeling and tree traversal schemes. The similarity between tree topologies is then quantified by applying elastic matching techniques. The resulting sequence alignment reveals corresponding node groups providing a better understanding of matching tree topologies. The new similarity approach is explored using various classification algorithms and is applied to a medical dataset outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by at least 6.6% and 3.5% in terms of absolute specificity and accuracy correspondingly.",

This method can be utilized to assess the tissue patterns in CT lung images, and thus assisting the diagnosis of Pulmonary Emphysema. Lung images in the set are divided into 4 categories corresponding to different lung diseases. The regions of interest (ROIs) are specified by domain experts. First, dense SIFT features are extracted out for each image; Then, we encode the features using a k-means generated codebook and locality-constraint linear coding (LLC), which is introduced in place of vector quantization (VQ) coding for it preserves both locally and sparsity. Next, two feature representations: spatial pyramid matching (SPM) and feature context (FC) are utilized to convey statistical as well as spatial information of lung images. The coded features are congregated and form a final descriptor vector of the image, which is fed into classifiers. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to baseline classification methods using VQ and histogram similarity. A 89.2% classification accuracy is achieved on a set of 200 lung images. It indicates that our approach can potentially aid in diagnosing lung diseases.",

Detection of regions of interest (ROIs) in clinical breast images serves as the first step in development of an automated system for image analysis and breast cancer diagnosis. In this paper, we have investigated machine learning approaches for the task of identifying ROIs with visible breast ductal trees in a given galactographic image. Specifically, we have developed boosting based framework using the AdaBoost algorithm in combination with Haar wavelet features for the ROI detection. Twenty-eight clinical galactograms with expert annotated ROIs were used for training.

            "Abstract": "We developed a novel method based on the Fourier analysis of protein molecular surfaces to speed up the analysis of the vast structural data generated in the post-genomic era. This method computes the power spectrum of surfaces of the molecular electrostatic potential, whose three-dimensional coordinates have been either experimentally or theoretically determined. Thus we achieve a reduction of the initial three-dimensional information on the molecular surface to the one-dimensional information on pairs of points at a fixed scale apart. Consequently, the similarity search in our method is computationally less demanding and significantly faster than shape comparison methods. As proof of principle, we applied our method to a training set of viral proteins that are involved in major diseases such as Hepatitis C, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, Bovine viral diarrhea and West Nile fever. The training set contains proteins of four different protein families, as well as a mammalian representative enzyme. We found that the power spectrum successfully assigns a unique signature to each protein included in our training set, thus providing a direct probe of functional similarity among proteins. The results agree with established biological data from conventional structural biochemistry analyses.",

The GGE virus constitutes an important pathogen of livestock that infects the goat\u2019s central nervous system. The viral enzymes of GGE, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), are ideal targets for inhibitor design, since those enzymes are crucial for the virus\u2019 survival, proliferation and transmission. In an effort to understand the molecular structure underlying the functions of those viral enzymes, the three dimensional structures of GGE NS3 helicase and NS5 RdRP have been modelled. The models were constructed in silico using conventional homology modelling techniques and the known 3D crystal structures of solved proteins from closely related species as templates. The established structural models of the GGE NS3 helicase and NS5 RdRP have been evaluated for their viability using a repertoire of in silico tools. The goal of this study is to present the 3D conformations of the GGE viral enzymes as reliable structural models that could provide the platform for the design of novel anti-GGE agents.",

Can we estimate a robustness index for a graph quickly? Additionally, if the graph evolves over time, how this property changes? In this work, we are trying to answer the above questions studying the expansion properties of large social graphs. First, we present a measure that characterizes the robustness properties of a graph and also serves as global measure of the community structure (or lack thereof). We show how to compute this measure efficiently by exploiting the special spectral properties of real-world networks.

The experimental results show that the detected association rules make sense biologically.

Since both a query and a target sequence may be noisy, i.e., contain some outlier elements, it is desirable to exclude the outlier elements from matching in order to obtain a robust matching performance. Moreover, in many applications like shape alignment or stereo correspondence it is also desirable to have a one-to-one and onto correspondence (bijection) between the remaining elements. We propose an algorithm that determines the optimal subsequence bijection (OSB) of a query and target sequence. The OSB is efficiently computed since we map the problem's solution to a cheapest path in a DAG (directed acyclic graph). We obtained excellent results on standard benchmark time series datasets. We compared OSB to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with and without warping window. We do not claim that OSB is always superior to \u2026",

Using a DNA or RNA biotin labelled oligonucleotide and after the addition of a recombinant helicase, the nucleic acid unwinds, causing the emission of luminescence, which is quantified with a particular antibody. In our assay, one of the DNA oligos was biotinylated, while the other was labelled with digoxygenin (DIG), both in their 5\u2019termini. The biotin molecule immobilises the DNA duplex on a neutravidin-coated plate and the helicase activity is measured through the unwinding of DNA, due to ATP activation. The subsequent release of DIG-labelled oligos results in a luminescence signal measured with a chemiluminescence antibody. Our goal was to provide a high throughput screening method for potential helicase inhibitors. The method described in this paper has been demonstrated to be fast, easy and \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for automatic detection of breast tumors in US images. We formulate the tumor detection as a two step learning problem: tumor localization by bounding box and exact boundary delineation. Specifically, the proposed method uses an AdaBoost classifier on Harr-like features to detect a preliminary set of tumor regions. The preliminarily detected tumor regions are further screened with a support vector machine using quantized intensity features. Finally, the random walk segmentation algorithm is performed on the US image to retrieve the boundary of each detected tumor region \u2026",

The learned set of visual parts is optimized to yield an optimal performance for recognition of new objects. We divide the learning strategy into two main steps that follow our proposed, cognitively motivated principles of learning descriptive and distinctive parts of objects. We first extract the most dissimilar representative parts from all possible parts of all objects in the same class. We then select the most discriminative subset of this set with respect to the classification of shapes into classes. In order to computationally evaluate our approach, we developed a shape similarity measure that is able to compare parts of objects. The obtained measure yields intuitive results for significantly distorted or occluded parts even if parts are given at different scales.",

Data reduction or selection are necessary to mitigate these effects.

In decision-level fusion on the other hand, sensor-specific classification models are trained and subsequently integrated to reach a combined decision. Recent work has shown that decision-level fusion with a global (common for all sensors) classification model, is more appropriate for generalized events that show a (weak or strong) manifestation across all sensors.

Dimensionality reduction is performed to obtain a compact representation of each block's values. The block vectors provide a joint representation of texture and motion patterns. The motion detection and tracking experiments demonstrate that our method although simpler than a state-of-the-art method based on the Stauffer-Grimson Gaussian mixture model has superior performance. It reduces both the instability and the processing time making real-time processing of high resolution videos and efficient analysis of large scale video data feasible.",

Nevertheless, creating robust predictive models from data collected unobtrusively in home environments can be challenging, especially for vulnerable ageing population. Under that premise, we propose an activity recognition scheme for older people exploiting feature extraction and machine learning, along with heuristic computational solutions to address the challenges due to inconsistent measurements in non-standardized environments. In addition, we compare the customized pipeline with deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, applied to raw sensor data without any pre-or post-processing adjustments. The results demonstrate that the generalizable deep architectures can compensate for inconsistencies during data acquisition providing a valuable alternative. View Full-Text",

In a typical workstation setting scheduling is local and constitutes part of the operating system, whereas in distributed systems such as Hadoop there is an additional global scheduling layer at the cluster level.

To avoid the tree isomorphism problem we obtain the breadth-first canonical form of a tree. Our approach is based on employing tree encoding techniques, such as the depth-first string encoding and the Pr\u00fcfer encoding, to obtain a symbolic representation. Thus, the problem of classifying trees is reduced to string classification where node labels are the string terms. We employ the tf-idf text mining technique to assign a weight of significance to each string term (i.e., tree node label). We perform similarity searches and k-nearest neighbor classification of the trees using the tf-idf weight vectors and the cosine similarity \u2026",

In the context of spatial databases and in particular in 3-D medical image databases we present an evaluation framework in which we use probability distributions to model the spatial regions of interest (ROIs), and Bayesian networks to model the joint probability distribution among ROIs and observed deficits or medical conditions. By controlling these parameters, we evaluate as example, the Fisher exact test of independence, one of the methods currently available for detection of associations. We obtain measures of recovery of known associations as a function of the number of samples used, the strength and number of associations in the statistical model, the number of spatial ROIs associated with a particular deficit, the prior \u2026",

This framework implements a distributed dynamic recursive partitioning algorithm for medical image analysis that integrates medical image data repositories that contain multiple studies and are potentially located at spatially distributed clinical sites. The goal is to detect associations among regions of interest (ROIs) in images and clinical properties such as the progression of a disease. Statistical descriptors are computed from the ROIs in order to assist in medical decision making by facilitating automatic characterization, classification, and similarity searches of ROIs (e.g., lesions, tumors, and regions of morphological variability). The system consists of a central information fusion site that coordinates the analysis by communicating with remotely located processing sites \u2026",

In the present chapter, differences and similarities between the two most recent outbreaks have been studied, in order to pinpoint and design a trace model that will allow us to draw some conclusions for the connection of those two epidemics. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem, modern and state of the art geo-epidemiological methods have been used in an effort to provide the means necessary to establish the abovementioned model.

            "Abstract": "A suite of computer programs has been developed under the general name Thetis, for monitoring structural changes during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on proteins. Conformational analysis includes estimation of structural similarities during the simulation and analysis of the secondary structure with emphasis on helices. In contrast to available freeware dealing with MD snapshots, Thetis can be used on a series of consecutive MD structures, thus allowing a detailed conformational analysis over the time course of the simulation.",

Our method applies a variation of the Cyclic Generalized Lloyd Algorithm (CGLA) on every point of the training set and then uses a neural network for each quantizer to represent the training points and their associated codewords. The codeword of every training point is initialized using a previously proposed regression tree approach. Simulation results show that there is an improvement of the proposed approach over using regression trees only.",

Extra virgin olive oil is classified as a medical food, due to nutraceutical benefits and its protective properties against cancer, cardiovascular diseases, age-related diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and many other diseases. Extensive studies have reported the benefits of olive oil on human health. However, available data at the nucleotide sequence level are highly unstructured. Towards this aim, we describe an in-silico approach that combines methods from data mining and machine learning pipelines to ontology classification and semantic annotation.

Selection of patients is essential for effective treatment and in order to minimize perioperative complications. The hepatic surgeon has to achieve complete resection of the tumor(s) including devascularized liver segments and leave a sufficient future liver remnant volume (FLR). Computer assisted risk analysis can provide useful information regarding resectability, anatomical relations, risk areas and volumetric measurements. However, additional findings from the intraoperative ultrasound may modify the resection plan. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the intraoperative computer assisted risk analysis for oncologic liver surgery in clinical practice using a novel liver segmentation and surgery planning solution.

Most present techniques impose a matrix structure on the dataset, with rows representing observations and columns representing features. While this assumption is reasonable when features are scalar and do not exhibit co-dependence, the matrix data model becomes inappropriate when dependencies between non-target features must be modeled in parallel, or when features naturally take the form of higher-order multilinear structures. Such datasets particularly abound in functional medical imaging modalities, such as fMRI, where accurate integration of both spatial and temporal information is critical.

This descriptor can be used effectively for similarity searches, clustering, classification and other retrieval operations. We present an application of this approach to the analysis of x-ray galactograms; we analyze the texture in retroareolar regions of interests (ROIs) in order to distinguish between patients with reported galactographic findings and normal subjects. We decompose these ROIs into equi-size blocks and use VQ to represent each block with the closest codeword from a codebook. Each image is represented as a vector of frequencies of codeword appearance. We perform k-nearest neighbor classification of the texture patterns employing the \u2026",

In this paper, we review three methods for the description and classification of breast ductal topology.

The performance of these methods has been compared using clinical x-ray and MR images of breast ductal networks. We observed the accuracy of the classification between the ductal trees segmented from the x-ray galactograms with radiological findings and normal cases in the range of 0.86-0.91%. The accuracy of the classification of the ductal trees segmented from the MR autogalactograms was observed in the range of 0.5-0.89%.",

Although matrix representation which treats features as concatenated vectors allows capturing dependencies across channels, it leads to significant increase of feature vector dimensionality and lacks a means of modeling dependencies between features. Thus, the authors compare the commonly used matrix representation with a tensor-based scheme. TUCKER decomposition is applied to learn the essence of original, high-dimensional domain of feature space. In contrast to other relevant studies, the authors extend the non-epileptic class to both psychogenic non-epileptic seizure and vasovagal syncope. The classification schemes were evaluated on EEG epochs from 11 subjects. The proposed tensor scheme \u2026",

However, not much work in traditional gene expression profiling takes into account the location information of a gene's expressions in the brain. Gene expression maps, which contain spatial information regarding the expression of genes in mice's brain, are obtained by combining voxelation and microarrays. Based on the idea that genes with similar gene expression maps may have similar gene functions, we propose an approach to identify gene functions. A gene function can potentially be associated with a specific gene expression profile. We name this specific gene expression profile, Functional Expression Profile (FEP). A functional expression profile can be obtained either by directly finding genes with a certain function, or by analyzing clusters of genes that have similar expression maps and similar functions.

Using an automated segmentation technique based on fuzzy connectedness we accurately outline the tumor mass boundaries in the MR images so that further analysis concentrates on these regions of interest (ROIs). We then apply a concentric circle technique on the ROIs to extract features that are utilized by the classification algorithms. To remove redundant features, we perform feature selection where only those features with discriminatory information (among classes) are used in the model building process.
