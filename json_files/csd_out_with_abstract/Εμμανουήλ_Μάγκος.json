The existence of the phenomenon has been studied in many fields, such as for social networks and especially for a variety of forums and online communities. This paper questions its existence in the context of sensitive data, and more specific in the health data area via a survey which took place in Greece. Given that health-related information is perceived as sensitive personal data it is often excluded from discussions and sharing. This research aims to unravel the paradox\u2019s existence regarding the disclosure of health data information when individuals visit related online forums and communities.",

Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) introduce a number of security challenges to the research community, mainly concerning the tradeoff between the privacy of the drivers and the accountability of misbehaving vehicles. Another challenge is how to satisfy privacy in the presence of an adversary that has access to all communication (a global observer), and that can perform traffic analysis in order to link messages and identify vehicles. In this paper we attempt to address such issues and propose a set of cryptographic mechanisms that balance the tradeoff between privacy and accountability in a VANET. Furthermore, we examine techniques for location privacy against adversaries that perform a Bayesian traffic analysis, and \u2026",

However this notion extends to many other e-systems for which the privacy of users must be protected, even if the users wish to undermine their own privacy. In this paper we consider uncoercible e-bidding games. We discuss necessary requirements for uncoercibility, and present a general uncoercible e-bidding game that distributes the bidding procedure between the bidder and a tamper-resistant token in a verifiable way. We then show how this general game can be used to design provably uncoercible e-auctions and e-elections. Finally, we discuss the practical consequences of uncoercibility in other areas of e-commerce.",

Our protocol assumes no trust on a third party and/or other peers, and it is specifically suited for low-min entropy data (i.e., data that can be exhaustively searched by an attacker), such as encrypted users locations. We demonstrate that our primitive is secure and efficient: Two public-key exponentiations are required, per each user, for each equality testing. We give implementation results, showing that our primitive is practical in a multiple users scenario. Finally, we describe how we could use our primitive as a building block for a proximity testing buddy-finder service for social networks.",

Worm propagation models are mathematical models that attempt to capture the propagation dynamics of scanning worms as a means to understand their behaviour. It turns out that the emerged scalability in worm propagation plays an important role in order to describe the propagation in a realistic way. On the other hand human-based countermeasures also drastically affect the propagation in time and space. This work elaborates on a recent propagation model (Avlonitis et al. in J Comput Virol 3, 87\u201392, 2007) that makes use of Partial Differential Equations in order to treat correctly scalability and non-uniform behaviour (e.g., local preference worms).

This could also lead to higher quality data mining results, in a privacy preserving manner. Recent research has proved that it is possible to provide both privacy and accuracy assurances in a distributed computing scenario, where all participants may be mutually untrusted, without the presence of an unconditionally trusted third party. We believe that valuable knowledge can be borrowed from the vast body of literature on e-auction and e-voting systems, in order to be adapted to privacy preserving data mining systems in a distributed environment. These systems tend to balance well the efficiency and security criteria, because they need to be implementable in medium to large scale environments.",

The desired anonymity is not achieved and the entire system becomes vulnerable to attackers, since a malicious attacker can observe that during the time, many of the neighbors' ids change, except for a small number of users. Thus, we reinforce the privacy model by clustering the mobile users according to their motion patterns in (u, ) plane, where u and  define the velocity measure and the motion direction (angle) respectively. In this case, the anonymized (kNN) request looks up neighbors, who belong to the same cluster with the mobile requester in (u, ) space: Thus, we know that the trajectory of the k-anonymous mobile user is within this surface, but we do not know exactly where.

While these features are very attractive, the publication of users\u2019 location in an OSN exposes them to privacy hazards. Recently, various protocols have been proposed for private proximity testing, where users are able to check if their online friends are near, without disclosing their locations. However, the computation cost of the required cryptographic operations utilized in such protocols is not always efficient for mobile devices. In this paper we introduce a lightweight and secure proximity testing protocol, suitable for online mobile users. We show that our protocol is provably secure under the well-known factoring problem and we analyze its efficiency. Our results show that our approach outperforms other existing protocols, by \u2026",

Our approach is based on the classical homomorphic model for online elections, and more particularly on some extensions of the model for supporting multi-candidate elections. We also describe some weaknesses and present an attack on a recent scheme [1] which was the first to use a variation of the homomorphic model in the PPDM setting.

            "Abstract": "Course evaluations have become a common practice in most academic environments. To enhance participation, evaluations should be private and ensure a fair result. Related privacy-preserving method and technologies (eg, anonymous credentials, Privacy Attribute-Based Credentials, and domain signatures) fail to address, at least in an obvious way, the minimal security and practicality requirements. In this paper, we propose, evaluate, and implement an efficient, anonymous evaluation protocol for academic environments. The protocol borrows ideas from well-known and efficient cryptographic approaches for anonymously submitting ballots in Internet elections for issuing one-time credentials and for anonymously broadcasting information. The proposed protocol extends the above approaches in order to provably satisfy properties such as the eligibility, privacy, fairness and verifiability of the evaluation system. Compared to the state of the art, our approach is less complex and more effective, while security properties of the proposed protocol are verified using the ProVerif cryptographic protocol verifier. A web-based implementation of the protocol has been developed and compared to other approaches and systems. View Full-Text",

The protocol supports multiphase deployment i.e., the sensor nodes are deployed in the network in multiple groups, known as \"generations\". After their deployment, the nodes of the first generation are engaged in a key establishment protocol, in order to establish secure communication channels with their neighbors. Then, each forthcoming generation initializes a new key establishment phase, which allows the new nodes to communicate with other nodes of their own generation as well as with the older nodes of the network. The protocol extends the hybrid scheme of Kotzanikolaou et al. By making the scheme of \"P.

Paraphrases are learned in two phases: a set of shallow empirical rules are applied to every input sentence, leading to an initial pool of paraphrases. The pool is then filtered through supervised learning techniques. The syntactic transformations are shallow and require minimal linguistic resources, allowing the methodology to be easily portable to other inflectional languages. A secret key shared between two communicating parties helps them agree on one chosen paraphrase, the presence of which (or not) represents a binary bit of hidden information. The ability to simultaneously apply more than one rules, and each rule more than one times, to an input sentence increases the paraphrase pool size, ensuring thereby steganographic security.",

However, deploying the appropriate digital environment for conducting cybersecurity exercises can be challenging and typically requires a lot of effort and system resources by educators. In this paper, we present PocketCTF, an extensible and fully independent CTF platform, open to educators to run realistic virtual labs to host cybersecurity exercises in their classrooms. PocketCTF is based on containerization technologies to minimize the deployment effort and to utilize less system resources. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the feasibility of deploying CTF challenges that allows the trainees to engage not only in offensive security but also in defensive tasks that have to be conducted during cybersecurity incidents. When using PocketCTF, educators can deploy hands-on labs, spending less time on the deployment and without necessarily having the advanced technical background to deploy complex labs and scenarios.",

The corresponding gradient coefficient is a measure of the characteristic scale of interactions and as a result a novel scale approach for understanding the evolution of worm population in different scales, is considered. Results concerning random scan strategies and local preference scan worms are presented. A comparison of the proposed model with simulation results is also presented.

Towards this direction, this research aspires to discover how specific computer games, designed as simulations, could be converted into virtual learning environments and enhance the learning process, by increasing the levels of motivation and engagement of undergraduate students in the topics of cybersecurity. Computer games are appropriate for creating effective virtual learning environments specific to cybersecurity, providing positive learning outcomes. More specifically, in this study a commercial computer game is evaluated for the effectiveness of using GBL to the learning process. The result of this approach is a learning experience, featuring positive outcomes in terms of engagement and distinct impact in terms of perceived learning.

In this paper, we present two pairwise key establishment protocols for sensor nodes in unattended distributed sensor networks (DSNs).

            "Abstract": "During the past few years, in harmony with the fast growing rate of user population in Online Social Networks (OSNs), a trend for malware writers has been to take advantage of the social relationships of OSN users, in order to lure them into following malicious URLs that lead to malware infection. One reason for the success of such Social Engineering (SE)-based malware has been the low security awareness of OSN users. Indeed, it can be shown that, on the average, OSN users do not have sufficient knowledge of the malicious link threats they may come up against, and thus are easy victims of SE attacks. In this paper we conduct an empirical investigation which, on the one hand, demonstrates Facebook users' low awareness of malicious link threats, and on the other hand explores the views of OSN users on the desirable properties of a security application that protects them against social malware. Furthermore, we design and describe the architecture of a security application which intends to raise Facebook users' security awareness by informing them about (possibly) malicious posts on their walls before or after they get infected. Our application acts proactively by helping users to not get infected by malicious posts, and reactively by helping the users who got infected to gain an understanding of the threat and become more alerted towards identifying malware links.",

For this reason, several hybrid key establishment protocols have been developed, making limited use of public key cryptography and more particularly of Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

On the positive side, the user is obtaining advantages from GDPR. However, organisations are facing many difficulties in interpreting GDPR, and to properly applying it, and, in the meanwhile, due to their lack of compliance, many organisations are receiving huge fines from authorities. An important challenge is compliance with the Privacy by Design and by default (PbD) principles, which require that data protection is integrated into processing activities and business practices from the design stage. Recently, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) released an official document with PbD guidelines, and there are various efforts to provide approaches to support these. However, organizations are still facing difficulties in identifying a flow for executing, in a coherent, linear and effective way, these activities, and a complete toolkit for supporting this. In this paper, we propose the design of such flow, and our comprehensive supporting toolkit, as part of the DEFeND EU Project platform. Within DEFeND, we identified candidate tools, fulfilling specific GDPR aspects, and integrated them in a comprehensive toolkit: the DEFeND Data Scope Management service (DSM). The aim of DSM is to support organizations for continuous GDPR compliance through model-based Privacy by Design analysis. Here, we present DSM, its design, flow, and a preliminary case study and evaluation performed with pilots from the healthcare, banking, public administration and energy sectors.",

We provide a method for the theoretical estimation of the critical size of a network in respect to a worm with specific characteristics. Our motivation is the requirement in real systems to balance the needs for accuracy (i.e., monitoring a network of a sufficient size in order to reduce false alarms) and performance (i.e., monitoring a small\u2010scale network to reduce complexity).

            "Abstract": "With the advent of Internet Communications Technologies (ICT), the use of cryptographic protocols is a technical response to the loss of all traditional means that were used so far to establish security in democratic elections. We employ simple cryptographic techniques to address the \u201cabstaining voters\u201d problem in electronic elections with central administration. In such elections, voting authorities can cast a bogus vote on behalf of an authorized voter who decides to abstain. Our system is equitably fair: while a voter who registers for the election is allowed to abstain from voting (legal abstention), all registered voters who cast an encrypted vote must acknowledge, at some time later, the fact that they have voted. If not (illegal abstention), a cryptographic time capsule will be broken and their identity will be disclosed. Our system satisfies most requirements of a secure election and could be used in similar frameworks such as electronic polling and/or surveys over the Web.",

            "Abstract": "Privacy in statistical databases is a discipline whose purpose is to provide solutions to the conflict between the increasing social, political and economical demand of accurate information, and the legal and ethical obligation to protect the privacy of the individuals and enterprises to which statistical data refer. Beyond law and ethics, there are also practical reasons for statistical agencies and data collectors to invest in this topic: if individual and corporate respondents feel their privacy guaranteed, they are likely to provide more accurate responses. There are at least two traditions in statistical database privacy: one stems from official statistics, where the discipline is also known as statistical disclosure control (SDC), and the other originates from computer science and database technology. Both started in the 1970s, but the 1980s and the early 1990s saw little privacy activity on the computer science side. The Internet \u2026",
