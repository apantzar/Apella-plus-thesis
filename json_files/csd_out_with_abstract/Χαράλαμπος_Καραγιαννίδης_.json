            "Abstract": "Virtual user modeling research has attempted to address critical issues of human-computer interaction (HCI) such as usability and utility through a large number of analytic, usability-oriented approaches as cognitive models in order to provide users with experiences fitting to their specific needs. However, there is demand for more specific modules embodied in cognitive architecture that will detect abnormal cognitive decline across new synthetic task environments. Also, accessibility evaluation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) requires considerable effort for enhancing ICT products accessibility for older adults. The main aim of this study is to develop and test virtual user models (VUM) simulating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) through novel specific modules, embodied at cognitive models and defined by estimations of cognitive parameters. Well-established MCI detection tests assessed users\u2019 cognition, elaborated their ability to perform multitasks, and monitored the performance of infotainment related tasks to provide more accurate simulation results on existing conceptual frameworks and enhanced predictive validity in interfaces\u2019 design supported by increased tasks\u2019 complexity to capture a more detailed profile of users\u2019 capabilities and limitations. The final outcome is a more robust cognitive prediction model, accurately fitted to human data to be used for more reliable interfaces\u2019 evaluation through simulation on the basis of virtual models of MCI users.",

We argue that the commonly recognised models of adaptive systems can be used as a basis for a layered evaluation that offers certain benefits to the developers of ALS. Therefore, we propose the layered evaluation framework, where the success of adaptation is addressed at two distinct layers: user modelling and adaptation decision making. We outline how layered evaluation can improve the current evaluation practice of ALS. To build a stronger case for a layered evaluation, we re-visit the evaluation of the InterBook where the layered approach can provide a difference and provide an example of its use in KOD learning system.",

We investigated twenty (20) AEHS and analyze them comparatively to a variety of adaptivity determinants. Two are the pivotal points that are crucial in exploration of pedagogical approaches of these systems: the locus of control and the provided learning material. We conclude that these systems are based mostly on the learning paradigm of Cognitivism and Constructivism. In addition, we assume that the concept of learning theory is not such a narrow term, given that networked world imposes the concept of personal learning.",

Proposed reflexive methodologies still perpetuate many traditional hierarchies, and fail to consider the creative nature of the educational process as such. Much research work also takes place within the commercial sphere, and post-processual ideas cannot advance educational practice unless they can be implemented in some type of an e-learning system. In our Chapter we examine theoretical considerations of reflexivity, representation, subjectivity and experiential engagement to highlight their relevance to everyday educational practice, and their potential to undermine existing suboptimalities in the classroom.",

We present a preference-based decision-making framework for selecting among these LRs according to the profile of each individual learner, thus facilitating personalised access to LRs.

In this paper, focusing on resident location trajectory-based activity recognition through limited amount of low-cost cameras, we introduce a novel scheme for automatic ground truth data generation, via simulation of resident trajectories based on formal descriptions of activities. Additionally, we present an activity detection scheme capable of learning activity patterns from such synthetic ground truth data.

The application accommodates user\u2019s performance data towards the learning outcomes and provides feedback (to teachers or parents) about children\u2019s progress.

This paper proposes the introduction of novel enriched linguistic tests and examines the hypothesis that language can be a sensitive cognitive measure for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A group of MCI and healthy elderly were administered a set of proposed linguistic tests. Performance measures were made on both groups to indicate that concrete verbal production deficits such as impaired verb fluency can distinguish the MCI from normal aging. In addition, it was found that even in cases where the MCI subjects preserved scores, language tests took significantly more time compared to healthy controls. These findings indicate that language could be a sensitive cognitive marker in preclinical stages of MCI.",

Teachers\u2019 knowledge about the nature and characteristics of students with dyscalculia seems to be limited and this has a strong impact on their instructional decisions. In secondary education, where teachers\u2019 preservice educational programs are more focused on the scientific subject instead of appropriate instructional methods, teachers\u2019 knowledge about dyscalculia has not yet been taken into account. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which mathematics teachers know what dyscalculia is, and what its features are. Possible differences that may occur between teachers with and without special education training were also examined, as well as differences that may occur as a result of their working experience. One hundred and fourteen secondary mathematics teachers, with an average service time of twelve years, completed an electronic questionnaire in which they had to respond to 19 questions about the definition, the content and the major characteristics of dyscalculia. Although they seemed to understand the innate profile of dyscalculia, 31% of them attributed dyscalculia to learning gaps resulted by student absence from school while 67% of the teachers felt that mistakes of students with dyscalculia in solving algorithms may be reduced if more time is provided to the students. Furthermore, confusion prevailed regarding skills of students with dyscalculia to solve word problems. The findings in this study contribute to the ongoing discussion \u2026",

            "Abstract": "valuation of recommender systems has only lately started to become more systematic, since the emphasis has long been on the experimental evaluation of algorithmic performance. Recent studies have proposed adopting a layered evaluation approach, according to which recommender systems may be decomposed into several components, evaluating each of them separately. Nevertheless, there are still no evaluation studies of recommender systems that apply a layered evaluation framework to explore how all the different components or layers of such a system may be assessed. This paper introduces layered evaluation and examines how a previously proposed layered evaluation framework for adaptive systems can be applied in the case of recommender systems. It presents the possible adaptation of this out a retrospective analysis of its past evaluation results under the new prism that the layered evaluation \u2026",

Later on, computerized cognitive skills training and screening services are offered to sense those conditions and to numerically express the changes in cognition over time. This paper describes a web-platform designed to offer skills-training interventions to people at risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The content development was based mainly on verbal fluency and other combinatorial mental abilities judgment. One hundred fifteen (115) people, aged 55 to 78 years old (M= 65.57, SD= 5.89) were recruited in a proof-of-concept study (92 MCI/22 healthy controls).

The current paper investigates power changes in EEG channels on elderly people having Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) during a linguistic test. The main objective was to identify patterns in EEG power changes during a linguistically enriched cognitive assessment test which involved working memory abilities, selective attention and perception. Groups of MCI, demented and healthy controls were recruited to take part in an experiment. It was found that MCI and demented patients showed significantly different patterns in delta and theta frequency bands during the linguistic tasks. Results are valuable in the study of the way brain processes linguistic information in people with cognitive impairment and in screening assessment procedures.",

The agent is aiming to provide cognitive support to users with learning difficulties and attention disorders and is designed to accommodate self regulated learning elements. We review the basic principles of self regulated learning which, in turn, act as a basis for designing and implementing our system. Kolb\u2019s learning cycle is used to provide a framework upon which agents\u2019 pedagogical behaviour is constructed. A study between 24 students from higher education with learning difficulties and attention disorders is presented \u2026",

This chapter presents a study of a pedagogical agent that imitates human behaviour for enhancing e-learning applications through emotional intelligence. The results of the study reveal that agent can improve the quality of education, and in particular the agent can successfully diagnose the emotional state of the students and help them to complete their learning tasks; students enjoy using the agent, they have a sense of communicating with the agent, and they have positive emotions through this communication.",

To this end, we describe a framework which can enable the effective collaboration between the special education experts and the teachers. The framework builds on the notion of Living Labs, and facilitates the active involvement of different teams of experts in various stages of the educational process, and their collaborative decision making and planning for each individual student.",

            "Abstract": "The effects of technology acceptance and innovation diffusion behaviors on information and communications technology-enabled teaching/learning systems (ITLS) adoption attract increasing attention among primary school teachers (Wu and Liu 2015). In particular, Internet-based e-learning has been considered one of the important ICT tools for knowledge providers and receivers to create an exchange process in cyberspace for knowledge development. The system adoption is generally a multidimensional issue that needs to consider such issues as providers\u2019 teaching behaviors (eg, teaching cognition and ICT use preference), characteristics of ITLS (eg, material presentation, diversity, and adaptability), and receiver\u2019s learning behavior (eg, learning cognition and ICT adoption propensity)(Bertacchini et al. 2012). In particular, the provider\u2019s teaching behavior based on his or her cognitive system is one of the \u2026",
