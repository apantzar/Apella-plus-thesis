            "Abstract": "Switching in surface stabilised ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) cells takes place through the formation and evolution of domains, which can grow up to many tens of microns in size. Domain growth can be described by the Avrami model, but this relies on a statistical distribution of the number of nucleated domains, and hence a large number of domains are required for this model to succeed. We discuss the limitations of this model, for example in a microdisplay pixel, which is between 10 20 microns in size, and therefore only a few domains exist within each pixel. We also investigated the effects of light scattering during partial switching. Light scattering through domains is modelled using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, and shows good agreement with experimental results.",

The optical response of the device due to the applied voltage, was obtained experimentally. The helical deformation was also theoretically modeled using the continuum approach. In this paper, two different theoretical models will be presented. The first model is a one dimensional model which calculates the director variation along the helical axis. The second model is a two dimensional model which calculates the director variation through the thickness of the device, and along the helical axis.

Interest is focused on reflective devices. A complete understanding of light diffraction in two-dimensional reflective devices is made possible using the proposed numerical methods, contrary to matrix methods for optics (which are not suitable for such a task).

Choosing a liquid crystal with low viscosity to increase the temporal rate of the cell response usually leads to an increase of the control voltage.

Besides their limited capacity, electrical wiring technologies impose great energy and size limitations originating from the requirements to handle the vast amount of information that needs to be exchanged across all hierarchical communication levels within Data Centers and HPCs, ie rack-to-rack, backplane, chip-to-chip and on-chip interconnections. This reality has inevitably led to a clearly shaped roadmap for bringing optics into the spotlight and replacing electrical with optical interconnects, thereby overtaking the bottleneck in traffic exchange imposed by electrical wires [1]. Hence, the optical technology should penetrate into intra-rack and board-to-board transmission links, considering that the optical fiber as a large-bandwidth transmission medium [2] is used only in commercial systems for rack-torack communication [3].",

A two stage switching process is observed, in which the helix unwinds to an intermediate state in the pretransitional regime, at voltages below the threshold for antiferroelectric to ferroelectric switching. A series of experimental studies and theoretical modelling show that the intermediate state is an antiferroelectric state in which the directors lie in the plane containing the applied electric field and the smectic layer normal. The mechanism for the unwinding process is the interaction of the applied field with an induced polarisation, which arises from a distortion to the antiferroelectric ordering.",

            "Abstract": "Imaging systems are typically partitioned into three components: focusing of incident light, scattering of incident light by an object and imaging of scattered light. We present a model of high Numerical Aperture (NA) imaging systems which differs from prior models as it treats each of the three components of the imaging system rigorously. It is well known that when high NA lenses are used the imaging system must be treated with vectorial analysis. This in turn requires that the scattering of light by the object be calculated rigorously according to Maxwell\u2019s equations. Maxwell\u2019s equations are solvable analytically for only a small class of scattering objects necessitating the use of rigorous numerical methods for the general case. Finally, rigorous vectorial diffraction theory and focusing theory are combined to calculate the image of the scattered light. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model through examples.",

The mathematical formulation is based on a system of coupled differential equations involving an electric and a magnetic field component. The contribution of all dielectric tensor elements is included. A numerical implementation based on finite differences is used. Numerical examples are focused on light-wave propagation within twisted nematic pixels found in microdisplays, with all effects arising at pixel edges that are incorporated. A comparison between the results obtained and the prediction of finite-difference time-domain simulations is conducted, showing satisfactory agreement.

The proposed devices consist of a metal-insulator-metal resonant cavity formed between a subwavelength metal stripe grating and a back metal reflector. The dielectric spacing between the metallic parts is occupied by a deeply subwavelength layer of n-doped GaAs. By reverse biasing the Schottky junction formed at the interface between GaAs and the top metal grating, the thickness of the associated carrier depletion zone is controlled and, hence, the GaAs complex permittivity profile in the resonant cavities. Optimized structures are derived based on the mechanism of critical coupling, achieving amplitude modulation of the reflected terahertz wave with low insertion losses and theoretically infinite extinction ratio.",

An electro-optic switching mechanism, based on dual-frequency nematic materials, and its temporal dynamics are further discussed.

            "Abstract": "We present a thorough numerical investigation of end-fire coupling between dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton (DLSPP) and compact rib/wire silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides. Simulations are based on the three-dimensional vector finite element method. The interface geometrical parameters leading to optimum performance, i.e., maximum coupling efficiency or, equivalently, minimum insertion loss (IL), are identified. We show that coupling efficiencies as high as 85 % are possible. In addition, we quantify the fabrication tolerances about the optimum parameter values. In the same context, we assess the effect of a metallic stripe gap and that of a horizontal offset between waveguides on insertion loss. Finally, we demonstrate that by benefiting form the low-loss coupling between the two waveguides, hybrid silicon-plasmonic 2 x 2 thermo-optic switching elements can outperform their all-plasmonic \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We investigate transmission protocols for relay-assisted free-space optical (FSO) systems, when multiple parallel relays are employed and there is no direct link between the source and the destination. As alternatives to all-active FSO relaying, where all the available relays transmit concurrently, we propose schemes that select only a single relay to participate in the communication between the source and the destination in each transmission slot. The selection is based on the channel state information obtained either from all or from the last used FSO links. Thus, the need for synchronization of the relays\u2019 transmissions is avoided, while the slowly varying nature of the atmospheric channel is exploited. For the considered relay selection and all-active relaying schemes, novel closed-form expressions for the outage performance are derived, assuming the versatile Gamma\u2013Gamma channel model.

            "Abstract": "Broadband cholesteric reflectors are well-known for their ability to reflect circular polarized light over the entire visible spectrum. Among other techniques, such reflectors can be fabricated via thermal annealing of individual cholesteric films, which leads to the development of a pitch gradient due to a thermal diffusion process [1, 2]. The reflection properties of cholesteric reflectors with thermally induced pitch gradients are both theoretically investigated via the finite-difference time-domain method, and experimentally verified [3]. The optical behaviour of such films can be attributed to the averaged contribution of many stochastic pitch variation samples due to the longitudinal and transversal inhomogeneities present in the samples (Fig. 1). The reflection properties of the sample can be tuned depending on the annealing time, leading to both narrow-band and broadband behaviour. A theoretical approach on the influence of the pitch transition form on the broadband reflection performance of cholesteric samples is presented, and, finally, a multi-slab structure is proposed for optimum efficiency.",

The developed framework is flexible, allowing the systematic incorporation of other nonlinear effects such as the Kerr effect, two photon absorption, and saturable absorption [2], unfolding the complex dynamic behavior of the system, that can also demonstrate optical bistability and limit cycles [1, 3].",

            "Abstract": "A 1D photonic crystal slab based on preferential etching of commercially available silicon-on-insulator wafers is presented. Compared to dry etching, anisotropic wet etching is more tolerant to errors as it is self-stopping on crystallographic {111} planes and it produces a more precise geometry with symmetries and homothetic properties, with surface roughness close to 1 nm. The resulting grooves are infiltrated by low viscosity liquid crystal having large positive optical anisotropy. The use of slanted grooves provides advantages: first of all the complete filling of slanted grooves is simplified when compared to vertical walls structures. Furthermore alignment is significantly facilitated. Indeed the liquid crystal molecules tend to align with their long axis along the submicron grooves. Therefore by forcing reorientation out of a rest position, the liquid crystal presents a choice of refractive indices to the propagating optical field \u2026",

For calculating the nonlinear response, we employ a recently developed perturbation theory/coupled-mode theory framework which is both efficient and accurate.

The uniplanar EBG is particularly assessed, due to its fabrication simplicity and is found to exhibit a propagation mode that cancels the desired bandgap behaviour. Two new planar EBG structures, without such modes are presented, retaining the distinct feature of easy fabrication, since the metallic structures are exclusively on the interface layers, with no vertical connections. The EBGs are optimized to maximize the bandgap, making them suitable for the design of wideband microwave circuits and antennas.",

The mixed-order concept used here implies arbitrary orders of variation towards different directions and it differs essentially from the well-known mixed-order approximation that is an integral part of every Whitney element. The reduction of degrees of freedom, achieved by the employment of such elements, facilitates the solution of the resulting eigenvalue equation. Thus, an efficient 3-D finite-element analysis tool is developed to calculate the band structure of both symmetric and asymmetric photonic crystal slabs. Dispersion relation results for two different types of photonic crystal waveguides are also presented, to further verify the method.",

The spacer between a subwavelength metallic stripe grating and a back metal reflector is occupied by a bilayer of indium tin oxide (ITO) and hafnium oxide (). The application of a bias voltage across the bilayer induces free-carrier accumulation at the /ITO interface that locally modulates the ITO permittivity and drastically modifies the optical response of the absorber owing to the induced epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effect. The carrier distribution and dynamics are solved via the drift\u2013diffusion model, which is coupled with optical wave propagation studies in a common finite-element method platform. Optimized structures are derived that enable the amplitude modulation of the reflected wave with moderate insertion losses, theoretically \u2026",

Such a component features very poor drop port extinction ratio (ER). We therefore extend the analysis to add-drop filters with perpendicular access waveguides, which are found to exhibit superior drop port ERs, due to interference effects associated with the drop port transmission. In the process, the performance of a DLSPP waveguide crossing is also assessed, since it is a building block of those filters whose bus waveguides intersect.

The nanosecond (ns) TO response of the switch is due to the high thermal conductivities of the employed materials and we demonstrate specifically a 10 dB extinction ratio in the time-dependent switch transmission which features a pulsed 1 ns rise time followed by a 25 ns fall time when the switch is photo-thermally activated by a ns pulse at 532 nm wavelength.",

Their performance characteristics are highlighted for different microdisk radii, and compared with those of the respective, footprint-wise, microring filters. We show that microdisk filters are advantageous, as the resonator involved exhibits smaller radiation losses. Extinction ratios as high as 30 dB are possible by properly tuning the gap separating the waveguide from the microdisk in each case. Transmission dips due to higher-radial-order modes that drastically change the transmission picture appear only for very large microdisk radii.",

Advancing the existing studies on conventional amplitude modulation, phase-shift keying formats are investigated in this paper, using a rigorous and physically consistent modeling framework that seamlessly combines solid-state physics with Maxwell wave theory through carrier-dependent material models.
