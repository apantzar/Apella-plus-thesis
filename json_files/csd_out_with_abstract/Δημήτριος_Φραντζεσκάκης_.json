            "Abstract": "We present a unified description of different types of matter-wave solitons that can emerge in quasi one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). This description relies on the reduction of the original two-component Gross-Pitaevskii SOC-BEC model to a single nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, via a multiscale expansion method. This way, we find approximate bright and dark soliton solutions, for attractive and repulsive interatomic interactions respectively, for different regimes of the SOC interactions. Beyond this, our approach also reveals \"negative mass\" regimes, where corresponding \"negative mass\" bright or dark solitons can exist for repulsive or attractive interactions, respectively. Such a unique opportunity stems from the structure of the excitation spectrum of the SOC-BEC. Numerical results are found to be in excellent agreement with our analytical predictions.",

We first identify the spectrum of the underlying two-dimensional linear problem through multiple-scale techniques. Then, we use the results obtained in the linear limit as a starting point for the existence and stability analysis of the lowest energy states, emanating from the linear ones, in the nonlinear problem. Two-parameter continuations of these states are performed for increasing nonlinearity and optical lattice strengths, and their instabilities and temporal evolution are investigated. It is found that the ground state as well as some of the excited states may be stable or weakly unstable for both attractive and repulsive interatomic interactions. Higher excited states are typically found to be increasingly more unstable.",

Numerical results show that the ring dark soliton can be stabilized in a suitable interval of external potential strengths and chemical potentials. We also explore different proposed particle pictures considering the ring as a moving particle and find, where appropriate, results in very good qualitative and also reasonable quantitative agreement with the numerical findings.",

Propagation in the homogenized composite medium obeys the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation, and therefore the medium can support the propagation of chirped solitons that are either Pereira\u2013Stenflo (PS) bright solitons or Nozaki\u2013Bekki (NB) dark solitons, when linear loss is counterbalanced by nonlinear gain. Soliton propagation depends on the volume fraction of the component phases as well as on the correlation length of the spatial fluctuation of the dielectric properties in the composite medium.",

In the former case, we identify the dynamics as being chiefly quasi-periodic (although potentially periodic), while in the latter, irregular dynamics may ensue when suitable external drive of the BEC cloud is also considered. Our analytical findings are corroborated by numerical computations of the reduced ODE system.",

A local breather which gives rise to the nonlinear defect affecting the propagation of a narrow optical pulse is possible in a molecular chain. In the case when the host waveguide is linear, the pulse has a Gaussian shape. In that case, an immediate result of its interaction with the nonlinear defect can be found in an exact analytical form, amounting to a transformation of the incoming Gaussian into an infinite array of overlapping Gaussian pulses.

Using a combination of analytical techniques, based on differential and algebraic inequalities and selected numerical illustrations, we first derive conditions for collapse of an initially excited single-site unit, for both the Hamiltonian and the linearly damped versions of the system and showcase different potential fates of the single-site excitation, such as the possibility to be \u201cpulled back\u201d from outside the well or to \u201cdrive over\u201d the barrier some of its neighbors. Next, we study the evolution of a uniform (small) segment of the chain and, in turn, consider the conditions that support its escape and collapse of the chain. Finally, our path from one to the few and finally to the many excited sites is completed by a modulational stability analysis and the exploration of its connection to the escape process for plane \u2026",

We utilize two parameters: the first one breaks  -symmetry but retains a proportionality between the imaginary and the derivative of the real part of the potential; the second one, detunes from this latter proportionality. It is shown that the departure of the potential from the  -symmetric form does not allow for the numerical identification of exact stationary solutions.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate localized discrete states with a non-zero topological charge (discrete vortices) in a prototypical model of dynamical lattice systems, based on the two-and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (DNLS) equation, with both attractive and repulsive on-site cubic nonlinearity. Systems of two nonlinearly coupled DNLS equations are considered too. We report new results concerning the existence and, especially, stability of the vortices with higher values of the topological charge \u00cb (\u00cb \u00be\u00bf). Quasi-vortices, ie, stable solutions of the quadrupole and octupole type, which replace unstable vortices with \u00cb \u00be and, respectively, are also found. The vortices of the gap-soliton type, which are found in the defocusing (repulsive) model, are quite different, as concerns the stability, from their counterparts in the focusing (attractive) models. In the two-component system, stable compound vortices of the type \u00cb\u00bd \u00cb\u00be\u00b5 \u00bd\u00a6 \u00bd\u00b5 are found, the stability area being larger for the\u00b7 \u00cb \u00cb\u00b5 species. In the 3D case, besides finding stable vortices with \u00cb \u00bd and\u00bf, a novel possibility is reported, viz., a stable two-component complex with mutually orthogonal vortices in the components. Applications of the results to nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensates are briefly discussed.",

This system describes, for instance, beam propagation in nematic liquid crystals and optical thermal media. It is found, both numerically and analytically, that the nonlocal response has a focusing effect on the beam, concentrating its power around its center during propagation. In particular, the beam narrows in width and grows in amplitude faster than in local media, with the resulting beam shape being parabolic. Finally, a general initial localized beam evolves to a common shape.",

Nevertheless, there are also some nontrivial differences including, e.g., the unstable nature of both the parent and the daughter branch emerging in the relevant pitchfork bifurcation for slightly larger values of atom numbers. Another interesting feature that does not appear in the atomic condensate case is that the bifurcation for attractive interactions is slightly sub-critical instead of supercritical.

One of the most known nonlinear evolution equation is the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (NLS), a universal equation appearing in optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, water waves, plasmas, and many other disciplines. In optics, the NLS system is used to model a unique balance between the critical effects that govern propagation in dispersive nonlinear media, namely dispersion/diffraction and nonlinearity. This balance leads to the formation of solitons, namely robust localized waveforms that maintain their shape even when they interact. However, for several physically relevant contexts the standard NLS equation turns out to be an oversimplified description. This occurs in the case of nonlocal media, such as nematic \u2026",

In superfluids and superconductors, quantized vortices are topological excited collective states that play central roles in transport and dissipative properties. The realization of dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates [3, 4] has supplied a particularly pristine setting for the examination of static and dynamic vortex configurations, from solitary vortex lines to large vortex lattices [5, 6]. Our primary focus in this Letter is on the behavior of the vortex dipole\u2014a selfassembled, countercirculating pair of quantized vortices\u2014which lies at the heart of phenomena associated with quantum turbulence [7] and two-dimensional degenerate Bose gases [8]. Only recently have vortex dipoles been realized experimentally in dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates [9, 10], and no unifying theoretical \u2026",

We use a multiscale expansion method to identify solution families for chemical potentials in the semi-infinite gap of the linear energy spectrum. Depending on the linear and spin-orbit coupling strengths, the solitons may present either a sech 2-shaped or a modulated density profile reminiscent of the stripe phase of spin-orbit coupled repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with our analytical findings and demonstrate the potential robustness of solitons for experimentally relevant conditions.",

The cross pattern remains stable up to the zero value of the immiscibility parameter , while simpler rectilinear (quasi-1D) DWs exist only for values of  essentially exceeding those in BEC mixtures (two spin states of the same isotope) currently available to the experiment. Both symmetric and asymmetric cross configurations are investigated, with equal or different numbers  of atoms in the two species. In rotating traps, ``propellers'' (stable revolving crosses) are found too. A full stability region for of the crosses and propellers in the system's parameter space is identified, unstable crosses evolving into arrays of vortex-antivortex pairs. Stable rotating rectilinear DWs are found too, at larger vlues of . All the patterns produced by the intersection of three or more DWs are unstable, rearranging themselves into ones with two DWs. Optical propellers are also predicted in a twisted nonlinear photonic-crystal fiber carrying two different wavelengths or circular polarizations, which can be used for applications to switching and routing.",

Furthermore, we study the reflectivity of a soliton incident from the attractive region to the repulsive one. We find the reflection coefficient numerically and employ analytical methods, which treat the soliton as a particle (for moderate and large amplitudes) or a quasilinear wave packet (for small amplitudes), to determine the critical soliton momentum (as a function of the soliton amplitude) for which total reflection is observed.",

In a way fundamentally opposite to the case of bright solitons (but consonant to their \u201canti-particle character\u201d), we find that dark solitons accelerate as they pass the first barrier and hence cannot be trapped by a second equal-height barrier. A pair of unequal barriers may lead to reflection from the second one, however trapping in the inter-barrier region cannot occur. We also give some examples of dynamical adjusting of the barriers to trap the dark soliton in the inter-barrier region, yet we show that this can only occur over finite time horizons, with the dark soliton always escaping eventually, contrary again to what is potentially the case \u2026",

While matter-wave solitons in one-and two-component systems have been the focus of intense research efforts, an extension to three components has never been attempted in experiments. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the existence of robust dark-bright-bright (DBB) and dark-dark-bright solitons in a multicomponent F= 1 condensate. We observe lifetimes on the order of hundreds of milliseconds for these structures. Our theoretical analysis, based on a multiscale expansion method, shows that small-amplitude solitons of these types obey universal long-short wave resonant interaction models, namely, Yajima-Oikawa systems. Our experimental and analytical findings are corroborated by direct numerical simulations highlighting the persistence of, eg, the DBB soliton states, as well \u2026",

We highlight a number of additional possibilities that emerge in the higher dimensional settings and elucidate their corresponding phenomenology.

The results based on this Galerkin-type decomposition are in good agreement with the analysis of the full system.

In particular, first the linearization equation around the solitons is solved by expanding its solution into a set of complete eigenfunctions of the linearization operator. Then, suppression of secular growth in the linearized solution leads to the evolution equations of soliton parameters. The results are applied to a number of case examples motivated by the physics of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, where dark-bright solitons have recently been studied both in theory and in experiments. We thus consider perturbations corresponding to (a) finite temperature-induced thermal losses, and (b) the presence of localized (\u03b4-function) impurities.

By applying the perturbation method to the latter, we derive the analytical expressions for the first-and second-harmonics, which are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations of the nonlinear dynamical lattice model. Apart from the case of dispersionless nonlinear propagation and the Fubini solution, special attention is payed to the role of dispersion. In that regard, it is found that, once dispersion comes into play, second-harmonic beatings in space due to phase-mismatch can be identified.

To some extent, this work revealed that the extreme multistability phenomenon of coexisting infinitely many attractors' behavior depends not only on memristor initial condition-dependent dynamics, as it has been reported in literature, but also on the rest of circuit's initial condition-dependent dynamics. The circuit's behavior is studied by using well-known tools of nonlinear theory, such as a bifurcation-like diagram, Lyapunov exponents and phase portraits.",

However, their exploration at a particle level in open quantum systems has gained considerable attention only recently. Here we study vortex pair interactions in a resonant polariton fluid created in a solid-state microcavity. By tracking the vortices on picosecond time scales, we reveal the role of nonlinearity, as well as of density and phase gradients, in driving their rotational dynamics. Such effects are also responsible for the split of composite spin\u2013vortex molecules into elementary half-vortices, when seeding opposite vorticity between the two spinorial components. Remarkably, we also observe that vortices placed in close proximity experience a pull\u2013push scenario leading to unusual scattering-like events that can be described by a tunable effective potential.

Our findings indicate that for both models onsite solutions are stable for sufficiently small values of the coupling between adjacent nodes, while intersite solutions are always unstable.

Our model, namely, a dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, is treated analytically by means of dark-soliton perturbation theory and the Landau dynamics approach, which result in a Newtonian equation of motion for the dark-soliton center. This reduced model, which incorporates an effective washboard potential and an antidamping term accounting for finite-temperature effects, constitutes an example of an antidamped Josephson junction. We perform a qualitative (local and global) analysis of the equation of motion. We present results of systematic numerical simulations for both zero-and finite-temperature BECs to highlight the differences between the Hamiltonian and dissipative settings.

We then explore possibilities to use a time-modulated OL as a means of stopping and trapping a moving soliton, and of transferring an initially stationary soliton to a prescribed position by a moving OL. We also study the emission of radiation from the soliton moving across the combined magnetic trap and OL. We find that the soliton moves freely (without radiation) across a weak lattice, but suffers strong loss in deeper OLs.",

We focus here, more specifically, on bright discrete breathers which bifurcate from the lower edge of the linear dispersion relation at wavenumber . Guided by the multiscale analysis, we calculate numerically both the stable inter-site centered and the unstable site-centered members of the relevant family.

The modulational-instability analysis of the quasiuniform condensate driven by this scheme leads to an analog of the Kronig-Penney model. The ensuing stable localized structures are found. These include breathers, which oscillate between the Thomas-Fermi and Gaussian configuration, or may be similar to the 2-soliton state of the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and a nearly static state (\u201codd soliton\u201d) with a nested dark soliton.

Each additional bifurcation adds an extra mode to the dark soliton instability and an extra vortex to the configuration; moreover, the bifurcating states inherit the stability properties of the soliton prior to the bifurcation. The critical points of this bifurcation are computed analytically via a few-mode truncation of the system, which clearly showcases the symmetry-breaking nature of the corresponding bifurcation.

For relatively weak values of the parameter \u025b controlling the strength of the PT-symmetric potential, excited states undergo (analytically tractable) spontaneous symmetry breaking; as \u025b is further increased, the ground state and first excited state, as well as branches of higher multisoliton (multivortex) states, collide in pairs and disappear in blue-sky bifurcations, in a way which is strongly reminiscent of the linear PT phase transition\u2014thus termed the nonlinear PT phase transition.

We quantify the dynamics by developing a few-mode approximation corresponding to the DWP structure, and analyze the resulting system of ordinary differential equations and its bifurcations in detail. We compare results of this analysis with those produced by the full partial differential equation, finding good agreement between the two approaches.

Adjusting the Skyrmion ansatz to the lattice setting allows us to construct a \"baby-Skyrmion\" in two dimensions (2D) and extend it into the 3D case (1D counterparts of the Skyrmions are also found). Stability limits for these patterns are obtained analytically and verified numerically.

Our analysis is based on the study of the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which incorporates a phenomenological damping term accounting for the interaction of the condensate with the thermal cloud. We illustrate how the negative Krein sign eigenmodes (associated with the the single-or multiple-dark soliton states) can give rise to Hopf bifurcations and oscillatory instabilities, whose ensuing dynamics is also elucidated. In all cases, the finite-temperature induced dynamics results in soliton decay, and the system eventually asymptotes to the ground state.1. Introduction. Matter-wave dark solitons in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), namely density dips with a phase jump at their density minimum, are fundamental macroscopic nonlinear excitations of BECs with repulsive interatomic interactions. As such, their stability and dynamics have been studied extensively in theory (see, eg, reviews in Refs.[8, 25, 17] and references therein) and in a series of experiments [5, 13, 14, 4, 15, 3, 37, 41, 39]. In fact, as far as experimental investigations are concerned, the earlier dark soliton experiments [5, 13, 14, 4] have been performed with condensates at relatively high temperatures. As a result, important features of the dark soliton dynamics\u2013such as their oscillation in the trap [6, 16], or their repulsive interaction [26]\u2013were not observed because of the fast decay of the waves due to the interaction of the condensate with the thermal cloud.

Indeed, both specialized books [3, 4] and reviews [5] have touched upon the relevant topic. While the non-integrable models, as eg the \u03c64 model, possess some intriguing twists, such as the fractal collisions [6\u20138] and the associated irreversible energy transfer phenomena, the integrable sG equation has been both a workhorse of integrability theory and a ripe testbed of various reduced dynamical theories, such as collective coordinate ones, among others [2, 5]. While these studies have been extensive in the realm of (1+ 1)-dimensions (one spatial, one temporal) far less has been explored in the context of higher dimensional and presumably non-integrable variants. More specifically, some of the relevant efforts have focused on the kinematics and dynamics of kinks in two-and three-dimensions (2D and 3D)[9\u201312], considering, among others, their motion driven by curvature and their ability to produce breathers as a result of collisions with boundaries [13]",

The relevant three principal branches, with n r= 0, 1, and 2 radial nodes, respectively, are systematically continued as a function of the chemical potential and their linear stability is analyzed in detail, in the absence as well as in the presence of topological charge m, ie, vorticity. It is found that for repulsive interatomic interactions only the ground state is linearly stable throughout the parameter range examined. Furthermore, this is true for topological charges m= 0 or 1; solutions with higher topological charge can be unstable even in that case. All higher excited states are found to be unstable in a wide parametric regime. However, for the focusing (attractive) case the ground state with n r= 0 and m= 0 can only be stable for a sufficiently low number of atoms. Once again \u2026",

Performing systematic numerical simulations in the framework of the original lattice that models the transmission line, we study the propagation properties of the derived vector soliton solutions.

As a prototypical example, we use a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a periodic optical-lattice potential. We show that when the potential is turned on sufficiently nonadiabatically, the system tries to reach its new ground state by transiting through states with periodicity half that of the lattice. The particularly intriguing characteristic of such states is that they cannot be captured by discrete systems such as the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We illustrate the origin of these states mathematically by treating them as superharmonic resonances of a parametrically forced Duffing oscillator and discuss their transient nature and potential observability.",

            "Abstract": "In this work we analyze PT-symmetric double-well potentials based on a two-mode picture. We reduce the problem into a PT-symmetric dimer and illustrate that the latter has effectively two fundamental bifurcations, a pitchfork (symmetry-breaking bifurcation) and a saddle-center one, which is the nonlinear analog of the PT-phase-transition. It is shown that the symmetry breaking leads to ghost states (amounting to growth or decay); although these states are not true solutions of the original continuum problem, the system's dynamics closely follows them, at least in its metastable evolution. Past the second bifurcation, there are no longer states of the original continuum system. Nevertheless, the solutions can be analytically continued to yield a new pair of branches, which is also identified and dynamically examined. Our explicit analytical results for the dimer are directly compared to the full continuum problem, yielding a good agreement.",

Stability limits in terms of the coupling constants, which depend on the value of the phase-mismatch parameter, are found for solitons of the twisted-mode type in the 1D lattice, and for their counterparts of two different types (one being a discrete vortex) in the 2D lattice. When the twisted-mode soliton is unstable, the instability, which may be either oscillatory or due to imaginary eigenfrequency pairs, transforms the unstable soliton \u2026",

By using energy arguments, it is found that the collapse dynamics is chiefly controlled by the linear/nonlinear gain/loss strengths. We identify a critical value of the linear gain, separating the possible decay of solutions to the trivial zero-state, from collapse. The numerical simulations, performed for a wide class of initial data, are found to be in very good agreement with the analytical results, and reveal long-time stability properties of localized solutions. The role of the higher-order effects to the transient dynamics is also revealed in these simulations.",

Both cases of the nonlinearity that is repulsive or attractive on the average are considered. In the former case, the main effect produced by the application of the FRM is spontaneous self-trapping of the condensate in either of the two potential wells in parameter regimes where it would remain untrapped in the absence of the management. In the weakly nonlinear regime, the frequency of intrinsic oscillations in the FRM-induced trapped state is very close to half the FRM frequency, suggesting that the effect is accounted for by a parametric resonance.

Averaging over a number of such trajectories (as done in experiments) washes out such background fluctuations, revealing a well-defined temperature-dependent temporal growth in the oscillation amplitude.

Nevertheless, complete stabilization of the relevant configuration can be achieved by the presence of external ring-shaped barrier potentials. Interactions of multiple rings are also explored, and their equilibrium positions (as a result of their own curvature and their tail-tail interactions) are identified.

            "Abstract": "We review recent results for the emergence, existence, dynamics and interactions of vortex rings in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Under appropriate conditions, a BEC can be accurately described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is a variant of the celebrated defocusing nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation incorporating external potentials. Using the GPE model, we focus our attention on the two opposite regimes of low and high atomic density limits in the BEC as well as in the intermediate transition between these two limits. In the low density limit, corresponding to the linear limit, we study the emergence of single and multiple vortex rings emanating from planar 3D dark solitons through bifurcations. It is found that these bifurcations crucially depend on the aspect ratio (anisotropy) of the confining trapping potential. We characterize such bifurcations quantitatively using a Galerkin-type approach, and find good qualitative and quantitative agreement with our Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) numerical analysis. Under appropriate conditions for the trapping strengths, we find that vortex rings might be stabilized for large enough atomic densities (large chemical potentials). On the other hand, in the large density limit (the so-called Thomas-Fermi limit), the vortex rings acquire stability and behave like robust coherent structures. We study different single and multi-vortex-ring configurations together with their (normal) modes of vibration. Exotic structures such as Hopfions, the one-component counterpart to Skyrmions, are also constructed and tested for stability. Finally, we discuss some interactions dynamics between vortex rings such as \u2026",

In particular, the square root of the critical density for nucleation as a function of speed displays two different linear regimes corresponding to small and large velocities. Effectively, the emission of gray solitons and vortex\u2013antivortex pairs occurs for any velocity of the impurity, as any given velocity will be supercritical in a region with a sufficiently small density.

Typically, the surface makes the stability region larger, an extreme example of that being the three-site \u201chorseshoe\u201d-shaped structure, which is always unstable in the bulk, while at the surface it is stable near the anticontinuum limit. We also examine effects of the surface on lattice vortices. For the vortex placed parallel to the surface, the increased stability-region feature is also observed, while the vortex cannot exist in a state normal to the surface. More sophisticated localized dynamical structures, such as five-site horseshoes and pyramids, are also considered.",

In particular, merger of the solitons into a single one, and bounce after multiple collisions are found.

First we explore the one-dimensional, standard NLS equation with general power law nonlinearity, in which large amplitude excitations reminiscent of Peregrine solitons or regular solitons appear to form, as the width of the relevant Gaussian is varied. Furthermore, the variation of the nonlinearity exponent aims at a first glimpse of the interplay between rogue or soliton formation and collapse features. The robustness of the main features to noise in the initial data is also confirmed.

However, the stability critically depends on the gain and loss profile. For a symmetrically placed solitary wave (in either the continuum model or a discrete analog of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon type), there is no effect on the steady state spectrum. However, for asymmetrically placed solutions, there exists a measurable effect of which a perturbative mathematical characterization is offered. It is generally found that asymmetry towards the lossy side leads towards stability, while towards the gain side produces instability. Furthermore, a host of finite size effects, which disappear in the infinite domain limit, are illustrated in connection to the continuous spectrum of the problem.",

The motivating physical example consists of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates confined in an harmonic (e.g., magnetic) trap and an optical lattice. By connecting the nonlinear problem with the underlying linear spectrum, we examine the bifurcation of nonlinear modes out of the linear ones for both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. In particular, we find real-valued solutions (such as multipoles) and complex-valued ones (such as vortices). A primary motivation of the present work is to develop \u201crules of thumb\u201d about what waveforms to expect emerging in the nonlinear problem and about the stability of those modes. As a case example of the latter, we find that among the real-valued solutions, the one with larger norm for a fixed value of the chemical \u2026",

Indeed, the perspectives are very promising and range from coherent matter-wave optics to precision measurements and quantum information processing. Nowadays there exists an unprecedented control over the external magnetic, electric, or optical fields that are used to confine or alter the properties of the BECs, while matter-wave devices, such as the atom chips [2], have been developed as well. These advances, along with the formal similarities between nonlinear and matter-wave optics [3] indicate that coherent matter-waves, such as matter-wave solitons and vortices, may in principle be controlled similarly to their optical siblings in optical fibers, waveguides, photonic crystals, and so on [4].",

We systematically verify the conditions for the existence and stability of discrete solitons in the one-dimensional version of the model predicted by means of the variational approximation (VA), and demonstrate the following: monostability of fundamental solitons (FSs) in the case of the weak nonlinearity, 2\u03c3+1<3.682\u03c3+1<3.68; bistability, in a finite range of values of the soliton\u2019s power, for 3.68<2\u03c3+1<53.68<2\u03c3+1<5; and the presence of a threshold (minimum norm of the FS), for 2\u03c3+1\u226552\u03c3+1\u22655. We also perform systematic numerical simulations to study higher-order solitons in the same general model, i.e., bound states of the FSs. While all in-phase bound states are unstable, stability regions are identified for antisymmetric double solitons and their triple counterparts. These numerical findings are supplemented by an analytical treatment of the stability problem, which allows quantitively accurate predictions for the stability features of such multipulses. When these waveforms are found to be unstable, we show, by means of direct simulations, that they self-trap into a persistent lattice breather, or relax into a stable FS, or sometimes decay completely.",

We find very good quantitative agreement between theoretical, numerical, and experimental diagnostics of the modulational instability.

Remarkably, this rapid modulation provides for a controllable expansion of the region of exact PT-symmetry, depending on the strength and frequency of the imposed modulation. The resulting averaged models are analysed theoretically and their exact stationary solutions are translated into time-periodic solutions through the averaging reduction. These are, in turn, compared with the exact periodic solutions of the full non-autonomous PT-symmetry managed problem and very good agreement is found between the two.",

It is shown that a shelf develops around the soliton that propagates with speed determined by the background intensity. Integral relations obtained from the conservation laws of the NLS equation are used to determine the properties of the shelf.

All the above models arise in the description of shallow water waves, and their solutions are used for the construction of relevant soliton solutions of the nonlocal NLS. Thus, the connection between water wave and nonlinear optics models suggests that patterns of water may indeed exist in light.

The dynamics is sensitive to the phase of the OL potential relative to the magnetic trap, and depends less on the OL strength. For the cosinusoidal OL potential, a local minimum is generated at the trap's centre, creating a stable equilibrium for the vortex, while in the case of the sinusoidal potential, the vortex is expelled from the centre, demonstrating spiral motion. Cases where the vortex is created far from the trap's centre are also studied, revealing slow outward-spiralling drift. Numerical results are explained in an analytical form by means of a variational approximation. Finally, motivated by a discrete model (which is tantamount to the case of the strong OL lattice), we present a novel type of vortex consisting of two pairs of antiphase solitons.",

First, at an intermediate stage, a Boussinesq equation is derived, and then its far-field, in the form of a variety of Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvilli (KP) equations for right-and left-going waves, is found. KP models include versions of the KP-I and KP-II equations, in Cartesian and cylindrical geometry. Solitary waves solutions, planar or ring-shaped, and of dark or anti-dark type, are also predicted to occur. Their nature and stability is determined by a parameter defined by the physical parameters of the original nonlocal system. It is thus found that (dark) anti-dark solitary waves are only supported by a weak (strong) nonlocality, and are unstable (stable) in higher-dimensions. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by direct numerical simulations.",

The critical (maximum) velocity of the inhomogeneity, at which it is still able to steadily drag the front, is found in an analytical approximation, using both perturbation theory and a quasiparticle description of the front. A case of steep inhomogeneities is studied in detail by means of direct simulations, showing that the analytical prediction for the critical velocity is in very good agreement with numerical results for small and moderate values of the inhomogeneity's strength. If the driving velocity exceeds the critical value, the kink is eventually destroyed. If the perturbation is strong, the simulations show that the actual critical velocity is larger than a formally extended analytical value, i.e., the kink turns out to be more robust than it is \u2026",

We supplement our spectral analysis by studying the dynamics of such stationary states; we find them to be robust against significant perturbations of the initial state. In the unstable regimes, we not only identify the unstable mode, such as a quadrupolar or hexapolar mode, but we also observe the corresponding instability dynamics.

Their stability is subsequently examined in the presence of purely magnetic trapping, and in the combined presence of magnetic and optical trapping. We then study pairs of vortices and their interactions, illustrating a reduced description in terms of ordinary differential equations for the vortex centers. In the realm of two vortices we also consider the existence of stable dipole clusters for two-component condensates.

            "Abstract": "The dynamical behavior of a higher-order cubic Ginzburg-Landau equation is found to include a wide range of scenarios due to the interplay of higher-order physically relevant terms. We find that the competition between the third-order dispersion and stimulated Raman scattering effects gives rise to rich dynamics: this extends from Poincar\u00e9-Bendixson\u2013type scenarios, in the sense that bounded solutions may converge either to distinct equilibria via orbital connections or to space-time periodic solutions, to the emergence of almost periodic and chaotic behavior. One of our main results is that third-order dispersion has a dominant role in the development of such complex dynamics, since it can be chiefly responsible (even in the absence of other higher-order effects) for the existence of periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic spatiotemporal structures. Suitable low-dimensional phase-space diagnostics are devised and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We report experimental results and study theoretically soliton formation and propagation in an air-filled acoustic waveguide side loaded with Helmholtz resonators. We propose a theoretical modeling of the system, which relies on a transmission-line approach, leading to a nonlinear dynamical lattice model. The latter allows for an analytical description of the various soliton solutions for the pressure, which are found by means of dynamical systems and multiscale expansion techniques. These solutions include Boussinesq-like and Korteweg-de Vries pulse-shaped solitons that are observed in the experiment, as well as nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger envelope solitons, that are predicted theoretically. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations and in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.",

We illustrate that such inhomogeneous settings present vastly different dynamical behavior in the vicinity of the interface than the one expected in their homogeneous counterparts. We analyze the relevant stationary states, as well as their stability, by means of perturbation theory and linear stability analysis. We find good agreement with the numerical findings in the vicinity of the anticontinuum limit. For larger values of the coupling, we follow the relevant branches numerically and show that they terminate at values of the coupling strength which are larger for more extended solutions. The dynamical development of relevant instabilities is also monitored in the case of unstable solutions.",

            "Abstract": "In the present work, we investigate how single-and multi-vortex-ring states can emerge from a planar dark soliton in three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein condensates (confined in isotropic or anisotropic traps) through bifurcations. We characterize such bifurcations quantitatively using a Galerkin-type approach and find good qualitative and quantitative agreement with our Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes (BdG) analysis. We also systematically characterize the BdG spectrum of the dark solitons, using perturbation theory, and obtain a quantitative match with our 3D BdG numerical calculations. We then turn our attention to the emergence of single-and multi-vortex-ring states. We systematically capture these as stationary states of the system and quantify their BdG spectra numerically. We find that although the vortex ring may be unstable when bifurcating, its instabilities weaken and may even eventually disappear for \u2026",
