The design objective of our Jamming Avoidance Itinerary Design (JAID) algorithm is twofold: (a) to calculate near-optimal routes for MAs that incrementally fuse the data as they visit the nodes; (b) in the face of jamming attacks against the WSN, to modify the itineraries of the MAs to bypass the jammed area(s) while not disrupting the efficient data dissemination from working sensors.

The visit of the included nodes and edges should take place within their respective time window and the overall duration of each walk should be below a certain threshold. In this paper we introduce the MTOPTW, which can be used for modeling a realistic variant of the Tourist Trip Design Problem where the objective is the derivation of near-optimal multiple-day itineraries for tourists visiting a destination which features several points of interest (POIs) and scenic routes. Since the MTOPTW is a NP-hard problem, we propose the first metaheuristic approaches to tackle it. The effectiveness of our algorithms is validated through a number of experiments on POI and scenic route sets compiled from the city of Athens (Greece). View Full-Text",

The basis of our algorithm is a scheme that accurately predicts the mobility of each mobile host based on the stability of its neighborhood (i.e., how different is its neighborhood over time). This information is then used for creating each cluster from hosts that will remain neighbors for sufficiently long time, ensuring the formation of clusters that are highly resistant to host mobility.

A situation often encountered in AR applications is the partial or full occlusion of\u2013physical or virtual\u2013objects by physical obstacles. Existing outdoors AR applications overlook this issue displaying visual indicators about nearby annotated objects even when those are hidden behind a building, hence, being out of the users\u2019 field of view (FoV). This paper presents a geolocative raycasting technique which enables real time building recognition towards the device\u2019s pointing direction, thereby estimating the FoV of the users. The objective is either to hide or utilize appropriate visual metaphors for occluded objects/locations thereby improving the user\u2019s perception about its surrounding space. The motivation for developing our occlusion handling technique has been drawn from KnossosAR, an outdoors mobile AR \u2026",

TTDP solvers derive daily tourist tours ie, ordered visits to POIs, which respect tourist constraints and POIs attributes. The main objective of the problem discussed is to select POIs that match tourist preferences, thereby maximizing tourist satisfaction, while taking into account a multitude of parameters and constraints (eg, distances among POIs, visiting time required for each POI, POIs visiting days/hours, entrance fees, weather conditions) and respecting the time available for sightseeing in daily basis. The aim of this work is to survey models, algorithmic approaches and methodologies concerning tourist trip design problems. Recent approaches are examined, focusing on problem models that best capture a multitude of realistic POIs attrbutes and user constraints; further, several interesting TTDP variants are investigated.

Clustering of mobile nodes among separate domains has been proposed as an efficient approach to answer the organization, scalability and routing problems of mobile ad hoc networks. In this work, we propose an efficient distributed clustering algorithm that uses both location and energy metrics for stable cluster formation. Unlike existing active clustering methods, out algorithm relieves the network from the unnecessary burden of control messages broadcasting. This is achieved through adapting broadcast period according to mobile nodes mobility pattern. For relative static network topologies, broadcast period is lengthened. In contrast, broadcast period is shortened to meet the requirements of highly dynamic networks for consistent cluster \u2026",

In the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), jamming is the type of attack which interferes with the radio frequencies used by sensor nodes and may be viewed as a special case of denial of service (DoS) attacks. Herein, we outline the possible jamming attacks a WSN may encounter. The main contribution of this paper is the outline of the design specifications of a prototype node \u2018Ares\u2019 that effectively defends jamming attacks. Our focus is on frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), two of the most effective countermeasures against jamming. The main novel aspect of Ares is that it uses a hybrid FHSS\u2013DSSS approach to defend jamming attacks. We suggest the use of a specific FHSS technique in 5\u2009GHz \u2026",

The system incentivizes users based on the priorities of vehicle relocations among stations, taking into account the fluctuating demand for vehicles and parking places at different stations over time.

There is little knowledge however as to how actual social conditions impact users during a virtual experience. We investigate this issue by placing 54 individuals into a virtual clothing store and having them witness the exposure of their avatar's naked virtual body, being either alone or in the presence of a virtual salesman. Our results indicate that a second character does not affect levels of presence and body ownership illusion, but does cause a strong emotional response, thus suggesting that social context and social presence affectively impact users.",

The system incentivizes users based on the priorities of vehicle relocations from station to station, taking into account the fluctuating demand for vehicles and parking places at different stations over time. We present two different schemes for incentivizing users to act in favour of the system. Both schemes consider budget constraints and are truthful and budget-feasible.

This causes the decline of scarce network resources such as bandwidth and energy, thus decreasing the lifetime of sensor network. Recently, the mobile agent (MA) paradigm has been proposed as a solution to overcome these problems. The MA approach accounts for performing data processing and making data aggregation decisions at nodes rather than bring data back to a central processor (sink). Using this approach, redundant sensory data is eliminated. In this article, we consider the problem of calculating near-optimal routes for MAs that incrementally fuse the data as they visit the nodes in a WSN. The order of visited nodes (the agent\u2019s itinerary) affects not only the quality but also the overall cost of data fusion. Our proposed heuristic algorithm adapts \u2026",

Research projects have mainly focused on identifying applications where the employment of MAs is preferable compared to centralised or alternative distributed computing models. Very little work has been made on examining how MA platforms design can be optimised so as the network traffic and latency associated with MA transfers are minimised. The work presented in this paper addresses these issues by investigating the effect of several optimisation ideas applied on our MA platform prototype.

TOPTW is an NP-hard problem and the most efficient known heuristic is based on Iterated Local Search (ILS). However, ILS treats each POI separately; hence it tends to overlook highly profitable areas of POIs situated far from the current location, considering them too time-expensive to visit.

The main objective in clustering is to identify suitable node representatives, i.e. cluster heads (CHs) to store routing and topology information; CHs should be elected so as to maximize clusters stability, that is to prevent frequent cluster re-structuring. Since CHs are engaged on packet forwarding they are prone to rapidly drop their energy supplies, hence, another important objective of clustering is to prevent such node failures. Recently proposed clustering algorithms either suggest CH election based on node IDs (nodes with locally lowest ID value become CHs) or take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and optimize initial clustering. Yet, the former method is biased against nodes with low IDs (which are likely to serve as CHs for long periods and \u2026",

Due to the deficiencies of the traditional manager-agent paradigm and the resulting scalability and flexibility limitations of centralisation, it is now commonly agreed that a transition to distributed management is required. There are many new trends in NSM that try to address this requirement. In general, these trends make use of well-established techniques from other computing fields, eg distributed objects, Java and Web technologies, adapted to NSM problems. In addition, management distribution aspects have also been incorporated in both the Internet and OSI-SM management architectures. However, it has been shown that distribution alone is not enough. Due to the high frequency of changes in networking environments, it is imperative that management systems are flexible, ie they can dynamically adapt to those changes and allow on-the-fly customisation of management services. In that context, Management by Delegation (MbD) paradigm has been identified as the first promising approach towards management distribution and flexibility.Mobile Agents (MA) represent a relatively new computing paradigm used in several domains as a means for structuring distributed applications. The term MA refers to a software entity identified by its code, persistent and execution state, with the ability to autonomously move from host to host, acting on behalf of a user or an application.

In this paper, we introduce an on-line distributed protocol for event handling in a WSAN. Existing techniques usually select actors nearby the current event for handling it. However, this greedy approach may eventually lead to a slow response to events because it does not consider the spatial distribution that future events might have. In contrast, in order to cater for future events, the proposed solution probabilistically selects actors for event handling, allowing distant actors to be selected as well. This randomized approach guarantees fast average responsiveness to events, a balanced energy consumption among actors \u2026",

PROTECT utilizes a 3-tier architecture where the first tier comprises a base station (BS), the second tier mobile sinks (MS) (carried by blind people on their sticks) and the third tier stationary sensor nodes. This WSN is deployed in an urban environment. In the event of an alarm issued by a sensor node, the BS launches a number of MAs supplied with a near-optimal itineraries that visit the nodes in the alarm's surrounding area and notifies, through Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), visually impaired people for potential hazards in their proximity.

The algorithm\u2019s structure encompasses two basic components. First, a modified objective function of the fuzzy c-means method is reformulated and then is minimized by means of an iterative gradient-descent procedure. Second, the overall training procedure is equipped with a systematic strategy for the transition from fuzzy mode, where each training vector is assigned to more than one codebook vectors, to crisp mode, where each training vector is assigned to only one codebook vector. The algorithm is fast and easy to implement. Finally, the simulation results show that the method is efficient and appears to be insensitive to the selection of the fuzziness parameter.",

Determining optimal itineraries for MAs traveling through WSN nodes is a non-trivial problem. Thus, several heuristics have been proposed to perform efficient itinerary planning for MAs. However, the evaluation of these heuristics is typically performed on the ground of different parameter spaces and assumptions about the underlying network and the capabilities of nodes. Herein, we implement, simulate and compare the most prominent itinerary planning algorithms upon a common parameter space, making realistic network-level assumptions.",

However, existing systems fail to exploit information, behaviors, ideas, evaluations, assessments, ratings, etc, by other tourists with similar interests, which provide ground for the cooperative production of tourist content and travel recommendations.

The proposed techniques achieve prolonged network lifetime by (i) selecting as rendezvous nodes sensor nodes from energy rich network neighborhoods that are appropriately distributed across the network, especially in regions where increased energy consumption has been observed and (ii) building energy efficient routes for all sensor nodes of the network toward the trajectories of the mobile elements. We also conducted simulation tests which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.",

The main objective of clustering is to identify suitable node representatives, i.e. cluster heads (CHs), to store routing and topology information and maximize clusters stability. Traditional clustering algorithms suggest CH election exclusively based on node IDs or location information and involve frequent broadcasting of control packets, even when network topology remains unchanged. More recent works take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and optimize initial clustering. However, in many situations (e.g. in relatively static topologies) re-clustering procedure is hardly ever invoked; hence initially elected CHs soon reach battery exhaustion.

            "Abstract": "Pervasive games represent a radically new game form that extends gaming experiences out into the physical world, weaving ICTs into the fabric of players' real environment. This emerging type of games is rather challenging for developers who are engaged in exploring new technologies and methods to achieve high quality interactive experience for players. This paper follows a systematic approach to explore the landscape of pervasive gaming. First, we present ten representative pervasive game projects, classified in five genres based on their playing environment and features. Then, we present a comparative view of those projects with respect to several design aspects. Last, we shed light on current trends, design principles and future directions for pervasive games development.",

            "Abstract": "Worldwide forecasts indicate that the size and population of cities will increase further. This immense growth will put a strain on resources and pose a major challenge in many aspects of everyday life in urban areas, such as the quality of services in the medical, educational, environmental, transportation, public safety, and security sectors, indicatively. Thus, novel methods of management must be put in place for these cities to remain sustainable. The wide adoption of pervasive and mobile computing systems gave rise to the term of \u201csmart cities,\u201d which implies the ability of sustainable city growth by leading to major improvements in city management and life in the above-mentioned sectors and other aspects such as energy efficiency, traffic congestion, pollution reduction, parking space, and recreation. This has been made possible in recent years due to the widespread availability of commodity low-power sensors, smart phones, tablets, and the necessary wireless networking infrastructure, which, along with technologies such as AI and management of big data, may be utilized to address the challenges of sustainable urban environments. The motivation behind this special issue has been to solicit cutting-edge research relevant to technologies, methodologies, and applications for smart cities. The special issue has attracted 19 submissions. Following a rigorous review process (including a second review round), 7 outstanding papers (acceptance rate 36.8%) have been finally selected for inclusion in the special issue. The accepted papers cover a wide range of research subjects in the broader area of smart cities, including service delivery, service \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A critical issue dealt with in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs) is the real time response of actors to events occurring in the network area. The fast notification of actors from Sensor Nodes (SNs) about the events as well as the effective coordination of actors for prompt event handling is most important in these networks. In this paper, we introduce a distributed protocol for effective event handling in a WSAN. Existing approaches mainly favoring actors near the current event for handling it, may lead to highly ineffective solutions for certain worst-case scenarios. Through a randomized approach, our solution also selects distant actors for handling events, and guarantees fast average responsiveness to events and a balanced energy distribution among actors. In addition, it features efficient distributed algorithms for sensor to actor and actor to actor coordination which are of independent interest.",

In this way, long lifetime for the clustering structure is guaranteed, thereby eliminating the need for frequent reclustering.

For satisfying timely delivery of sensory data to the mobile sink, the mobile sink is forced to visit only an appropriate number of rendezvous nodes while the remaining nodes send their data through multi-hop communication toward the rendezvous nodes. The proposed technique achieves prolonged network lifetime by selecting energy rich paths for this multi-hop communication. Specifically, first the network is partitioned into a number of clusters and then the cluster heads of an appropriate number of energy rich clusters are selected as rendezvous nodes in such a way that (i) the rendezvous nodes are appropriately distributed across the network area to ensure energy efficient data gathering from the other sensor nodes to the rendezvous nodes and (ii) the length of the mobile sink trajectory \u2026",

A popular clustering algorithm (LID) suggests CH election based on node IDs (nodes with locally lowest ID value become CHs). Although fast and simple, this method is biased against nodes with low IDs, which are likely to serve as CHs for long periods and are therefore prone to rapid battery exhaustion. Herein, we propose LIDAR, a novel clustering method which represents a major improvement over traditional LID algorithm: node IDs are periodically re-assigned so that nodes with low mobility rate and high energy capacity are assigned low ID values and, therefore, are likely to serve as CHs.

Tourists, upon installation to their mobile device, can view content material and a map of Mytilene (Lesvos, Greece) without the need to \u201cconnect\u201d to any mobile operator network, thereby saving high roaming charges. Our case-study has been the design and implementation of a Multi-Platform Mobile Tourist Guide system for the Municipality of Mytilene (Greece), which uses a thin PC client via Internet to present tourist content giving the user the opportunity to select content of choice and the ability to dynamically build a thick client mobile tourist application or use the PDA Installation available at the Municipal tourist office.",

The algorithm not only suggests the optimal number of MAs that minimise the overall cost but also constructs optimal itineraries for each of them.

Hence, applications that allow searching for best food options have become essential part of food experience for many. Technological advancements have brought the opportunity for custom search of food options at our fingertips. Tourist applications increasingly incorporate food search as an integral functional element, as gastronomy becomes an indispensable part of the travelling.

The energy constraints of sensor nodes call for energy-efficient data aggregation methods so as to prolong network lifetime. Among other approaches, Mobile Agents (MAs) have been proposed to improve the performance of data aggregation in WSNs. In such approaches, the itineraries followed by travelling agents largely determine the overall performance of the data aggregation tasks. Along this line, several heuristics have been proposed to perform efficient itinerary planning for MAs. However, a direct comparison of the proposed algorithms is not straightforward, as they are typically performed on the ground of different parameter instances and assumptions about the underlying network and nodes capabilities.

            "Abstract": "Museum stores represent integral parts of the museums that have also a lot to benefit from a successful presence on the web arena. In addition to traditional web sites, carefully designed electronic commerce (e-commerce) sites may increase the potential of museum stores offering possibilities for on-line shopping and other commercial functions. In parallel, the recent convergence of the traditionally separate technologies of the Internet and mobile telephony has brought the concept of 'wireless Internet' into the spotlight. Within this context, 'mobile commerce' (m-commerce) is a relatively new trend that represents a natural extension of e-commerce into the wireless world. M-commerce refers to electronic business transactions and differentiates from e-commerce since it involves the use of mobile devices and wireless medium rather than wired. The unique characteristics of mobile computing bring forward new challenges and opportunities for museum stores. This article presents the design and implementation of an e-commerce and an m-commerce museum shop application. The aim is to evaluate and compare the two applications in terms of several parameters, such as available technologies, strengths and limitations, design requirements, usability, interaction speed, usage cost, etc and also to identify ways for enhancing the potential of such applications and designing successful and profitable business models.",

            "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in many applications which often include the monitoring and recording of sensitive information. Hence, their critical importance raises many security concerns. In the context of WSNs, jamming is the type of attack which interferes with the radio frequencies used by network nodes. In the event that an attacker uses a rather powerful jamming source, disruptions of WSNs proper function are likely to occur. As a result, the use of countermeasures against jamming in WSN environments is of immense importance. The main contribution of this article is the discussion of various defence methods against jamming that would allow a WSN to survive and work properly in a hostile jamming environment. Our focus is on frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), two of the most effective countermeasures against jamming. We suggest the \u2026",

The effectiveness of pervasive games in creating immersive live-action game experiences principally depends on the correlation of the game content with actual physical elements. To address this issue, most pervasive game prototypes so far have been bound to specific locations, while game content has been manually edited by the developers; they have also been heavily dependent on the mediation of orchestration teams.

An authoring tool (Developer21) supporting a metadata model according MPEG-21 XML schema files is described. The main scope of Developer21 is to increase interactivity resulting from the use of metadata in several broadcast scenarios in interactive or IP television. In addition to basic functionalities (editing and enrichment of audiovisual contents), innovative content management functionalities of the Developer21 are briefly presented. As the focus of this paper was to provide a brief description of a novel authoring tool for metadata and descriptor management, only core functionalities are presented.",

            "Abstract": "A key feature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the collaborative processing, where the correlation existing over the local data of sensor nodes (SNs) is exploited so that the total data volume can be reduced (data aggregation). The use of Mobile Agents (MAs), i.e., software entities able of migrating among nodes and resuming execution naturally, fits in this scenario; the local data of an SN can be combined with the data collected by an MA from other SNs in a way that depends on the specific program code of the MA. In this paper, we consider the problem of calculating near-optimal routes for MAs that incrementally aggregate the data as they visit the nodes in a distributed sensor network. Our algorithm follows a greedy-like approach always selecting the next node to be included in an itinerary in such a way that the cost of the so far formed itineraries is kept minimum at each step.

This paper reports hands-on experiences in designing, implementing and operating UbiCare, an AAL based prototype system for elderly home care monitoring. The monitoring is based on the recording of environmental parameters like temperature and light intensity as well as micro-level incidents which allows one to infer daily activities like moving, sitting, sleeping, usage of electrical appliances and plumbing components. The prototype is built upon inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware (eg, various sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, ZigBee-compatible wireless communication modules) and license-free software, thereby ensuring low system deployment costs. The network comprises nodes placed in a house\u2019s main rooms or mounted on furniture, one wearable node, one actuator node and a centralized processing element (coordinator). Upon detecting significant deviations from the ordinary activity patterns of individuals and/or sudden falls, the system issues automated alarms which may be forwarded to authorized caregivers via a variety of communication channels. Furthermore, measured environmental parameters and activity incidents may be monitored through standard web interfaces. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Mobile Agent (MA) technology has been recently proposed in Wireless Sensors Networks (WSNs) literature to answer the scalability problem of client/server model in data fusion applications. In this paper, we describe the critical role MAs can play in the field of security and robustness of a WSN in addition to data fusion. The design objective of our Jamming Avoidance Itinerary Design (JAID) algorithm is twofold:(a) to calculate near-optimal routes for MAs that incrementally fuse the data as they visit the nodes;(b) in the face of jamming attacks against the WSN, to modify the itineraries of the MAs to avoid the jammed area (s) while not disrupting the efficient data dissemination from working sensors. If the number of jammed nodes is small, JAID only modifies the pre-jamming scheduled itineraries to increase the algorithm\u2019s promptness. Otherwise, JAID reconstructs the agent itineraries excluding the jammed area (s). Another important feature of JAID is the suppression of data taken from sensors when the associated readings do not change overtime. Data suppression also applies sensors\u2019 readings are identical to those of their neighboring sensors. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm against jamming attacks as well as its performance gain over alternative approaches in data fusion tasks.",

Nevertheless, while large enterprise networks are already hierarchically structured, MA-based management has not yet moved from \u2018flat\u2019 to hierarchical structures. That results in non-scalable flat architectures, particularly when the management of remote subnetworks is considered. In this context, the deployment of a hierarchically structured MA-based management framework is a reasonable approach. The migration to hierarchical structures is achieved with an additional management entity, the Mobile Distributed Manager (MDM), which takes the full control of managing a given network segment. This architecture exploits the mobility features of MDMs to dynamically adapt to mutable networking conditions. Empirical results \u2026",

However, desktop is still important for daytime at work audiences, and smart devices (such as tablets and smartphones) dominate the time that people spend connected to the web. Personalization is a desired functionality for applications within mobile environments. It provides means of fulfilling users\u2019 needs more effectively and efficiently and consequently increasing users\u2019 satisfaction, overtaking the traditional onesize-fits-all paradigm. It is considered a fundamental feature for both users who are receiving services and for service providers who want to target their services to each individual, but different conceptual and technical challenges must be faced to achieve adequate adaptivity. For personalization to be successful, information about the specific users is necessary to understand real user needs. ree principal sources of data about the user are usually considered: contextual information (eg, geolocation and presence of other people), representations of user specific attributes, such as interests and needs, and social signals. e motivation behind this special issue is to solicit cutting-edge research relevant to personalized mobile services, with significant advances, carry out innovative explorations, and establish foundations for further research. e special issue has attracted 12 submissions.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, a new scheme for dynamic relocation in free floating car sharing systems is proposed. First, a heuristic approach is presented for designing a car relocation plan which achieves a better balance between supply and demand in such a system within strict time limits. As being heuristic, the algorithm is fast, further aiding in maintaining fast responsiveness in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, an on-fly-correction of the original relocation plan is also presented for dealing with changes in car distribution happening in the system due to its concurrent use by the users. Thus, the relocation plan is still effective even in the case that the predictions of future user movements are not accurate.",
