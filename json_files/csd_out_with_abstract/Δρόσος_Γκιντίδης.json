Using Liouville's transform, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the solution of an auxiliary initial value problem for large wave numbers and the asymptotic behaviour of the characteristic determinants derived from the eigenfunction expansions. Next, we assume that we know all transmission eigenvalues with spherically symmetric eigenfunctions and prove under some conditions that the transformed discontinuity of the refractive index can be determined. Finally we prove that the knowledge of all transmission eigenvalues including multiplicities uniquely determines n (r), under the assumption that n (0) is known and either n (r)> 1 or 0< n (r)< 1 by using a moment type result and applying M\u00fcntz's theorem.",

            "Abstract": "We consider the interior transmission eigenvalue problem corresponding to the inverse scattering problem for an isotropic inhomogeneous medium. We first prove that transmission eigenvalues exist for media with index of refraction greater or less than one without assuming that the contrast is sufficiently large. Then we show that for an arbitrary Lipshitz domain with constant index of refraction there exists an infinite discrete set of transmission eigenvalues that accumulate at infinity. Finally, for the general case of non constant index of refraction we provide a lower and an upper bound for the first transmission eigenvalue in terms of the first transmission eigenvalue for appropriate balls with constant index of refraction.1. Introduction. The interior transmission problem is a boundary value problem in a bounded domain which arises in inverse scattering theory for inhomogeneous media. Although simply stated, this problem is not covered by the standard theory of elliptic partial differential equations since as it stands it is neither elliptic nor selfadjoint. Of particular interest is the spectrum associated with this boundary value problem, more specifically the existence of eigenvalues which are called transmission eigenvalues. Besides the theoretical importance of transmission eigenvalues in connection with uniqueness and reconstruction results in inverse scattering theory, recently they have been used to obtain information about the index of refraction from measured data [1],[5]. This is based on the important result that transmission eigenvalues can be determined from the measured far field data which is recently proven in [3]. For information on the interior \u2026",

Both problems are formulated in R2 for time\u2010harmonic fields and longitudinal or transversal incident plane waves. Representation of the scattered field as a single\u2010 or a double\u2010layer potential, equivalently, leads to a system of two nonlinear integral equations for the density and the parametrization of the boundary. A detailed numerical implementation is presented for computing the corresponding solutions of both systems and numerical reconstructions are given to show the effectiveness of the method.",

We assume that the waveguide is a two dimensional horizontal strip between two straight lines where on the one boundary line Dirichlet conditions hold and on the other Neumann. We use point sources, distributed uniformly on the boundary of a domain to illuminate point scatterers which are located inside this domain. The measurements are performed at the same points where the point sources are placed. We first formulate a MUSIC type algorithm and justify mathematically its connection with the scattering from an inhomoge-neous waveguide. Next, we present its connection with the factorization method for waveguides. We perform a numerical implementation of the algorithm using singular value decomposition of the basic data matrix taking into account the difficulties arising in waveguides. The final algorithm produces fine \u2026",

For bounded scatterers, the well\u2010known Kupradze radiation conditions encode the outgoing character of the elastic waves. For infinite scatterers the situation changes drastically. The boundary of the problem is now in the neighbourhood of the asymptotic region and Kupradze's conditions are proved inadequate. In this work the radiation conditions for the elastic scattering by stress\u2010free rough surfaces are constructed. The elastic scattered field is expressed through the angular spectrum representation, which contains two vector spectral amplitudes expressing the two propagating waves in elasticity. In a properly selected region, the different types of integrals emerging from the application of Betti's formula are estimated \u2026",

We consider the problem of an infinite elastic isotropic substrate which contains an isotropic inhomogeneity with arbitrary shape and any loading at infinity. We characterise the integrodifferential equation as a tensor singular integral equation of second kind. We adopt a classical matrixisation procedure which provides an equivalent matrix integral equation. We compute its symbol and prove that the index is zero which means that it is of Fredholm type. Consequently, according to Noether's theory, to infer existence and uniqueness it is sufficient to prove that the corresponding homogeneous equation has the trivial solution.

The corresponding boundary integral system of equations is uniquely solvable. Using superposition principle we establish the exact form of the scattered field if the incident wave is a superposition of plane dyadic waves.
