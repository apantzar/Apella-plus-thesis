Besides, the study examined the relationship between participants\u2019 gender and their foreign language learning strategy use. Oxford\u2019s taxonomy for language learning strategies (1990) was utilized. In this taxonomy, language learning strategies are classified into the following six main categories: cognitive, memory, metacognitive, compensation, social and affective-strategies. A questionnaire comprising Oxford's taxonomy for second language learning strategies (1990) was used as an instrument for surveying the language learning strategies. The overall strategy used by the whole sample was found to be located in the medium range of strategies used. While metacognitive the participants reported strategies as the most utilized strategies. Affective strategies registered the lowest use by them. The results of the t-test indicated no statistically significant difference in the participants\u2019 use of different learning approaches with respect to the gender variable. Conclusions and pedagogical implications of the results were discussed.",

In each evaluation study, usability problems were identified, and specific suggestions were documented for HRI usability improvement. In each design iteration, a smaller number of usability issues were identified. Results of the final heuristic evaluation showed that the system is at a good level of usability and is expected to provide satisfactory services to its typical users.",

Britain [2] identifies three general ideas that are central to this concept: a) people learn better when actively involved in doing something, b) learning activities may be sequenced or otherwise structured carefully and deliberately in a learning workflow to promote more effective learning and c) it would be useful to be able to record \u2018learning designs\u2019 for sharing and re-use in the future.",

Active learning and engaging learning activities are prominent among the-often not realized in practice-promises of ICTE.

In this paper we present LvS (Learning via Subtitling), a special learning/exercising environment for foreign languages, mimicking a highly specialized professional activity: film/video subtitling. The learner combines listening (to speech, music and other sounds) with viewing (thus incorporating cultural aspects in her learning) in order to come to an understanding which she must then render by suitable translation into subtitles: they will appear as a subtitled film and be stored \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we report work in designing a decision-making system that aims to support teachers in appropriating to their practice innovative scenarios that employ uses of information and communication technologies (ICT) in teaching and learning. To this end, we break down educational scenarios into micro-activities, and connect them to required and alternative infrastructure. We argue that micro-activities is a unit of analysis of educational scenarios that is compatible with the role of teachers as designers who select, decompose, combine, enact and revise different pieces of resources. This paper offers a reflective viewpoint on integrating ICT in existing scenarios and investigates how teaching objectives make use, or not, of the potential of digital technologies.",

            "Abstract": "All students of the Hellenic Open University (HOU) attend undergraduate and postgraduate courses at a distance. The lack of a live academic community is reported by many as a drawback in their studies. Systematic exploitation of new communication and collaboration technologies is desirable in the HOU but cannot be imposed universally as the average student\u2019s IT competence level is relatively low. In this work we present the methodology for the development of an integrated communication environment in which collaboration spaces serving as open communities play a key role in user engagement in the whole communication environment. To track and evaluate user participation we propose analytic metrics which, when combined with our detailed knowledge of the internal workings of user groups, provide concrete evaluation of the community online activity.",

            "Abstract": "Introducing semi-automatic teleoperation of an agricultural robotic system can enable improved performance, overcoming the complexity that current autonomous robots face due to the dynamic and unstructured agriculture environment. A teleoperated robot can both leverage the farmers\u2019 knowledge and experience while keeping them safe and also help the robot manage the unpredictability of the environment in the field. In this paper we describe the construction of such a teleoperated agricultural robot sprayer that is controlled through a Reality-Based Interaction interface. Two different user interfaces for teleoperating a vineyard spraying robot were experimentally evaluated. In the first condition, participants were provided with a single view (one camera) for teleoperating the robot, whereas in the second condition they had additional views (multiple cameras) supporting peripheral vision and targeted spraying. Analysis of the collected data showed that users in the additional views condition sprayed significantly more grapes and teleoperated the robot with significantly less collisions with obstacles, compared to users who did not have these aids, but also required significantly more time. Participants\u2019 perceived usability assessments were not affected by the availability of these additional views.",

            "Abstract": "Distance learning institutions need to find a way to transplant the benefits of conventional tutoring practices into the development of digital content that is conducive to students\u2019 learning needs. Therein lie two great challenges: promote real distance learning effectively and, at the same time, try to accommodate the ability of students to learn via collaboration. The authors have proposed the development of learner\u2019s open-and-distance-learning (ODL) courses as both a theoretical model and an applied methodology to be one of their key priorities and describe how this concept co-evolves with Web mining and institutional infrastructures to address the needs of emergent communities of practice within their university, primarily of students and secondarily of tutors.",

The paper reports on empirical findings derived from classroom interventions which were undertaken to investigate the impact of the proposed strategy. For each intervention, an adaptive e-course was developed and tested with encouraging results. Since the proposed strategy is descriptive in nature the paper can be used as the basis for future studies that validate it with other subject matters than those mentioned herein.",

A prototype of the spraying interface was developed and the usability of three different interaction modes was investigated. Fifty participants were asked to use the three devices to select grape clusters taken from a simulated robot moving along rows in a vineyard. Next, participants completed a questionnaire related to their user experience with the system. This paper presents the results of the statistical analysis of the log files and questionnaire responses to compare the three devices.",

Most schools, even in Cyprus, have their own web site showing information, while other schools employ online student management (or information) systems with specific levels of access by teachers, students and parents. In many cases, schools (or even teachers) use blogs, Facebook and Twitter accounts or even forums and email to communicate with families. All these approaches, even though commendable and with good results (according to research), take into account that (a) all parents can purchase or have access to a computer (b) all parents have the basic skills required to navigate through student management systems, reply to emails, post to forums or even navigate basic web pages. This research project will create an integrated online platform providing cloud-based serivces including an operating system and an optimised Graphic User Interface that will enable people with little to no skills and experience in using a computer, to collaborate and communicate with school personnel and other experts (ie psychologists), as well as participate in events organized by the school or by the Parent Teachers Association, in case it is extremely difficult or even impossible to attend the actual at-school event.",

This can lead to a considerable fluctuation of student populations within a programme\u2019s courses. The evolution of the student population may be an important factor in determining the academic viability of a programme as well as the resources that have to be budgeted and administered. Providing a method that estimates this population could be of substantial help to university management and academic personnel. We describe how course precedence constraints expressed in the Prolog language are used to calculate alternative tuition paths and we then use discrete Markov simulation with the Extend system to estimate future populations. In doing so, we identify key issues of the potential deployment of such a system at a large scale.",

The initially obtained set of 70 guidelines is grouped into eight categories: platform architecture and scalability, error prevention and recovery, visual design, information presentation, robot state awareness, interaction effectiveness and efficiency, robot environment/surroundings awareness, and cognitive factors. Agricultural robots were used as an application case study for implementation and field evaluation. The proposed guideline taxonomy was used heuristically to evaluate the usability of an existing user interface of a teleoperated agricultural robot.",

The goal of this article is to provide experimental evidence that different MSP algorithms are optimal in effectiveness and efficiency depending on context and user intention. A series of experiments with new algorithms were carried out. The experimental results demonstrate that spatial pointing efficacy is influenced by user, physical and computational context-aware aspects. We conclude that no algorithm is optimal for all application situations of digital pointing, whence MSP systems should be designed adaptively using context-aware \u2026",

Designing adaptive elearning activities should not add disproportionate technical difficulties to the task. IMS-Learning Design purports to provide a pedagogically neutral and technically smooth environment for the design of educationally rich, including adaptive, learning scenarios. However, although IMS-Learning Design has been effectively used for adaptive, web-based learning, most teachers and instructional designers consider it to be technically out of their reach. Two examples of IMS-Learning Design compliant adaptive web-based learning activities are presented in this paper to show that this is not really the case. Learner profiling and personalization is achieved in adaptive courseware compliant with the IMS-Learning Design specification, including a diagnostic learning style test and an educational recommender system. These components make use of the learning style and prior knowledge respectively, in order to adapt the presentation of the learning material and the feedback given to the learner.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a case study where twelve graduate students undertook the demanding role of the adaptive e-course developer and worked collaboratively on an authentic and complex design task in the context of open and distance tertiary education. The students had to work in groups in order to conceptualise and design a learning scenario for adaptive learning, develop learning materials and adaptive learning strategies, implement the respective adaptive e-course and finally, reflect on their experience. The primary goal of this intervention was to engage the students in the whole lifecycle of a Technology Enhanced Learning design artefact. In teaching highly complex skills for the ill-structured domain of Learning Design the four components instructional model (4C/ID) was exploited. Students were exposed to a wide range of interconnected issues and made design choices. Mixed research methods are used to conclude on the effectiveness of the intervention. Implications of this study include design guidelines towards an environment that implements complex adaptive behaviour in today's learner-generated digital world where Computer Supported Collaborative Learning often converges with Computer Supported Collaborative Design.",

            "Abstract": "We discuss an intervention in mother language instruction in a Greek Vocational Lyceum combining Web 2.0 tools with electronic writing pedagogy. During a full school year (2012-13), forty six 11th grade students with typically low literacy skills participated, randomly separated in control and experimental group. The latter systematically dealt with Technical Problem Solving and completed online (Edmodo) increasingly complex writing tasks. Encouraged to reflect on and solve technical problems, they activated language skills for communicating their solutions through the synthesis of technical text-genres. Meanwhile the control group followed the conventional teaching method using the usual literary texts. Pre and post-test measurements demonstrated that, while both groups improved, the experimental group made significantly more progress in their language efficiency and writing.",

Such robots exist, but they are not yet widespread. We believe that the limited usage of robotics in agriculture could be related to the fact that the mainstream direction for robotics in agriculture is full automation. The teleoperation of an agricultural robotic system can enable improved performance overcoming the complexity that current autonomous robots face due to the dynamic and unstructured agricultural environment. A field study was conducted to evaluate eight different user interfaces aiming to determine the factors that should be taken into consideration by designers while developing user interfaces for robot teleoperation in agriculture.

Specifically, these tools can be used in lesson planning to encourage the development of critical thinking in learners. In particular, a Cognitive Skill-based Question Wizard (CSQ-Wizard) is proposed as a supporting tool for teachers in their attempts to design appropriate lesson plans that can encourage the development of cognitive skills in learners. The design of this CSQ-Wizard is based on modern social and constructivist views of learning. The idea, the rationale, the architecture and the interface associated with the proposed CSQ-Wizard is presented through a specific example of possible implementation within LAMS; a web-based open source environment that supports Learning Design.",

            "Abstract": "Introducing semi-automatic teleoperation of an agricultural robotic system can enable improved performance overcoming the complexity that current autonomous robots face due to the dynamic and unstructured agriculture environment. This requires design of a human-robot interface. A user interface for a vineyard robotic sprayer was implemented including functions. The user interface incorporates several functions; robot navigation, target selection and spraying. Following examination of the user interface several usability limitations were identified. Semi-automatic teleoperation implies that the user is not collocated with the robot, and therefore, when designing a user interface several principles must be considered aiming to improve the usability of user interface. In the case of an interface for semi-automatic teleoperation in agricultural robotics, such principles include: visibility, safety, simplicity, feedback, extensibility, and cognitive load reduction. The contribution of this paper is to specify the design guidelines of a user interface for a human-robot cooperative, agricultural robot, in the case of vineyard spraying. Future work will include other interaction styles such as post-WIMP interfaces, within the framework of the AgriRobot project. This research also proposes a methodology to evaluate the usability of the user interface and to examine the human factors (eg, user awareness, user centered design, interaction styles, learnability) and human-robot interaction parameters (eg, level of autonomy, interaction roles).",

The suitability of texts for use in language teaching is defined by four parameters, which are described in detail in this article: text readability, content, genre, and grammatical information. The literature review shows the research gap as to the ways of finding on the Web a suitable text for use in language teaching according to specific characteristics. The tool diaKeimenou, which is presented in this article, aims to fill this gap and help the teacher choose the most suitable texts for teaching with reasonable effort and time. The results of the usability evaluation of diaKeimenou are also presented in this article.",

            "Abstract": "This paper attempts a historical overview of adaptive e-learning approaches through the lens of a well-known categorization, which distinguishes among the macro-adaptive approach, the aptitude\u2013treatment interaction approach, the micro-adaptive approach, and the constructivist\u2013collaborative approach. Early and more recent examples in each category are presented in order to conclude on similarities and differences among the approaches. The history of adaptive e-learning systems is discussed, and the main conclusion drawn is that, historically, the development of adaptive e-learning systems has followed the trends of education and cognitive science.",

            "Abstract": "We discuss some aspects of a pilot e-learning technical writing course addressed to 11th grade vocational high school students in Greece. The application of this alternative teaching intervention stemmed from the researcher- instructor's reflections relating to the integration of a problem based e-pedagogy that aims not just to familiarize students with some technical writing text-types, but to trigger a positive way of thinking and writing and thus enhance students' linguistic literacy. Can genuine interest to content learning (the school's vocational sectors and technical subjects) revert the negative attitude towards school writing activities? And what if the teachers, taking advantage of this interest, converted the conventional language lesson to a web mediated, e-learning problem based language course by engaging more energetic, student-centered teaching and learning approaches? The study showed that a \u2026",

The classification is based on six basic functions during the learning process: information storing/retrieving; written expression; communication and publication; experimentation including programming, simulation and virtual reality; administration; and what is today \u2018advanced usage\u2019. The paper also presents a brief overview of systems, tools and practices currently used in web-based education, including examples of actual usage characterized according to these learning process functions.

The hardware and the software modules that must be installed onto the system are described, with particular emphasis on human\u2013robot interaction. Details of the technology are given focusing on the user interface aspects. Two laboratory experiments and two studies in the field to evaluate the usability of the user interface provide evidence for the increased usability of a prototype robotic system. Specifically, the study aimed to empirically evaluate the type of target selection input device mouse and digital pen outperformed Wiimote in terms of usability. A field experiment evaluated the effect of three design factors: (a) type of screen output, (b) number of views, (c) type of robot control input device \u2026",

REVIT, an e-inclusion project, proved that e-learning courses can be designed, developed, and implemented to address the needs as these are described by the trainees themselves in an economically feasible, pedagogically sound, and technologically advanced way. The educational outcome of the project is not a \u201ctechie\u201d product threatening to alienate the intended audience. Rather, the medium becomes the message and in some cases the tool employed by the citizens of remote or insular areas to establish their own online communities. This is the value brought forward by the REVIT project.",
