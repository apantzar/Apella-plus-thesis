            "Abstract": "In this paper, we consider Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm for the single source single target shortest path problem in large sparse graphs. The goal is to reduce the response time for on-line queries by using precomputed information. Due to the size of the graph, preprocessing space requirements can be only linear in the number of nodes. We assume that a layout of the graph is given. In the preprocessing, we determine from this layout a geometric object for each edge containing all nodes that can be reached by a shortest path starting with that edge. Based on these geometric objects, the search space for on-line computation can be reduced significantly. Shortest path queries can then be answered by Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm restricted to edges where the corresponding geometric object contains the target. We present an extensive experimental study comparing the impact of different types of objects. The test data we use are real-world traffic networks, the typical field of application for this scenario. Furthermore, we present new algorithms as well as an empirical study for the dynamic case of this problem, where edge weights are subject to change and the geometric containers have to be updated. We evaluate the quality and the time for different update strategies that guarantee correct shortest paths. Finally, we present a software framework in C++ to realize the implementations of all of our variants of Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. A basic implementation of the algorithm is refined for each modification and\u2013even more importantly\u2013these modifications can be combined in any possible way without loss of efficiency.",

The mechanism protect the transfer and the exchange of the data that are delivered both between the services and the end user. The mechanism allows only authenticated content providers to register services and devices using the CGM tool. Security Mechanism is about protecting data, that is, how to prevent unauthorized access or damage to data that is in storage or in transit.In security terms, there are two important concepts: authentication and authorization. Understanding and the ways of implementing of these concepts can achieve the security effect of a project. Authentication is the way in which an entity (a user, an application, or a component) determines that another entity is who it claims to be.

Conducting experiments, we verify that the implemented structure outperforms other well-known hierarchical tree-based structures, since it provides better complexities regarding load-balancing operations. More specifically, the structure achieves a logarithmic amortized bound, using an efficient deterministic load-balancing mechanism, which is general enough to be applied to other hierarchical tree-based structures. Moreover, we investigate the structure's fault tolerance, which hasn't been sufficiently tackled in previous work, both theoretically and through rigorous experimentation.

The wide-scale and frequent adoption of web-based map services for route planning and driving directions, GPS navigation, and other location-based applications on large spatial network databases that we see today, has been enabled by and in turn motivated numerous research into accelerating such shortest path queries. In particular, the development of practical algorithms for route planning in transportation networks has been a showpiece application of successful algorithm engineering during the past decade, where experimental evaluation on real-world networks drives the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms in a continuous feedback loop. This has produced many speedup techniques, varying in preprocessing time, space, and query performance, but also simplicity and ease of implementation. Most approaches follow a similar paradigm: During preprocessing, auxiliary data is computed that is subsequently used to accelerate queries by pruning the search space that needs to be considered. Speedup techniques are so mature today that the fastest can answer a single query within only a few memory accesses, while retaining provable correctness of the results. Due to these successes, focus has shifted to \u2026",

In this work, we present a comprehensive experimental study of the algorithms applied to a large variety of graphs, where the main goal is to find separators that do not only satisfy upper bounds but also possess other desirable qualities with respect to separator size and component balance. We propose the usage of fundamental cycles, whose size is at most twice the diameter of the graph, as planar separators: For graphs of small diameter the guaranteed bound is better than the  bounds, and it turns out that this simple strategy almost always \u2026",

The resulting set is aggregated in the form of a time-dependent alternative graph and is characterized by minimum route overlap, small stretch factor, small size and low complexity. To our knowledge, this is the first work that deals with the time-dependent setting in the framework of alternative routes. Based on preprocessed minimum travel-time information between a small set of nodes and all other nodes in the graph, our algorithm carries out a collection phase for candidate alternative routes, followed by a pruning phase that cautiously discards uninteresting or low-quality routes from the candidate set. Our experimental evaluation on real time-dependent road networks demonstrates that the new algorithm performs much better (by one or two orders of magnitude) than existing baseline approaches. In particular, the entire alternative graph can be computed in less than 0.384 sec for the road network of Germany, and in less than 1.24 sec for that of Europe. Our approach provides also\" quick-and-dirty\" results of decent quality, in about 1/300 of the above mentioned query times for continental-size instances.",

In addition, an extensive experimental evaluation reveals further differences with respect to query performance. However, delays\u2013which occur very frequently in railway systems\u2013are not covered. In this work, we show how the time-dependent and the time-expanded models should be updated in order to capture delays. It turns out that delays can be incorporated in the time-dependent model without changing the topology of the network.

We have now models to represent timetables that allow us to answer queries for optimal journeys in a few milliseconds, also at a very large scale. Such models can be classified into two types: those representing the timetable as an array, and those representing it as a graph. Array-based models have been shown to be very effective in terms of query time, while graph-based ones usually answer queries by computing shortest paths, and hence they are suitable to be combined with the speed-up techniques developed for road networks.In this paper, we study the behavior of graph-based models in the prominent case of dynamic scenarios, i.e., when delays might occur to the original timetable.

Our oracle is based only on the sparsity of the network, along with two quite natural assumptions about travel-time functions which allow the smooth transition towards asymmetric and time-dependent distance metrics.",

In this article, we present a comprehensive experimental study of the classical algorithms applied to a large variety of graphs, where our main goal is to find separators that do not only satisfy upper bounds, but also possess other desirable characteristics with respect to separator size and component balance. We achieve this by investigating a number of specific alternatives for the concrete implementation and fine-tuning of certain parts of the classical algorithms.

We provide a new FPTAS for computing an approximate Pareto curve for multiobjective shortest paths that significantly improves upon previous approaches, especially in the case of more than two objective functions. We show how our new FPTAS can be used to provide better approximate solutions to three related problems (multiobjective constrained optimal paths, multiobjective constrained paths, and non-additive shortest paths) that have important applications in the areas of quality of service routing in communication networks, and in computing traffic equilibria in transportation networks. We also show how our new FPTAS for multiobjective shortest paths can provide efficient approximate solutions in a completely different context\u2013to a natural generalization of the weighted multicommodity flow problem with elastic demands and values that models several realistic design scenarios in transportation and communication networks. Finally, as a byproduct of our framework, we provide a generic method for constructing FPTAS for any multiobjective optimization problem with non-linear objective functions of a rather general form.",

Although desktop and high-end server security seems to be under control by the use of current security technology, securing the low-end embedded computing systems is a difficult long-term problem. This is mainly due to the fact that the embedded systems are constrained by their operational environment and the limited resources they are equipped with. Recent research activities focus on the deployment of lightweight cryptographic algorithms and security protocols that are well suited to the limited resources of low-end embedded systems. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) offers an interesting alternative to the classical public key cryptography for embedded systems (eg, RSA and ElGamal), since it uses smaller key sizes for achieving the same security level \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is one of the most promising alternatives to conventional public key cryptography, such as RSA and ElGamal, since it employs keys of smaller sizes for the same level of cryptographic strength. Smaller key sizes imply smaller hardware units for performing the arithmetic operations required by cryptographic protocols and, thus, ECC is an ideal candidate for implementation in embedded systems where the major computational resources (speed and storage) are limited. In this paper we present a port, written in ANSI C for maximum portability, of an open source ECC-based cryptographic library (ECC-LIB) to ATMEL's AT76C520 802.11 WLAN Access Point. One of the major features of this port, not found in similar ports, is that it supports Complex Multiplication (CM) for the construction of Elliptic Curves with good security properties. We present some experimental results that \u2026",

In this time-dependent alternative route scenario, we present a novel query algorithm, called Time-Dependent Alternative Graph (TDAG), that exploits the outcome of a time-consuming preprocessing phase to create a manageable amount of travel-time metadata, in order to provide answers for arbitrary alternative-routes queries, in only a few milliseconds for continental-size instances. The resulting set of alternative routes is aggregated in the form of a time-dependent alternative graph, which is characterized by the minimum route overlap, small stretch factor, small size, and low complexity. To our knowledge, this is the first work that deals with the time-dependent setting in the framework of alternative routes. The preprocessed metadata prescribe the minimum travel-time informations between a small set of \u201clandmark\u201d nodes and all other nodes in the graph. The TDAG query algorithm carries out the work in two distinct phases: initially, a collection phase constructs candidate alternative routes; consequently, a pruning phase cautiously discards uninteresting or low-quality routes from the candidate set. Our experimental evaluation on real-world, time-dependent road networks demonstrates that TDAG performed much better (by one or two orders of magnitude) than the existing baseline approaches.",

A crucial step of this method is to compute the roots of a special type of class field polynomials with the most commonly used being the Hilbert and Weber ones, uniquely determined by the CM discriminant D. In attempting to construct prime order ECs using Weber polynomials two difficulties arise (in addition to the necessary transformations of the roots of such polynomials to those of their Hilbert counterparts). The first one is that the requirement of prime order necessitates that D \u2261 3 (mod 8), which gives Weber polynomials with degree three times larger than the degree of their corresponding Hilbert polynomials (a fact that could affect efficiency). The second difficulty is that these Weber polynomials do not have roots in . In this paper we show how to overcome the above difficulties and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The problem of robust line planning requests for a set of origin-destination paths (lines) along with their traffic rates (frequencies) in an underlying railway network infrastructure, which are robust to fluctuations of real-time parameters of the solution. In this work, we investigate a variant of robust line planning stemming from recent regulations in the railway sector that introduce competition and free railway markets, and set up a new application scenario: there is a (potentially large) number of line operators that have their lines fixed and operate as competing entities struggling to exploit the underlying network infrastructure via frequency requests, while the management of the infrastructure itself remains the responsibility of a single (typically governmental) entity, the network operator. The line operators are typically unwilling to reveal their true incentives. Nevertheless, the network operator would like to ensure a fair (or, socially optimal) usage of the infrastructure, eg, by maximizing the (unknown to him) aggregate incentives of the line operators. We show that this can be accomplished in certain situations via a (possibly anonymous) incentive-compatible pricing scheme for the usage of the shared resources, that is robust against the unknown incentives and the changes in the demands of the entities. This brings up a new notion of robustness, which we call incentive-compatible robustness, that considers as robustness of the system its tolerance to the entities' unknown incentives and elasticity of demands, aiming at an eventual stabilization to an equilibrium point that is as close as possible to the social optimum.",

            "Abstract": "A novel landmark-based oracle (CFLAT) is presented, which provides earliest-arrival-time route plans in time-dependent road networks. To our knowledge, this is the first oracle that preprocesses combinatorial structures (collections of time-stamped min-travel-time-path trees) rather than travel-time functions. The preprocessed data structure is exploited by a new query algorithm (CFCA) which computes (and pays for it), apart from earliest-arrival-time estimations, the actual connecting path that preserves the theoretical approximation guarantees. To make it practical and tackle the main burden of landmark-based oracles (the large preprocessing requirements), CFLAT is extensively engineered. A thorough experimental evaluation on two real-world benchmark instances shows that CFLAT achieves a significant improvement on preprocessing, approximation guarantees and query-times, in comparison to previous landmark-based oracles, whose query algorithms do not account for the path construction. It also achieves competitive query-time performance and approximation guarantees compared to state-of-art speedup heuristics for time-dependent road networks, whose query-times in most cases do not account for path construction.",

We also investigate the efficiency of our variant when the computation of Weber polynomials should be made on-line due to limitations in resources (e.g., hardware devices of limited space).We present trade-offs that could be useful to potential implementors of elliptic curve cryptosystems on resource-limited hardware devices.",

This necessitates the development of context-aware services that hide the complexity of public transit networks while considering all available transportation modalities (e.g. bus, metro, tram, walking and cycling) in order to provide sophisticated route planning tailored to both residents and visitors of urban areas.

            "Abstract": "Many efforts have been done in the last decade to model public transport timetables in a graph theoretical framework. The aim is to represent a timetable as a graph so that an optimal route or itinerary is found by computing afterwards a shortest path in such a graph. One of the most used models is the so called time-expanded graph model. Its main drawback is that if the timetable changes (eg, due to a delay occurring in the network), the graph needs to be topologically updated. In this paper we propose a new model to represent the timetable of a public transportation system as a graph. Its main advantage is that it can be efficiently updated after a change in the timetable. In fact, it is based on a compact representation that allows us to update the graph by changing only few arc weights and does not require any topological modification.

We give algorithms that depend on the treewidth  of the input graph. When the treewidth is a constant, our algorithms can answer distance queries in O(\u03b1(n))  time after O(n)  preprocessing. This improves upon previously known results for the same problem. We also give a dynamic algorithm which, after a change in an edge weight, updates the data structure in time O(n  \u03b2  ) , for any constant 0 < \u03b2 < 1 . Furthermore, an algorithm of independent interest is given: computing a shortest path tree, or finding a negative cycle in linear time. ",

The model is characterized by the number of network nodes n, and two parameters f and g. Parameter f represents the probability of failure of an attack to a node and is a gross measure of the level of security of the attacked system and perhaps of the intruder\u2019s skills; g represents a limit on the number of attacks that the intrusion software can ever try, due to the danger of being discovered, when it issues them from a particular (broken) network node. The success of the attack scheme is characterized by two factors: the number of nodes captured (the spread factor) and the number of virtual links that a defense mechanism has to trace from any node where the attack is active to the origin of the intrusion (the traceability factor). The goal of an intruder is to maximize both factors. In our model we present four \u2026",

Scenarios where large numbers of on-line queries for shortest paths have to be processed in real-time appear for example in traffic information systems. In such systems, the techniques considered to speed up the shortest path computation are usually based on precomputed information. One approach proposed often in this context is a space reduction, where precomputed shortest paths are replaced by single edges with weight equal to the length of the corresponding shortest path. In this paper, we give a first systematic experimental study of such a space reduction approach. We introduce the concept of multi-level graph decomposition. For one specific application scenario from the field of timetable information in public transport, we perform a detailed analysis and experimental evaluation of shortest path computations \u2026",

The core of this preprocessing phase is based on a novel, quite efficient and simple one-to-all approximation method for creating approximations of shortest travel-time functions. We then propose three query algorithms, including a PTAS, to efficiently provide min-cost route plan responses to arbitrary queries.

We present in brief the theoretical algorithmic analysis, in which our proposed structure is based on, and we describe thoroughly the key aspects of the implementation. Conducting experiments, we verify that the implemented structure outperforms other well-known hierarchical tree-based structures, since it provides better complexities regarding load-balancing operations. More specifically, the structure achieves a logarithmic amortized bound, using an efficient deterministic load-balancing mechanism, which is general enough to be applied to other hierarchical tree-based structures. Moreover, we investigate the structure's fault tolerance, which hasn't been sufficiently tackled in previous work, both theoretically and through rigorous experimentation. We prove that D3-Tree is highly fault tolerant, since, even for massive node failures, it achieves a significant success rate in element queries. Afterwards we go one step further, in order to achieve sub-logarithmic complexity and propose the ART+ structure (Autonomous Range Tree), exploiting the excellent performance of D3-Tree. ART+ is a fully dynamic and fault-tolerant structure, which achieves sub-logarithmic performance for query and update operations and performs load-balancing in sub-logarithmic amortized cost.",

It turns out that the most crucial part of the implementation is the mapping of the logical processors to the physical processing nodes of the supercomputer. We achieve the requested efficient mapping through a new graph-theoretic result of independent interest: computing a Hamiltonian cycle on a directed hyper-torus.

The goal is to reduce the response time for on-line queries by using precomputed information. Due to the size of the graph, preprocessing space requirements can be only linear in the number of nodes. We assume that a layout of the graph is given. In the preprocessing, we determine from this layout a geometric object for each edge containing all nodes that can be reached by a shortest path starting with that edge. Based on these geometric objects, the search space for on-line computation can be reduced significantly. Shortest path queries can then be answered by Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm restricted to edges where the corresponding geometric object contains the target. We present an extensive experimental study comparing the impact of different types of objects. The test data we use are real-world traffic networks, the typical field of application for this scenario. Furthermore, we present new algorithms as well as an empirical study for the dynamic case of this problem, where edge weights are subject to change and the geometric containers have to be updated. We evaluate the quality and the time for different update strategies that guarantee correct shortest paths. Finally, we present a software framework in C++ to realize the implementations of all of our variants of Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. A basic implementation of the algorithm is refined for each modification and\u2013even more importantly\u2013these modifications can be combined in any possible way without loss of efficiency.",

MATDSP requires the computation of one time-dependent shortest-path tree (TDSPT) per origin-vertex and departure-time, from an arbitrary collection of pairs of origins and departure-times, towards all reachable destinations in the graph. Our goal is to explore the potential and highlight the limitations of amorphous data parallelism, when dealing with MATDSP in multicore computing environments with a given amount of processing elements and a shared memory to exploit. Apart from speeding-up execution time, consumption of resources (and energy) is also critical. Therefore, we aim at limiting the work overhead for solving a MATDSP instance, as measured by the overall number of arc relaxations in shortest-path computations, while trying to minimize the overall execution time. Towards this direction, we provide several algorithmic engineering interventions for solving MATDSP concerning:(i) the compact representation of the instance;(ii) the choice and the improvement of the time-dependent single-source shortest path algorithm that is used as a subroutine;(iii) the way according to which the overall work is allocated to the processing elements;(iv) the adoption of the amorphous data parallelism rationale, in order to avoid \u2026",

In the case of outerplanar digraphs, our data structures can be updated after any such change in only logarithmic time. A distance query is also answered in logarithmic time. In the case of planar digraphs, we give an interesting tradeoff between preprocessing, query, and update times depending on the value of a certain topological parameter of the graph.

In the time-expanded approach, every event at a station, e.g., the departure of a train, is modeled as a node in the graph, while in the time-dependent approach the graph contains only one node per station. Both approaches have been recently considered for (a simplified version of) the earliest arrival problem, but little is known about their relative performance. Thus far, there are only theoretical arguments in favor of the time-dependent approach. In this paper, we provide the first extensive experimental comparison of the two approaches. Using several real-world data sets, we evaluate the performance of the basic models and of several new extensions towards realistic modeling.

The load-balancing scheme of elements into nodes is deterministic and general enough to be applied to other hierarchical tree-based overlays.

All protocols are classified in the semi-compulsory, relay category according to which communication is achieved through a small team of mobile hosts, called the support, which move in a predetermined way and serves as an intermediate pool for receiving and delivering messages. We implement a new semi-compulsory, relay protocol in which the motion of the support is based on a so-called \u201chunter\u201d strategy developed for a pursuit-evasion game. We conduct an extensive, comparative experimental study of this protocol with other two existing protocols, each one possessing a different motion for its support. We considered several types of inputs, including among others two kinds of motion patterns (random and adversarial) for the mobile hosts not in the support. Our experiments showed that for all protocols the throughput scales almost linearly with the number of mobile hosts in the network, and that a small support size suffices for efficient communication. An interesting outcome is that in most cases the new protocol is inferior to the other two, although it has a global knowledge of the motion space.",

            "Abstract": "We present a cloud-based time-dependent routing service, which is a core component in providing efficient personalized renewable mobility services in smart cities. We describe the architecture of the time-dependent routing engine, consisting of a core routing module along with the so-called urban-traffic knowledge base, which creates, maintains and stores historic traffic data, as well as live traffic updates such as road blockages or unforeseen congestion. We also provide the crucial algorithmic details for providing the sought efficient time-dependent routing service. Our cloud-based time-dependent routing service exhibits an excellent practical behavior on a diversity (w.r.t. to scale and type) of real-world road networks.",

            "Abstract": "A fundamental approach in finding efficiently best routes or optimal itineraries in traffic information systems is to reduce the search space (part of graph visited) of the most commonly used shortest path routine (Dijkstra's algorithm) on a suitably defined graph. We investigate reduction of the search space while simultaneously retaining data structures, created during a preprocessing phase, of size linear (i.e., optimal) to the size of the graph. We show that the search space of Dijkstra's algorithm can be significantly reduced by extracting geometric information from a given layout of the graph and by encapsulating precomputed shortest-path information in resulted geometric objects (containers). We present an extensive experimental study comparing the impact of different types of geometric containers using test data from real-world traffic networks. We also present new algorithms as well as an empirical study for the \u2026",

The added features provide the tools to study wireless networks of high dynamics. TRAILS facilitates the implementation of advanced mobility patterns, obstacle presence and disaster scenarios, and failures injection that can dynamically change throughout the execution of the simulation. Moreover, we define a set of utilities that enhance the use of ns-2. This functionality is implemented in a simple and flexible architecture, that follows design patterns, object oriented and generic programming principles, maintaining a proper balance between reusability, extendability and ease of use. We evaluate the performance of TRAILS and show that it offers significant speed-ups regarding the \u2026",

Under this approach, we present a new semi-compulsory protocol called the runners in which the members of \u2211 perform concurrent and continuous random walks and exchange any information given to them by senders when they meet. We also conduct a comparative experimental study of the runners protocol with another existing semi-compulsory protocol, called the snake, in which the members of \u2211 move in a coordinated way and always remain pairwise adjacent. The experimental evaluation has been carried out in a new generic framework that we developed to implement protocols for mobile computing. Our \u2026",

Examples of scheduled transportation include bus, ferry, airline, and railway networks, with the latter being a prime application domain that provides a fair amount of the most complex and largest instances of such optimization problems. Scheduled transport optimization deals with planning and scheduling problems over several time horizons, and substantial progress has been made for strategic planning and scheduling problems in all transportation domains. This state-of-the-art survey presents the outcome of an open call for contributions asking for either research papers or state-of-the-art survey articles. We received 24 submissions that underwent two rounds of the standard peer-review process, out of which 18 were finally accepted for publication. The volume is organized in four parts: Robustness and Recoverability, Robust Timetabling and Route Planning, Robust Planning Under Scarce Resources, and Online Planning: Delay and Disruption Management.",

Our approach is the first one that concerns the dynamic maintenance of a large-scale graph with ordered elements using a contiguous memory part, and which allows an arbitrary online reordering of its elements.",

An important feature of our algorithms is that they can work in a dynamic environment, where the cost of any edge can be changed or the edge can be deleted. In the case of outerplanar digraphs, our data structures can be updated after any such change in only logarithmic time. A distance query is also answered in logarithmic time. In the case of planar digraphs, we give an interesting tradeoff between preprocessing, query, and update times depending on the value of a certain topological parameter of the graph. Our results can be extended to n-vertex digraphs of genus O (n1\u2212 \u03b5) for any \u03b5> 0.\u201d",

We also considered simple-minded algorithms that were easy to implement and likely to be fast in practice. Wetested and compared the above implementations on random inputs, on non-random inputs that are worst-case inputs for the dynamic algorithms, and on an input motivated by a real-world graph.",
