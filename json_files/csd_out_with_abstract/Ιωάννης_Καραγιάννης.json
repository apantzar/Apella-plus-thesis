            "Abstract": "We study the problem of {\\em impartial selection}, a topic that lies at the intersection of computational social choice and mechanism design. The goal is to select the most popular individual among a set of community members. The input can be modeled as a directed graph, where each node represents an individual, and a directed edge indicates nomination or approval of a community member to another. An {\\em impartial mechanism} is robust to potential selfish behavior of the individuals and provides appropriate incentives to voters to report their true preferences by ensuring that the chance of a node to become a winner does not depend on its outgoing edges. The goal is to design impartial mechanisms that select a node with an in-degree that is as close as possible to the highest in-degree. We measure the efficiency of such a mechanism by the difference of these in-degrees, known as its {\\em additive} approximation. In particular, we study the extent to which prior information on voters' preferences could be useful in the design of efficient deterministic impartial selection mechanisms with good additive approximation guarantees. We consider three models of prior information, which we call the {\\em opinion poll}, the {\\em a prior popularity}, and the {\\em uniform} model. We analyze the performance of a natural selection mechanism that we call {\\em approval voting with default} (AVD) and show that it achieves a  additive guarantee for opinion poll and a  for a priori popularity inputs, where  is the number of individuals. We consider this polylogarithmic bound as our main technical contribution. We complement this last result by \u2026",

Nodes correspond to points on the plane and each uses a directional antenna modeled by a sector with a given angle and radius. The connectivity problem is to decide whether or not it is possible to orient the antennas so that the directed graph induced by the node transmissions is strongly connected. We present algorithms for simple polynomial-time-solvable cases of the problem, show that the problem is NP-complete in the -dimensional case when the sector angle is small, and present algorithms that approximate the minimum radius to achieve connectivity for sectors with a given angle. We also discuss several extensions to related problems. To the best of our knowledge, the problem has not been studied before in the literature.",

Each client has a particular latency requirement at each server and may choose either to be assigned to some server in order to get serviced provided that her latency requirement is met, or not to participate in the assignment at all. From a global perspective, in order to optimize the performance of such a system, one would aim to maximize the number of clients that participate in the assignment. However, clients may behave selfishly in the sense that, each of them simply aims to participate in an assignment and get serviced by some server where her latency requirement is met with no regard to overall system performance. We model this selfish behavior as a strategic game, show how to compute pure Nash equilibria efficiently, and assess the impact of selfishness on system performance. We also show that the problem of optimizing performance is \u2026",

Specifically, we are interested in Nash equilibria that are obtained via sequences of rational strategic moves.

            "Abstract": "Social networks on the Internet have seen an enormous growth recently and play a crucial role in different aspects of today's life. They have facilitated information dissemination in ways that have been beneficial for their users but they are often used strategically in order to spread information that only serves the objectives of particular users. These properties have inspired a revision of classical opinion formation models from sociology using game-theoretic notions and tools. We follow the same modeling approach, focusing on scenarios where the opinion expressed by each user is a compromise between her internal belief and the opinions of a small number of neighbors among her social acquaintances. We formulate simple games that capture this behavior and quantify the inefficiency of equilibria using the well-known notion of the price of anarchy. Our results indicate that compromise comes at a cost that strongly depends on the neighborhood size.",

We consider two different scenarios. In selfish load balancing, each client is selfish in the sense that it chooses, among its permissible servers, to run its job on the server having the smallest latency given the assignments of the jobs of other clients to servers. In online load balancing, clients appear online and, when a client appears, it has to make an irrevocable decision and assign its job to one of its permissible servers. Here, we assume that the clients aim to optimize some global criterion but in an online fashion. A natural local optimization criterion that can be used by each client when making its decision is to assign its job to that server that gives the minimum increase of the global objective. This gives rise to greedy online \u2026",

We present a broad class of coordination mechanisms for unrelated machine scheduling that are simple to define and we identify one of its members (mechanism DCOORD) that is superior to all known mechanisms. In particular, DCOORD induces potential games with logarithmic price of anarchy and only constant price of stability. Both bounds are almost optimal.",

Although Dodgson\u2019s rule is one of the most well-studied voting rules, it suffers from serious deficiencies, both from the computational point of view\u2014it is NP-hard even to approximate the Dodgson score within sublogarithmic factors\u2014and from the social choice point of view\u2014it fails basic social choice desiderata such as monotonicity and homogeneity. However, this does not preclude the existence of approximation algorithms for Dodgson that are monotonic or homogeneous, and indeed it is natural to ask whether such algorithms exist.In this article, we give definitive answers to these questions. We design a monotonic exponential-time algorithm that yields a 2-approximation to the Dodgson score, while matching this result with a tight lower bound.

In our setting, samples are supplied by strategic agents, who wish to pull the estimate as close as possible to their own value. In this setting, the sample mean gives rise to manipulation opportunities, whereas the sample median does not. Our key question is whether the sample median is the best (in terms of mean squared error) truthful estimator of the population mean. We show that when the underlying distribution is symmetric, there are truthful estimators that dominate the median. Our main result is a characterization of worst-case optimal truthful estimators, which provably outperform the median, for possibly asymmetric distributions with bounded support.",

            "Abstract": "We present a new approximation algorithm for the Minimum Energy Broadcast Routing (MEBR) problem in ad hoc wireless networks that achieves an exponentially better approximation factor compared to the well-known Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) heuristic. Namely, for any instance where a minimum spanning tree of the set of stations is guaranteed to cost at most \u03c1 \u2265 2 times the cost of an optimal solution for MEBR, we prove that our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio bounded by 2ln\u03c1-2 ln 2 + 2. This result is particularly relevant for its consequences on Euclidean instances where we significantly improve previous results. In this respect, our experimental analysis confirms the better performance of the algorithm also in practice.",

            "Abstract": "We study the PAC learnability of multiwinner voting, focusing on the class of approval-based committee scoring (ABCS) rules. These are voting rules applied on profiles with approval ballots, where each voter approves some of the candidates. ABCS rules adapt positional scoring rules in single-winner voting by assuming that each committee of  candidates collects from each voter a score, that depends on the size of the voter's ballot and on the size of its intersection with the committee. Then, committees of maximum score are the winning ones. Our goal is to learn a target rule (i.e., to learn the corresponding scoring function) using information about the winning committees of a small number of sampled profiles. Despite the existence of exponentially many outcomes compared to single-winner elections, we show that the sample complexity is still low: a polynomial number of samples carries enough information for learning the target committee with high confidence and accuracy. Unfortunately, even simple tasks that need to be solved for learning from these samples are intractable. We prove that deciding whether there exists some ABCS rule that makes a given committee winning in a given profile is a computationally hard problem. Our results extend to the class of sequential Thiele rules, which have received attention due to their simplicity.",

            "Abstract": "When a company undergoes a merger or transfer of its ownership, the existing governing body has an opinion on which buyer should take over as the new owner. Similar situations occur while assigning the host of big sports tournaments, eg, the World Cup or the Olympics. In all these settings, the values of the external bidders are as important as the internal experts\u2019 opinions. Motivated by such questions, we consider a social welfare maximizing approach to design and analyze truthful mechanisms in these settings. We consider the problem with one expert and two bidders and provide tight approximation guarantees of the optimal social welfare. Since this problem is a combination of mechanism design with and without monetary transfers (payments can be imposed to the bidders but not to the expert), classical solutions like VCG cannot be applied, making this a unique mechanism design problem. We distinguish between mechanisms that use ordinal and cardinal information, as well as between mechanisms that base their decisions on one of the two sides (either the bidders or the expert) or both. Our analysis shows that the cardinal setting is quite rich and admits several nontrivial randomized truthful mechanisms, and also allows for closer-to-optimal-welfare guarantees.",

For many reasons one might consider mechanisms, or social choice functions, that only have access to the ordinal rankings of alternatives by the individual agents rather than their utility functions. In this context, one possible objective for a social choice function is the maximization of (expected) social welfare relative to the information contained in these rankings. We study such optimal social choice functions under three different models, and underscore the important role played by scoring functions. In our worst-case model, no assumptions are made about the underlying distribution and we analyze the worst-case distortion\u2014or degree to which the selected alternative does not maximize social welfare\u2014of optimal (randomized) social choice functions.

We demonstrate that whereas some of the positive axiomatic and computational results extend to this more general setting, others do not.

Our objective is to extend the original game so that selfish behavior does not deteriorate performance.

The problem is known as load balancing under the Lp norm. We present an improved upper bound for the greedy algorithm through simple analysis; this bound is also shown to be best possible within the class of deterministic online algorithms for the problem. We also address the question whether randomization helps online load balancing under Lp norms on unrelated machines; this is a challenging question which is open for more than a decade even for the L2 norm. We provide a positive answer to this question by presenting the first randomized online algorithms which outperform deterministic ones under any (integral) Lp norm for p= 2,..., 137. Our algorithms essentially compute in an online manner a fractional solution to the problem and use the fractional values to make random choices. The local optimization criterion used at each step is novel and rather counterintuitive: the values of the fractional variables for each job correspond to flows at an approximate Wardrop equilibrium for an appropriately defined non-atomic congestion game. As corollaries of our analysis and by exploiting the relation between the Lp norm and the makespan of machine loads, we obtain new competitive algorithms for online makespan minimization, making progress in another longstanding open problem.",

We make significant progress in this direction. We show that for every instance with additive valuations, there is an EFX allocation of a subset of items with a Nash welfare that is at least half of the maximum possible Nash welfare for the original set of items. That is, after donating some items to a charity, one can distribute the remaining items in a fair way with high efficiency. This bound is proved to be best possible.

According to such grading schemes, each student receives a few assignments (by other students) which she has to rank. Then, a global ranking (possibly translated into numerical scores) is produced by combining the individual ones. This is a novel application area for social choice concepts and methods where the important problem to be solved is as follows: how should the assignments be distributed so that the collected individual rankings can be easily merged into a global one that is as close as possible to the ranking that represents the relative performance of the students in the assignment? Our main theoretical result suggests that using very simple ways to distribute the assignments so that each student has to rank only  of them, a Borda-like aggregation method can recover a  fraction of the true ranking when each student correctly ranks the assignments she receives. Experimental results strengthen our analysis further and also demonstrate that the same method is extremely robust even when students have imperfect capabilities as graders. We believe that our results provide strong evidence that ordinal peer grading can be a highly effective and scalable solution for evaluation in MOOCs.",

(2007) [11] and Varian (2007) [36] show that an efficient equilibrium always exists in the full information setting. Their results, however, do not extend to the case with uncertainty, where efficient equilibria might not exist.In this paper we study the space of equilibria in GSP, and quantify the efficiency loss that can arise in equilibria under a wide range of sources of uncertainty, as well as in the full information setting. The traditional Bayesian game models uncertainty in the valuations (types) of the participants. The Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction gives rise to a further form of uncertainty: the selection of quality factors resulting in uncertainty about the behavior of the underlying \u2026",

A partition scheme  consists of a partition  for each row i of A. The partition  acts as a smoothing operator on row i that distributes the expected value of each partition subset proportionally to all its entries. Given a scheme B that induces a smooth matrix , the partition value is the expected maximum column entry of .

The task is, given a directed graph representing nominations to the members of a community by other members, to select the member with the highest number of nominations. This seemingly trivial goal becomes challenging when there is an additional impartiality constraint, requiring that no single member can influence her chance of being selected. Recent progress has identified impartial selection rules with optimal approximation ratios. Moreover, it was noted that worst-case instances are graphs with few vertices. Motivated by this fact, we propose the study of additive approximation, the difference between the highest number of nominations and the number of nominations of the selected member, as an alternative measure of the quality of impartial selection.Our positive results include two randomized impartial selection \u2026",

Dipaths represent communication requests, while colors correspond to wavelengths that must be assigned to requests so that multiple users can communicate simultaneously through the same optical fiber. Recent work on wavelength routing in trees has studied a special class of algorithms which are called greedy. Although these algorithms are simple and implementable in a distributed setting, it has been proved that there are cases where a bandwidth utilization of 100% is not possible.

We explore inherent limitations of this model; in particular, we show that the famous Gibbard--Satterthwaite impossibility result holds even if a manipulator can only lie by swapping two adjacent alternatives in his vote. Motivated by these negative results, we then introduce a richer model of verification, which we term mechanism design with probabilistic verification.

            "Abstract": "With very few exceptions, recent research in fair division has mostly focused on deterministic allocations. Deviating from this trend, we study the fairness notion of interim envy-freeness (iEF) for lotteries over allocations, which serves as a sweet spot between the too stringent notion of ex-post envy-freeness and the very weak notion of ex-ante envy-freeness. iEF is a natural generalization of envy-freeness to random allocations in the sense that a deterministic envy-free allocation is iEF (when viewed as a degenerate lottery). It is also certainly meaningful as it allows for a richer solution space, which includes solutions that are provably better than envy-freeness according to several criteria. Our analysis relates iEF to other fairness notions as well, and reveals tradeoffs between iEF and efficiency. Even though several of our results apply to general fair division problems, we are particularly interested in instances with equal numbers of agents and items where allocations are perfect matchings of the items to the agents. Envy-freeness can be trivially decided and (when it can be achieved, it) implies full efficiency in this setting. Although computing iEF allocations in matching allocation instances is considerably more challenging, we show how to compute them in polynomial time, while also maximizing several efficiency objectives. Our algorithms use the ellipsoid method for linear programming and efficient solutions to a novel variant of the bipartite matching problem as a separation oracle. We also study the extension of interim envy-freeness notion when payments to or from the agents are allowed. We present a series of results on two optimization \u2026",

These models take as input a ground truth committee and return random approval votes to be thought of as noisy estimates of the ground truth. A minimum robustness requirement for an approval-based multiwinner voting rule is to return the ground truth when applied to profiles with sufficiently many noisy votes. Our results indicate that approval-based multiwinner voting can indeed be robust to reasonable noise. We further refine this finding by presenting a hierarchy of rules in terms of how robust to noise they are.",

In all these cases, the individual inputs provided by each program committee member, society member, or student have to be aggregated in order to get the final result.The challenge that needs to be addressed is to guarantee an as high as possible level of effectiveness in the evaluation outcome, given that the individual inputs will be, in general, partial and inaccurate. Typically, the number of submissions in a big scientific conference is a few thousand (eg, more than 2,000 papers were submitted in the last AAAI and IJCAI conferences). Of course, there is no single program committee member that has a complete view of all submitted papers. Instead, each PC member is given very few papers for review. The source of inaccuracy should be clear in the case of students who grade their peers in an online course but it can be a severe problem even among experts. In a recent experiment, 1 the organizers of the NIPS 2014 conference formed two independent program committees.

The second one is a local search heuristic which can use the outcome of our first algorithm as an initial solution and further improve it. We have applied our algorithms on inputs that have been produced by well-known random models for the generation of social networks as well as on inputs that use real social networks. Our algorithms can tolerate noise at the level of up to 10%. Interestingly, our results provide further evidence to which graph generation models are most suitable for modeling social networks and distinguish them from unrealistic ones.",

Motivated by such systems, we consider a setting where each worker is asked to rank a fixed (small) number of alternatives and, then, a positional scoring rule is used to compute the aggregate ranking. Among the apparently infinite such rules, what is the best one to use? To answer this question, we assume that we have partial access to an underlying true ranking. Then, the important optimization problem to be solved is to compute the positional scoring rule whose outcome, when applied to the profile of individual rankings, is as close as possible to the part of the underlying true ranking we know. We study this fundamental problem from a theoretical viewpoint and present positive and negative complexity results and, furthermore, complement \u2026",

Given a set of paths P on a graph G, the path coloring problem is to color the paths of P so that no two paths traversing the same edge of G are assigned the same color and the total number of colors used is minimized. The problem has been proved to be NP-hard even for trees and rings.Using optimal solutions to fractional path coloring, a natural relaxation of path coloring, on which we apply a randomized rounding technique combined with existing coloring algorithms, we obtain new upper bounds on the minimum number of colors sufficient to color any set of paths on any graph. The upper bounds are either existential or constructive.The existential upper bounds significantly improve existing ones provided that the cost of the optimal fractional path coloring is sufficiently \u2026",

Classic cake cutting protocols are susceptible to manipulation. Do their strategic outcomes still guarantee fairness? To address this question we adopt a novel algorithmic approach, proposing a concrete computational model and reasoning about the game-theoretic properties of algorithms that operate in this model. Specifically, we show that each protocol in the class of generalized cut and choose (GCC) protocols---which includes the most important discrete cake cutting protocols---is guaranteed to have approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria, or even exact equilibria if the protocol's tie-breaking rule is flexible. We further observe that the (approximate) equilibria of proportional protocols---which guarantee each of the n agents a 1/n-fraction of the cake---must be (approximately) proportional, thereby answering the above question in the positive (at least for one common notion of fairness).",

            "Abstract": "When a company undergoes a merger or transfers its ownership, the existing governing body has an opinion on which buyer should take over as the new owner. Similar situations occur while assigning the host of big sports tournaments, like the World Cup or the Olympics. In all these settings, the values of the external bidders are as important as the opinions of the internal experts. Motivated by such scenarios, we consider a social welfare maximizing approach to design and analyze truthful mechanisms in {\\em hybrid social choice} settings, where payments can be imposed to the bidders, but not to the experts. Since this problem is a combination of mechanism design with and without monetary transfers, classical solutions like VCG cannot be applied, making this a novel mechanism design problem. We consider the simple but fundamental scenario with one expert and two bidders, and provide tight approximation guarantees of the optimal social welfare. We distinguish between mechanisms that use ordinal and cardinal information, as well as between mechanisms that base their decisions on one of the two sides (either the bidders or the expert) or both. Our analysis shows that the cardinal setting is quite rich and admits several non-trivial randomized truthful mechanisms, and also allows for closer-to-optimal welfare guarantees.",

Deviating from this trend, we define and study the novel notion of interim envy-freeness (iEF) for lotteries over allocations, which aims to serve as a sweet spot between the too stringent notion of ex-post envy-freeness and the very weak notion of ex-ante envy-freeness. Our new fairness notion is a natural generalization of envy-freeness to random allocations in the sense that a deterministic envy-free allocation is iEF (when viewed as a degenerate lottery). It is also certainly meaningful as it allows for a richer solution space, which includes solutions that are provably better than envy-freeness according to several criteria. Our analysis relates iEF to other fairness notions as well, and reveals tradeoffs between iEF and efficiency.

Pure Nash equilibria in a game characterize situations with non-cooperative deterministic players in which no player has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from the current situation in order to achieve a higher payoff. Unfortunately, it is well known that there are games that do not have pure Nash equilibria. Furhermore, even in games where the existence of equilibria is guaranteed, their computation can be a computationally hard task. Such negative results significantly question the importance of pure Nash equilibria as solution concepts that characterize the behavior of rational players. Approximate pure Nash equilibria, which characterize situations where no player can significantly improve her payoff by unilaterally deviating from her current strategy, could serve as alternative solution concepts provided \u2026",

In weighted congestion games with linear latency functions, the existence of pure Nash equilibria is guaranteed by a potential function argument. Unfortunately, this proof of existence is inefficient and computing pure Nash equilibria in such games is a PLS-hard problem even when all players have unit weights. The situation gets worse when superlinear (e.g., quadratic) latency functions come into play; in this case, the Nash dynamics of the game may contain cycles and pure Nash equilibria may not even exist. Given these obstacles, we consider approximate pure Nash equilibria as alternative solution concepts.

We are interested in the minimax approval voting rule in which the outcome represents a compromise among the voters, in the sense that the maximum distance between the preference of any voter and the outcome is as small as possible. This voting rule has two main drawbacks. First, computing an outcome that minimizes the maximum distance is computationally hard. Furthermore, any algorithm that always returns such an outcome provides incentives to voters to misreport their true preferences. In order to circumvent these drawbacks, we consider approximation algorithms, ie, algorithms that produce an outcome that approximates the minimax distance for any given instance. Such algorithms can be considered as alternative voting rules. We present a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm that uses a natural linear programming relaxation for the underlying optimization problem and deterministically rounds the fractional solution in order to compute the outcome; this result improves upon the previously best known algorithm that has an approximation ratio of 3. We are furthermore interested in approximation algorithms that are resistant to manipulation by (coalitions of) voters, ie, algorithms that do not motivate voters to misreport their true preferences in order to improve their distance from the outcome.

            "Abstract": "We study communication problems in wireless networks supporting multiple interfaces. In such networks, two nodes can communicate if they are close enough and share a common interface. The activation of each interface has a cost reflecting the energy consumed when a node uses this interface. We distinguish between the homogeneous and heterogeneous case, depending on whether all nodes have the same activation cost for each interface or not. For the homogeneous case, we present a (3/2+\u03f5)-approximation algorithm for the problem of achieving connectivity with minimum activation cost, improving a previous bound of 2. For the heterogeneous case, we show that the connectivity problem is not approximable within a sublogarithmic factor in the number of nodes and present a logarithmic approximation algorithm for a more general problem that models group communication.",

We argue that this is too stringent a requirement, and instead ask: How many votes does a voting rule need to reconstruct the true ranking? We define the family of pairwise-majority consistent rules, and show that for all rules in this family the number of samples required from the Mallows noise model is logarithmic in the number of alternatives, and that no rule can do asymptotically better (while some rules like plurality do much worse). Taking a more normative point of view, we consider voting rules that surely return the true ranking as the number of samples tends to infinity (we call this property accuracy in the limit); this allows us to move to a higher level of abstraction.

            "Abstract": "We study the problem of allocating optical bandwidth to sets of communication requests in all--optical networks that utilize Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). WDM technology establishes communication between pairs of network nodes by establishing transmitter--receiver paths and assigning wavelengths to each path so that no two paths going through the same fiber link use the same wavelength. Optical bandwidth is the number of distinct wavelengths. Since state--of--the--art technology allows for a limited number of wavelengths, the engineering problem to be solved is to establish communication between pairs of nodes so that the total number of wavelengths used is minimized; this is known as the wavelength routing problem. In this paper, we survey recent advances in bandwidth allocation in tree--shaped WDM all--optical networks:--We present hardness results and lower bounds for the general problem and the special case of symmetric communication.--We give the main ideas of deterministic greedy algorithms and study their limitations.--We demonstrate how we can achieve optimal and nearly--optimal bandwidth utilization in networks with wavelength converters using simple algorithms.--We also present recent results about the use of randomization for wavelength routing. 1",

The agent valuations for different pieces of cake are typically assumed to be additive. However, in certain practical settings this assumption is invalid because agents may not have positive value for arbitrarily small\" crumbs\" of cake. In this paper, we propose a new, more expressive model of agent valuations that captures this feature. We present an approximately proportional algorithm for any number of agents that have such expressive valuations. The algorithm is optimal in the sense that no other algorithm can guarantee a greater worst-case degree of proportionality. We also design an optimal approximately proportional and fully envy-free algorithm for two agents.",

A well-established approach -- which we refer to as implicit utilitarian voting -- assumes that voters have latent utility functions that induce the reported rankings, and seeks voting rules that approximately maximize utilitarian social welfare. We extend this approach to the design of rules that select a subset of alternatives. We derive analytical bounds on the performance of optimal (deterministic as well as randomized) rules in terms of two measures, distortion and regret. Empirical results show that regret-based rules are more compelling than distortion-based rules, leading us to focus on developing a scalable implementation for the optimal (deterministic) regret-based rule. Our methods underlie the design and implementation of RoboVote.org, a not-for-profit website that helps users make group decisions via AI-driven voting methods.",

The mechanism allocates to each user a fraction of the resource that is proportional to her bid and collects an amount equal to her bid as payment. Since users act as utility-maximizers, this naturally defines a proportional allocation game. Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) quantified the inefficiency of equilibria in this game with respect to the social welfare and presented a lower bound of 26.8 % on the price of anarchy over coarse-correlated and Bayes-Nash equilibria in the full and incomplete information settings, respectively. In this paper, we improve this bound to 50 % over both equilibrium concepts. Our analysis is simpler and, furthermore, we argue that it cannot be improved by arguments that do not take the equilibrium structure \u2026",

In case of a tie, the agent does not change her current preference. A profile of the agents\u2019 preferences is stable if the each agent\u2019s preference coincides with the preference of at least half of the neighbors (thus, the system is in equilibrium).We ask whether there are network topologies that are robust to social pressure.

It uses an embedding of the nodes of a network into points of a space (eg, R d) equipped with a distance function (eg, the Euclidean distance \u2113 2) and uses as address of each node the coordinates of the corresponding point. The embedding has particular properties so that the routing decision for a packet is taken greedily based only on the addresses of the current node, its neighbors, and the destination node and the distances of the corresponding points. In this way, there is no need to keep extensive routing information (eg, routing tables) at the nodes. Embeddings that allow for this functionality are called greedy embeddings. Even though greedy embeddings do exist for several spaces and distance functions, they usually result in paths of high stretch, ie, significantly longer than the corresponding shortest paths.

Our results demonstrate that there exists a greedy hot-potato routing algorithm that is stable for all greedy injection queueing protocols for injection rates very close to 100% of the network capacity. Furthermore, according to the algorithms we studied, we can claim that the one-pass property is not appropriate for the dynamic case, since the system cannot achieve stability at high injection rates.",

Its advocates support that by allowing voters to delegate their vote to more informed voters can result in better decisions. In an attempt to evaluate the validity of such claims, we study liquid democracy as a means to discover an underlying ground truth. We revisit a recent model by Kahng et al.[2018] and conclude with three negative results, criticizing an important assumption of their modeling, as well as liquid democracy more generally. In particular, we first identify cases where natural local mechanisms are much worse than either direct voting or the other extreme of full delegation to a common dictator. We then show that delegating to less informed voters may considerably increase the chance of discovering the ground truth. Finally, we show that deciding delegations that maximize the probability to find the ground truth is a computationally hard problem.",

An allocation of indivisible items to agents is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of any other agent to his own in terms of value. As envy-freeness is rarely a feasible goal, there is a recent focus on relaxations of its definition. An approach in this direction is to complement allocations with payments (or subsidies) to the agents. A feasible goal then is to achieve envy-freeness in terms of the total value an agent gets from the allocation and the subsidies. We consider the natural optimization problem of computing allocations that are {\\em envy-freeable} using the minimum amount of subsidies. As the problem is NP-hard, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms. On the positive side, we present an algorithm that, for a constant number of agents, approximates the minimum amount of subsidies within any required accuracy, at the expense of a graceful increase in the running time. On the negative side, we show that, for a super-constant number of agents, the problem of minimizing subsidies for envy-freeness is not only hard to compute exactly (as a folklore argument shows) but also, more importantly, hard to approximate.",

The assignment of advertisers to slots depends on the bids they submit; these bids may be different than the true valuations of the advertisers for the slots. Variants of the celebrated VCG auction mechanism guarantee that advertisers act truthfully and, under some assumptions, lead to revenue or social welfare maximization.

In such networks, many users within the same geographical region (cell) can communicate simultaneously with other users of the network using distinct frequencies. The spectrum of the available frequencies is limited; thus, e cient solutions to the call control problem are essential. The objective of the call control problem is, given a spectrum of available frequencies and users that wish to communicate, to maximize the bene t, ie, the number of users that communicate without signal interference. In previous work 4, 5], the authors study the performance of algorithm p {Random; an intuitive on-line randomized call control algorithm for wireless cellular networks where each cell is a regular hexagon. In practice, however, at least parts of the network are expected to be sparser and irregular. In the present work, we extend previous work on randomized call-control focusing on sparse wireless networks with irregular cell shape and small degree (three or four). We prove analytical upper bounds on the competitive ratio (de ned as the maximum over all possible sequences of calls of the ratio of the bene t of the algorithm over the ratio of the optimal o-line algorithm) of algorithm p {Random against oblivious adversaries as a function of the parameter p. Optimizing the upper bound function, we prove that algorithm p {Random is 9= 4 {and 2: 651 {competitive on sparse wireless cellular networks supporting one frequency of degree three and four, respectively.

            "Abstract": "Recently, much attention has been devoted to discrete preference games to model the formation of opinions in social networks. More specifically, these games model the agents\u2019 strategic decision of expressing publicly an opinion, which is a result of an interplay between the agent\u2019s private belief and the social pressure. However, these games have very limited expressive power; they can model only very simple social relations and they assume that all the agents respond to social pressure in the same way. In this paper, we define and study the novel class of generalized discrete preference games. These games have additional characteristics that can model social relations to allies or competitors and complex relations among more than two agents. Moreover, they introduce different levels of strength for each relation, and they personalize the dependence of each agent to her neighborhood. We show that these novel games admit generalized ordinal potential functions and, more importantly, that every two-strategy game that admits a generalized ordinal potential function is structurally equivalent to a generalized discrete preference game. This implies that the games in this novel class capture the full generality of two-strategy games in which the existence of (pure) equilibria is guaranteed by topological arguments.",

Rules in this family are given by a scoring vector (such as plurality or Borda) associating a positive value with each rank in a vote, and an aggregation function such as leximin or the Nash product. Our family contains well-studied rules, but most are new. We discuss computational and normative properties of our rules. We focus on fairness, and introduce the SD-core, a group fairness notion.

In this paper, we consider the natural scenario in which the connectivity requirements are posed by selfish users who have agreed to share the cost of the network to be established according to a well-defined rule. The design proposed by the network designer should now be consistent not only with the connectivity requirements but also with the selfishness of the users.

The problem has been proved to be NP-hard even for trees and rings. Using optimal solutions to fractional path coloring, a natural relaxation of path coloring, on which we apply a randomized rounding technique combined with existing coloring algorithms, we obtain new upper bounds on the minimum number of colors sufficient to color any set of paths on any graph. The upper bounds are either existential or constructive. The existential upper bounds significantly improve existing ones provided that the cost of the optimal fractional path coloring is sufficiently large and the dilation of the set of paths is small. Our algorithmic results include improved approximation algorithms for path coloring in rings and in bidirected trees. Our results extend to variations of the original path coloring problem arizing in multifiber WDM optical networks.",

The embedding has particular properties so that the routing decision for a packet is taken greedily based only on the addresses of the current node, its neighbors, and the destination node and the distances of the corresponding points. In this way, there is no need to keep routing tables at the nodes. Embeddings that allow for this functionality are called greedy embeddings. Even though greedy embeddings do exist for several metric spaces and distance functions, they usually result in paths of high stretch, ie, significantly longer than the corresponding shortest paths.

            "Abstract": "In a discrete preference game, each agent is equipped with an internal belief and declares her preference from a discrete set of alternatives. The payoff of an agent depends on whether the declared preference agrees with the belief of the agent and on the coordination with the preferences declared by the neighbors of the agent in the underlying social network. These games have been used to model the formation of opinions and the adoption of innovations in social networks. Recently, researchers have obtained bounds on the Price of Anarchy and on the Price of Stability of discrete preference games and they have studied to which extent the winning preference reached via best-response dynamics disagrees with the majority of beliefs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of these results to variants of the model. Our starting point is the observation that bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Stability can be very dependent on the way the quality of an equilibrium is measured. On the other side, results about the disagreement between majority at equilibria and majority among beliefs continue to hold even if we consider different classes of dynamics, such as noworse-response dynamics, best response with multiple players updating at the same time, or with weighted neighbors.",

When the items are arranged in a path, we show that EF1 allocations are guaranteed to exist for arbitrary monotonic utility functions over bundles, provided that either there are at most four agents, or there are any number of agents but they all have identical utility functions. Our existence proofs are based on classical arguments from the divisible cake-cutting setting, and involve discrete analogues of cut-and-choose, of Stromquist's moving-knife protocol, and of the Su-Simmons argument based on Sperner's lemma. Sperner's lemma can also be used to show that on a path, an EF2 allocation exists for any number of agents. Except for the results using Sperner's lemma, all of our procedures can be implemented by efficient algorithms. Our positive results for paths imply the existence of connected EF1 or EF2 allocations whenever G is traceable, i.e., contains a Hamiltonian path. For the case of two agents, we completely characterize the class of graphs  that guarantee the existence of EF1 allocations as the class of graphs whose biconnected components are arranged in a path. This class is strictly larger than the class of traceable graphs; one can be check in linear time whether a graph belongs to this class, and if so return an EF1 allocation.",

We show that k-approval voting\u2014where all agents are asked to approve the same number k of alternatives and the outcome is obtained by sorting the alternatives in terms of their number of approvals\u2014has exponential sample complexity for all values of k. This negative result suggests that an exponential (in terms of the number of alternatives m) number of agents is always necessary in order to recover the ground truth ranking with high probability. In contrast, by just asking each agent to approve a random number of alternatives, the sample complexity improves dramatically: it now depends only polynomially on m.

We propose a resource augmentation framework, where a truthful mechanism is evaluated by its worst-case performance on an instance with enhanced facility capacities against the optimal mechanism on the same instance with the original capacities. We study a well-known mechanism, Serial Dictatorship, and provide an exact analysis of its performance.

The goal is to produce such an assignment that minimizes the social cost, i.e., the total distance between the most-preferred points of the agents and their corresponding facilities in the assignment, under the constraint of truthfulness, which ensures that agents do not misreport their most-preferred points.We propose a resource augmentation framework, where a truthful mechanism is evaluated by its worst-case performance on an instance with enhanced facility capacities against the optimal mechanism on the same instance with the original capacities. We study a well-known mechanism, Serial Dictatorship, and provide an exact analysis of its performance. Among other results, we prove that \u2026",

This is a fundamental problem with apparent applications to pricing communication bandwidth or cloud computing services. We focus on simple sequential posted pricing mechanisms that use linear pricing, i.e., a fixed price for the whole item and proportional prices for fractions of it. We present results of the following form that can be thought of as analogs of the well-known prophet inequality of Samuel-Cahn (1984). For , if there is a linear pricing so that sequential posted pricing sells a -fraction of the item, this results in a -approximation of the optimal social welfare. The value of  can be improved to approximately  if sequential posted pricing considers the agents in random order. We also show that the best linear pricing yields an expected revenue that is at most  times smaller than the optimal one, where  is a bound on the curvature of the valuation functions. The proof extends and exploits the approach of Alaei et al. (2019) and bounds the revenue gap by the objective value of a mathematical program.

In cellular networks of reuse distance 2, the previously best known algorithm that beats the lower bound of 3 on the competitiveness of de-terministic algorithms works on networks with one frequency, achieves a competitive ratio against oblivious adversaries which is between 2.469 and 2.651, and uses a number of random bits at least proportional to the size of the network. We significantly improve this result by presenting a series of simple randomized algorithms that have competitive ratios smaller than 3, work on networks with arbitrarily many frequencies, and use only a constant number of random bits or a comparable weak random source.

The objective of each vendor is to set the price of its product to a fixed value so that its profit is maximized. The profit depends on the vendor's price itself and the total volume of buyers that find the particular price more attractive than the price of the vendor's competitors. We model the behavior of buyers and vendors as a two-stage full-information game and study a series of questions related to the existence, efficiency (price of anarchy) and computational complexity of equilibria in this game. To overcome situations where equilibria do not exist or exist but are highly inefficient, we consider the scenario where some of the vendors are subsidized in order to keep prices low and buyers highly satisfied.",

We consider scenarios where there is no central authority that coordinates the network users in order to achieve efficient solutions. Instead, the users act in an uncoordinated and selfish manner and reach solutions to the above problems that are consistent only with their selfishness. In this sense, the users act aiming to optimize their own objectives with no regard to the globally optimum system performance. Such a behavior poses several intriguing questions ranging from the definition of reasonable and practical models for studying it to the quantification of the efficiency loss due to the lack of users\u2019 cooperation.

            "Abstract": "In the context of fair allocation of indivisible items, fairness concepts often compare the satisfaction of an agent to the satisfaction she would have from items that are not allocated to her: in particular, envy-freeness requires that no agent prefers the share of someone else to her own share. We argue that these notions could also be defined relative to the knowledge that an agent has on how the items that she does not receive are distributed among other agents. We define a family of epistemic notions of envy-freeness, parameterized by a social graph, where an agent observes the share of her neighbours but not of her non-neighbours. We also define an intermediate notion between envy-freeness and proportionality, also parameterized by a social graph. These weaker notions of envy-freeness are useful when seeking a fair allocation, since envy-freeness is often too strong. We position these notions with respect to known ones, thus revealing new rich hierarchies of fairness concepts. Finally, we present a very general framework that covers all the existing and many new fairness concepts.",

            "Abstract": "The seminal work of Myerson (Mathematics of OR \u201981) characterizes incentive-compatible single-item auctions among bidders with independent valuations. In this setting, relatively simple deterministic auction mechanisms achieve revenue optimality. When bidders have correlated valuations, designing the revenue-optimal deterministic auction is a computationally demanding problem; indeed, Papadimitriou and Pierrakos (STOC \u201911) proved that it is APX-hard, obtaining an explicit inapproximability factor of 1999/2000 = 99.95%. In the current paper, we strengthen this inapproximability factor to 63/64 \u2248 98.5%. Our proof is based on a gap-preserving reduction from the Max-NM 3SAT problem; a variant of the maximum satisfiability problem where each clause has exactly 3 literals and no clause contains both negated and unnegated literals. We furthermore show that the gap between the revenue of deterministic and randomized auctions can be as low as 13/14 \u2248 92.9%, improving an explicit gap of 947/948 \u2248 99.9% by Dobzinski, Fu, and Kleinberg (STOC \u201911).",

The idea is to outsource the grading task to the students themselves as follows. After the end of an exam, each student is asked to rank---in terms of quality---a bundle of exam papers by fellow students. An aggregation rule will then combine the individual rankings into a global one that contains all students. We define a broad class of simple aggregation rules and present a theoretical framework for assessing their effectiveness. When statistical information about the grading behaviour of students is available, the framework can be used to compute the optimal rule from this class with respect to a series of performance objectives. For example, a natural rule known as Borda is proved to be optimal when students grade correctly. In addition, we \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A node (or station) in these networks is equipped with an omnidirectional antenna which is responsible for sending and receiving signals. Communication is established by assigning to each station a transmitting power. In the most common power attenuation model (13), the signal power falls as 1/ra, where r is the distance from the transmitter and a is a constant which depends on the wireless environment (typical values of a are between 1 and 6). So, a transmitter can send a signal to a receiver if 26.6 a> y where P, is the power of the transmitting signal, d (s, t) is the Euclidean distance between the transmitter and the receiver, and y is the receiver's power threshold for signal detection which is usually normalized to 1. So, communication from a node s to another node t may be established either directly if the two nodes are close enough and s uses adequate transmitting power, or by using intermediate nodes. Observe that due to the nonlinear power attenuation, relaying the signal between intermediate nodes may result in smaller power consumption. A crucial issue in ad hoc wireless networks is to support communication pat-terns that are typical in traditional networks. These include broadcasting, multicasting, and gossiping (all-to-all communication). Since establishing a commu-nication pattern strongly depends on the power levels, the important engineering question to be solved is to guarantee a desired communication pattern minimiz-ing the total power consumption. In this work, we consider a series of power consumption problems which we formulate below. Consider a complete directed graph G=(V, E), where IV= n, with a nonnegative \u2026",
