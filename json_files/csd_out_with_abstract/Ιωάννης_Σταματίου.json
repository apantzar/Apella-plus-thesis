            "Abstract": "Embedded computing devices dominate our everyday activities, from cell phones to wireless sensors that collect and process data for various applications. Although desktop and high-end server security seems to be under control by the use of current security technology, securing the low-end embedded computing systems is a difficult long-term problem. This is mainly due to the fact that the embedded systems are constrained by their operational environment and the limited resources they are equipped with. Recent research activities focus on the deployment of lightweight cryptographic algorithms and security protocols that are well suited to the limited resources of low-end embedded systems. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) offers an interesting alternative to the classical public key cryptography for embedded systems (eg, RSA and ElGamal), since it uses smaller key sizes for achieving the same security level \u2026",

These types of networks are mainly used for military purposes for monitoring and collecting information from hostile environments. The types of sensors include acoustic, seismic, and magnetic.Wireless links both in MANETs and DSNs are open to both passive and active attacks, and nodes might roam in hostile environments where they are susceptible to capture and tampering. Therefore, security is of prime importance in these types of networks, more so than in networks with a fixed infrastructure. Security mechanisms need to be adaptable to the changes in the network topology due to roaming nodes and frequent changes in node membership. They also need to be scalable to handle increasing number of nodes.",

This scheme operates directly in the compressed data domain, while manipulating the time and subband/channel domains and was implemented with the mind on efficiency, both in time and space. The main feature of this scheme is that it offers users the enhanced capability of proving their ownership of the audio file not by simply detecting the bit pattern that comprises the watermark itself, but by showing that the legal owner knows a hard to compute property of the watermark bit sequence (\u201csemantic\u201d meaning).

One way to create this shared piece of information is to have the two agents start with one random bit string each and then engage in a protocol that enables them to transform, gradually, bit differences (in their strings) into bit agreements. In a previous work, an efficient protocol was proposed which was based on the use of the Extended Golay error-correcting code in order to locate and \u201ccorrect\u201d bit differences. In this work we generalize this protocol in order to use any generic error-correcting code and derive theoretical performance bounds on the efficiency, based on the characteristics of the employed code.

            "Abstract": "In this work wepresent a method for proving copyrightownership based on Zero Knowledge Interactive Proof (ZKIP) protocols for computationally intractable problems. We use the 3-coloring problem, which consists in assigning one of three available colors to the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the presumed computational intractability of this problem, we propose the construction of large signatures that represent adjacency matrices of random, 3-colorable graphs. Since it is easy to construct large graphs with a prescribed 3-coloring of their vertices whereas it is difficult to discover such a 3-coloring, the owner of a copyrighted digital piece of work (eg image, audio, video) may easily generate a random 3-colorable graph, embed it in the digital object and then use the knowledge of the 3-coloring in debates over the object's ownership. Due to the intractability of the 3-coloring problem, only the owner is able to produce it sufficiently fast in an ownership challenge so as to convince a third party that the graph was indeed embedded in the object by herself/himself. Since we need graphs with maximum possible resistance to well-known coloring algorithms, we exploit some relatively recent experimental and theoretical findings suggesting that hard 3-coloring instances are found among graphs having a vertices to edges ratio around a specific threshold value. The proposed scheme has the additional advantage that disclosing the signature is of no consequences since it is essentially the knowledge of a characteristic of the signature, ie the 3-coloring of the graph it represents, that enables one to use it as \u2026",

This function assigns to each edge of the graph the sum of the weights of all Hamiltonian cycles that contain the edge. Since this function involves the factorial function, whose exact calculation is intractable due to its superexponential asymptotic rate of increase, we also introduce a normalized version of the function that is efficiently computable. From this version, we derive an upper bound to the weight of the minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle of the graph based on the weights of the graph edges. Then we investigate the possible algorithmic applications of this normalized function using the Nearest Neighbor Heuristic and a smallest edge first heuristic. As evidence for its applicability, we show that the use of this function as a criterion for the selection of the next edge, improves the performance of both heuristics for \u2026",

The opposite behavior is observed if this ratio is slightly decreased below this value. For k= 2, this value exists and it is equal to 1 while for k> 2 its existence remains open. For k= 3, it is rigorously shown that if it exists, it falls between 3.003 and 4.6011 while experiments place it to, about, 4.2. In this paper, we lower the upper bound to 4.596 through two different approaches. In both approaches, we start with a sum over all truth assignments that appears in an upper bound to the the probability that a random 3-SAT formula is satisfiable. In the first approach, this sum is reformulated as the partition function of a spin system \u2026",

In this paper, we consider the problem of bounding the threshold value from above using methods that, we believe, are of interest on their own right. More specifically, we show how the method of local maximum satisfying truth assignments can be combined with results for the occupancy problem in schemes of random allocation of balls into bins in order to achieve an upper bound for the unsatisfiability threshold less than 4.571.

            "Abstract": "The Panopticon (which means \"watcher of everything\") is a well-known structure of continuous surveillance and discipline proposed by Bentham in 1785. This device was, later, used by Foucault and other philosophers as a paradigm and metaphor for the study of constitutional power and knowledge as well as a model of individuals' deprivation of freedom. Nowadays, technological achievements have given rise to new, non-physical (unlike prisons), means of constant surveillance that transcend physical boundaries. This, combined with the confession of some governmental institutions that they actually collaborate with these Internet giants to collect or deduce information about people, creates a worrisome situation of several co-existing Panopticons that can act separately or in close collaboration. Thus, they can only be detected and identified through the expense of (perhaps considerable) effort. In this paper we provide a theoretical framework for studying the detectability status of Panopticons that fall under two theoretical, but not unrealistic, definitions. We show, using Oracle Turing Machines, that detecting modern day, ICT-based, Panopticons is an undecidable problem. Furthermore, we show that for each sufficiently expressive formal system, we can effectively construct a Turing Machine for which it is impossible to prove, within the formal system, either that it is a Panopticon or it is not a Panopticon.",

Key management refers to the creation, distribution and revocation of keys amongst the network. A solution to these issues is given by key pre-distribution schemes according to which each node is initially given a set of keys from which keys can be chosen to be used for their communication needs. In this paper we first give a formal definition of what constitutes a desirable set system design for key pre-distribution and propose a deterministic key pre-distribution scheme based on set systems whose members have intersection sizes that fall within a limited, predetermined range.

There are many key establishment protocols that are based on Trusted Third Parties or public key cryptography which are in use today. However, in the case of networks with frequently changing topology, such an approach is difficult to apply. In this paper we give a formal definition of collusion resistant key predistribution schemes and then propose such a scheme based on probabilistically created set systems. The resulting key sets are shown to have a number of desirable properties that ensure the confidentiality of communication sessions against collusion attacks by other network nodes. Moreover we associate our deterministic key pre-distribution scheme with the theory of set family construction methods showing that the mathematical properties possessed by the sets of such families lead to key \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Many of the network security protocols employed today utilize symmetric block ciphers (DES, AES and CAST etc). The majority of the symmetric block ciphers implement the crucial substitution operation using look up tables, called substitution boxes. These structures should be highly nonlinear and have bit dispersal, i.e. avalanche, properties in order to render the cipher with resistant to cryptanalysis attempts, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis. Highly secure substitution boxes can be constructed using particular Boolean functions as components that have certain mathematical properties which enhance the robustness of the whole cryptoalgorithm. However, enforcing these properties on SBoxes is a highly computationally intensive task. In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm and its implementation on a computing cluster that accelerates the construction of secure substitution boxes with \u2026",

It is manifested by the appearance of different prices when the same product is browsed by different prospective buyers, based on their profiles. Thus, for instance, the price of an item may increase at the instance it is browsed by a user coming from a rich neighbourhood or has performed a series of purchases of expensive objects in the past. Price discrimination can lead to decrease of profits and loss of clientele, in the long run, as well as decrease of people\u2019s trust towards eCommerce. In this paper, we propose the deployment of Privacy Enhancing Technologies in order to handle users\u2019 personal information. These technologies empower users to have command over their own privacy by allowing them to reveal only what is absolutely necessary (minimal disclosure principle), or what they agree to reveal, in order to use a service avoiding any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Thus, eCommerce services that employ such technologies for handling their clients\u2019 personal data can attract more loyal clients, increase their popularity while, at the same time, suffer from minimal client data and company image loss in case of a massive customer data theft attacks.",

However, people still are not as enthusiastic, as it was envisaged by technocrats and politicians, in using IT solutions to pass from eGovernment to eGovernance, a notable example of which is eVoting. In this paper we argue that efforts to introduce complex eGovernment and eParticipation applications should be gradual and develop solutions hand-inhand with in-field trials that increase (also gradually) in complexity and people inclusiveness, so as to handle the various forms of social inertia successfully. We present our experience in the eVoting domain and suggest that a similar approach in eVoting (and other demanding eGovernment/eParticipation applications) could fare better to success than introducing to people a system that suddenly appears and claims to be the \u201cperfect\u201d, all-in-one, solution.",

One of the main obstacles for its wide adoptionis the reluctance of citizens to participate in electronic voting procedures. This reluctance can be partially attributed to the low penetration of technology among citizens. However, the main reason behind this reluctance is the lack of trust which stems from the belief of citizens that systems implementing an eVoting process will violate their privacy. The departure point of this approach is that the emergence of such a belief can be considerably facilitated by designing and building systems in a way that evidence about the system\u2019s properties is produced during the design process. In this way, the designers can demonstrate the respect in privacy using this evidence that can be understood and checked by the \u2026",

For CORAS, a system is not just technology, but also the humans interacting with the technology and all relevant aspects of the surrounding organisation and society. The use of graphical models in CORAS furthers communication between the different stakeholders of a risk assessment, and makes it easier for non-technicians to take part. Telemedicine services and electronic applications used in the health sector have a high demand for security. The medical developers, providers and users of such services and systems are important contributors in the risk assessment of these services and systems \u2026",

We also model user reaction against infected email as well as the rate at which antivirus software is installed. User acquaintance is perceived as a \u201cnetwork\u201d connecting users based on their contact book links. We then propose a worm propagation formulation based on a token propagation algorithm, further analyzed with a use of a system of continuous differential equations, as dictated by Wormald\u2019s theorem on approximating \u201cwell-behaving\u201d random processes with deterministic functions.",

An upper bound of 4.506 was announced by Dubois et al. in 1999 but, to the best of our knowledge, no complete proof has been made available from the authors yet. We consider the problem of bounding the threshold value from above using methods that, we believe, are of interest on their own right.

The easiest action would be to change the characteristics of the algorithm in a way that obscures the cryptanalytic attack or that eliminates the cipher's weaknesses.

            "Abstract": "In light of the rise of malicious attacks on the internet and the various networks and applications attached to it, new approaches towards modeling worm activity in networks is called for. One frequently utilized method for W32/Novarg [7], Sober X, Netsky P and Mytob ED [18] propagation exploited by worms is through the victim's contact book. The contact book, which reflects the acquaintance profiles of people, is used as a``hit-list'', to which the worm can try and send itself in order to spread fast. In this paper we propose a discrete worm propagation model that relies upon a combined email and Instant Messaging (IM) communication behavior of users in a scale free environment. We also model the effect in propagation based on user reaction when a threat is recognized, the installation and update of antivirus software as well as the network connectivity, arising conclusions about the behavior of the network infrastructure in presence of a worm. Our analysis is based on Wormald's differential equations method for approximating``well-behaving''random processes with deterministic functions.",

            "Abstract": "Price discrimination is a recently introduced practice in the domain of eCommerce. It is manifested by the appearance of different prices when the same product is browsed by different prospective buyers, based on their profiles. Thus, for instance, the price of an item may increase at the instance it is browsed by a user coming from a rich neighbourhood or has performed a series of purchases of expensive objects in the past. Price discrimination can lead to decrease of profits and loss of clientele, in the long run, as well as decrease of people\u2019s trust towards eCommerce. In this paper, we propose the deployment of Privacy Enhancing Technologies in order to handle users\u2019 personal information. These technologies empower users to have command over their own privacy by allowing them to reveal only what is absolutely necessary (minimal disclosure principle), or what they agree to reveal, in order to use a service \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is one of the most promising alternatives to conventional public key cryptography, such as RSA and ElGamal, since it employs keys of smaller sizes for the same level of cryptographic strength. Smaller key sizes imply smaller hardware units for performing the arithmetic operations required by cryptographic protocols and, thus, ECC is an ideal candidate for implementation in embedded systems where the major computational resources (speed and storage) are limited. In this paper we present a port, written in ANSI C for maximum portability, of an open source ECC-based cryptographic library (ECC-LIB) to ATMEL's AT76C520 802.11 WLAN Access Point. One of the major features of this port, not found in similar ports, is that it supports Complex Multiplication (CM) for the construction of Elliptic Curves with good security properties.

An example of a Digital Territory is the range defined by a WiFi access point or the access range of a bluetooth device. Since Digital Territories are created in the open space, a major issue that arises during their creation and lifetime is their security and privacy, in terms of what entities can have access to them and with which access rights.

In attempting to construct prime order ECs using Weber polynomials two difficulties arise (in addition to the necessary transformations of the roots of such polynomials to those of their Hilbert counterparts). The first one is that the requirement of prime order necessitates that D \u2261 3 (mod 8), which gives Weber polynomials with degree three times larger than the degree of their corresponding Hilbert polynomials (a fact that could affect efficiency). The second difficulty is that these Weber polynomials do not have roots in . In this paper we show how to overcome the above difficulties and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "One of the most challenging problems in probability and complexity theory is to establish and determine the satisfiability threshold, or phase transition, for random k-SAT instances: Boolean formulas consisting of clauses with exactly k literals. As the previous part of the volume has explored, empirical observations suggest that there exists a critical ratio of the number of clauses to the number of variables, such that almost all randomly generated formulas with a higher ratio are unsatisfiable while almost all randomly generated formulas with a lower ratio are satisfiable. The statement that such a crossover point really exists is called the satisfiability threshold conjecture. Experiments hint at such a direction, but as far as theoretical work is concerned, progress has been difficult. In an impor-tant advance, Friedgut (177] showed that the phase transition is a sharp one, though without proving that it takes place at a \u201cfixed\u201d ratio for large formulas. Otherwise, rigorous proofs have focused on providing successively better upper and lower bounds for the value of the (conjectured) threshold. In this chapter,",

Visual quality measurements and empirical tests have shown the imperceptibility of the embedded watermark. Over 500 tests were performed on numerous images from our image collection, confirming that the watermark can be recovered, even after multiple attacks have been launched in sequence. The probability of false recovery, according to this method is extremely low. Experimental confirmation of the low probability is also provided in this paper.",

The individuals interact, using their portable devices (eg mobile phones and tablets), with specialized information systems that collect and process information sent by the individuals.The main advantage of crowd sourcing is that it mobilizes large crowds of people who volunteer to contribute, using the sensors of their mobile devices, towards the collection of environmental data and information (eg weather conditions, city traffic status, pollution indicators, seismic wave propagation etc.) or their behavior itself (eg movement). Based on this local data and other information sent by the crowd, the experimenters can derive useful global information about the evolution of a physical phenomenon or explain an observed macroscopic behavior of the crowd population itself. Thus, typically, crowd sourcing mostly benefits the experimenter while it either benefits minimally the participating crowd or benefits it in a long term way.",

Since the properties of the s-boxes largely determine the properties of the cryptoalgorithm, we provide the architecture of a CAST-128 based cryptoalgorithm whose s-box construction methodology results in s-boxes with good properties. We map this architecture on ATMEL\u2019s innovative processor+ FPGA chip FPSLIC TM where the cryptoalgorithm is implemented on the FPGA part while the s-box construction algorithm runs on the processor part (AVR). The result is a one chip fast and secure cryptoalgorithm than can reconfigure itself at run time, either autonomously at regular time intervals or upon receipt of an external signal in order to hinder or confuse suspected cryptanalytic efforts.",

Cohen gave a simple but realistic, formal, definition of the characteristic actions of a computer virus as a Turing Machine that replicates itself and then proved that constructing a Turing Machine that recognizes viruses (ie Turing Machines that act like viruses) is impossible, by reducing the Halting Problem, which is undecidable, to the problem of recognizing a computer virus. In this paper we complement Cohen\u2019s approach along similar lines, based on Recursion Function Theory and the Theory of Computation. More specifically, after providing a simple generalization of Cohen\u2019s definition of a computer virus, we show that the malware/non-malware classification problem is undecidable under this new definition. Moreover, we show that to any formal system, there correspond infinitely many, effectively constructible, programs for which no proof can be produced by the formal system that they are either malware or non-malware programs. In other words, given any formal system, one can provide a procedure that generates, systematically, an infinite number of impossible to classify, within the formal system, programs.",

            "Abstract": "A basic task of cryptography is the transformation, or encryption, of a given message into another message which appears meaningful only to the intended recipient through the process of decryption. The message that undergoes encryption is called the plaintext (or cleartext), while the transformed message is called ciphertext. Cryptanalysis refers to the process of discovering the plaintext from the ciphertext without knowing the decryption key. A cryptographic algorithm, cipher, is a mathematical function employed for the encryption and decryption of messages. Ciphers can be divided into two categories, the symmetric-key and the public-key ciphers. In symmetric-key ciphers the sender and the receiver of the message secretly choose the key that will be used for encryption and decryption. A drawback of this type of cryptosystems is that it requires prior communication of the key between the sender and the receiver \u2026",

Although it is a difficult concept to formalize and handle, many efforts have been made towards a clear definition of trust and the development of systematic ways for trust management. Our central viewpoint is that trust cannot be defined, anymore, as consisting of a static set of rules that define systems properties that hold eternally due to the highly dynamic nature of today's computing systems (eg wireless networks, ad-hoc networks, virtual communities and digital territories etc.). Our approach is an effort to define trust in terms of properties that hold with some limiting probability as the the system grows and try to establish conditions that ensure that \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019properties hold almost certainly. Based on this viewpoint, in this paper we provide a new framework for defining trust through formally definable properties that hold, almost certainly, in the limit in randomly growing combinatorial structures that model \u2018\u2018boundless\u2019\u2019computing systems (eg ad-hoc networks), drawing on results that establish the threshold behavior of predicates written in the first and second order logic. We will also see that, interestingly, some trust models have properties that do not have limiting probabilities. This fact can be used to demonstrate that as certain trust networks grow indefinitely, their trust properties are not certain to be present.",

In addition, it does not need the original signal to detect the watermark. Our scheme was implemented taking special care for the efficient usage of the two limited resources of computer systems: time and space. It offers to the industrial user the capability of watermark embedding and detection in time immediately comparable to the real music time of the original audio file that depends on the mpeg compression, while the end user/audience does not face any artifacts or delays hearing the watermarked audio file. Furthermore, it overcomes the disadvantage of algorithms operating in the PCM-Data domain to be vulnerable to compression/recompression attacks, as it places the watermark in the scale factors domain and not in the digitized sound audio data. The strength of our scheme, that allows it to be used with success in both authentication and copyright protection, relies on the fact that it gives to the users the enhanced capability their ownership of the audio file not to be accomplished simply by detecting the bit pattern that comprises the watermark itself, but by showing that the legal owner knows a hard to compute property of the watermark.",

CORAS permeates the development process in all the layers of the target system and aims at the precise, unambiguous, and efficient risk assessment during their design, implementation and operation phases. It focuses on the integration of viewpoint-oriented UML-like modeling and employs a variety of risk analysis methods. In addition, CORAS produces a detailed system documentation which can be publicized in order to increase transparency, providing thus an open view of the system to the public leading to its wider acceptance, in contrast with most \u201cclosed-design\u201d commercial eVoting systems.*",

Systems that can be described with such terms are of a dynamic, with no clear physical boundary, nature and it seems that it is impossible (or, at least, difficult) to define sharply a number of important properties holding with certainty and throughout the whole lifetime of the system. In this chapter we propose a new paradigm for the concept of trust that can be applicable to describing trust related properties in evolving,\u201cboundary-transcending\u201d, computing systems. This paradigm is founded on the interaction between formal logic and threshold phenomena, ie properties of large combinatorial structures that can be proved to emerge with certainty, as the system evolves. We define a number of notions of trust within these frameworks and pinpoint their inherent weakness in providing clear and measurable trust properties. We then argue that trust in dynamic, global computing systems must, necessarily, incorporate, to some degree, some non-formalizable elements, such as common sense and intuition in order to overcome formalism\u2019s weaknesses and result in a pragmatic notion of trust applicable to today\u2019s new computing paradigms.",

We use the 3-coloring problem, which consists in assigning one of three available colors to the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the presumed computational intractability of this problem, we propose the construction of large signatures that represent adjacency matrices of random, 3-colorable graphs. Since it is easy to construct large graphs with a prescribed 3-coloring of their vertices whereas it is di cult to discover such a 3-coloring, the owner of a copyrighted digital piece of work (eg image, audio, video) may easily generate a random 3-colorable graph, embed it in the digital object and then use the knowledge of the 3-coloring in debates over the object's ownership. Due to the intractability of the 3-coloring problem, only the owner is able to produce it su ciently fast in an ownership challenge so as to convince a third party that the graph was indeed embedded in the object by herself/himself. Since we need graphs with maximum possible resistance to well-known coloring algorithms, we exploit some relatively recent experimental and theoretical findings suggesting that hard 3-coloring instances are found among graphs having a vertices to edges ratio around a specific threshold value. The proposed scheme has the additional advantage that disclosing the signature is of no consequences since it is essentially the knowledge of a characteristic of the signature, ie the 3-coloring of the graph it represents, that enables one to use it as proof \u2026",

Modern search engines have developed duplicate detection algorithms to eliminate this problem in the search results, but difficulties still remain, mainly because the structure and the content of the results could not be changed. In this work we propose an effective methodology for removing redundant information from search results. Using previous methodologies, we extract from the search results a set of composite documents called SuperTexts and then, by applying novel approximation algorithms, we select the SuperTexts that better reduce the redundant information. The final results are next ranked according to their relevance to the initial query. We give some complexity results and experimentally evaluate the proposed algorithms.",

This competition that resulted in the selection of the Rijndael block cipher, after more than two years of intensive scrutiny of all submissions, enabled the cryptography community to gain many helpful insights into the area of cryptosystem design and implementation as well as cryptanalysis.Each AES submission was evaluated along four main (rather natural) assessment criteria: security (robustness against known cryptanalytic attacks), software efficiency (throughput of software implementations), flexibility (ability to modify the algorithm through a set of tunable parameters), and hardware efficiency. In order to investigate the last of them, researchers (independently of NIST) have implemented many of the AES submissions, with the emphasis on the five finalists (see [2, 4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the hardware implementations of cryptoalgorithms on FPGAs focus on implementing a particular algorithm (eg one of the AES finalists) to be as fast as possible under various",

            "Abstract": "In general, graph search can be described in terms of a sequence of searchers' moves on a graph, able to capture a fugitive resorting on its vertices/edges. Several variations of graph search have been introduced, di# ering on the abilities of the fugitive as well as of the search. In this paper, we examine the case where the fugitive is inert, ie, it moves only whenever the search is about to capture it. Mainly, there are two variants for\" clearing\" an edge during a search: when a sliding of a searcher occurs along the edge or when both its endpoints are simultaneously occupied by searchers. These variants define the inert edge search and the inert node search respectively. A third search variant, the inert mixed search, is defined when both ways of clearing an edge are possible. As we show, inert search and inert mixed search are equivalent (surprisingly, this is not the case if we discard the inertness property). Moreover, we prove that, in any case, by restricting the searches to only those that always reduce further the fugitive's possible resorts, does not give any advantage to the fugitive (this monotonicity property is usually expressed as:\" recontamination does not help\"). So far, the only monotonicity result on inert search concerns inert node search and our results yield a much simpler proof of that result as well. Furthermore, we define a new graph-theoretic parameter, the proper-treewidth, in analogy to the parameter proper-pathwidth, and prove it equivalent to the inert mixed search game. Last, we prove that proper-treewidth, in turn, is equivalent to a known graph theoretic parameter related to treewidth.",

ACP is known to be inherently sequential, or P-complete, so in this paper we examine some weaker versions of it and their parallel complexity. We propose several natural approximation schemes for ACP and show that they are also P-complete. In an attempt to overcome these negative results, we turn our attention to the problem of filtering out values from the variables so that each value in the resulting network is compatible with at least one value of not necessarily all, but a constant fraction of the other variables. We call such a network partially arc consistent. We give a parallel algorithm that, for any constraint \u2026",

Quite intriguingly, experimental results with various models for generating random CSP instances suggest that the probability of such problems having a solution exhibits a \u201cthreshold\u2013like\u201d behavior. In this spirit, some preliminary theoretical work has been done in analyzing these models asymptotically, i.e., as the number of variables grows. In this paper we prove that, contrary to beliefs based on experimental evidence, the models commonly used for generating random CSP instances do not have an asymptotic threshold. In particular, we prove that asymptotically almost all instances they generate are overconstrained, suffering from trivial, local inconsistencies.

All network nodes are assumed to process tasks based on the M/M/1 queuing model. Thus, the model behaves as an open network of M/M/1 queues.

This dynamic and complex nature of security protocols frequently leaves open the door for subtle problems that eventually render the protocols insecure and useless, after thorough and in depth scrutiny by researchers. And what is worse, is that uncovering these subtleties may be a long and time consuming process that, while in progress, allows the target protocol to be used in practical applications, even though it may be flawed. Thus, what is needed, first, is a way to unambiguously describe a security protocol so as to let all researchers understand the same things about the protocol, without any possible misunderstandings \u2026",

            "Abstract": "As gamification may benefit the learning experience, many Technology Acceptance Models affecting the user's acceptance of using gamification have been investigated. However, there has been limited work on the digital skills level and the adoption of user acceptance gamification. This paper examines the user\u2019s perceptions of gamification acceptance in e-learning environments. For this reason, a research model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) proposed to reveal the relationships between the constructs of the model and participants with different e-skills Level. The search data collected from 188 participants of a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) course focused on enhancing cybersecurity skills. Nonparametric tests and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) implemented for the hypothesis tests. Findings prove that there are statistical differences among participants with different Level of e-skills on Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Intention Use (IU) and Actual Use (AU). Also, the study reveals significant positive relationships among most of the model\u2019s constructs on gamification acceptance. The extra factor \u201cICT Level\u201d provides a roadmap deeper understanding of the studies based on e-learning Technology Acceptance Models and show that affect the adoption of user acceptance.",

The  CSNA  is a software system for real time automated analysis of cybersecurity-related information available on Social Networks, with a focus on Twitter. Its aim is to uncover cybersecurity breach related discussions and posts, identify emerging cybersecurity incidents and provide, in a timely fashion, early warning alerts. The  CSNA  platform presents the results from the analysis of the gathered information in a variety of graphical formats for easy visualisation of potential threats within user-specified time windows of interest. We complement our description with a demonstration of the real time information provided by the platform during its operation on the Twitter social network.",

            "Abstract": "This paper addresses stability issues in incremental induction of decision trees. Stability problems arise when an induction algorithm must revise a decision tree very often and oscillations between similar concepts decrease learning speed. We review a heuristic that solves this problem and subsequently employ asymptotic analysis to approximate the basic parameters related to the estimation of computational effort in incremental learning of decision trees. We then use these approximations to simplify the heuristic, we deliver insight into its amortizing behavior and argue how they can also speed-up its execution and enhance its applicability, also providing experimental evidence to support these claims.",

This function shares with many other functions the remarkable property of appearing frequently in the solutions of a variety of mathematical problems stemming from diverse scientific domains that range from chemistry and mechanical engineering to computer science and network design. In this paper we survey some recent research results on various, diverse problems whose solutions involve the Lambert-W function as well as a natural extension there of, called Hyper Lambert functions. Our approach relies on highlighting the intuition behind the appearance of the Lambert function in the solution to these problems rather than providing fine details of the solution process, which can be found in the original research works. Our hope is that our work will be useful to other researchers working in similar problems serving as a guideline for \u2026",

This framework is characterised by: (1) A careful integration of techniques and features from partly complementary risk assessment methods. (2) Patterns and methodology for UML oriented modelling targeting the different risk assessment methods. (3) A risk management process based on AS/NZS 4360. (4) A risk documentation framework based on RM-ODP. (5) An integrated risk management and system development process based on UP. (6) A platform for tool-inclusion based on XML. This chapter describes and explains the CORAS approach to model-based risk assessment. The ability to aid risk assessment in a component-based software engineering process receives particular attention. We consider maintenance, composition as well as reuse of risk assessment \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this work, a method for proving copyright ownership is presented that is based on Zero Knowledge Interactive Proof (ZKIP) protocols for computationally intractable problems. The utilized problem is the 3-coloring problem, which consists in assigning one of three available colors to the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the presumed computational intractability of this problem, the construction of large signatures is proposed so that they represent adjacency matrices of random, 3-colorable graphs. Since it is easy to construct large graphs with a prescribed 3-coloring of their vertices whereas it is difficult to discover such a 3-coloring, the owner of a copyrighted digital piece of work (e.g. image, audio, video) may easily generate a random 3-colorable graph, embed it in the digital object and then use the knowledge of the 3-coloring in debates over the object\u2019s \u2026",
