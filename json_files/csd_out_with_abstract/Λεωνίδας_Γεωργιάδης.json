            "Abstract": "In this paper we consider the N-user broadcast erasure channel with public feedback and side information. Before the beginning of transmission, each receiver knows a function of the messages of some of the other receivers. This situation arises naturally in wireless and in particular cognitive networks where a node may overhear transmitted messages destined to other nodes before transmission over a given broadcast channel begins. We provide an upper bound to the capacity region of this system. When the side information is linear, this bound is tight for the case of two-user broadcast channels. The special case where each user knows the whole or nothing of the message of each other node, constitutes a generalization of the index coding problem. For this instance, and when there are no channel errors, we show that the bound reduces to the known Maximum Weighted Acyclic Induced Subgraph bound. We \u2026",

The first algorithm relies on random coding techniques while the second relies only on XOR operations between pairs of packets. Complexity and feedback information tradeoffs for the two algorithms are discussed. For the case where, in addition to traffic destined exclusively to either one of the users there is additional multicast traffic, we present an algorithm that shows that the rate region of the system can be increased by allowing inter-session coding.

We discuss several of those techniques that have been developed during the last few years. Some techniques are focused on pure IP networks while others have been designed with emerging technologies for scalable Quality of Service (QoS) such as Differentiated Services and MPLS in mind. We first discuss traffic engineering techniques inside a single domain. We show that by using a non-linear programming formulation of the traffic engineering problem it is possible to meet the requirements of demanding customer traffic, while optimising the use of network resources, through the means of an automated provisioning system. We also extend the functionality of the traffic engineering system through policies. In the following, we discuss the techniques that can be used to control the flow of packets between domains. First, we briefly describe interdomain routing and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Second, we summarise the characteristics of interdomain traffic based on measurements with two different Internet Service Providers. We show by simulations the limitations of several BGP-based traffic engineering techniques that are currently used on the Internet. Then, we discuss the utilisation of BGP to exchange QoS information between domains by using the QOS-NLRI attribute to allow BGP to select more optimum paths. Finally, we consider the multi-homing problem and analyse the current proposed IPv6 multi-homing solutions are analysed along with their impact on communication quality.",

Since these algorithms suffer from large computational complexity and decoding delay, our aim, in this paper, is to design a coding algorithm with reduced computational complexity and a low decoding delay that achieves a comparable rate region to the former algorithms.

In this paper, we study the joint effects of RF impairments on energy detection based spectrum sensing in multi-channel environments. In particular, we provide an analytical framework for the evaluation of the probabilities of detection and false alarm, assuming Rayleigh fading and approximating the joint effects of RF impairments by a Gaussian distribution. Numerical results illustrate the detrimental effects of RF imperfections on the spectrum sensing performance, which bring significant losses in the spectrum utilization.",

Specifically, we examine the possibility of improving the overall system performance by employing network coding techniques. The objective is to achieve this while affecting Primary user transmissions only positively, namely: 1) avoid network coding operations at the Primary transmitter, hence avoiding increase of its storage requirements and keeping its complexity low, 2) keep the order of packets received by the Primary receiver the same as in the non cooperative case and 3) induce packet service times that are stochastically smaller \u2026",

The primary transmitter is the owner of the channel and as such, we intend to keep its operations simple and to avoid increasing its storage requirements. Specifically, the primary transmitter does not receive data sent by the secondary transmitter and does not perform any coding operations. On the other hand, the secondary transmitter can overhear primary transmissions and is allowed to perform any coding operations. We develop an outer bound to the capacity of the fundamental cooperative cognitive radio network under consideration. Then, we propose a coding-scheduling algorithm suitable for this type of networks, which involves only XOR network coding operations. The complexity of the scheduling decisions of the proposed algorithm depends on the channel statistical parameters and three cases, depending on the relations between channel erasure probabilities, are distinguished. For the first two cases the rate region of the proposed algorithm coincides with the developed capacity outer bound, hence the algorithm is capacity achieving.

Using a single broadcast tree simplifies considerably the tree maintenance problem and allows scaling to larger networks. We first show that, using the same broadcast tree, the total power consumed for broadcasting from a given source node is at most twice the total power consumed for broadcasting from any other source node. We next develop a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the construction of a single broadcast tree. The performance analysis of the algorithm indicates that the \u2026",

Precomputing and storing of the relevant information minimizes the computational overhead required to determine an optimal path when a new connection request arrives. We evaluate algorithms that precompute paths with maximal bandwidth (widest paths), which in addition satisfy given end-to-end delay constraints. We analyze and compare both the worst case and average case performance of the algorithms. We also show how the precomputed paths can be used to provide computationally efficient solutions to the constrained widest multicast tree problem. In this problem, a multicast tree with maximal bandwidth (widest multicast tree) is sought, which in addition satisfies given end-to-end delay constraints for each path on the tree from the source to a multicast destination.",

This scheme performs only binary (XOR) operations and includes special rules for coding packets that ensure instantaneous decodability. Drawing on the results of network stability under statistical overhearing, we provide a stabilizing policy using this coding scheme. Furthermore, we show that, for N = 4 and i.i.d. erasure events, the stability region of such a system effectively coincides with its information-theoretic capacity region, and provide a stabilizing policy that employs this XOR-based scheme.",

Packet scheduling in such a switch falls within the scope of our resource allocation model. The switch architecture imposes restrictions of a single packet transmission per slot for each input and output port, a restriction that is captured by the transmission conflict constraints of the resource allocation model.

            "Abstract": "One of the main benefits of multicast communication is the overall reduction of network load. To quantify this reduction, when compared to traditional unicast, experimental studies by Chuang and Sirbu indicated the so called power law which asserts that the number of links in a multicast delivery tree connecting a source to m (distinct) sites is in m^0.8. In order to explain theoretically this behavior, Phillips, Shenker, and Tangmunarunkit examined approximately the link number for a V-ary complete tree topology, and concluded that this number grows nearly linearly with m, thus not obeying the power law. We first re-examine the analysis by Phillips et.al. and provide precise asymptotic expansion for the link number that confirms the nearly linear (with some wobbling) growth. Claiming that the essence of the problem lies in the modeling assumptions, we replace the V-ary complete tree topology by a V-ary self-similar tree with similarity factor 0\\leq\\theta<1. In such a tree a node at level k is replicated CV^(D-k)\\theta times, where D is the depth of the tree and C is a constant. Under this assumption, we analyze again L(m) and prove that L(m)\\sim cm^1-\\theta where c is an explicitly computable constant. Hence self-similar trees provide a plausible explanation of the multicast power law. Next, we examine more general conditions for general trees, under which the power law still holds. We also discuss some experimental results in real networks that reaffirm the power law and show that in these networks the general conditions hold.",

When not utilized carefully, all these operations can induce tremendous processing overheads in practical, wireless, multi-rate settings. Our measurements with prior NC implementations suggest that such processing operations severely degrade the router throughput, especially at high bit rates. Motivated by this, we design {\\bf NCRAWL}, a Network Coding framework for Rate Adaptive Wireless Links. The design of NCRAWL facilitates low overhead NC functionalities, thereby effectively approaching the theoretically expected capacity benefits of joint NC and scheduling.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate transmission techniques for a fundamental cooperative cognitive radio network, i.e., a radio system where a Secondary user may act as relay for messages sent by the Primary user, hence offering performance improvement of Primary user transmissions, while at the same time obtaining more transmission opportunities for its own transmissions. Specifically, we examine the possibility of improving the overall system performance by employing network coding techniques. The objective is to achieve this while affecting Primary user transmissions only positively, namely: 1) avoid network coding operations at the Primary transmitter in order avoid increase of its complexity and storage requirements, 2) keep the order of packets received by the Primary receiver the same as in the non cooperative case and 3) induce packet service times that are stochastically smaller than packet service times \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Intersession network coding (NC) can provide significant performance benefits via mixing packets at wireless routers; these benefits are especially pronounced when NC is applied in conjunction with intelligent scheduling. NC, however, imposes certain processing operations, such as encoding, decoding, copying, and storage. When not utilized carefully, all these operations can induce tremendous processing overheads in practical settings. Our testbed measurements suggest that such processing operations can severely degrade the router throughput, especially at high bit rates. Motivated by this, we design network coding framework for rate adaptive wireless links (NCRAWL). The design of NCRAWL facilitates low overhead NC operations, thereby effectively approaching the theoretically expected throughput benefits of joint NC and scheduling. We implement and evaluate NCRAWL on a wireless testbed. Our \u2026",

The policy to attain this criterion is therefore referred to as the min\u2013max policy (MMP). It is shown that this optimization criterion is tantamount to routing to the fastest M processors, where M depends on system statistics, and equalizing the expected response times on these processors. The algorithm to compute job routing probabilities is applicable to increasing continuous functions of system response time versus the job arrival rate.

However, despite the broad applicability and the extensive study of such models, eg, in the context of P2P networks, many fundamental questions regarding their properties and efficiency remain unanswered. We consider such a service exchange model and analyze the users' interactions under three different approaches. First, we study a centrally designed service allocation policy that yields the fair total service each user should receive based on the service it offers to the others. Accordingly, we consider a competitive market where each user determines selfishly its allocation policy so as to maximize the service it receives in return, and a coalitional game model where users are allowed to coordinate their policies. We prove that there is a unique equilibrium exchange allocation for both game theoretic formulations \u2026",

By increasing the probability of successful packet transmission for the PU, the SU essentially increases the service rate of the PU queue and thus, for given packet arrival rate, it increases the chances that it will be empty, and the channel will be free to use. Due to power limitations however, SUs have to take intelligent decisions on whether to cooperate or not and at which power level.

Information generated by the monitoring sensors needs to be routed efficiently to the location where the sink is currently located across multiple hops with different transmission energy requirements. We exploit the capability of the sink to be located in different places during network operation in order to maximize network lifetime. We provide a novel linear programming formulation of the problem. We show that maximum lifetime can be achieved by solving optimally two joint problems: a scheduling problem that determines the sojourn times of the sink at different locations, and a routing problem in order to deliver the sensed data to the sink in an energy-efficient way. Our model provides the optimal solution to both of these problems and gives the best achievable network lifetime. We evaluate numerically the performance of our model by comparing it with the case of static sink and with previously proposed models that focus mainly on the sink movement patterns and sojourn times, leaving the routing problem outside the linear programming formulation. Our approach always achieves higher network lifetime, as expected, leading to a lifetime up to more than twice that obtained with models previously proposed as the network size increases. It also results in a fair balancing of the energy depletion among the sensor nodes.

In this context, integrated service/network management and traffic control mechanisms are of paramount importance for service provisioning and network operation, aiming to satisfy the QoS requirements of contacted services while optimising the use of underlying network resources. In this paper, after briefly introducing an architectural framework for integrated service/network management and control, we concentrate in its traffic engineering aspects comparing and contrasting two different approaches: MPLS-based explicit routed paths and IP-based hop-by-hop routing. We consider relatively longterm network dimensioning based on the requirements of contracted services and subsequent dynamic route and resource management that react in shorter time scales to statistical traffic fluctuations and varying network conditions.",

Despite their broad applicability, many fundamental questions about their properties remain unanswered. We consider a general sharing economy model and analyze the dynamic interactions of nodes under three different approaches in a stochastic environment. First, we study a centrally designed allocation policy that yields the fair resource each node should receive based on the resources it offers to others. Next, we consider a competitive market where each node determines its allocation strategy so as to maximize the service it receives in return, and a coalitional game model where nodes may coordinate their policies. We prove there is a unique equilibrium exchange allocation for both settings, which also coincides with the central fair allocation. We also characterize the properties of the long-term equilibrium \u2026",

Much of the research on the topic has focused on protocol design issues, e.g. coordination mechanisms among the next-hop candidates; however, the fundamental performance bounds of the scheme are not yet known. In this paper we study the theoretical throughput region of opportunistic routing, for a generic network model with an arbitrary matrix of packet erasure probabilities between any two nodes, which cannot be mapped onto any classical model due to the existence of undirected broadcast from each node.

In order to obtain a better insight we first analyze some simple multicast tree topologies, which under appropriately chosen parameters give rise to the multicast power law. The asymptotic analysis of R (n) in this case, indicates that it is very difficult to infer the validity of power law by observing experimental graphs of R (n) alone. Next we introduce a new easy to measure metric of multicast tree topology which is applicable to general networks where the multicast trees are constructed as subtrees of a given spanning tree (global multicast tree). We show that this metric provides a more reliable means for inferring the validitity of the power law. Finally, we perform experiments on real and simulated networks to demonstrate the use of the new metric.",

            "Abstract": "One of the main benefits of multicast communication is the overall reduction of network load. To quantify this reduction, when compared to traditional unicast, experimental studies by Chuang and Sirbu indicated the so called power law which asserts that the number of links L (m) in a multicast delivery tree connecting a source to m (distinct) sites satisfies L (m) \u00bc cm0: 8 where c is a constant. In order to explain theoretically this behavior, Phillips, Shenker, and Tangmunarunkit examined approximately L (m) for a V-ary complete tree topology, and concluded that L (m) grows nearly linearly with m, thus not obeying the power law. We first re-examine the analysis by Phillips et. al. and provide precise asymptotic expansion for L (m) that confirms the nearly linear (with some wobbling) growth. Claiming that the essence of the problem lies in the modeling assumptions, we replace the V-ary complete tree topology by a V-ary self-similar tree with similarity factor 0\u00b7 \u00b5< 1.

Under this assumption, we analyze again L (m) and prove that L (m)\u00bb cm1L\u00b5 where c is an explicitly computable constant. Hence self-similar trees provide a plausible explanation of the multicast power law. Next, we examine more general conditions for general trees, under which the power law still holds. We also discuss some experimental results in real networks that reaffirm the power law and show that in these networks the general conditions hold.

More specifically, we experimentally show that sequences of outliers can serve as a distinguishing characteristic between true and false positives, and we show how analysing sequences of outliers can lead to lower false positive rates, while maintaining high detection rates. Based on this analysis, we developed an anomaly detection filter that learns outlier sequences using k-nearest neighbours with normalised longest common subsequence. Outlier sequences are then used as a filter to reduce false positives on the  file system intrusion detection system. This filter is evaluated on both overlapping and non-overlapping sequences of outliers. In both cases, experiments performed on three real-world web servers and a honeynet show that \u2026",

However, SUs have limited power resources and, therefore, they have to take intelligent decisions on whether to cooperate or not and at which power level, to maximize their throughput. Cooperation policies in this framework require the solution of a constrained Markov decision problem with infinite state space. In our work, we restrict attention to the class of stationary policies that take randomized decisions of an SU activation and its transmit power in every time slot based only on spectrum sensing. Assuming infinitely backlogged SUs queues, the proposed class of policies is shown to achieve the maximum throughput for the SUs, while significantly enlarging the stability region of PU queue.

Based on the results above we use stochastic approximation techniques to provide a policy that optimizes a combination of concave rewards associated with class performance metrics.

            "Abstract": "Communication of information between two or more parties takes place over a variety of physical media called channels. Such channels can be simple twisted pair cables, coaxial and optical cables, or the free space. Sometimes the channel is dedicated to a specific transmitter-receiver pair. This may be the case when two parties establish a telephone conversation over a dedicated cable. Channels of this type are called point-to-point. There are situations, however, where multiple users need to have access to the same channel. The most familiar one is human speech communication. When a number of humans are located in the same room they all use the same channel, the atmosphere, for their conversation exchange. Computer Local Area Networks (LANs) is another example: a common approach in this case is to attach a number of computers to the same cable as in Figure 1. Hence, each computer can listen to the transmission of every other computer attached to the same cable. For a third example, consider Satellite communication. As shown in Figure 2 a number of terminals need to communicate between each other but due to physical obstacles they cannot all listen to each other directly. Instead, each terminal first sends the information to the satellite through the upstream channel. The satellite listens to the upstream channel, receives the information and then retransmits to the downstream channel, to which all terminal can listen. Hence the upstream channel needs to be accessed by all terminals. Channels of this type are called multiple-access.If the terminals in a multiple-access channel are left unchecked so that they can transmit \u2026",

Information generated by the monitoring sensors needs to be routed efficiently to the location where the sink is currently located across multiple hops with different transmission energy requirements. We exploit the capability of the sink to be located in different places during network operation and give a novel linear programming formulation that maximizes network lifetime. We show that the maximum lifetime can only be achieved by solving optimally two joint problems: a scheduling problem that determines the sojourn times of the sink at different locations, and a routing problem in order to deliver the sensed data to the sink in an energy-efficient way. Our model provides the optimal solution to both of these problems and gives the best achievable network lifetime. We evaluate numerically the performance of our model by comparing it with the case of static sink and with previously proposed models that focus mainly on the sink movement patterns and sojourn times, leaving the routing problem outside the linear programming formulation. Our approach always achieves higher network lifetime, as expected, leading to a lifetime up to more than twice that obtained with models previously proposed as the network size increases. It also results in a fair balancing of the energy depletion among the sensor nodes.",

We present first a downlink resource allocation scenario; the analysis is then extended to multihop networks. The policy is evaluated via simulations and is seen to perform very well even in the non-asymptotic regime.

Before the beginning of transmission, each receiver knows a function of the messages of some of the receivers. This situation arises naturally in wireless and in particular cognitive networks where a node may overhear transmitted messages destined to other nodes before transmission over a given broadcast channel begins. We provide an upper bound to the capacity region of this system. Furthermore, when the side information is linear, we show that the bound is tight for the case of two-user broadcast channels. The special case where each user may know the whole or nothing of the message of each other node, constitutes a generalization of the index coding problem. For this instance, and when there are no channel errors, we show that the bound reduces to the known Maximum Weighted Acyclic Induced Subgraph bound. We also show how to convert the capacity upper bound to transmission completion lower bound and provide examples of codes for certqain information graphs for which the bound is either achieved of closely approximated.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of broadcasting in wireless networks, so that the power consumed by any node is as small as possible. This approach is motivated by the fact that nodes in such networks often use batteries and, hence, it is important to conserve energy individually, so that they remain operational for a long time. We formulate the problem as a lexicographic node power optimization one. The problem is in general NP-complete. We provide an optimal algorithm which runs in polynomial time in certain cases. We also provide a heuristic algorithm whose performance relative to the optimal one is fairly satisfactory. We next show that these algorithms can also be used to solve the problem of broadcasting so that the residual energy of any node after the broadcast process is as large as possible. Finally, we discuss the issues of implementing the above algorithms distributively, as well as their \u2026",
