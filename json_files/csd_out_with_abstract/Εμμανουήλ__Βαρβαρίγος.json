By its nature, global optimization of the edge resource deployment cannot by easily performed considering the number and the diversity of the players that will be involved in the edge computing arena. As a result, building and maintaining more and more edge-located resources for serving radio and application data will eventually lead to increased cost and energy consumption and resource underutilization. One way to overcome this predicament, is through virtual resource consolidation, where separate but efficiently interconnected edge resources appear as a single computing entity, serving radio and \u2026",

We propose a multi-cost scheme of polynomial complexity that performs immediate reservations and selects the computation resource to execute the task and determines the path to route the input data.

The proposed reservation schemes aim at reducing the end-to-end delay of a data burst, by sending the burst header packet (BHP) in the core network before the burst assembly is completed at the ingress node. We use linear prediction filters to estimate the expected length of the burst and the time needed for the burstification process to complete. A BHP packet carrying these estimates is sent before burst completion, in order to reserve bandwidth at each intermediate node for the time interval the burst is expected to pass from that node. Reducing the total time needed for a packet to be transported over an OBS network is important, especially for real-time applications. Reserving bandwidth only for the time interval it is actual going to be used by a burst is important for network utilization efficiency. In the simulations \u2026",

Tackling these problems is even more challenging since RES spillage minimization and energy cost minimization for the local energy community are set as major pre-requisites. In this paper, we consider a Microgrid Operator (MGO) that:(i) gradually decides the optimal mix of its RES and flexibility assets\u2019(FlexAsset) sizing, siting and operation,(ii) respects the physical distribution network constraints in high RES penetration contexts, and (iii) is able to bid strategically in the existing day-ahead energy market. We model this problem as a Stackelberg game, expressed as a Mathematical Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), which is finally transformed into a tractable Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The performance evaluation results show that the MGO can lower its costs when bidding strategically, while the coordinated planning and scheduling of its FlexAssets result in higher RES utilization, as well as distribution network aware and cost-effective RES and FlexAsset operation.

            "Abstract": "Recently there have been several historical changes in electricity networks that necessitate the development of Demand Side Management (DSM). The main objective of DSM is to achieve an aggregated consumption pattern that is efficient in terms of energy cost reduction, welfare maximization and satisfaction of network constraints. This is generally envisaged by encouraging electricity use at low-peak times. In this paper, we consider a system with strategic, price anticipating consumers with private preferences that choose their electricity consumption patterns so as to maximize their own benefit. In this context, we take on the problem of coordinating the consumers' consumption behavior without sacrificing their welfare (Quality of Experience). In order to tackle this problem, we draw on concepts of indirect mechanism design and propose a DSM architecture that is able to fulfill specific system-wide constraints (e.g. energy cost reduction) and simultaneously achieve welfare that is very close to optimal. The proposed billing rule preserves both the budget-balance and the individual rationality properties. According to our evaluation, the proposed DSM architecture achieves a close to optimal allocation (1%-3% gap), compared to an \"optimal\" system that would use central optimization of user loads without user consensus or protection of their privacy",

Similarly, when the load of a lightpath decreases below the low threshold, a lightpath is deactivated to release the underutilized network equipment. Reconfiguration algorithms use these thresholds to adjust the virtual topology to the constantly fluctuating IP traffic flows.

The architecture uses  wavelength converters and fixed-length delay lines that are combined to form either a multiple-input buffer or a  shared buffer. Both architectures are modular, allowing the expansion of the buffer at a cost that grows  logarithmically with the buffer depth, where the cost is measured in terms of the number of switching elements, and  wavelength converters are employed. The architectural design also provides a tradeoff between the number of  wavelength converters and their tunability. The buffer architectures proposed are complemented with scheduling  algorithms that can guarantee lossless communication and are evaluated using physical-layer simulations to obtain  their performance in terms \u2026",

Several optical interconnection solutions have been proposed for specific parts of the DC network, while more ambitious holistic all-optical architectures are being researched. The first applications of optics are for rack-to-rack or server-to-switches communications.

To account for signal degradation due to physical impairments, we model the effects of the path length, the path hop count, and the interference among ligthpaths by imposing additional (soft) constraints on RWA. The objective of the resulting optimization problem is not only to serve the connection requests using the available wavelengths, but also to minimize the total accumulated signal degradation on the selected lightpaths.

Energy Service Providers (ESPs) and end users (consumers) will mutually benefit from the cost reduction and the stability improvement that behavioral changes in the energy consumption can bring. Modern pricing schemes should be able to trigger these behavioral changes. As we argue in this paper, the energy pricing schemes proposed so far (e.g. Real Time Pricing) do not reward the users (energy consumers) that modify their behavior, and are therefore unfair and unable to trigger behavioral changes. Based on this research motivation, we develop a Behavioral Real Time Pricing (B-RTP) scheme, which offers an adjustable level of financial incentives to participating users, rewarding desirable behavioral changes (in the form of their Energy Consumption \u2026",

In multicost routing, each link is assigned a cost vector consisting of several parameters. These parameters are treated separately and are combined at the end of the algorithm using various optimization functions, corresponding to different routing schemes, for selecting the optimal path. The cost parameters we use are the hop count, the interference caused, the node residual energies, and the node transmission powers. We assume that nodes can use power control to adjust their transmission power to the desired level. The experiments conducted show that the combination of multicost routing and adjustable transmission power can lead to reduced interference and energy consumption, improving network performance and lifetime.",

We analyze different equipment, investigating where most failures occur and how these failures can be monitored. We conclude that in-band OSNR monitoring is the most important monitoring technique for failure localization purposes. We give a general probabilistic model for failure localization and assess its limitations using the mutual information metric.

This level of computational power is well beyond the reach of any single computer system, whether a common PC or a massively parallel supercomputer. Various ad hoc implementations have already successfully illustrated the Grid\u2019s potential. However, its true global success requires the development of thoroughly specialized supporting technologies, especially for the management of the grid resources. Unfortunately, the Grid\u2019s apparent constitution as a combination of already well-developed and mature technologies is, in fact, quite misleading [2]. The Computational Grid is both (1) a way to share resources and (2) a way to do things faster than a single computer can do. The critical resources in the Grid are the computational power, memory, communication bandwidth, and devices of all kinds that have to be shared [1]. Clearly, it is these resources that will account for the largest fraction of its cost. The remaining cost, which is mainly the cost of the application software to be used, is expected to decrease (to be amortized) as the number of users increase\u2014and there is no great penalty in distributing this software everywhere in the grid. The true waste occurs when the computational and the communication resources that are shared are not efficiently used. Therefore the development of protocols and algorithms for the efficient management of resources is a key to the success of grid computing [3]. Computers running a \u2026",

Certain physical effects cause choices for one lightpath to affect and be affected by the choices made for other lightpaths. This interference among lightpaths is particularly difficult to formulate in an offline algorithm, since in this version of the problem we start without any established connections, and the utilization of lightpaths are the variables of the problem. For this reason the majority of work performed in this field either neglects lightpath interactions or assumes a worst case interference scenario. In this article we present a way to formulate interlightpath interference as additional constraints on RWA and show how to incorporate these constraints in an IA-RWA \u2026",

Towards this goal, FLEXGRID develops innovative data models and energy market architectures (with high liquidity and efficiency) that effectively manage smart grids through an advanced TSO-DSO interaction as well as interactions between Transmission Network and Distribution Network level energy markets. Consequently, and through intelligence that exploits the innovation of the proposed market architecture, FLEXGRID develops investment tools able to examine in depth the emerging energy ecosystem and allow in this way: i) the financial sustainability of DER investors, and ii) the market liquidity/efficiency through advanced exploitation of DERs and intelligent network upgrades.",

The algorithm starts by transforming the wireless network topology into an auxiliary expanded graph that captures the WBA property, and assigning appropriate weights to the links so as to capture the WUT property. The proposed transformation is interesting on its own merit, since it permits us to consider only point-to-point transmissions (as in wireline networks) in the expanded graph, instead of the point-to-multipoint transmissions present in \u2026",

A variety of applications can benefit from Grid computing; among them data-intensive applications that perform computations on large sized datasets, stored at geographically distributed resources. In this context, we identify two important issues: i) data consolidation that relates to the handling of these data-intensive applications and ii) information aggregation, which relates to the summarization of resource information and the provision of information confidentiality among the different administrative domains. Data consolidation (DC) applies to data-intensive applications that need more than one pieces of data to be transferred to an appropriate site, before the application can start its execution at that site. It is true, though, that an application/task may not need all the datasets at the time it starts executing, but, it is usually beneficial both for the network and for the application to perform the datasets transfers concurrently and before the task\u2019s execution. The DC problem consists of three interrelated sub-problems:(i) the selection of the replica of each dataset (ie, the data repository site from which to obtain the dataset) that will be used by the task,(ii) the selection of the site where these pieces of data will be gathered and the task will be executed and (iii) the selection of the paths the datasets will follow in order to be concurrently transferred to the data consolidating site.

The important issue here is how to combine these impairment parameters into a scalar that would reflect the true transmission quality of a path. The training phase of the proposed IA-RWA algorithm is based on an optimization approach, called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), inspired by animal social behavior.

The traffic in metro and core networks is forecasted to grow in volume but also in dynamicity and the network operators face the challenge of shorter upgrades, influencing the cost efficiency and suppressing the return of investment. Thus, it is imminent to adopt a multi-period network planning approach and account jointly for the upgrade of the optical but also the IP edges of the network. In this work we formulate the problem of the incremental joint multi-layer planning of an IP over elastic optical network (EON) and propose an ILP formulation to solve it. Our objective is to deploy in a period the minimum additional network resources to cope with the changed traffic (CapEx) from the previous period, but also to minimize the changes for the transition between the two periods (OpEx).

More specifically, the adaptation of the modulation format to a more robust one can recover the quality of transmission (QoT) of a lightpath affected by a soft failure (i.e., a physical layer degradation resulting in QoT deterioration). In this scenario, increasing the robustness of a transmission may require a spectrum increase. Thus, the spectrum also might have to be reconfigured. In this paper, we propose spectrum sharing between lightpaths of classes requiring different rate guarantees. In the case of a soft failure, a high-priority, rate-guaranteed lightpath can expand its spectrum to recover its QoT at the expense of spectrum allocated to a lower-priority, guaranteed minimum rate lightpath.

These restricted node architectures have a smaller cost than the more flexible (and best performing) ones usually assumed in the RWA problem. This introduces an interesting tradeoff between the network performance achieved, in terms of network blocking and number of manual interventions required, and the cost of the node architecture used. In the process of comparing the node architectures, we propose an adaptation of an RWA algorithm that accounts for the lack of node flexibility, aiming to achieve using the constrained node architectures, performance similar to that obtained with the fully flexible node architectures.

We argue that it would be beneficial to have shorter upgrade cycles and a multiperiod network planning approach that accounts jointly for the upgrade of the optical but also the IP edges of the network.

In our scheme the transmission power used for the RTS frames is not constant, but follows a slow start principle. The CTS frames, which are sent at maximum transmission power, prevent the neighbouring nodes from transmitting their DATA frames at power levels higher than a computed threshold, while allowing them to transmit at power levels less than that threshold. Reduced energy consumption is achieved by adjusting the node transmission power to the minimum required value for reliable reception at the receiving node, while increase in network \u2026",

We categorize Grid tasks according to whether or not they demand hard performance guarantees. Tasks with one or more hard requirements are referred to as Guaranteed Service (GS) tasks, while tasks with no hard requirements are referred to as Best Effort (BE) tasks. For GS tasks, we propose scheduling algorithms that provide deadline or computational power guarantees, or offer fair degradation in the QoS such tasks receive in case of congestion. Regarding BE tasks our objective is to allocate resources in a fair way, where fairness is interpreted in the max-min fair share sense.

In the planning problem we assume that we are given the traffic matrix and the transponders' feasible configurations that account for the physical layer, and the objective is to serve the traffic and find a solution that minimizes the maximum spectrum used and the cost (number and type) of transponders. The offline RSA algorithm that we outline serves demands for their requested rates by choosing the route, breaking the transmissions in more than one connection and placing regenerators, if needed, and allocating spectrum to them. We then turn our attention to operating a flexible optical network. We assume that the spectrum allocated to a connection can be adapted so as to follow the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Synchronization in modern optical systems is of paramount importance. The sharing of a common time between different network components constitutes a crucial factor towards system stability. Latest advancements in optical access networks, such as Passive Optical Networks (PONs), allow transmission rates of 10 Gbps. Hence, a very accurate synchronization method is required in order to keep the network free of blocking and collisions. In this work, we focus on 10-gigabit-capable passive optical network (XG-PON) systems, one of the most popular standards for PONs. A rigorous analytic approach is devised so as to investigate the required precision of underlying synchronization method. Closed equations for computing the no blocking and blocking probabilities are developed. The devised analytic framework is verified using simulation methods.",

In this paper, however, we consider a system with strategic, price-anticipating consumers with private preferences that choose their electricity consumption patterns so as to maximize their own benefit. In this context, we take on the problem of coordinating the strategic consumers\u2019 consumption behavior so as to satisfy system-wide constraints without sacrificing their welfare.

Traditionally, high margins are added to account for the model\u2019s inaccuracy and the uncertainty in the current and evolving physical layer conditions, targeting uninterrupted operation for several years, until the end-of-life (EOL). Reducing the margins increases network efficiency but requires accurate QoT estimation. We present two machine learning (ML) assisted QoT estimators that leverage monitoring data of existing connections to understand the actual physical layer conditions and achieve high estimation accuracy. We then quantify the benefits of planning/upgrading a network over multiple periods with accurate QoT estimation as opposed to planning with EOL margins. ",

Our algorithm is optimal, in the sense that it can optimize any desired function of the total power consumed by the broadcasting task and the minimum of the current residual energies of the nodes, provided that the optimization function is monotonic in each of these parameters. Our algorithm has non-polynomial complexity, thus, we propose a relaxation producing a near-optimal solution in polynomial time.

To cope with both the energy and bandwidth requirements, and to overcome the limitations of the electrical interconnects, DCs will have to deploy optical technologies not only in rack-to-rack but also in smaller packaging modules and lower levels of their architectures, namely board-to-board, on-board, and even on-chip. In this chapter the architectures proposed for these packaging levels are briefly surveyed. Implementing and laying out complex topologies via optical waveguides on the on-board (Optical Printed Circuit Boards) level presents a number of issues that have to be considered when designing architectures for DCs. To address these issues, we outline appropriate and general lay-out strategies for both point-to-point and multi-point topologies for OPCBs.",

In multi-cost routing, a vector of cost parameters is assigned to each network link, from which the cost vectors of candidate paths are calculated. Only at the end these parameters are combined in various optimization functions, corresponding to different routing algorithms, for selecting the optimal path. The multi-cost routing problem is a generalization of the multi-constrained problem, where no constraints exist, and is also significantly more powerful than single-cost routing.

Despite the potential value of managing remote, scalable, or productive installations, there are currently very few integrated management systems that support WSN infrastructures, besides standard workstations and smart devices. Traditional network management priorities, such as fault, configuration, security, performance, accounting management, etc., need to be complemented by additional ones, such as energy conservation policing, code delivery, software updates, and topology consciousness in the case of WSNs. Most commercial infrastructure management (IM) systems use remote client or agent modules that convey network management (NM) and systems management (SM) functionality. Agents may vary in terms of operation, functionality, or presentation; they may run as user or system processes, support flexible types of installation, and they may support complex configurations and expose extensive or minimal graphical interfaces to users. IM agents typically exploit a family of management protocols by the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), including WBEM (Thompson, 1998), CIM (Tosic and Dordevic-Kajan, 1999), WMI (Microsoft technet, nd), SNMP (Chaparadza, 2005), and others.

As a result it can be considered as a promising platform for solving large scale intensive problems. For this reason, it can be considered as one of the hottest issues in the computer society. A computational intensive application which can be gained from such a Grid infrastructure is rendering, a process dealing with creating realistic computer-generated image and with many applications ranging from simulation to design and entertainment. To implement, however, a rendering process in a Grid infrastructure is to perform prediction of its computational complexity. This is addressed, in this paper, by using several neural network modules, each of which is appropriate for a given rendering process. For this reason, initially, a feature vector is constructed to describe with high efficiency the parameters affected the complexity of a rendering algorithm. The feature vector is estimated by parsing a file on a RIB format. Then, prediction is performed using a neural network model. Prediction of three types of rendering algorithms is examined; the Ray Tracing, the Radiosity and the Monte Carlo irradiance analysis.",

We consider the planning problem of an OFDM optical network, where we are given a traffic matrix that includes the requested transmission rates of the connections to be served. Connections are provisioned for their requested rate by elastically allocating spectrum using a variable number of OFDM subcarriers and choosing an appropriate modulation level, taking into account the transmission distance. We introduce the Routing, Modulation Level and Spectrum Allocation (RMLSA) problem, as opposed to the typical Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem of traditional WDM networks, prove that is also NP-complete and present various algorithms to solve it.

ORCHESTRA's high observability will rely on information provided by the coherent transceivers that can be extended, almost for free, to operate as software defined optical performance monitors (soft-OPM). Novel digital signal processing (DSP) OPM algorithms will be developed and combined with a novel hierarchical monitoring plane, cross-layer optimization algorithms and active-control functionalities. ORCHESTRA vision is to close the control loop, enabling true network dynamicity and unprecedented network capacity efficiency.",

The method relies on traffic monitoring at the optical network units (ONUs) and utilises readily available traffic information to predict the accumulated burst size of each respective ONU in the following cycle. They demonstrate that a significant delay enhancement can be accomplished by reporting the predicted, rather than the current, burst size to the optical line terminal (OLT). The author's simulation results show that a delay improvement of over 25% can be expected by the proposed method without modifying the well\u2010established interleaved polling scheme with adaptive cycle time dynamic bandwidth assignment scheme at the OLT.",

As a result, there is an increasing need for modern pricing schemes, which will effectively incentivize willing users to modify their energy consumption pattern to meet this objective. Current energy pricing schemes (e.g. real time pricing) treat all users the same, and do not adequately compensate for behavioral changes, thus mitigating the behavioral change dynamics. In this paper, we propose a Community Real Time Pricing (CRTP) scheme together with an Energy Community Formation Algorithm (ECFA), where users are clustered in Virtual Energy Communities (VECs) according to: (i) their level of flexibility in modifying their Energy Consumption Curve (ECC), and (ii) their relationships in Online Social Networks (OSNs \u2026",

Clearly, each utility must follow regulation rules regarding the proportion of RES units it must have in its energy mix, in order to avoid emission penalties. Following a decentralized market scheme, we address the problem of allocating a total amount of RE demanded by a set of utilities in a local market to individual RES microgrids (MGs) that can cover the demands, considering two supply policies. In the first policy, a RES producer is assumed to be able to split its production into smaller parts so that it can supply multiple utilities, and a simple allocation algorithm is presented.

Past similar studies used only space (routing) information and thus neglected spectrum, while they focused on old-generation noncoherent networks. The proposed framework accounts for correlation in both the space and spectrum domains and can be applied to both fixed-grid wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and elastic optical networks.

Their improved spectrum efficiency makes them a promising solution for next-generation backbone and metropolitan networks.

Traditional BBP as a metric fails to capture this phenomenon. In this work, a normalization of BP to the connection\u2019s hop distance is proposed and a novel low complexity algorithm is presented that takes this new metric into consideration. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves network performance and fairness with no deterioration of BBP, when compared to the FirstFit RSA algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "Routing is a primordial task in wireless ad hoc networks due to the multihop nature of packet relaying for both unicast (one-to-one) and multicast (one-to-many) communication. Furthermore, the lack of a fixed infrastructure makes energy efficiency a top priority in all operational aspects of these networks. This chapter focuses on energy-aware solutions for unicast and multicast routing, presenting a novel class of routing algorithms based on multiple criteria. According to this approach, each link\u2014and by extension, path\u2014is assigned a cost vector consisting of several cost parameters. After enumerating the candidate nondominated paths, the optimal is selected based on an optimization function. The algorithms are evaluated against well-known unicast and multicast strategies and are shown to result in improved and more balanced energy consumption.8.1 introductionEnergy plays a central role in the operation of wireless ad hoc networks. Given the lack of any kind of fixed infrastructure in these networks, energy is a scarce resource that directly limits their performance. Therefore, energy conservation and efficiency is a top priority for all protocols designed for wireless ad hoc networks, regardless of the layer of their operation. Furthermore, the multihop nature of the communication, along with the cooperative applications that these networks are often applied to, makes routing a cornerstone operation. In this context, energy-efficient routing algorithms are critical for wireless ad hoc networks and have deservedly attracted a great deal of research effort in the last few years.",

            "Abstract": "The efficient allocation of network resources is key to the overall performance and the quality of services provided. Thanks to their high data rates, optical networks are the cornerstone of present and future core, metro, access, and datacenter networking. Many works in the field, formulate resource allocation operations as offline combinatorial problems, assuming a known static traffic matrix, and use integer linear programming (ILP) as well as heuristics. In contrast, other works assume randomly generated traffic and propose online schemes that serve connection requests one by one. In practice, traffic in optical networks is neither static nor completely random, but is usually semi-periodic, following some (e.g., daily or weekly) pattern. We present a traffic-pattern-driven approach for elastic optical networks for serving immediate and in advance network requests, where the decisions of an offline process, optimizing \u2026",

In such networks the signal quality of transmission degrades due to physical layer impairments. In the multi-parametric approach, a vector of cost parameters is assigned to each link, from which the cost vectors of candidate lightpaths are calculated. In the proposed scheme the cost vector includes impairment generating source parameters, such as the path length, the number of hops, the number of crosstalk sources and other inter-lightpath interfering parameters, so as to indirectly account for the physical layer effects. For a requested connection the algorithm calculates a set of candidate lightpaths, whose quality of transmission is validated using a function that combines the impairment generating parameters.

The ARMONIA network monitors its status, and dynamically (re-) optimizes its configuration. ARMONIA leverages software defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) technologies. These technologies enable the access and metro convergence and the joint and efficient control of the optical and the IP equipment used in these different network segments. Network monitoring information is collected and analyzed utilizing machine learning and big data analytics methods. Dynamic algorithms then decide how to adapt and dynamically optimize the unified network. The ARMONIA network enables unprecedented resource efficiency and provides advanced virtualization services, reducing the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) and lowering the barriers for the introduction of new services. We demonstrate the benefits of the ARMONIA network in the context of dynamic resource provisioning of network slices.

In this context, there is a need for modern pricing schemes that will be able to effectively incentivize willing users towards modifying their energy consumption pattern based on current conditions. Existing pricing schemes treat all users the same, thus mitigating the behavioral change dynamics. To address this deficiency, we propose a Community Real Time Pricing (C-RTP) model, where users form communities and are charged according to the energy behavior of their entire community. The proposed C-RTP system is compared against the most widely accepted model in the literature, the RTP pricing model, and is shown to achieve lower energy cost (10%-15%) without sacrificing the end users' \u2026",

Our algorithm uses a max-min fair sharing approach for providing fair access to users. When there is no shortage of resources, the algorithm assigns to each task enough computational power for it to finish within its deadline. When there is congestion, the main idea is to fairly reduce the CPU rates assigned to the tasks so that the share of resources that each user gets is proportional to the users weight. The weight of a user may be defined as the users contribution to the infrastructure or the price he is willing to pay for services or any other socioeconomic consideration. In our algorithms, all tasks whose requirements are lower than their fair share CPU rate are served at their demanded CPU rates. However, the CPU rates \u2026",

The resources are partitioned in groups that serve GS users only, or BE users only, or both types of users with different priorities. Furthermore, the GS users are registered to the resources either statically or dynamically, while both single and multi-Cpu resources are examined. Finally the proposed resource configurations for providing QoS are implemented in the GridSim environment and a number simulations are executed. Our results indicate that the allocation of resources to both types of users, with different priorities, results in fewer deadlines missed and better resources utilization.

Currently, Grid computing using optical network infrastructure is dedicated to a small number of well known organizations with extremely large jobs (eg large data file transfers between known users or destinations [1]. Due to the static or semi-static nature of this type of Grids, long-lived wavelength paths between clients and Grid resources with centralized job management strategies are usually deployed (Lambda Grids). This type of Grid networking relies on carrier provision of optical network resources while the Grid users have no visibility of the lambda infrastructure. In other words, the Grid user is not able to setup paths over the optical Grid network.As Grid applications evolve, the need for user controlled network infrastructure is apparent in order to support emerging dynamic and interactive services. Examples of such applications may be high resolution home video editing, real-time rendering, highdefinition interactive TV, e-health and immersive interactive learning environments. These applications need infrastructures that makes vast amount of storage and computation resources potentially available to a large number of users. Key for the future evolution of such networks is to determine early on the technologies, protocols, and network architecture that would enable solutions to these requirements.",

The burst assembly schemes aim at minimizing (for a given burst size) the average delay of the packets incurred during the burst assembly process, while the fast reservation protocols aim at further reducing the end-to-end delay of the data bursts. The burst assembly techniques use a linear prediction filter to estimate the number of packet arrivals at the ingress node in the following interval, and launch a new burst into the network when a certain criterion, different for each proposed scheme, is met. The fast reservation protocols use prediction filters to estimate the expected length of the burst and the time needed for the burst assembly process to complete. A Burst Header Packet (BHP) packet carrying these estimates is sent before the burst is completed, in order \u2026",

Each CS faces a number of constraints related to the power that it can provide. In order to serve its EVs, each CS solves an optimization problem to derive the charging schedule, so that no constraints are violated and the energy needs of the parked EVs are met. The motivating problem is that centrally located CSs become congested and users that arrive later can no longer be served. In order to tackle this problem we propose a method for the stochastic estimation of Charging Stations' shadow prices based on a dual decomposition method applied to offline simulations. Prices are determined so as to serve as many EVs as possible and minimize the social cost while satisfying their constraints and \u2026",

The traffic volume in metro and core networks is forecast to grow at very high rates, exceeding 30% per year for the next five years, and if the corresponding energy requirements grow analogously, they will sooner rather than later form a bottleneck for network communications. Thus, energy efficiency in optical networks is mandatory for the sustainability of the future Internet. The objectives of the current work are to identify the main causes of energy consumption for current fixed-grid wavelength division multiplexing and future flex-grid optical networks, and to propose and compare techniques for improving their energy efficiency.

Our algorithm is optimal, in the sense that it can optimize any desired function of the total power consumed by the multicasting task and the minimum of the current residual energies of the nodes, provided that the optimization function is monotonic in each of these parameters.

We present the concept of a simplified DCN fabric that relies on a lean optical switch design of limited but scalable functionality that offers high reconfiguration speeds, real-time scheduling, efficient control and low equipment cost. To achieve these objectives, the proposed architecture relaxes the usual non-blocking switching requirements but opts for switching modules that are constrained in terms of the achievable space and wavelength input-output configurations.

This tool can be used by energy aggregators to represent groups of individual prosumers that can form the basis of their customer base.

Minimizing packet delay jitter is important in a number of applications, such as real-audio and streaming-video applications.

The architectural design uses wavelength converters and fixed feed-forward delay lines that are combined to form either a multiple-input buffer or a shared buffer. Both schemes are modular, allowing the logarithmic expansion of buffer size with the number of switching elements (wavelength converters).",

In this paper, we describe the experimental demonstration of a fully disaggregated white box, composed of two different types of transponders, monitors (including filtering effect parameter monitors), add-drop multiplexers, and switches. Toward this end, we developed an appropriate control and management plane for the white box based on NETCONF and YANG.

IoT (smart) end devices forward their traffic to the Internet, either by direct communication to LTE networks, or by multi-hop transmissions to a specific gateway. Acquiring both types of communication capabilities would be unnecessarily costly for IoT end devices. Instead, to lower the overall cost, only devices performing as gateways could be fully equipped with such capabilities, while the rest of the devices could have simple low cost wireless transmitters for forwarding the traffic towards a gateway. Towards this end, the decision on gateway placement is critical to provide low cost and Quality of Service (QoS). To address this design problem, we present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) that minimizes the total cost of the network with respect to the deployed devices, while achieving mandatory QoS \u2026",

Modern energy pricing schemes (e.g., real-time pricing) do not model the case that an energy service provider owns a shared ESS that its customers could take advantage of, even though a shared ESS is more efficient than the operation of many individual ESSs (i.e., personal ESS case). Thus, we propose a shared ESS aware real-time pricing model that achieves a very attractive tradeoff between the service provider\u2019s and end user\u2019s interests. We also compare our system with its predecessors and we witness its superiority. The proposed scheme allows energy consumers to use shared ESS and have cost-efficient energy services \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Small or very small energy prosumers who produce renewable energy and sell the energy surplus consumed find it difficult to participate in a liberalized electricity market. This happens due to the fact that the marginal costs of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) production are very low and so are the respective prices in the market. EU co-funded VIMSEN project\u2019s premise is that multiple RES prosumers are able to be grouped in virtual associations, which can represent their interests in a liberalized electricity market in a more efficient way. These so called \u201cVirtual MicroGrid (VMG) associations\u201d have greater negotiation power in the market and can even play the role of \u201cprice makers\u201d. This type of \u201cVMG infrastructure\u201d needs the aid of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to be realized. In this paper, we propose a Decision Support System (DSS) to be used by aggregators or Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), which monitors and manages decentralized RES prosumers, via a web-enabled software platform. The platform\u2019s implementation is based on virtualization techniques and a wide range of functionalities are described, tested and validated. Over 40 real-life prosumers\u2019 profiles are used and results of various decision-making algorithms show that under different formations of prosumers\u2019 groups (ie \u201cclusterings\u201d) can provide remarkable energy savings and monetary profits for the end users.",

We present a multi-cost routing algorithm that uses several cost parameters for each link. A set of candidate paths, called non-dominated paths, is obtained, and the optimum path is chosen according to an optimization function. The only limitation on the optimization function is that it is assumed to be monotonic with respect to each of the cost parameters. We compare the multi-cost routing algorithm for several choices of the optimization function with two traditional routing algorithms: the algorithm that chooses the widest-shortest path and the algorithm that chooses the shortest-widest path. The performance of the three algorithms is compared for a max-min fair share network. This network operation has been identi ed by the ATM Forum as one of the main design goals for ABR tra c management algorithms.",

In addition, the use of flexible transponders further increases the flexibility of such networks, bringing closer the optical and the IP layers. The joint planning and operation of both layers becomes crucial to reduce the capital and operational costs. To this end, in this paper we examine the planning problem of a multilayer (ML) flex-grid network from the perspective of capital expenditure taking into account modular IP/MPLS routers at the optical network edges along with tunable optical transponders. We propose a concise ILP formulation that jointly solves the ML planning problem. The formulation is \u2026",

For the specific adaptive routing scheme that we examine, we demonstrate that, for the hypercube and torus topologies considered, providing (at most) one alternate link at every hop gives a per-wavelength throughput that is close to that achieved by oblivious routing with twice the number of wavelengths per link. Also, we examine the effect of limited wavelength conversion in network performance and find that limited conversion to only one or two adjacent wavelengths can provide a considerable fraction of the improvement that full-wavelength conversion provides over no-wavelength conversion. These results clearly emphasize the need for network designers to investigate the tradeoffs between wavelength conversion, routing flexibility, and hardware cost when designing future optical networks.",

First, the optical transparency complicates failure localization and isolation procedures, as loss of light alarms stemming from a failure propagate downstream from the failure point. Besides, such a transparency implies that optical signals must traverse relatively long distances without electrical regeneration. In view of this, backup path computations must also account for all degradations introduced in the physical end-to-end path, thus ensuring their feasibility. Looking toward the optical core networks of the future, the EU DICONET Project has worked on cross-layer solutions to enhance network control and management with the impairment-awareness needed to govern the underlying optical layer.

DC arises when a task needs for its execution two or more pieces of data, possibly scattered throughout the grid network. In such a case, the scheduler and the data manager must select the data replicas to be used and the site where these will accumulate for the task to be executed. The policies for selecting the data replicas and the data consolidating site comprise the data consolidation problem. We propose and experimentally evaluate a number of DC techniques. Our simulation results brace our belief that DC is an important technique for data grids since it can substantially improve task delay, network load and other performance related parameters.",

We extend a multi-layer connection establishment algorithm to jointly optimize the energy consumption of both IP and optical layers. We compare the performance of the proposed energy-aware multi-layer connection establishment algorithm when applied to fixed-grid MLR and flexible optical networks, with that of an energy-unaware solution. We observe that energy savings can be achieved especially at the optical layer, when the proposed energy-aware algorithm is applied to a flexible, as opposed to a fixed-grid MLR optical network, while we also observed a tradeoff between blocking probability and energy efficiency in the case of flexible optical networks.",

To safely establish a lightpath for a new connection two main approaches can be used. The most common approach is to select a lightpath that has acceptable transmission quality under the worst case interference assumption. This ensures that the selected lightpath will not become infeasible due to the possible establishment of future interfering connections, but it sacrifices candidate path space for a quick and stable lightpath selection process. The second approach is to consider the actual current network utilization and account for the interference among lightpaths so as to perform a cross layer optimization between the network and physical layers.

The concept of grid computing is gaining popularity in the last decade due to the rapid growth of the Internet as a medium for global communication and the development of faster hardware and more sophisticated software. Grid computing clusters wide variety of geographically distributed computational resources, including supercomputers, PC's, PDA's and workstations, and presents them as a single unified integrated resource. Many computationally intensive problems can be solved within a more feasible/reasonable time and cost based on a grid infrastructure than using a single resource supercomputing scheme [2].A computationally intensive application, which can benefit from grid infrastructure, is rendering. Rendering is the process of creating realistic images from synthetic three-dimensional (3D) geometrical models and is an essential tool for many fields, ranging from simulation and design to education, entertainment and advertisement [3]. In order to implement a rendering algorithm to a grid infrastructure, two main issues should be addressed. The first refers to the parallelization of the rendering process, while the second to the way of allocating different tasks to the available resources. Parallelization of a rendering process can be performed in frame domain. In this case, each frame of the generated video sequence is handled independently from the previous frames and thus can be assigned to a different resource for processing. The second issue is solved by applying an appropriate scheduling scheme such as the Earliest Deadline \u2026",

Since photonic technology introduces new network building blocks, topology design for all the packaging levels should be reconsidered. This paper focuses on the on-board level of the packaging hierarchy, and proposes lay-out strategies for optical interconnection networks on optical printed circuit boards (OPCBs), based on direct topology families (tori, meshes and fully connected networks). We also describe a methodology for designing OPCBs given a set of input parameters, including building blocks specifications as well as traffic demands. The onboard topology design methodology generates all the feasible designs within the topology families examined, following our proposed OPCB lay-out approach, and \u2026",

However, transmission experiments in MLR networks have shown that physical layer interference phenomena are more significant between transmissions that utilize different modulation formats. Thus, the transmission reach of a connection with a specific modulation format/line rate depends also on the other connections that co-propagate with it in the network.

Through such services one will be able to reserve on demand raw network capacity and for a specific duration, in the form of virtual links or of virtual networks that interconnect branch offices, datacenters or devices around the world. In this work, we initially present the capacity services landscape as it is formulated and discuss on the relations with the cloud computing service model. Next, we propose optimal Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based mechanisms for matching network demands to networking capacity services, in the same way users' computing requirements can be matched to virtual computing instances. We show through simulations that the proposed mechanisms can optimize the bandwidth usage, while minimizing the cost associated with the use \u2026",

Since the energy crisis and environmental protection are of increasing concern in recent years, many research efforts are in use to save energy. In this context, the present research focuses on reducing the energy consumption of an IP over WDM backbone network using the lightpath bypass strategy. Schemes based on lightpath bypass strategy were previously proposed aimed at reducing energy consumption. Although these approaches, which perform aggregation of traffic, can increase the overall power saving, they suffer from low reuse of lightpaths. To overcome the above drawback this paper proposes a new efficient heuristic called Intelligent Search Lightpath Bypass (ISLB) which will focus on energy efficiency issues related to the planning phase of a WDM optical network.

Similarly, the central controller receives notifications when failures occur and (re)acts by reconfiguring the data plane.

An all-optical 2 x 2 exchange/bypass (E/B) switch based on the nonlinear operation of a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is considered as the basic building block of the scheduling switch as opposed to active SOA-based space switches that use injection current to switch between ON and OFF states.

            "Abstract": "The advent of WDM technology has resulted in transmission capacities that have increased manifold in recent years. The most common architecture used for establishing communication in WDM optical networks is wavelength routing, where data are transmitted over all-optical WDM channels, called lightpaths, which may span multiple consecutive fibers. A lightpath is realized by determining a path between the source and the destination and allocating a free wavelength on all the links of the path. The selection of the path and the wavelength to be used by a lightpath is an important optimization problem, known as the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem (Ramaswami & Sivarajan, 1995). In the absence of wavelength conversion, a lightpath must be assigned a common wavelength on each link it traverses; this restriction is referred to as the wavelength continuity constraint. However, two lightpaths may occupy the same wavelength, as long as they use disjoint sets of links; this property is known as wavelength reuse. The RWA problem is usually considered under two alternative traffic models. Static Lightpath Establishment (SLE) addresses the case where the set of connections is known in advance and Dynamic Lightpath Establishment (DLE) considers the case where connection requests arrive randomly, over an infinite time horizon, and are served one-by-one.The key elements that make WDM technology feasible are optical line terminals, optical add/drop multiplexers, and optical cross-connectors (Ramaswami & Sivarajan, 2001). An optical line terminal (OLT) includes multiplexers/demultiplexers of wavelengths and \u2026",

Since the NEPHELE architecture relies on shared optical rings, the isolation of VDC traffic is challenging. Observing its close resemblance to finding a bi-clique on a bipartite graph, which is NP-hard, we propose heuristic algorithms which find a solution by limiting either the spatial spread of racks that construct each VDC or their wavelength allocation. If a solution cannot be found, then the algorithms invoke a second de-fragmentation phase, where they re-allocate the racks of existing VDCs to concentrate them spatially and reduce traffic on the shared optical rings.

We present the concept of a simplified DCN fabric that relies on a lean optical switch design of limited but scalable functionality that offers high reconfiguration speeds, real-time scheduling, efficient control and low equipment cost. To achieve these objectives, the proposed architecture relaxes the usual non-blocking switching requirements but opts for switching modules that are constrained in terms of the achievable space and wavelength input-output configurations. We analytically compare the functionality and complexity of the simplified fabric with those of a non-blocking switch. We evaluate the throughput performance of the simplified DCN fabric and compare it to that of other fabrics with a different level of functionality and centralized control.",

To establish a lightpath for a new connection two main approaches can be used. The most common approach is to select a lightpath that has acceptable transmission quality under a worst case interference assumption, ensuring that the selected lightpath will not become infeasible due to the possible establishment of future interfering connections. This approach sacrifices candidate path space for a quick and stable lightpath selection, which is appealing from a complexity viewpoint. The second approach is to consider the current network utilization and account for the actual interference among lightpaths, performing a cross layer optimization between the network and physical layers. In this case, however, the algorithm has to check whether the establishment of the new lightpath turns infeasible some of the already established connections. The question that arises is whether the performance benefits that can be achieved through the second approach are worth the added complexity introduced by the cross-layer optimization applied.",

In contrast to single-cost routing, where each path is characterized by a scalar, in multicost routing a vector of cost parameters is assigned to each link, from which the cost vectors of the paths are calculated. These parameters are combined according to an optimization function for selecting the optimal path. Up until now the performance of multicost routing in ad hoc networks has been evaluated either at a theoretical level or by assuming that nodes are static and have full knowledge of the network topology and nodes' state. In the present paper we assess the performance of multicost routing, based on energy-related parameters, in mobile ad hoc networks by embedding its logic in the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) algorithm, which is a well-known distributed routing algorithm.

            "Abstract": "Efficient use of available bandwidth plays an important role in performance enhancement due to the wide penetration of high-bandwidth demanding services. The flexible nature of elastic optical networks (EONs) effectively uses spectral resources for communication by allocating the minimum required bandwidth to customer requirements. Since the energy consumption of such networks scales with the magnitude of bandwidth demand, many studies have addressed the issue of energy wastage in optical networks. Learning Automata are Artificial Intelligence tools that have been used in networking algorithms where adaptivity to the characteristics of the network environment can result in a significant increase in network performance. This work introduces a new adaptive power-aware algorithm, which selectively switches off bandwidth variable optical transponders (BVTs) under low utilization scenarios supporting energy efficiency. A novel algorithm which uses LA technology and significantly reduces the total energy consumption, while maintaining low bandwidth blocking probability (BBP), is proposed. LA mechanism applied in this work, aims to find the best number of BVTs to be switched off so as for the BBP not to be affected. Simulation results are presented, which indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves a power saving of up to 50%, compared to non-adaptive solutions.",

The technique utilizes least-mean-square polynomial regression for the estimation of incoming traffic and adaptive least-mean-squares filtering for the estimation of the EPON cycle duration. Given these estimates, the ONU successfully predicts its bandwidth requirements at the next available transmission opportunity and communicates this prediction, rather than its actual buffer occupancy, to the optical line terminal (OLT). The proposed scheme is assessed via simulations and it is demonstrated that a delay improvement of 30 % can be achieved without modifying the dynamic bandwidth assignment process at the OLT. In addition, we further explore aspects of traffic prediction combined with a max-min fair bandwidth redistribution scheme at the OLT. Initial results show that the \u2026",

Efficient scheduling policies should be evaluated based not only on performance metrics that are of interest to the infrastructure side, such as the Grid resources utilization efficiency, but also on user satisfaction metrics, such as the percentage of tasks served by the Grid without violating their QoS requirements. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm for tasks with strict timing requirements, given in the form of a desired start and finish time. Our algorithm aims at minimizing the violations of the time constraints, while at the same time minimizing the number of processors used. The proposed scheduling method exploits concepts derived from spectral clustering, and groups together for assignment to a computing resource the tasks so to a) minimize the time \u2026",

The proposed protocol is a two-way reservation scheme that employs delayed and in-advance reservation of resources. In this scheme delayed reservations may be relaxed, introducing a reservation duration parameter that is negotiated during call setup phase. This feature allows bursts to reserve resources beyond their actual size to increase their successful forwarding probability and is used to provide QoS differentiation. The proposed signaling protocol offers a low blocking probability for bursts that can tolerate the round-trip delay required for the reservations. We present the main features of the protocol and describe in detail timing considerations regarding the call setup and the reservation process.

Each state of an appliance is described by exactly one vector of power consumptions from a carefully designed set of such vectors (called atoms), that comprise a dictionary. The latter is constructed during a training phase, where it is assumed that individual power consumption signals are available. A clustering algorithm is applied on overlapping patches extracted from the training signals to select a fixed number of representatives, i.e., the atoms of the dictionary. Moreover, in the training phase, an appropriate state transition probabilities matrix is constructed. During the operation phase, where the actual disaggregation task is performed, a trellis, with a reduced number of transitions, is used for the acquisition of the disaggregated power consumption signals \u2026",

A technique that has gained considerable recent attention is cooperative diversity, where nodes are organized for transmitting the same signal to a given, often otherwise unreachable, node. The receiver combines the multiple receptions to reconstruct the original signal. In this work, we examine the routing and power allocation problem under such a cooperative communications model, so as to obtain a cross-layer design of the network and the physical layer.

Typically, these percentiles are estimated using histogram techniques. Positioning errors are statistically nonstationary due in large part to the time-varying satellite geometry. This time-variation is described in terms of the position dilution-of-precision (PDOP) parameter. Due to a relatively slow variation of PDOP, the position errors can be approximated as quasi-stationary over a sufficiently short time window. For these reasons, we present a time-windowing algorithm that (a) computes an appropriate time-window over which the position errors are locally stationary using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and (b) uses a kernel distribution estimator to compute percentiles. The performance of the algorithm is verified using a GPS positioning simulation with the position errors generated \u2026",
