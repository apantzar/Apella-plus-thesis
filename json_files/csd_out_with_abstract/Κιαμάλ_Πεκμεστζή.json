In this paper we propose a translation based hw/sw codesigned Java virtual machine architecture, which extends a typical embedded RISC processor. The architectural extensions we propose include special instructions that accelerate translated blocks dispatch and security checks for arrays and objects. The extensions are done in a way that operating systems support is maintained, something that makes their adoption more attractive. Benchmarking using Embedded Caffeine Mark (ECM) benchmarks, showed significant speedups, especially when high performance RISC processors are employed.",

Given the IDG FinFET dual gate mutual coupling and excellent control over the transistor conductive channel, simulations show that the proposed cell can operate as a regular memory cell, with Static Voltage Noise Margin of 341mV, Static Current Noise Margin of 15uA and provides soft-error immunity to particle strikes on single nodes, as well as considerable area savings compared to similar designs.",

However, the stack nature of the java virtual machine instruction set imposes a limitation on the achievable execution performance. If we intend to exploit instruction level parallelism, we must remove the stack completely. This can be achieved by recursive stack folding algorithms, such as OPEX, which dynamically transform groups of java bytecodes to RISC like instructions. However, the decoding throughputs that are obtained are limited. In this paper we propose a novel stack folding technique, that uses a predecoded cache to store folded bytecodes, thus enabling reuse. The decoding throughput reaches 4 RISC instructions per cycle. With use of a superscalar backend core, the obtained IPC is approximately 2.08 instructions per cycle (or 3.02 java bytecodes per cycle).",

We introduce the concept of perforation for approximate arithmetic circuit design and we explore the newly defined design space of hybrid designs showing that it leads to lower power consumption at every examined error range. To address the increased complexity of the target design space, we introduce an heuristic optimization technique and the corresponding design framework that \u2026",

While this ideas is mainly applicable to array multipliers, due to their regular interconnection scheme, the reduced area of the Wallace tree multiplier is a real temptation for the designer. Therefore, a mixed style architecture, using a traditional, tree based part, combined with a bypass, array based part, is proposed.

Therefore, a mixed style architecture, using a traditional, tree based part, combined with a bypass, array based part, is proposed. Through extensive experimentation it has been found that while the bypass technique offers the minimum dynamic power consumption value, the mixed architecture offers a delay*power product improvement ranging from 1.2x to 6.5x, compared to all other architectures. Furthermore, the tree part of the mixed architecture has enough timing slack \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Complex arithmetic operations are widely used in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications. Keeping the intermediate results in a redundant representation (e.g. carry-save) is a common technique to speed up chained arithmetic operations due to the elimination of the intermediate parallel additions which occupy significant area and largely increase the overall critical delay. Thus, arithmetic units with operands in a redundant representation are of considerable practical interest. In this work, we propose an efficient modulo 2 n +1 addition unit with one or both operands in the redundant carry-save representation and, also, we introduce an efficient modulo 2 n +1 multiplier with the one of two operands in the redundant carry-save form.",

The KMA is a fast divide and conquer algorithm for the multiplication of large numbers. As a result, the proposed circuit is highly efficient in terms of speed, area and power in comparison with the Conventional FIR filter architecture. Simulations of FIR filters in transposed form made over standard-cell implementation based on a Faraday 90nm technology show an average reduction of about 15% in the delay, 9% in area and 17% in power.",

The term 100% operational efficiency implies that no zero bits have to be inserted between successive input data words in order the filter input to be synchronized with the filter output. Both the input data and the filter output are in two's complement LSB-first bit-serial form. The coefficients are in two's complement bit-parallel form. All the intermediate results and the filter output are produced and handled in full precision. The proposed scheme is based on a special serial-parallel multiplier that operates with 100% efficiency. We exploit the internal registers and the free accumulation input in this multiplier to reduce the hardware complexity of the filter significantly. The proposed scheme is compared from the aspect of hardware complexity and efficiency with other bit-serial schemes.",

During the last five years, the development of Hardware Description Language (HDL)-based CNN accelerators, either for FPGA or ASIC, has seen huge academic interest due to their high-performance and room for optimizations. Towards this direction, we propose a library-based framework, which extends TensorFlow, the well-established machine learning framework, and automatically generates high-throughput CNN inference engines for FPGAs and ASICs. The framework allows software developers to exploit the benefits of FPGA/ASIC acceleration without requiring any expertise on HDL development and low-level design. Moreover, it provides a set of optimization knobs concerning the model architecture and the inference engine generation, allowing the developer to tune the accelerator according to the requirements of the respective use case. Our framework is evaluated by optimizing the LeNet CNN model on the MNIST dataset, and implementing FPGA-and ASIC-based accelerators using the generated inference engine. The optimal FPGA-based accelerator on Zynq-7000 delivers 93% less memory footprint and 54% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, and up to 10\u00d7 speedup on the inference execution vs. different Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Central Processing \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper a new technique for the design of combinational circuits for low power is introduced. The basic idea is to bypass blocks of logic when their function is not required, using low delay and area overhead components (transmission gates). The internal state of these blocks is kept unchanged, so the switching activity of the circuit is minimized, resulting to low dynamic power consumption. While this idea offers great savings mainly to array multipliers, due to their regular interconnection scheme, the reduced area and fast speed of tree multipliers is a real temptation for the designer. Therefore, a mixed style architecture, using a traditional, tree based part, combined with a bypass, array based part, is proposed. Through extensive experimentation it has been found that the bypass technique offers minimum power consumption for all cases while the mixed architecture offers a delay*power product improvement \u2026",

In the proposed design, the rows of the array are reduced to the half, compared to the initial multiplexer-based scheme, as two bits from both operands are processed at each step. The proposed scheme is compared to the Modified-Booth array multiplier and to the initial multiplexer-based array scheme. The compared designs are coded in VHDL and synthesized using the TSMC 0.13 \u00bcm technology library. The synthesis results of critical time and area show 11-22% improvement in critical time delay compared to the Modified-Booth array, in the expense of an area overhead of 3.8-16%. Compared to the initial multiplexer-based scheme, there is a significant improvement in terms of area and critical time.",

At a second level, the proposed pruning technique is combined with exhaustive exploration in order to guarantee the quality of design solutions. We show that the proposed methodology delivers (i) higher quality designs than exploration methods which do not account the introduced extended design space, (ii) with considerable reductions of the exploration's runtime and (iii) efficient convergence to global optima.",

In the parallel merged architecture, both the input data and the coefficients operate in bit-parallel form. In the serial merged architecture, input data enters the circuit in Modified-Booth encoded digits, while the coefficients are kept in bit-parallel form. The proposed schemes are based on a low latency filter structure, where adjacent multiply-add units are merged to reduce the number of carry-save registers of the accumulation path to the half. The computation of intermediate terms is implemented using the carry-save arithmetic. Based on theoretical estimation models of hardware complexity and switching activity, it is shown that the presented schemes result in circuits with reduced area and power consumption, compared to other parallel and serial FIR filter architectures presented in the bibliography.",

These effects impact the performance of designs gradually rather than abruptly, leading to timing violations in several timing-critical paths and thus shortening the system\u2019s lifetime. Therefore, the need for design methodologies predicting the impact of such phenomena is emerging. This paper presents a case study for a dominating interconnect reliability effect, Electro-migration, based on an MP-SoC platform with two LEON3 SPARC processors as kernels. The proposed flow studies the impact of Electro-migration on the timing-critical paths of the design and estimates the system\u2019s lifetime due to this effect. The presented case study may be used as a guide to estimate the impact of Electro-migration in the performance of complex, MP-SOC designs, based on a proposed analysis framework, which can be extended to the study of relevant interconnect reliability phenomena.",

In this work, we employ linear regression techniques to accelerate transistor variability estimation using static timing analysis (STA) tools. By identifying the variation-critical part of an arithmetic circuit, we reduce the transistor inventory that needs to be tracked by the STA solver.

In this brief, we propose VOSsim, a framework that extends state-of-the-art industry strength tools, to enable fast and accurate simulations of voltage overscaled circuits. We extensively evaluate VOSsim showing that it attains 99.2% output and 98.4% power accuracy, with an average speedup of 32\u00d7 in simulation time compared to high-precision SPICE simulations, i.e., the only available solution today for VOS-aware simulation.",
