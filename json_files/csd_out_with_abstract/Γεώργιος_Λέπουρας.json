            "Abstract": "Having realised the benefits resulting from delivering on-line public services in the context of electronic government, administrations strive to extend the spectrum of services offered to citizens and enterprises, as well as to engage multiple communication channels in service delivery, in order to increase the target audience and, consequently, the service effectiveness. Insofar, however, only the web channel has been sufficiently used for service delivery, whereas other channels have not been adequately exploited. One of the main reasons of this lag is the cost incurred for the development and maintenance of multiple versions of an electronic service, each version targeted to a different platform. In this paper, we present an approach and the associated tools for developing and maintaining electronic services that allows the automated production of different versions of the electronic service, each targeted to a specific platform.",

E-forms have a significant role in e-government, as they are the basis for implementing most of the twenty public services that all member states have to provide to their citizens and businesses. The aim of the SmartGov project is to specify, develop, deploy and evaluate a knowledge-based platform to assist public sector employees to generate online transaction services by simplifying their development, maintenance and integration with already installed IT systems. This platform will be evaluated in two European countries (in one Ministry and one Local Authority). This paper outlines key issues in the development of the SmartGov system platform.",

            "Abstract": "Web services are functional, independent components that can be called over the Web to perform a task. Web services are provided by organizations to enable others to perform tasks the organization offers online. However, with an ever increasing number of Web services, finding the Web service that performs a certain task is not always easy. Furthermore, adopting an end-user point of view what is needed is the actual result and not the service per se. It is often the case that more than one service have to be combined to produce the anticipated outcome, e.g. in the case of life-events. To this end, we propose an active, ontology-based blackboard architecture that aims at tackling the problems inherent in dynamic synthesis of composite Web services and at facilitating user interaction with complex e-government transactions.",

Each electronic service contains a substantial amount of knowledge in the form help texts, rules of use or legislation excerpts, examples, validation checks, etc. This knowledge has been extracted from domain experts when the services were developed, especially in the phases of analysis and design, and was subsequently translated into software. In the latter format though, knowledge cannot be readily used in organizational processes, such as knowledge sharing and development of new services. In this paper, we present an approach for reverse engineering electronic services in order to create knowledge items of high levels of abstraction, which can be used in knowledge sharing environments \u2026",

In a preliminary study, it was found that most of the 1 st year students at the Department of Computer Science and Technology (University of Peloponnese) use Facebook daily and many hours per day. It was decided that Facebook would be used as a complementary teaching tool for the course of \u201cResearch Methodology in English\u201d(1 st year course). In total, 66 students attended the classes, all between 18-19 years of age. The course instructor created a new profile on Facebook (not a specific group, but seen as a physical person) and asked students to send friendship requests. The vast majority of students included the instructor in their friends\u2019 lists (55 friend requests). The students were also aware that this was a research process and their participation is valuable. From the first day of use, the students were given a usage diary and were asked to fill in at least 5 logs each, in which they should write down the date of use, the duration, the medium (PC, mobile phone, etc.), the purpose of visit, difficulties they faced, any other comments. The diaries were collected at the end of the term. In addition, students were asked to answer a small questionnaire at the beginning of the term, to identify their cognitive style, since one of the main research hypotheses was that social media might be more beneficial for certain cognitive styles, rather than others (ie extroverts vs. introverts). The students\u2019 cognitive styles would be compared at the end of the term with their overall course mark (to see whether certain cognitive styles managed \u2026",

The assessment showed that hand-held devices can be easier to use and faster for data input. A numeric keyboard can offer fast input for positive, small numbers, while the gamepad-based method can offer uniform performance.

We are looking for quick and efficient ways to provide the visitor with appropriate learning content. The option of adaptivity seems very promising due to the fact that the available time for learning within a museum is very limited both because a person might only visit once and also because a typical visit does not usually exceed some minutes. For example, Falk (1991) found that a typical family visit lasted from 31 minutes to 105 minutes, from which the orientation period was between 3-10 minutes, the intensive looking period was between 15-40 minutes, the exhibit cruising period was between 20-45 minutes and the leave taking period between 3-10 minutes. Falk, et al.(1985) also found that visitors\u2019 had an attention span of 30-45 minutes. After that, their attention dropped rapidly. In another study by Serrell (1998), it was found that 82% of visitors spent less than 20 minutes in different exhibitions (110 in total) of various sizes. From all the above, it becomes apparent that the time given for learning is very limited. To this end, it seems important to provide the visitor with personalized experience. Quick adaptivity seems like a good approach to the problem. However, and again due to time restrictions, we do not have the possibility of asking the visitor specific quest\u0131ons that w\u0131ll enable us to \u0131dent\u0131fy \u0131nd\u0131v\u0131dual features\u2013a very necessary aspect of the personal\u0131zat\u0131on process.

In this paper, we present a generic method for providing seamless communication between the two platforms, enabling the full integration of documents submitted through electronic services into the organisational workflow, thus leveraging the quality of services offered to citizens and facilitating e-service development and operation.",

In this paper, we present an approach for reverse engineering e-services, in order to formulate knowledge items of a high level of abstraction, which can be made available to the employees of the organizations. Moreover, the knowledge items formulated in the reverse engineering process are stored into a knowledge-based e-service development platform, making them readily available for use in the development of other services. 1",

While such motivation is worthy, the results are often less than ideal. In raising awareness of the shortcomings of localisation, we hope to improve the prospects for successful second-language support. To this end, the present paper describes three varieties of linguistic irregularity that we have encountered in localised systems and suggests that these anomalies are direct results of localisation. This underlines the need for better end-user guidance in managing local language resources and supports our view that complementary local resources may hold the key to second language user support.",

In this paper we present an active blackboard architecture, which automates the task of service composition based on the semantics of individual services and data dependencies between them. The blackboard incorporates registries, which facilitate service discovery and an execution engine that arranges for dynamic service composition and execution.",

Of particular importance is that spreading activation can be applied locally to a dynamic selfselecting working set of an (practically) unbound linked data collection, as well as globally to the entire collection.

Historic research involves finding, using, interpreting and correlating information within primary and secondary sources, in order to understand past events. The collection of historical data is accomplished through methodical and comprehensive research in primary and secondary sources. An important factor in our study was to understand what kind of data and/or information historians are looking for in a library/historical archive, either printed or digitized, and which research methodologies or research models they use while they investigate a historical archive. Since this issue has not been addressed insofar, and therefore there are no methods for elucidating research methodologies or research models that historians employ / use, we formulated a questionnaire comprising of seven information retrieval tasks commonly addressed in the context of historic research. History researchers were asked to describe in detail how they would proceed in searching for the information they need for completing these tasks. Through this procedure we aimed to investigate the different ways a historian can use to tackle a specific question, examine whether there exists a common research methodology, and the historic researchers' expectations and preferences. The insight gained from this investigation can be used for educational purposes, since it could be useful in the creation / development of a methodology for conducting research on historical information. Furthermore, the findings can be exploited in the \u2026",

The proteomics results (large sets of identified proteins or peptides) that originate from several workflow steps, play an important role in the analysis of a proteomics experiment. As a result, the area of high-through-put proteomics created new visualization challenges in interpreting large-scale datasets. We present VIP, an interactive visualization tool for proteomics data, which integrates protein or peptide features emanating at every step of the proteomics analysis and combines them visually in synthetic maps. Our novel tool offers the flexibility to choose any desired features according to the analysis objectives, examine simultaneously more than one maps and interact with the visualization by querying and filtering the results.

Personality characteristics like cognitive style, seem to affect how efficiently and effectively learners perceive the knowledge. Cognitive style deals with the way learners perceive information and is a significant feature in improving programming learning.

This facility, that we term 'dynamic annotation', affords a means of editing Web page content 'on-the-fly' between the source Web server and the requesting client. Thereby, we have a generic way of modifying the content displayed to local users by addition, removal or reorganising any information sourced from the World-Wide Web, whether this derives from local or remote pages. For some time, we have been exploring the scope for this device and we believe that it affords many potential worthwhile applications. Here, we describe two varieties of use. The first variety focuses on support for individual users in two contexts (second-language support and second language learning). The second variety of use focuses on support for groups of users. These differing applications have a common goal which is content enrichment of the materials placed before the user. Dynamic annotation provides a potent and flexible means to this end.",

The study investigates the benefits of students' involvement with robotics about skills, motivation and learning. Additionally, it is researched weather ER should be introduced in the Greek compulsory curricula. A qualitative methodology was used and although the sample was relatively small (N= 18), the results were quite homogeneous showing a very high level of engagement and motivation of teachers and students. The results show that there are numerous benefits for students: they seem to increase their collaboration, problem solving and creativity skills; understand STEM concepts about computer science and engineering and especially gaining programming knowledge. Moreover, most of the teachers consider that ER should be part of the compulsory curriculum.",

Besides being used individually to deliver some well-specified functionality, Web services may be used as building blocks that can be combined to implement a more complex function. In such compositions, typically some Web services produce results that are used as input for Web services that will be subsequently invoked. In the execution schemes currently employed, Web services producing intermediate results deliver them to some \"coordinating entity\", which arranges the forwarding of these intermediate results to Web services that require them as input. In this paper we present an execution scheme that employs direct communication between producers and consumers of intermediate results.

Insofar, application designers model user profiles mainly in an ad-hoc manner, hindering thus application interoperability at the user profile level, increasing the amount of work to be done and the possibility of errors or omissions in the profile model. This work aims at creating a user profile ontology that incorporates concepts and properties used to model the user profile. Existing literature, applications and ontologies related to the domain of user context and profiling have been taken into account in order to create a general, comprehensive and extensible user model. This ontology can be used as a reference model, in order to alleviate the aforementioned issues. The model, available for download, is exemplified through its application in two different areas, personal information management and adaptive visualization.",

In such a framework the focus is mainly on how better to handle the information collected. Task Information Management (TIM) on the other hand adopts a more usercentric view and aims to support users in performing their tasks. Possible ways of achieving this are to automatically find data users need in order to perform a task, to automate the execution of tasks and the synthesis of new more abstract tasks by identifying tasks users carry out often. PIM and TIM can be seen as complimentary since an efficient organization of personal information can help in the discovery of data relevant to a task. To this end, it is necessary to adopt a holistic approach in the design and implementation of a Task Information Management System.",

Besides development activities, electronic shopping has attracted the attention of researchers, who have studied various perspectives, including user attitude, critical success factors, security, technical aspects, and so forth (eg, Fang & Salvendy, 2003; Wang, Makaroff, & Edwards, 2003). Two main concerns for e-commerce are personalization and enhancement of user experience.

A game was designed and implemented in order to test this hypothesis. To investigate this topic a comparative study of two similar prototypes (mouse input vs. Kinect input) of a 2D game about the history of photography was conducted. Two different groups tested these two prototypes. The first findings from the pilot experiments indicated that using voice and gestures as an input method caused higher user valence and dominance than the use of mouse.

Here we report our observation on a novel avb3-targeting liposome formulation (RGD-LP) and on the corresponding non-targeting control (NT-LP) for diagnosis and molecular imaging of tumor by exploiting SPECT/MRI technology. Radiolabelling was performed with 99mTc tricarbonyl core via the ligand cysteine (Cys). Both peptide and ligand were coupled to DSPE-PEG2000-Mal lipid. Radiochemical purity and in vitro stability tested in the presence of competitive ligands for 99mTc (I) were assessed by paper chromatography. For nuclear imaging a custom SPECT system (1.5 mm spatial resolution) was used and the results were correlated to the biodistribution data. Both liposomes disposed of a PEG surface density of 5.5% and were loaded with 25% of Gd-based lipid (B2286) for MRI studies. For recording MR images, cells were transferred into glass capillaries, centrifuged and placed in an agar phantom. MR images were acquired on a Bruker Avance300 spectrometer operating at 7.1 T. In vivo MRI experiments were carried out on U87MG tumor xenografts with a 1T scanner (Bruker, Icon Instrument).Radiolabelling yield (> 80%), radiochemical purity (> 90%), in vitro stability in the presence of excess amount of cysteine and in 10% FBS/DMEM were satisfactory to permit in vivo evaluation at normal mice.

Using the XML language to develop such a model offers a number of additional advantages, such as rich semantics, facilitation of data interchange, extensibility, high abstraction levels, and possibility for mechanical processing. In this paper, we present the design aspects of an XML model for electronic services, which has been used for building a repository of interlinked elements representing e-services. A web-based interface for the management of this repository and a tool for automatically compiling e-service descriptions into executable images have been developed alongside. The model has been evaluated by a mixture of electronic service stakeholders, and the results of this evaluation are also presented.",

It comes to a point where the massive of content in social media makes it a tedious procedure to contact the appropriate audience, the people that would really be stimulated by cultural information. In this notion, we assume that establishing conversations of high impact can possibly guide the cultural venues to audiences that can benefit more. These conversations usually include the so called influencers, users whose opinion can affect many people on social media; the latter usually referred to as followers. In this research paper we examine the characteristics of the influencers that can affect the procedures of a cultural venue on social media. The research is done within the scope of \u2026",

While developing an e-service, it is usually possible to reuse elements that have already crafted for other e-services, such as personal detail forms or widgets for collecting social security numbers, decreasing thus both development effort and the time for deployment. A more generic framework for supporting reusability in development of e-services includes the identification of reusable objects, the creation and population of a repository containing such components, and the empowerment of developers with tools allowing for location, retrieval and adaptation of components for suiting their specific tasks. In this paper, we conduct an analysis to recognise e-service component that offer reusability opportunities and we present facilities and methods to enable e-service \u2026",

Although rapid application development environments such as MS Visual. NETTM (Visual .NET, 2005) and DelphiTM (Borland Delphi, 2005) have to some extent employed reusability of components to aid the fast implementation of software applications, the extent to which existing objects can be used again in the implementation of new software systems is usually limited to basic building blocks of the interface.

Accommodating unanticipated changes implies that systems must be able to adapt to changes occurring in and evolve in step with their changing environment. Adaptation is concerned with monitoring, analysing and understanding the patterns of the user\u2019s interaction with the system. Similarly, an information system is said to be evolutionary if it can be purposefully used in a dynamic environment. E-government information systems, in virtue of their nature and function, are driven by the need to adapt and evolve. This suggests that the design and implementation of such systems must provide the necessary infrastructure for evolution and adaptability. In other words, egovernment information systems must abide to the Tailorable Information Systems paradigm. In this work we present a case study for the development of a Tailorable e-government information system.",

It also presents an overview of the methodology, elaborating on the individual methodology steps; in particular, the processes for determining the visitors\u2019 perception of the museum (degree of museumness); the museum needs that require to be supported; the educational approach to be adopted; the relevance to life-long learning activities; the approach to adaptivity; and user involvement have been reviewed.",

The main reason for this lag is that traditional software engineering approaches cannot satisfactorily handle all of electronic services lifecycle aspects. In this paper we present experiences from the Greek Ministry of Finance\u2019s e-services lifecycle, and propose a new approach for handling e-service projects. The proposed approach has been used successfully for extending existing services, as well as developing new ones.",

The profiler, based on an ontology of the users\u2019 domain, enables them to create their personal ontology by initially choosing one of the available template ontologies as a starting point, which they subsequently populate and customize. The profiler employs a web interface which allows users to populate their personal ontology through forms, hiding ontology complexities and peculiarities.

In an effort to eliminate this phenomenon, museums, institutes and organisations (MIOs) adopt more attractive, engaging and fun content to provide a high quality and fast learning experience. Games seem to be an interesting suggestion to this approach but they are time consuming. To this end, we introduce nano-games. We define nano-games as short, easy to master, self\u2013contained games of a single level of difficulty, having basic and direct rules that stay unaltered throughout the play and challenge players with clearly defined goals reachable within tens of seconds of gameplay. This approach has been adopted and evaluated in the premises of European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN).",

However, the pace with which electronic services are made available and adopted is lower than planned or expected; governments tend to be slow in releasing new services, and citizens often prefer to conduct business with the government through paper forms and physical presence, rather than using online methods. This indicates that certain barriers exist that hinder the transition to electronic services. In this paper, we present the results of a survey among electronic service stakeholder groups, to identify the most important barriers to electronic service development.

Adding new exhibits to the story requires curators to identify for each exhibit its aspects that fit to the message of the story and position the exhibit at the right place in the story thread. The availability of rich semantic information for exhibits, allows for exploiting the wealth of meanings that museum exhibits express, enabling the automated or semi-automated generation of practically countless stories that can be told. Personalization algorithms can then be employed to choose from these stories the ones most suitable for each individual user, based on the semantics of the stories and information within the user profile.

Methods are selected by examining parameters related to the user profile, system configuration and the set of data to be visualized, and employing a set of rules to assess the suitability of each method.

            "Abstract": "Most existing human-computer interfaces are now based on the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers) paradigm and on the desktop metaphor. Each application is targeted towards editing one specific type of \u201cdocument\u201d. Current desktop oriented systems propose a mostly disconnected set of generic tools (word processor, e-mail reader, drawing tool, CD burning application, etc.). In such a setting, a user which is executing a specific task (eg making a CD from a set of files) will likely use more than one of these tools. The fact that they are running on one system without being connected leads to awkward situations such as the user reentering or copying data between applications. Furthermore, the same user is very likely to run multiple times the same task and often, she will do this in a similar manner. For example, a music fan will likely find himself burning more than one music CD. Having a system which is aware that some task is being run would allow for some anticipation and could relieve the user from much routine procedures.To provide the user with complete power of her desktop computer, we propose the idea that she should be provided with a system having knowledge of her specific tasks. Such a task-oriented system should be designed to aid the user in managing her day-to-day tasks and helping her gain in efficiency. We consider that both tasks themselves and how they are to be lead are specific to each user. Building a system which is both adapted to the user and simple enough for being used by a non-expert user, is a challenge. At one extent, full adaptability is asking the user to specify herself her tasks. At the other extent \u2026",

In the present study, issues of visiting style were explored and statistical significance was found once different factors were analyzed. Most importantly, there seems to be a connection between the way people move in a museum and the way they prefer to approach and process information cognitively.

Online shops, often called virtual shops offer customers the possibility to buy products through Internet. E-learning on the other hand encompasses technologies that allow teachers and students to interact either synchronously or asynchronously.",

In addition, kinesthetic parameters are also important, since the user movement can affect the overall experience. The present study focuses on human factors in conditions that the physical and the virtual world sounds are contradicting. Kinesthesis is also considered and combined with user vision and hearing. There were 2 experimental conditions, in one the users experienced three levels of sound-vision in a virtual world and no sound on the physical world, while they are walking on a smooth surface and in the second experimental condition, the same three levels of sound \u2026",

Virtual Reality can offer a number of advantages to museums, offering a way to overcome some common problems like the lack of space or the need of visitors to interact with the exhibits. A broad categorisation of virtual museums reveals that they vary from fully immersive cave systems to simple multimedia presentations. In our approach to develop a virtual reality museum we have designed a virtual environment (VE) where guests can visit a total of ten different museums. The processes of digitisation, architectural design and exhibit presentation are outlined and points of particular importance are explained. Exhibits from the real world museums have been digitised and integrated in the VE. The system has been implemented in two versions: one fully immersive and one with a stereo display.",

The language of the application is often at variance with the native language of its users. This issue is frequently addressed through localization. In turn, localization generates a range of new problems. We propose an alternative to localization that is analogous to cinematic subtitles. This has the potential to reduce the user interaction defects that otherwise arise with localization whilst benefiting users through an additional channel of information in their own language. This paper outlines a prototype implementation and describes our initial evaluation of this approach. We suggest that our complementary \u2018subtitles\u2019 promise consistent support for all applications in the user's computing environment and yield a system that is expandable and much easier to maintain than pre-localized software.",

We look at issues relating to interaction and'appropriate intelligence', at different types of context that arise and at architectural lessons we have learnt.

In this process, historians employ their scientific knowledge, experience, and intuition to formulate queries (who was involved in an event, when did an event occur etc.), and subsequently try to locate the pertinent information from their sources. In this article, the authors investigate how historians formulate queries, which query terms are chosen, and how historians proceed in searching for related information in sources. The insight gained from this investigation can be subsequently used for organizing documents within historical source repositories and building tools that will enable historians to access the needed information more rapidly and fully.",

This study investigates two alternative teaching methods (collaborative learning and peer tutoring) and compares the learning results to the traditional learning context. A test was used to measure all participating students\u2019 learning results and a questionnaire was distributed to record participant student attitudes towards the alternative teaching conditions. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate each aspect in terms of perceived knowledge, experience, satisfaction, diversity, oddness and interest. The analysis explores potential differences of students\u2019 learning results between alternative and traditional teaching and also differences in the two aspects in relation to students\u2019 preferences.

The proposed framework (ATMF) summarizes the benefits of alternative teaching methods in contrast with known issues of traditional teaching. In addition, ATMF is built upon empirical evidence and concludes that alternative practices, if used under the right conditions, can provide increased motivation for learning and better learning outcomes.",

In this paper, we investigate these aspects to obtain insights into their advantages and disadvantages and suggest solutions in the area of PIM, as well as in other domains employing similar visualization paradigms. The presented study focuses on the two most widespread visualizations used by file browsers, the indented list and zoomable interface paradigms, and assesses their effectiveness for various tasks and contexts, both by exploiting results on existing evaluations on hierarchy visualizations and folder hierarchy visualizations in particular, and by conducting an interview-based user study.",

It argues whether the task of developing adaptive virtual reality museums is a complex one, presenting key challenges, and should thus be facilitated by means of a supporting architecture and relevant tools. The proposed architecture is flexible enough to cater for a variety of user needs, and modular promoting extensibility, maintainability, and tailorability. Adoption of this architecture will greatly simplify the development of adaptive virtual reality museums, reducing the needed effort to exhibit digitisation and user profile specification; user profiles are further refined dynamically through the user data recorder and the user modelling engine, which provide input for the virtual environment generator.",

            "Abstract": "Small animal imaging has been well proven as a robust tool to non-invasively study the biodistribution of various biomolecules. A number of imaging systems are commercially available but with high purchase and maintenance costs. For this reason, we present the \u201c\u03b3-eye\u201d, a dedicated \u03b3-camera suitable for in-vivo scintigraphic molecular imaging. The \u201c\u03b3-eye\u201d is a unique benchtop system with 5 \u00d7 10 cm2 field-of-view for whole-body mouse imaging.The \u201c\u03b3-eye\u201d is based on two PositionSensitivePhotomultiplierTubes H8500 coupled to a CsINa pixelated scintillator and a low energy parallel hexagonal hole collimator. The external dimensions of the entire system, including all required electronics, are 45 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 15 cm3. All studies can be stored as raw data and in DICOM format and are handled through a Database-Manager. The software supports a real-time viewer mode with \u2026",

The platform's architecture is modular, allowing the introduction of new functionality or connection to new systems to collect needed data. All data can be analyzed and presented though interactive visualizations to find correlations between metrics, to make predictions for students or student groups, to identify best practices for instructors and let them explore 'what-if' scenarios, to offer students personalized recommendations and personalized detailed feedback, etc. Our objective is to inform and empower all stakeholders to improve the learning experience.",

            "Abstract": "In the information era, enterprises strive to be productive and efficient. One feature of this goal is for employers to engage their employees in education programmes, to help them to gain new experiences and knowledge and to adapt to an ever-changing working environment. Such programmes must be carefully designed in order to achieve satisfactory results. Recently, enterprises, recognising the role that technology can play in the education of their employees, have adopted systems that supplement the traditional educational model with mechanisms that enable the sharing of experiences and knowledge. In this paper, we describe an architecture and a system prototype that allows users to search easily for information, interact with colleagues and share experiences, and to compose and disseminate best practices and knowledge. The design of this system is based on insights gained from the operation of the \u2026",

File browsing, in particular, has an inherent hierarchical structure and plays an important role in the context of personal information management (PIM). A multitude of file browsers are nowadays available, offering different functionalities, while users adopt diverse practices and habits for browsing activities. In this paper, we investigate these aspects to obtain insights into their advantages and disadvantages and suggest solutions in the area of PIM, as well as in other domains employing similar visualization paradigms. The presented study focuses on the two most widespread visualizations used by file browsers, the indented list and zoomable interface paradigms, and assesses their effectiveness for various tasks and contexts, both by exploiting results on existing evaluations on \u2026",

This is especially the case regarding European history, which is highly interconnected by nature; however, most History-related experiences that are today offered to the greater public, from schools to museums, are siloed. The CrossCult project aims to provide the means for offering citizens and cultural venue visitors a more holistic view of history, in the light of cross-border interconnections among pieces of cultural heritage, other citizens viewpoints and physical venues. To this end, the CrossCult project will built a comprehensive knowledge base encompassing information and semantic relationships across cultural information elements, and will provide the technological means for delivering the contents of this knowledge base to \u2026",

In such a case except from the usual perception problems, users confront additional problems due to the unfamiliar language.To tackle the problem a number of methodologies have been proposed and are currently in use. All existing methodologies focus on the stage of software design, aiming to develop products that overcome the problem. However, their application has shown that not only they cannot solve efficiently the problem, but, in some cases they generate new side effects.",

Existing work has shown that spreading activation can be used to model context over small personal ontologies, which can be used to assist in various user activities, for example, in auto-completing web forms. This previous work is extended and methods are developed by which large external repositories, including corporate information and the web, can be linked to the user's personal ontology and thus allow automated assistance that is able to draw on the entire web of data. The basic idea is to augment the personal ontology with cached data from external repositories, where the choice of data to fetch or discard is related to the level of activation of entities already in the personal ontology or cached data. This relies on the assumption that the working set of highly active entities is relatively small; empirical \u2026",
