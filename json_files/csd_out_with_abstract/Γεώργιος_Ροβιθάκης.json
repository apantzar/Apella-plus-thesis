            "Abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of force/position tracking for a robot with revolute joints in compliant contact with a kinematically known planar surface. A novel controller is designed capable of guaranteeing, for an a priori known nonsingular initial robot condition, (i) certain predefined minimum speed of response, maximum steady state error as well as overshoot concerning the force/position tracking errors, (ii) contact maintenance and (iii) bounded closed loop signals. No information regarding either the robot dynamic model or the force deformation model is required and no approximation structures are utilized to estimate them. As the tracking performance is a priori guaranteed irrespectively of the control gains selection, the only concern is to adopt those values that lead to reasonable input torques. Finally, a comparative simulation study on a 6-DOF robot illustrates the performance of the proposed controller.",

Assuming full state measurement, a state feedback controller is firstly constructed to solve the problem and subsequently its output is constrained via the utilization of a carefully selected saturation function to preserve the stability and performance attributes established in its absence. Finally, at a third stage the actual system states are replaced by the states of a high gain observer to formulate an output feedback controller.

Packet switching is employed to optimize the use of the bandwidth available in a network and to minimize the latency, a measure of time delay experienced in a system. According to TCP, every continuous data stream must be segmented into several packets if it exceeds a predefined threshold. To establish or terminate a connection, TCP follows a specific procedure according to which both the source and the destination have to state their starting sequence numbers, information crucial to establish a robust communication. In a packet switching scheme, prior to transmitting a piece of information, the source divides the total amount of data into fundamental units of information called packets. Depending on the network, each packet can be of fixed \u2026",

The proposed controller guarantees compliance of the operated manipulator strictly within preselected spatial limits. Specifically, by introducing a nonlinear stiffness term into the control design, the manipulator is prevented from colliding with an explicitly defined hard boundary, like a human being or a fragile object. When operating in spatial regions sufficiently away from the boundary the manipulator behaves as if it were operated via a linear stiffness impedance controller, thus preserving in these regions its compliance and convergence characteristics.

TCP Reno has performed remarkably well and is generally believed to have prevented severe congestion as the Internet scaled up by magnitudes in size and speed.

The scheme achieves prescribed bounds on the transient and steady state output error performance despite the uncertainty in system nonlinearities and deadzone characteristics. For the latter, only a locally Lipschitz property is assumed to hold, with strictly increasing nonlinearities outside the dead-band, thus forming a fairly general class of admissible deadzones. Furthermore, approximating structures, i.e., neural/fuzzy systems, etc., are not utilized and, moreover, the backstepping \u201cexplosion of complexity\u201d issue is eliminated without residing to filtering, thus resulting in a low complexity design. The proposed controller evades the construction of a deadzone inverse and does not employ a special analytical deadzone representation. Simulations are performed to verify the theoretical findings.",

The above, along with bandwidth measurements obtained at per frame basis, provide the essential information to the controller, which outputs the appropriate values for the media characteristics in order to achieve the required user satisfaction without violating the available bandwidth constraint.

For this purpose, we construct an on-line model for the packet round trip time, depending on source rate and congestion measure. The proposed algorithm is comprised of a two level scheme. At the high level the packet round trip is estimated, while at the low, a neural net rate controller is designed to achieve the estimated values. To improve the application sending time, we introduce the notion of communication channels, whose number is updated via an appropriately designed algorithm, parallelizing the transmission process. Simulation studies illustrate the approach.",

The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. New theory, new controllers, actuators, sensors, new industrial processes, computer methods, new applications, new philosophies..., new challenges. Much of this development work resides in industrial reports, feasibility study papers and the reports of advanced collaborative projects. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of such new work in all aspects of industrial control for wider and rapid dissemination. Neural networks is one of those areas where an initial burst of enthusiasm and optimism leads to an explosion of papers in the journals and many presentations at conferences but it is only in the last decade that significant theoretical work on stability, convergence and robustness for the use of neural networks in control systems has been tackled. George Rovithakis and Manolis Christodoulou have been interested in these theoretical problems and in the practical aspects of neural network applications to industrial problems. This very welcome addition to the Advances in Industrial Control series provides a succinct report of their research. The neural network model at the core of their work is the Recurrent High Order Neural Network (RHONN) and a complete theoretical and simulation development is presented. Different readers will find different aspects of the development of interest. The last chapter of the monograph discusses the problem of manufacturing or production process scheduling.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we consider the synchronization control problem for uncertain high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems in a leader-follower scheme, under a directed communication protocol. A robust decentralized control law of minimal complexity is proposed that achieves prescribed, arbitrarily fast and accurate synchronization of the following agents with the leader. The control protocol is decentralized in the sense that the control signal of each agent is calculated based solely on local relative state information from its neighborhood set. Additionally, no information regarding the agents' dynamic model is employed in the design procedure. Moreover, provided that the communication graph is connected and contrary to the related works on multi-agent systems, the controller-imposed transient and steady state performance bounds are fully decoupled from: 1) the underlying graph topology, 2) the control gains \u2026",

Moreover this control approach avoids posing severe restrictions on the unknown system nonlinearities other than their continuity. To effectively avoid possible division by zero, the designed output feedback controller is of switching type.
