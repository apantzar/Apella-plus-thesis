            "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori infection induces a plethora of DNA damages. Gastric epithelial cells, in order to maintain genomic integrity, require an integrous DNA damage repair (DDR) machinery, which, however, is reported to be modulated by the infection. CagA is a major H. pylori virulence factor, associated with increased risk for gastric carcinogenesis. Its pathogenic activity is partly regulated by phosphorylation on EPIYA motifs. Our aim was to identify effects of H. pylori infection and CagA on DDR, investigating the transcriptome of AGS cells, infected with wild-type, \u0394CagA and EPIYA-phosphorylation-defective strains. Upon RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analysis, we observed that a notable number of DDR genes were found deregulated during the infection, potentially resulting to base excision repair and mismatch repair compromise and an intricate deregulation of nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining. Transcriptome observations were further investigated on the protein expression level, utilizing infections of AGS and GES-1 cells. We observed that CagA contributed to the downregulation of Nth Like DNA Glycosylase 1 (NTHL1), MutY DNA Glycosylase (MUTYH), Flap Structure-Specific Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), RAD51 Recombinase, DNA Polymerase Delta Catalytic Subunit (POLD1), and DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) and, contrary to transcriptome results, Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APE1) upregulation. Our study accentuates the role of CagA as a significant contributor of H. pylori infection-mediated DDR modulation, potentially disrupting the balance between DNA damage and \u2026",

WiNTRLINC1 positively regulates the expression of its genomic neighbor ASCL2, a transcription factor that controls intestinal stem cell fate. WiNTRLINC1 interacts with TCF4/\u03b2-catenin to mediate the juxtaposition of its promoter with the regulatory regions of ASCL2.

Intriguingly, the mRNA levels of a substantial number of immunomodulatory and DNA repair proteins including CXCL9, CD3D, and RAD51 were found to be downregulated in hypoxic areas in vivo, consistent with a protumorigenic role of hypoxia in solid tumors.

            "Abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (~ 22 nts) that are considered central post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and key components in many pathological conditions. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to inexpensive, massive data production, revolutionizing every research aspect in the fields of biology and medicine. Particularly, small RNA-Seq (sRNA-Seq) enables small non-coding RNA quantification on a high-throughput scale, providing a closer look into the expression profiles of these crucial regulators within the cell. Here, we present DIANA-microRNA-Analysis-Pipeline (DIANA-mAP), a fully automated computational pipeline that allows the user to perform miRNA NGS data analysis from raw sRNA-Seq libraries to quantification and Differential Expression Analysis in an easy, scalable, efficient, and intuitive way. Emphasis has been given to data pre-processing, an early, critical step in the analysis for the robustness of the final results and conclusions. Through modularity, parallelizability and customization, DIANA-mAP produces high quality expression results, reports and graphs for downstream data mining and statistical analysis. In an extended evaluation, the tool outperforms similar tools providing pre-processing without any adapter knowledge. Closing, DIANA-mAP is a freely available tool.

Editing of a mutation-containing pri-miR-BART6 found in Daudi Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma C666-1 cell lines suppressed processing of miR-BART6 RNAs.

Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) has emerged as a popular gene expression profiling protocol, able to quantitate TSS usage by recognizing the 5\u2019end of capped RNA molecules. However, there is an increasing volume of studies in the literature suggesting that CAGE can also detect 5\u2019capping events which are transcription byproducts. These findings highlight the need for computational methods that can effectively remove the excessive amount of noise from CAGE samples, leading to accurate TSS annotation and promoter usage quantification. In this study, we present an annotation agnostic computational framework, DIANA Signal-TSS (DiS-TSS), that for the first time utilizes digital signal processing inspired features customized on the peculiarities of CAGE data. Features from the spatial and frequency domains are combined with a robustly trained Support Vector Machines (SVM) model to accurately distinguish between peaks related to real transcription initiation events and biological or protocol-induced noise. When benchmarked on experimentally derived data on active transcription marks as well as annotated TSSs, DiS-TSS was found to outperform existing implementations, by providing on average~ 11k positive predictions and an increase in performance by~ 5% in the experimental and annotation-based evaluations.",

A large number of known and novel miRNAs can be uncovered from next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments that measure the complement of a given cell\u2019s small RNAs under various conditions. Here, we present an algorithm based on radial basis functions for the identification of potential miRNA precursor structures. Computationally assessing features of known human miRNA precursors, such as structural linearity, normalized minimum folding energy, and nucleotide pairing frequencies, this model robustly differentiates between miRNAs and other types of non-coding RNAs. Without relying on cross species conservation, the method also identifies non-conserved precursors and achieves high sensitivity. The presented method can be used routinely for the identification of known and novel miRNAs \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Research in the past decade has revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are widespread and that they are likely to underlie an appreciably larger set of disease processes than is currently known. The first miRNAs and their functions were determined via classical genetic techniques. Soon after, a number of miRNAs were discovered experimentally (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001). However, the characterization of miRNA function remained elusive owing to low-throughput experiments and often indeterminate results, most notably for those miRNAs which have multiple roles in multiple tissues. High-throughput experimental methods for miRNA target identification are the ideal solution, but such methods are not currently available. As a result, computational methods were developed, and are still regularly used, for the purpose of identifying miRNA targets. Most current target prediction programs require the sequences of known miRNAs. Currently, there are 332 known miRNAs in the human genome. The estimation of the total number of miRNAs varies from publication to publication (Lim et al., 2003; Bentwich et al., 2005). In a recent paper, Bentwich et al. contended that there are at least 500 more miRNAs that are yet to be identified (Bentwich etal., 2005). Despite the number of unknown miRNAs, computational approaches based on features of known miRNAs have been instrumental in the discovery of as-of-yet-unknown miRNAs in the genome. The past few years have witnessed an explosion in information regarding the genomic organization of miRNAs, the biogenesis of miRNAs, the targeting mechanisms of miRNAs, and the regulatory networks in \u2026",

About 30 of these proteins were involved in various steps of RNA processing. One of them, IWS1, is a transcription elongation factor, which was originally identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a protein that interacts with the histone H3/H4 chaperone Spt6 or as a suppressor of TATA binding protein (TBP) mutations that impair post-recruitment transcriptional activation. The human IWS1 is an 819aa protein, which contains a C-terminal domain that is similar to domain I of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS, and to related domains in Elongin A and the Mediator Complex subunit 26 (Med26). IWS1 was shown to be phosphorylated, primarily by Akt3, at two neighboring sites (Ser720/Thr721). To address the role of phosphorylated IWS1 in RNA \u2026",

We develop three protein coding measures that directly assess conserved regions in multiple sequence alignments of many species: one based on phase-shifts induced by alignment gaps, another based on the 3rd position mutation asymmetry in codons, and a third based on nucleotide composition asymmetry. The methods are easy to implement and require no training. Using a human-chimp-rat-mouse-chicken multiple alignment, these measures can classify coding regions as short as 30nt with greater specificity than single-genome measures using 120nt. Results from human-mouse and humanchicken alignments can be further improved by considering additional species; only the chimp genome proved uninformative. The phase-shift method is especially accurate.Contact: agh@ pcbi. upenn. edu, hannoh@ seas. upenn. edu",

            "Abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (~ 22 nts) that are considered central post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and key components in many pathological conditions. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to inexpensive, massive data production, revolutionizing every research aspect in the fields of biology and medicine. Particularly, small RNA-Seq (sRNA-Seq) enables small non-coding RNA quantification on a high-throughput scale, providing a closer look into the expression profiles of these crucial regulators within the cell. Here, we present DIANA-microRNA-Analysis-Pipeline (DIANA-mAP), a fully automated computational pipeline that allows the user to perform miRNA NGS data analysis from raw sRNA-Seq libraries to quantification and Differential Expression Analysis in an easy, scalable, efficient, and intuitive way. Emphasis has been given to data pre-processing, an early, critical step in the analysis for the robustness of the final results and conclusions. Through modularity, parallelizability and customization, DIANA-mAP produces high quality expression results, reports and graphs for downstream data mining and statistical analysis. In an extended evaluation, the tool outperforms similar tools providing pre-processing without any adapter knowledge. Closing, DIANA-mAP is a freely available tool. It is available dockerized with no dependency installations or standalone, accompanied by an installation manual through Github.",

However, its capacity to instruct neurogenic conversion of astrocytes and its independent mechanism of direct reprogramming action have been poorly investigated. Aim of the study was to investigate whether miR-124 is a master-regulatory reprogramming agent, potent to drive direct reprogramming of astrocytes to induced-neurons (iNs) on its own and to elucidate its mechanism of reprogramming action. To this end we overexpressed miR-124 either alone or in combination with the small neurogenic compound ISX9 both in vitro and in in vivo in a mouse mechanical cortical trauma model and analyzed their mechanism of reprogramming action. Our data indicate that miR-124 and ISX9 exhibit both unique and convergent molecular contributions in the reprogramming process to iNs. miR-124 is a potent driver of the astrocytic reprogramming switch of astrocytes towards an immature neuronal fate by repressing genes regulating astrocytic function, among which we identified the RNA-binding protein Zfp36l1 as a novel miR-124 direct target. We also provide evidence that ISX9 greatly improves both miR-124-induced reprogramming efficiency and functional maturation of iNs. Importantly, miR-124 either alone or along with ISX9 is potent to guide direct neuronal reprogramming of reactive astrocytes to iNs of cortical identity in vivo, a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Most ab initio gene predictors use a probabilistic sequence model, typically a hidden Markov model, to combine separately trained models of genomic signals and content. By combining separate models of relevant genomic features, such gene predictors can exploit small training sets and incomplete annotations, and can be trained fairly efficiently. However, that type of piecewise training does not optimize prediction accuracy and has difficulty in accounting for statistical dependencies among different parts of the gene model. With genomic information being created at an ever-increasing rate, it is worth investigating alternative approaches in which many different types of genomic evidence, with complex statistical dependencies, can be integrated by discriminative learning to maximize annotation accuracy. Among discriminative learning methods, large-margin classifiers have become prominent because of the success of support vector machines (SVM) in many classification tasks. We describe CRAIG, a new program for ab initio gene prediction based on a conditional random field model with semi-Markov structure that is trained with an online large-margin algorithm related to multiclass SVMs. Our experiments on benchmark vertebrate datasets and on regions from the ENCODE project show significant improvements in prediction accuracy over published gene predictors that use intrinsic features only, particularly at the gene level and on genes with long introns.",

References to miRNA names in the literature often deviate from standard nomenclature for various reasons, since even the official nomenclature evolves. For instance, a single miRNA name may identify two completely different molecules or two different names may refer to the same molecule. mirPub is a database with a powerful and intuitive interface, which facilitates searching for miRNA literature, addressing the aforementioned issues. To provide effective search services, mirPub applies text mining techniques on MEDLINE, integrates data from several curated databases and exploits data from its user community following a crowdsourcing approach. Other key features include an interactive visualization \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that IWS1 (Interacts with Spt6) is a phosphorylation target of AKT and regulates the alternative RNA splicing of FGFR2, linking IWS1 with human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. To further address the role of IWS1 in alternative RNA splicing in lung cancer, we performed an RNA-seq study using lung adenocarcinoma cells in which IWS1 was knocked down or replaced by its phosphorylation site mutant. The results identified a novel, exon 2 deficient splice variant of the splicing factor U2 Associated-Factor 2 (U2AF2), whose abundance increases, upon the loss of phosphorylated IWS1. This exon encodes part of the U2AF65 Serine-Rich (SR) Domain, which is required for its binding with pre-mRNA Processing factor 19 (Prp19). Here, we show that U2AF2 exon 2 inclusion depends on phosphorylated IWS1, by promoting histone H3K36 trimethylation and the assembly of LEDGF/SRSF1 splicing complexes, in a cell-cycle specific manner. Inhibition of the pathway results in the downregulation of cell cycle division associated 5 (CDCA5), a phosphorylation target and regulator of ERK, leading to G2/M phase arrest, impaired cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenografts models, an effect more pronounced in EGFR mutant cells. Analysis of lung adenocarcinoma samples revealed strong correlations between IWS1 phosphorylation, U2AF2 RNA splicing, and Sororin/p-ERK levels, especially in EGFR, as opposed to K-RAS mutant patients. More importantly, IWS1 phosphorylation and U2AF2 RNA splicing pattern are positively correlated with tumor stage, grade and metastasis, and associated with poor survival in \u2026",

To ensure re-use and allow exploitation and validation of scientific results, several challenges related to scientific data dynamics should be tackled. In this paper, we deal with the publication of diachronic life science linked data. We propose a change model based on RDF to capture versioned entities. Based on this model we convert legacy data from biological databases as diachronic linked data.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are regulatory molecules that have been functionally associated with several developmental programs and their deregulation with diverse diseases including cancer.  Methodology/Principal Findings Although miRNA expression levels may not be routinely measured in high-throughput experiments, a possible involvement of miRNAs in the deregulation of gene expression can be computationally predicted and quantified through analysis of overrepresented motifs in the deregulated genes 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) sequences. Here, we introduce a user-friendly web-server, DIANA-mirExTra (www.microrna.gr/mirextra) that allows the comparison of frequencies of miRNA associated motifs between sets of genes that can lead to the identification of miRNAs responsible for the deregulation of large numbers of genes. To this end, we have investigated different approaches and measures, and have practically implemented them on experimental data.  Conclusions/Significance On several datasets of miRNA overexpression and repression experiments, our proposed approaches have successfully identified the deregulated miRNA. Beyond the prediction of miRNAs responsible for the deregulation of transcripts, the web-server provides extensive links to DIANA-mirPath, a functional analysis tool incorporating miRNA targets in biological pathways.

            "Abstract": "In studies of electron and proton radiotherapy, ultrahigh dose rates of FLASH radiotherapy appear to produce fewer toxicities than standard dose rates while maintaining local tumor control. FLASH-proton radiotherapy (F-PRT) brings the spatial advantages of PRT to FLASH dose rates (>40 Gy/second), making it important to understand if and how F-PRT spares normal tissues while providing antitumor efficacy that is equivalent to standard-proton radiotherapy (S-PRT). Here we studied PRT damage to skin and mesenchymal tissues of muscle and bone and found that F-PRT of the C57BL/6 murine hind leg produced fewer severe toxicities leading to death or requiring euthanasia than S-PRT of the same dose. RNA-seq analyses of murine skin and bone revealed pathways upregulated by S-PRT yet unaltered by F-PRT, such as apoptosis signaling and keratinocyte differentiation in skin, as well as osteoclast \u2026",

Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced, the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20,000-23,000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution, while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example, the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements, both non-coding and coding. Notably, many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes. In coding regions the evolutionary dynamics of protein domains and orthologous groups illustrate processes that distinguish the lineages leading to birds and mammals. The distinctive properties of avian microchromosomes, together with the inferred patterns of conserved synteny, provide additional insights into vertebrate chromosome architecture.",

Genome-wide CAGE studies reveal that a large fraction of TSS exhibit peaks where the vast majority of associated tags map to a particular location (\u223c45%), whereas other active regions contain a broader distribution of initiation events. The presence of a strong single peak suggests that transcription at these locations may be mediated by position-specific sequence features. We therefore propose a new model for single-peaked TSS based solely on known transcription factors (TFs) and their respective regions of positional enrichment. This probabilistic model leads to near-perfect classification results in cross-validation (auROC = 0.98), and performance in genomic scans demonstrates that TSS \u2026",

Though computational methods for miRNA target prediction are the prevailing means to analyze their function, they still miss a large fraction of the targeted genes and additionally predict a large number of false positives.

The features characterizing each miRNA recognition element include binding structure, conservation level and a specific profile of structural accessibility. The ANN is trained to integrate the features of each recognition element along the 3\u2019 untranslated region into a targeting score, reproducing the relative repression fold change of the protein. Tested on two different sets the algorithm outperforms other widely used algorithms and also predicts a significant number of unique and reliable targets not predicted by the other methods. For 542 human miRNAs DIANA-microT-ANN predicts 120,000 targets not provided by TargetScan 5.0. The algorithm is freely available at http://microrna.gr/microT-ANN.",

We demonstrate the biological relevance of this finding by comparison with data from early to mid-gestation human cortical tissue. Further we find that miR-934 directly controls progenitor to neuroblast transition and impacts on neurite growth of newborn neurons. In agreement, miR-934 targets are involved in progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation whilst miR-934 inhibition results in profound global transcriptome changes associated with neurogenesis, axonogenesis, neuronal migration and neurotransmission. Interestingly, miR-934 inhibition affects the expression of genes associated with the subplate zone, a transient compartment most prominent in primates that emerges during early corticogenesis. Our data suggest that mir-934 is a novel regulator of early human neurogenesis with potential implications for a species-specific evolutionary role in brain function.",

            "Abstract": "BackgroundMicroRNAs (miRs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, act as posttranscriptional regulators and are involved in a plethora of cellular functions. miRs have attracted a great deal of attention as potential therapeutic targets, as the sequence-specific mode in which they act, allows the simultaneous targeting of multiple target genes, often members of the same biological pathway (s)[1]. Previous studies have demonstrated that miRs are dysregulated and functionally involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)[2\u20139]. In this study we sought to identify novel miR associations in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a key pathogenic cell type in RA [10, 11], by performing miR expression profiling on cells isolated from the human TNF transgenic mouse model (TghuTNF, Tg197)[12] and patients biopsies.Materials and methodsmiR expression in SFs from TghuTNF and WT control mice were determined by deep sequencing and the arthritic profile was established by pairwise comparisons. qRT-PCR analysis was utilised for profile validation, miR and gene quantitation in patient SFs. Dysregulated miR target genes and pathways were predicted via bioinformatic algorithms.ResultsDeep sequencing demonstrated that TghuTNF-SFs exhibit a distinct pathogenic profile with 22 significantly upregulated and 30 significantly downregulated miRs (fold change> 1.5, p-value< 0.05). qRT-PCR validation assays confirmed the dysregulation of miR-223, miR-146a and miR-155 previously associated with human RA pathology, as well as that of miR-221/222 and miR-323-3p. Notably, the latter were also found significantly upregulated in patient RASFs, suggesting their \u2026",

To date there are no registered vaccines for disease prevention despite the fact that several vaccines are in preclinical development. Thus, new strategies are needed to improve vaccine efficacy based on a better understanding of the mechanisms mediating protective immunity and mechanisms of host immune responses subversion by immunopathogenic components of Leishmania. We found that mice vaccinated with CPA162-189-loaded p8-PLGA nanoparticles, an experimental nanovaccine, induced the differentiation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in spleen compared to control mice, characterized by increased dynamics of proliferation and high amounts of IFN-\u03b3 production after ex vivo re-stimulation with CPA162-189 antigen. Vaccination with CPA162-189-loaded p8-PLGA nanoparticles resulted in about 80% lower parasite load in spleen and liver at 4 weeks after challenge with L. infantum promastigotes as compared to control mice. However, 16 weeks after infection the parasite load in spleen was comparable in both mouse groups. Decreased protection levels in vaccinated mice were followed by up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 production although at lower levels in comparison to control mice. Microarray analysis in spleen tissue at 4 weeks post challenge revealed different immune-related profiles among the two groups. Specifically, vaccinated mice were characterized by similar profile to na\u00efve mice. On the other hand, the transcriptome of the non-vaccinated mice was dominated by increased expression of genes \u2026",

            "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are~ 22-nt small RNA molecules involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing in organisms ranging from plant to human (Bartel, 2004). They have been shown to bind, with perfect complementarity in plants, and usually imperfect complementarity in animals, to specific sites along the 3\u2032 UTR of various cytoplasmic messenger RNAs. Since 2001, when miRNAs were appreciated as abundant and widespread regulators (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2001; Lau et al., 2001), they have been implicated in fat metabolism, development, differentiation, apoptosis, antiviral defense, insulin secretion, and many other diverse biological processes (Kloosterman et al., 2005). There is also strong evidence that the misexpression of miRNAs abets the development of many diseases such as various forms of cancer (Calin and Croce, 2006; Esquela-Kerscher and Slack, 2006). Since it has been predicted that miRNAs target at least 30% of human genes (Lewis et al., 2005; Rajewsky, 2006), it is likely that they underlie an even larger set of disease processes than is currently appreciated. In this chapter we present a suite of resources we have developed to facilitate the study of miRNA ontology and function.",

Although the pro-tumorigenic role of the ISR in a tumor cellintrinsic manner has been established, its role in cell-extrinsic processes remains unexplored. Using novel conditional knockout ATF4 mouse models, we show that global, or broblast (FB)-speci c loss of host ATF4 results in abnormal tumor vascularization and a pronounced tumor growth delay in syngeneic melanoma and pancreatic tumor models, a phenotype which is largely reversed by co-injection of ATF4wt/wt FBs. Single-cell tumor transcriptomics uncovered a reduction of markers associated with FB activation in a cluster of perivascular cancer-associated broblasts (CAF) in ATF4\u0394/\u0394 mice. ATF4\u0394/\u0394 FBs displayed signi cant defects in collagen biosynthesis and deposition and reduced ability to support angiogenesis in vitro. Mechanistically, ATF4 directly regulates the expression of the Col1a1 gene as well as the biosynthesis of glycine and proline, the major amino acids comprising collagen bers. Analysis of human tumor samples revealed a strong correlation between ATF4 and collagen levels and between an ATF4 FB signature and expression of collagen genes. Our ndings uncover a novel role of stromal ATF4 in shaping CAF functionality, a key driver of disease progression and therapy resistance.",

MicroRNAs are a conserved class of regulatory RNAs that control mRNA stability and translation in tissues. They are abundant in the brain but the extent into which they are involved in synaptic mRNA regulation is poorly known. Herein, a computational analysis of the coding and 3\u2032UTR regions of 242 presynaptic and 304 postsynaptic proteins revealed that 91% of them are predicted to be microRNA targets. Analysis of the longest 3\u2032UTR isoform of synaptic transcripts showed that presynaptic mRNAs have significantly longer 3\u2032UTR than control and postsynaptic mRNAs. In contrast, the shortest 3\u2032UTR isoform of postsynaptic mRNAs is significantly shorter than control and presynaptic mRNAs, indicating they avert microRNA regulation under specific conditions. Examination of microRNA binding site density of synaptic 3\u2032UTRs revealed that they are twice as dense as the rest of protein-coding transcripts and that approximately 50% of synaptic transcripts are predicted to have more than five different microRNA sites. An interaction map exploring the association of microRNAs and their targets revealed that a small set of ten microRNAs is predicted to regulate 77% and 80% of presynaptic and postsynaptic transcripts, respectively.

Moreover, we provide evidence that nELAVLs regulate the production of APP695; by using a series of reporters we show that concurrent binding of nELAVLs to sequences located both upstream and downstream of exon 7 is required for its skipping, whereas nELAVL-binding to a highly conserved U-rich sequence upstream of exon 8, is sufficient for its exclusion.

            "Abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that IWS1 (Interacts with Spt6) is a phosphorylation target of AKT and regulates the alternative RNA splicing of FGFR2, linking IWS1 with human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. To further address the role of IWS1 in alternative RNA splicing in lung cancer, we performed an RNA-seq study using lung adenocarcinoma cells in which IWS1 was knocked down or replaced by its phosphorylation site mutant. The results identified a novel, exon 2 deficient splice variant of the splicing factor U2 Associated-Factor 2 (U2AF2), whose abundance increases, upon the loss of phosphorylated IWS1. This exon encodes part of the U2AF65 Serine-Rich (SR) Domain, which is required for its binding with pre-mRNA Processing factor 19 (Prp19). Here, we show that U2AF2 exon 2 inclusion depends on phosphorylated IWS1, by promoting histone H3K36 trimethylation and the assembly of LEDGF/SRSF1 splicing complexes, in a cell-cycle specific manner. Inhibition of the pathway results in the downregulation of cell cycle division associated 5 (CDCA5), a phosphorylation target and regulator of ERK, leading to G2/M phase arrest, impaired cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenografts models, an effect more pronounced in EGFR mutant cells. Analysis of lung adenocarcinoma samples revealed strong correlations between IWS1 phosphorylation, U2AF2 RNA splicing, and Sororin/p-ERK levels, especially in EGFR, as opposed to K-RAS mutant patients. More importantly, IWS1 phosphorylation and U2AF2 RNA splicing pattern are positively correlated with tumor stage, grade and metastasis, and associated with poor survival in \u2026",

As the number of experiments increase in a rapid rate and transcriptional units are better annotated, databases indexing lncRNA properties and function gradually become essential tools to this process. Aim of DIANA-LncBase (www.microrna.gr/LncBase) is to reinforce researchers\u2019 attempts and unravel microRNA (miRNA)\u2013lncRNA putative functional interactions. This study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive annotation of miRNA targets on lncRNAs. DIANA-LncBase hosts transcriptome-wide experimentally verified and computationally predicted miRNA recognition elements (MREs) on human and mouse lncRNAs.

To determine genome-wide miRNA DNA copy number abnormalities in cancer, 207 known human miRNA genes were analyzed by high-resolution array-based CGH in 253 human ovarian and breast cancer as well as melanoma specimens. High proportion of miRNA genes exhibited DNA copy number alterations in ovarian cancer (40.6%), breast cancer (57.0%) and melanoma (57.2% of miRNA genes). These frequencies were significantly higher than the average genome alteration frequency in the same cancer dataset. We identified miRNA genes with gene copy number changes that were shared among the three types of cancer (22 with gain and 7 with loss) and miRNA genes with copy number changes that were unique to each tumor type.

            "Abstract": "Primary transcripts of certain microRNA (miRNA) genes are subject to RNA editing that converts adenosine to inosine. However, the importance of miRNA editing remains largely undetermined. Here we report that tissue-specific adenosine-to-inosine editing of miR-376 cluster transcripts leads to predominant expression of edited miR-376 isoform RNAs. One highly edited site is positioned in the middle of the 5\u2032-proximal half \u201cseed\u201d region critical for the hybridization of miRNAs to targets. We provide evidence that the edited miR-376 RNA silences specifically a different set of genes. Repression of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, a target of the edited miR-376 RNA and an enzyme involved in the uric-acid synthesis pathway, contributes to tight and tissue-specific regulation of uric-acid levels, revealing a previously unknown role for RNA editing in miRNA-mediated gene silencing.",

MicroRNA regulation is performed through pairing of the microRNA to sites in the messenger RNA of protein coding genes. Since experimental identification of miRNA target genes poses difficulties, computational microRNA target prediction is one of the key means in deciphering the role of microRNAs in development and disease. DIANA-microT 3.0 is an algorithm for microRNA target prediction which is based on several parameters calculated individually for each microRNA and combines conserved and non-conserved microRNA recognition elements into a final prediction score, which correlates with protein production fold change.

To further address the role of IWS1 in alternative RNA splicing in lung cancer, we performed an RNA-seq study using lung adenocarcinoma cells in which IWS1 was knocked down or replaced by its phosphorylation site mutant. The results identified a novel, exon 2 deficient splice variant of the splicing factor U2 Associated-Factor 2 (U2AF2), whose abundance increases, upon the loss of phosphorylated IWS1. This exon encodes part of the U2AF65 Serine-Rich (SR) Domain, which is required for its binding with pre-mRNA Processing factor 19 (Prp19). Here, we show that U2AF2 exon 2 inclusion depends on phosphorylated IWS1, by promoting histone H3K36 trimethylation and the assembly of LEDGF/SRSF1 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22-nt RNA segments that are involved in the regulation of protein expression primarily by binding to one or more target sites on an mRNA transcript and inhibiting translation. MicroRNAs are likely to factor into multiple developmental pathways, multiple mechanisms of gene regulation, and underlie an array of inherited disease processes and phenotypic determinants. Several computational programs exist to predict miRNA targets in mammals, fruit flies, worms, and plants. However, to date, there is no systematic collection and description of miRNA targets with experimental support. We describe a database, TarBase, which houses a manually curated collection of experimentally tested miRNA targets, in human/mouse, fruit fly, worm, and zebrafish, distinguishing between those that tested positive and those that tested negative. Each positive target site is described by the miRNA that binds it \u2026",

            "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small noncoding RNAs that function as negative gene regulators. miRNA deregulation is involved in the initiation and progression of human cancer; however, the underlying mechanism and its contributions to genome-wide transcriptional changes in cancer are still largely unknown. We studied miRNA deregulation in human epithelial ovarian cancer by integrative genomic approach, including miRNA microarray (n = 106), array-based comparative genomic hybridization (n = 109), cDNA microarray (n = 76), and tissue array (n = 504). miRNA expression is markedly down-regulated in malignant transformation and tumor progression. Genomic copy number loss and epigenetic silencing, respectively, may account for the down-regulation of \u224815% and at least \u224836% of miRNAs in advanced ovarian tumors and miRNA down-regulation contributes to a genome-wide \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Insecticide resistance is a worldwide problem with major impact on agriculture and human health. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is crucial for the management of the phenomenon; however, this information often comes late with respect to the implementation of efficient counter-measures, particularly in the case of metabolism-based resistance mechanisms. We employed a genome-wide insertional mutagenesis screen to Drosophila melanogaster, using a Minos-based construct, and retrieved a line (MiT[w\u2212]3R2) resistant to the neonicotinoid insecticide Imidacloprid. Biochemical and bioassay data indicated that resistance was due to increased P450 detoxification. Deep sequencing transcriptomic analysis revealed substantial over- and under-representation of 357 transcripts in the resistant line, including statistically significant changes in mixed function oxidases, peptidases and cuticular proteins. Three P450 genes (Cyp4p2, Cyp6a2 and Cyp6g1) located on the 2R chromosome, are highly up-regulated in mutant flies compared to susceptible Drosophila. One of them (Cyp6g1) has been already described as a major factor for Imidacloprid resistance, which validated the approach. Elevated expression of the Cyp4p2 was not previously documented in Drosophila lines resistant to neonicotinoids. In silico analysis using the Drosophila reference genome failed to detect transcription binding factors or microRNAs associated with the over-expressed Cyp genes. The resistant line did not contain a Minos insertion in its chromosomes, suggesting a hit-and-run event, i.e. an insertion of the transposable element, followed by an \u2026",

MicroTSS integrates high-resolution RNA-sequencing data with active transcription marks derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase-sequencing to enable the characterization of tissue-specific promoters. MicroTSS is validated with a specifically designed Drosha-null/conditional-null mouse model, generated using the conditional by inversion (COIN) methodology.

            "Abstract": "In this study, we investigate whether miRNAs located within \u201chost\u201d protein-coding genes may regulate the expression of their host genes. We find that 43 of 174 miRNAs encoded within RefSeq genes are predicted to target their host genes. Statistical analysis of this phenomenon suggests that gene auto-regulation via miRNAs may be under positive selective pressure. Our analysis also indicates that several of the 43 miRNAs have a much lower expectation of targeting their host genes by chance than others. Among these examples, we identify miR-128b:ARPP-21 (cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, 21 kD) as a case in which both the miRNA and the target site are also evolutionarily conserved. We provide experimental support for this miRNA:target interaction via reporter silencing assays, and present evidence that this isoform-specific gene auto-regulation has been preserved in vertebrate species in \u2026",

Currently, there are numerous implemented approaches that can be used to support miRNA-related studies by identifying their coding and noncoding targets, their expression, their regulators, as well as by inferring their underlying regulatory networks. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the available state-of-the-art tools, web servers, and databases utilized in miRNA research. The selected tools cover an extensive scope ranging from miRNA annotation, promoter identification, and transcription to the identification of miRNA-controlled pathways. Significant attention has been paid to present and explain standard and novel -omics approaches that can be used to support, complement, or even substitute their in silico counterparts.
