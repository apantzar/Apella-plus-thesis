The first is the default mechanism of TCP; the second is a proposed congestion control algorithm that improves fairness of AIMD. We consider asynchronous networks where TCP flows have different propagation delays, a portion of their link is wireless, and they compete for resources over a single bottleneck link. We show that \u03c4-AIMD improves the performance of flows that have long propagation delay and the fairness of the network. In wireless links \u03c4-AIMD outperforms AIMD and the cost of lost packets (or wasted energy) is the same as that of AIMD.",

We quantify the improvements by using both DTN- and NDN- associated metrics combined in a common analytical framework and show that NDN-DTN can greatly improve the Interest Satisfaction Ratio and Average Delay when compared to a DTN-only approach, especially in environments with a low Delivery Ratio.

By\" opportunistic wireless networks\" it is meant multi-hop wireless networks where finding an end-to-end path between any pair of nodes at any moment in time may be a challenge. The goal is to assist in better defining opportunities for the transmission of Interest packets towards the most suitable data source, based on metrics that provide information about: i) the availability of different data sources; ii) the availability and centrality of neighbor nodes; iii) the time lapse between forwarding Interest packets and receiving the corresponding data packets. The document presents an architectural overview of DABBER followed by specification options related to the dissemination of name-prefix information to support the computation of next hops, and the ranking of forwarding options based on the best set of neighbors to ensure a short time-to-completion.",

According to RFC 2988, there are two main limitations that call for a lower bound to protect TCP from spurious timeouts:(i) the OS clock granularity (500 ms for most OSs at the time of RFC 2988 publication) and (ii) the Delayed Acknowledgments (usually set to 200 ms).

The protocol allows for a measurement-based transmission strategy, which complements the \u201cblind\u201d increase/decrease window adjustments. Owing to its design, the protocol displays an inherent property to produce comprehensive dynamics in heterogeneous environments with wired or wireless networks and delay-sensitive or -tolerant applications. TCP-Real controls congestion as standard TCP does. However, its receiver-oriented nature and its \u201cwave\u201d communication pattern allow for two amending mechanisms: (i) congestion avoidance, which reduces unnecessary transmission gaps that hurt the performance of time-constrained applications, and (ii) advanced error detection and classification, which designates recovery tactics responsive to the nature of the errors, thereby enhancing the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "\u2014Reliable communication in wireless sensor networks constitutes an essential factor in maintaining critical systems operational. Despite this, wireless sensor networks are known to be volatile and prone to faults disrupting their normal working state. Particularly in open environments, wireless sensor networks must be able to detect arising faults to minimize subsequent failures of the network. This study deals with the detection and identification of faults in wireless sensor networks, notably faults that occur due to externally driven events, affecting network services, such as data transfers and communication between nodes. Faults commonly occurring due to such factors are loss of connectivity because of faulty node interfaces, disrupted connectivity due to obstacles, and extreme packet loss because of increased noise conditions or congestion. Detection, identification, and recovery of sensor network faults have been studied extensively in the literature. In this paper, a Machine Learning approach is used to detect and diagnose these faults. A decision tree algorithm was used to train the model. The produced model is consistently able to identify the faults on test data with an overall accuracy of 96.46%. Results also include high precision and recall values for each separate fault case, thus producing a successful fault identification model.",

            "Abstract": "Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture is a new communication architecture developed to provide network connectivity in challenging environments. It forms a store-and-forward overlay network that employs persistent storage to deal with link disconnections. Consistent with its store-and-forward requirements, the design of the transport function of the DTN architecture was primarily based on hop-by-hop operations in preference to the traditional end-to-end communication model. As a result, pure end-to-end functionality is absent from the current DTN architecture and thus has been shifted towards applications. In this study, we highlight the benefits of having an additional layer of application-independent protocol offering transparent application data conditioning services end-to-end and we introduce Delay Tolerant Payload Conditioning (DTPC) protocol, a novel protocol that realizes this layer. DTPC protocol \u2026",

            "Abstract": "As the number and complexity of space missions increases, space communications enter a new era, where internetworking gradually replaces or assists traditional telecommunication protocols. The Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) architecture has recently emerged as a communication system for challenged networks, originally designed for the Interplanetary Internet. In the context of our project with ESA called \"Extending Internet into Space - ESA DTN Testbed Implementation and Evaluation\" we intend to deploy a distributed, flexible and scalable DTN testbed for space communications. The testbed will provide the supportive infrastructure for the design and evaluation of space-suitable DTN protocols, architectures, and routing policies to allow efficient deep-space communications. Throughout the project, we will demonstrate the operational capabilities of the DTN protocols in space; design and evaluate \u2026",

            "Abstract": "RED is an Active Queue Management technique that has been around for many years. Contrary to the Droptail algorithm, RED manages to increase fairness dramatically, although occasionally against network performance. RED's efficiency is due to a dropping mechanism that, based on a function of average queue length, drops probabilistically packets from the queue. Unlike RED, Droptail may favor performance over fairness. In this paper we analyze RED's dropping algorithm and based on the results we attempt to create a RED variant for maximum performance and fairness: Equilibrium-RED. We present results that demonstrate EQU-RED\u2019s ability to balance the trade-off between Droptail and classic RED behaviors.",

            "Abstract": "Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has an important role in the management of transport infrastructure. However, most SHM techniques are based on data obtained from dense networks of point-based sensors (rather than sparse networks of spatial sensors) and so, in relative terms, they are costly to implement. Most commercially available strain sensors have a limited maximum range-typically 1% to 2%-and are not well-suited to providing information of a severe loss of structural integrity. The SENSKIN project develops a dielectric-elastomer and micro-electronics-based skin-like sensor, based on the use of a large highly extensible capacitance sensing membrane and advanced micro-electronic circuitry, for monitoring transport infrastructure-such as bridges. The sensor will provide spatial measurements of strain of more than 10% and is being designed to (a) require low power to operate,(b) be easy to install (c) have a comparable or lower cost than conventional strain sensors,(d) allow simple signal processing, and (e) have the ability to self-monitor and selfreport. The system will support the new and emerging technology of Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking to secure that strain measurements acquired will reach the base station even under extreme conditions where communications may be disrupted. SENSKIN also develops a Decision-Support-System (DSS) for proactive condition-based structural interventions under normal operating conditions and reactive emergency intervention following an extreme event. In assessing potential rehabilitation options, the DSS will use the data supplied by the SENSKIN sensors together with \u2026",

We present an end-to-end Loss Differentiation Mechanism (LDA) which effectively decouples congestion from wireless loss in order to abolish the damage of error-induced multiplicative decrease on flow throughput and smoothness. The proposed LDA relies on Round Trip Time measurements to estimate the queuing delay and determine the appropriate error-recovery strategy. This mechanism can be easily adapted and incorporated into existing Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) protocols, enabling them to utilize the available resources more efficiently. In this context, we incorporate the LDA into AIMD-based Scalable Streaming Video Protocol (SSVP), an end-to-end TCP-friendly protocol optimized \u2026",

DS-TP's main advantage is its ability to complete file transfers faster than conventional TCP, SCPS-TP and Saratoga. Therefore, missions with small connectivity time are greatly favored. Deep space communication links are characterized by long propagation delays, high BERs, intermittent connectivity (i.e., blackouts) and bandwidth asymmetries. Common approaches to deal with the above unique characteristics are: rate-based, open-loop protocols to deal with huge propagation delays; regular retransmissions to deal with high BERs; transmission suspension to deal with blackouts; SNACKs to deal with bandwidth asymmetries. We adopt some of the above approaches, namely, the open-loop, rate-based transmission and the SNACKs and focus on the optimization of the rest, namely, the retransmission \u2026",

Processing and analysis of large volumes of Earth observation and space/planetary data face two major impediments: limited access capabilities due to narrow connectivity windows between spacecraft and ground receiving stations and lack of sufficient communication and dissemination mechanisms between space data receiving centres and the end-user community. Real-time data assimilation that would be critical in a number of forecasting capabilities is particularly affected by such limitations.

In particular, this paper focuses on those unique inter-agent anomalies that are generated as we go from single agent systems to multiple agent systems. For example, consider one agent with the rule \u201cif A then B\u201d and a rule in another agent \u201cif A then C\u201d. In such a setting, the agents would be constantly at odds. Alternatively we might find the following rules in one agent (\u201cif A then B\u201d and \u201cif C then A\u201d), while another agent that interacts with that agent might have the rule (\u201cif B then C\u201d). With those two interacting rule bases a dialogue starting with \u201cA\u201d could cycle indefinitely.One potential approach to multiple agent systems is to compare the knowledge base of each subset of agents to determine the existence verification issues. Where the number of agents is small this approach is feasible. However, for \u2026",

Therefore, NCQ introduces a new service philosophy, which prioritizes packets, and in turn corresponding flows, according to their impact on total delay. In this context, we also introduce a corresponding index to measure fairness as a function of the deviation of expected and received delay.",

We show here that carefully designed probing mechanisms can cancel this incompetent behavior of TCP for a wide range of hand-off periods. We compare TCP Tahoe and Reno with TCP Probing under various scenarios of hand-off duration, propagation delay and mobility conditions of the user. We measure the goodput efficiency of data transfer as well as the energy efficiency of the protocols\u2019 mechanisms in terms of overhead and time. Our results show that TCP Probing demonstrates significant gains in both energy and throughput efficiency by avoiding unnecessary timeout extensions and retransmission of data which is likely to be lost due to hand-offs.",

We show that \u03c4-AIMD improves the performance of flows that have long propagation delay and the fairness of the network. In wireless links \u03c4-AIMD outperforms AIMD and the cost of lost packets (or wasted energy) is the same as that of AIMD.",

It is only capable of detecting the results of the errors, namely that segments are dropped. As a result, the protocol lacks the ability to implement an appropriate error recovery strategy cognizant of current network conditions and responsive to the distinctive error characteristics of the communication channel. TCP sender always calls for the sending window to shrink. We show that probing mechanisms could enhance the error detection capabilities of the protocol. TCP could then flexibly adjust its window in a manner that permits the available bandwidth to be exploited without violating the requirements of stability, efficiency and fairness that need to be guaranteed during congestion.Our experiments have three distinct goals: First, to demonstrate the potential contribution of probing mechanisms.

AIRA extends AIMD functionality towards adaptive increase rates, depending on the level of network contention and bandwidth availability. In this context, acceleration grows when resource availability is detected by goodput/throughput measurements and slows down when increased throughput does not translate into increased goodput as well. Thus, the gap between throughput and goodput determines the behavior of the rate accelerator.We study the properties of the extended model and propose, based on analysis and simulation, appropriate rate decrease and increase rules. Furthermore, we study conditional rules to guarantee operational success even in the presence of symptomatic, extra-ordinary events.

            "Abstract": "Additive increase/multiplicative decrease-based protocols, including transmission control protocol (TCP), TCP-friendly, and a new generation of rate-based protocols, attempt to control the tradeoff of responsiveness and smoothness. Traditionally, smoothness has not been a main concern since it does not impact the performance of regular Internet applications such as the Web, FTP, or e-mail. However, multimedia-driven protocols attempt to favor smoothness at the cost of responsiveness. In general, smoothness and responsiveness constitute a tradeoff; however, we uncover undesirable dynamics of the protocols in the context of wireless/mobile networks with high-error rate or frequent handoffs: low responsiveness is not counterbalanced by gains in smoothness, but instead, produces a conservative behavior that degrades protocol performance with both delay-tolerant and -sensitive applications.

The layered scheme utilizes receiver buffering, adapting the video quality along with long-term variations in the available bandwidth. The allocation of a new layer is based on explicit criteria that consider the available bandwidth, as well as the amount of buffering at the receiver. Consequently, the adaptation mechanism prevents wasteful layer changes that have an adverse effect on user-perceived quality. In the sequel, we concentrate on the interactions of the layered approach with Scalable Streaming Video Protocol (SSVP). Exploiting performance measures related to the perceived quality of rate-adaptive video streams, we quantify the combination of SSVP rate control and \u2026",

Since existing TCP mechanisms do not work well (or at all) for such networks, new transport schemes are required. Intermittent connectivity in space environments calls for new transport approaches that smoothly adapt to the special networking conditions. DTTP is primarily a transport layer protocol and satisfies the inherent architecture requirements of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) in the absence of IP network infrastructure. It allows for reliable, efficient data transfer offering a number of application-oriented transmission strategies. Otherwise, when an IP architecture exists, DTTP operates as a standalone transport entity which interfaces with IP directly. We introduce the protocol's properties and functionality that enable its deployment in challenged networks. We conduct simulations that demonstrate the protocol's efficiency in scenarios with:(i) long propagation delays,(ii) minimum to relatively high packet error-rate, and (iii) intermittent connectivity.",

In addition, our approach uses a second level of prioritization that conditionally favors, in terms of delay, applications with slightly longer packets as well. Non-Congestive Queuing Plus (NCQ+) promotes applications that require comparatively small service times, as long as their total service times cause insignificant delays to other packets in the queue. Therefore, we prioritize packets, and in turn corresponding flows, according to their impact on total delay. We evaluate NCQ+ using ns-2 based experiments.",

The second category (\u201d the box is grey\u201d) groups approaches that use measurements to estimate available bandwidth, level of contention or even the temporary characteristics of congestion. Due to the possibility of wrong estimations and measurements, the network is considered a grey box.

The transmission rate is controlled by properly adjusting the inter- packet-gap, spacing outgoing packets evenly to produce a smoothed flow. SSVP attempts to optimize the performance of streaming video delivery with concern to friendliness with interfering traffic. Quantifying SSVP's performance, we identify that the protocol utilizes a higher fraction of the available bandwidth, and maintains a regular transmission rate with oscillations of a smaller magnitude in comparison with existing congestion control schemes.",

Given the short duration of most modern Internet applications, fast convergence to fairness is necessitated. In this paper, we use fairness as the major criterion to adjust traffic and present a corresponding algorithm of active queue management, which is called Explicit Global Congestion Notifier (EGCN). EGCN notifies flows almost simultaneously about incipient congestion by marking packets arriving at the router\u2019s queue, when the load in the network increases and buffer overflow is expected.

In the case of the Sun-Earth connection scenario, we plan to test and validate the capabilities of Space-Data Routers in providing: a) Simultaneous real-time sampling of space plasmas from multiple points with cost-effective means and measuring of phenomena with higher resolution and better coverage to address outstanding science questions and b) Successful data transmission even in hostile communication conditions.

This technique could be implemented through the User-Provided Network model in which end-users could become suppliers of Internet connectivity. In this paper, the behavior of such system is investigated from a queuemanagement perspective. A numerical analysis that takes into consideration both the high variability of broadband link speeds and different packet-size distributions is presented. Based on these results, we propose a hybrid packet scheduling scheme that enables the application of Lessthan-Best-Effort services at the connection edges and allows for the development of different packet scheduling policies corresponding to different requirements. Some significant open issues and research directions are also highlighted.",

Case examples of such data are typical sensor data. Non-Congestive Queuing (NCQ) needs not follow a state-full approach to traffic differentiation. We show that (i) non-congestive data gets a much better service from the network,(ii) congestive data suffers no extra delays; instead, both fairness and efficiency are occasionally improved due to lower contention. Having more flows finishing early may lead to better resource sharing.",

            "Abstract": "A major problem in packet networks is congestion. It is usually caused at the bottleneck links where packets get multiplexed. If packets arrive at a faster rate than the link can transmit them, they tend to overload the link and any new incoming packet will get lost. A prolonged congested link affects negatively the performance of the whole network system and applications. For example, in reference [45] and [23] the authors report the same problems caused by congestion in two different packet networks, the DARPANET (which now is named Internet and is a conglomerate of packet networks\u2013private and public) and DECNET. The practice has shown that congestion avoidance techniques are crucial for the normal operation of the network system (see references [23, 45] for example).Many congestion avoidance techniques have been proposed, but the one that has gained ground is the AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease). It was studied theoretically in [23] in terms of congestion avoidance and fairness, and experimentally, in terms of congestion avoidance, in [45]. The principle of this algorithm is to increase the sending rate of the flows when the network is not congested, and to decrease it drastically when congestion occurs. Since it was already coded into TCP by Jacobson, and TCP established a standard interface for reliable transport protocols, the AIMD became the de-facto congestion avoidance mechanism of the Internet. Another strong reason for the acceptance of this algorithm is that its congestion avoidance process is executed entirely at the end-hosts (eg users terminals) rather than using complex schemes at the network nodes \u2026",

In this context, we formulate an analytical model in order to quantify the impact of satellite systems and link asymmetry on TCP performance and real-time delivery. We emphasize on the effects of asymmetric links, and especially on the implications that cause interruptions in the sending rate, and eventually disturb smooth delivery. Since TCP performance is in part throttled by the rate of arriving ACKs, we additionally investigate the impact of delayed ACKs.

Indeed, queue management in DTN networks is a complex issue: loss of connectivity or extended delays, render occasionally meaningless any pre-scheduled priority for packet forwarding.

In our model, no flow is aware of the number of competitors in the channel, no flow is aware of the bandwidth and buffer capacity; however, the system reaches to equilibrium state fast, based on throughput measurements.

Despite this fact, broadband subscribers are usually hesitant to freely share their broadband connection with guests for a multitude of reasons; one of them being sharing their network might hinder their own broadband quality of experience. In this paper, we investigate experimentally the impact of uplink guest traffic on the sharer's broadband quality of experience under both generic and broadband-sharing-specific packet scheduling policies. Both guest-user traffic and access point profiles employed in our study are developed by analyzing real-world traffic traces and measurements, captured from actual broadband sharing networking environments. Our results validate the suitability of hybrid packet scheduling policies for broadband sharing schemes and show that only a few dozen kilobytes per second of uplink guest traffic can be tolerated by sharers without hampering their broadband quality of experience. In this context, we show that the selection of the most appropriate packet scheduling policy for broadband sharing, as well as its respective configuration, depend largely on the capacity of the broadband connection and the policy's packet-dropping behavior on guest traffic.",

Head-to-Tail introduces a novel AQM approach: the packet rearrange scheme. Instead of dropping, HtT rearranges packets, moving them from the head of the queue to its tail. The additional queuing delay triggers a sending rate decrease and congestion events can be avoided. The HtT scheme avoids explicit packet drops and extensive retransmission delays. In this work, we detail the HtT algorithm and demonstrate when and how it outperforms current AQM implementations.

            "Abstract": "Media-streaming applications experience limited performance and perceptible quality degradation in the presence of random wireless errors, as the underlying congestion control typically interprets packet loss as the outcome of congestion. In this context, we propose a selective rate control, namely AIAMD, which manages to differentiate congestive and non-congestive loss by utilizing history in its control rules. AIAMD combines the most desirable features of additive increase additive decrease (AIAD) and additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) controls, reacting gently to wireless loss and more aggressively to congestion. Exploring AIAMD's potential, we identify notable gains in terms of link utilization and media delivery, without compromising intra-protocol fairness.",

SSVP employs Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD)-based congestion control and adapts the sending rate by properly adjusting the inter-packet-gap (IPG). The smoothness-oriented modulation of AIMD parameters and IPG adjustments reduce the magnitude of AIMD oscillation and allow for smooth transmission patterns, while TCP-friendliness is maintained. Our experimental results demonstrate that SSVP eventually adapts to the vagaries of the network and achieves remarkable performance on real-time video delivery. In the event where awkward network conditions impair the perceptual video quality, we investigate the potential improvement via a layered adaptation mechanism that utilizes receiver buffering \u2026",

The DTN (delay/disruption tolerant networking) architecture and particularly the Bundle protocol, offers solutions in networks where low connectivity, big or variable delays and increased error rates are prevalent. Using persistent storage, a DTN node is able to overcome such limitations; the data can be transmitted several times until it is successfully received by the next hop. However, since the conditions in a DTN network might vary, from time to time we may experience high connectivity and low delays. In such cases, data does not need to be transferred to persistent storage, as it will be \u2026",

In this context, local error control is attractive, due to the remarkable feasibility of wireless link protocols in terms of wide range deployment. We investigate whether local retransmissions enable TCP to efficiently utilize wireless resources under the constraint of bounded end-to-end delay. Based on an analytical approach, as well as extensive simulations, we show that local recovery prevents wasteful end-to-end retransmissions and allows the transport protocol to utilize a higher fraction of the available bandwidth.

Head-to-Tail is a new approach to queue scheduling that aspires to alleviate this problem. When conditions at the router's buffer indicate high risk for congestion, Head-to-Tail delays packets intentionally to fabricate the senders' impression about the network load. This implicit signal to reduce the transmission rate allows for a responsive behavior prior to congestion. In this paper, we evaluated Head-to-Tail with TCP Vegas and compared it with RED and other TCP variants.

We seek an answer to strategic issues of maximising energy and bandwidth exploitation, without damaging the dynamics of multiple-flow equilibrium. We claim that (i) an energy-saving strategy of the transport level needs to be associated with some energy potential index which, unlike energy expenditure, is not device-specific and (ii) system-wise an energy-efficient system of flows is not always a better choice: we show that a less energy-efficient system may be more reliable in terms of packet multiplexing and, in turn, may reduce the probability that some flows may expend their energy with zero gain. We perform experiments using a real testbed and ns-2 based simulations.",

Objectives: The core activity of WP3 is the design and implementation of the UMOBILE platform. Departing from the existing properties of DTN and ICN, we establish an architectural framework that extends connectivity options by being delay-tolerant and exposing a common information-centric abstraction to applications. UMOBILE aims to advance networking technologies and architectures towards the conception and realization of Future Internet.

More precisely, our approach provides delay guarantees to applications that do not contribute noticeably to congestion because of their tiny packet sizes and low transmission rates. In addition, our approach uses a second level of prioritization that conditionally favors, in terms of delay, applications with slightly longer packets as well. Based on the NCQ concept, Non\u2010Congestive Queuing Plus (NCQ+) promotes applications that require comparatively small service times, as long as their total service times cause insignificant delays to other packets in the queue. Therefore, we prioritize packets, and in turn corresponding flows, according to their impact on total delay \u2026",

It is designed to better exploit the system properties during equilibrium, without trading off responsiveness for smoothness. In addition, it is capable of achieving convergence to fairness in only two congestion cycles. As a result, both efficiency and fairness are improved, responsiveness is not degraded, and smoothness is significantly improved when the system is in equilibrium. We provide a theoretical analysis for both static and dynamic environments and we discuss the potential of our approach for packet networks.

Our simulation results indicate that SQM manages to increase application satisfaction and augment the user-perceived quality.",

            "Abstract": "We claim that Delay-Tolerant Networking has the potential to form an internetworking overlay that shapes traffic in a manner that exploits the capacity of last hop wireless channels and allows for energy-efficient internetworking. We demonstrate DTN potential for energy-efficient internetworking through an overlay-architecture and a tool we have developed that captures the required state transitions of the mobile device WNIC. We show experimentally that the DTN overlay can re-shape traffic in a manner that allows the receiver to exploit the energy-throughput tradeoff better: it may condense sporadic packets into a burst and, in return, prolong sleep and power-off duration without risk to miss incoming packets and without degradation in throughput.",
