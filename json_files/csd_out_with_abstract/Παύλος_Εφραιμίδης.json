            "Abstract": "In this report we give an overview of our participation in the TREC 2013 Contextual Suggestion Track. We present an approach for context processing that comprises a newly designed and fine-tuned POI (Point Of Interest) data collection technique, a crowdsourcing approach to speed up data collection and two radically different approaches for suggestion processing (a k-NN based and a Rocchio-like). In the context processing, we collect POIs from three popular place search engines, Google Places, Foursquare and Yelp. The collected POIs are enriched by adding snippets from the Google and Bing search engines using crowdsourcing techniques. In the suggestion processing, we propose two methods. The first submits each candidate place as a query to an index of a user\u2019s rated examples and scores it based on the top-k results. The second method is based on Rocchio\u2019s algorithm and uses the rated examples per user profile to generate a personal query which is then submitted to an index of all candidate places. The track evaluation shows that both approaches are working well; especially the Rocchio-like approach is the most promising since it scores almost firmly above the median system and achieves the best system result in almost half of the judged contextprofile pairs. In the final TREC system rankings, we are the 2nd best group in MRR and TBG, and 3rd best group in P@5, out of 15 groups in the category we participated.",

We utilize a series of purely structure-based algorithmic approaches, such as modularity clustering, the minimum linear arrangement (MinLA) problem and the DeGroot opinion update model in order to reveal diverse aspects of the NOIs\u2019 political profile. Our methods are applied to a dataset containing the Twitter accounts of the members of the Greek Parliament as well as an enriched dataset that additionally contains popular news sources.

Despite its widespread use, there is a subtle ambiguity in the definition of the model and, consequently, the dependent models and applications. This ambiguity is a result of the model's tight relation with the field of unequal probability random sampling, which dictates the exact process of edge creation after a newborn node has been added. In this work, we identify the ambiguity, assess its impact and propose a more precise definition of the Barabasi-Albert model that is expressed as an application of unequal probability random sampling.",

In this work, we investigate the information contained in unique structural data of social networks, namely the lists or collections of items, and assess their potential in recommendation systems. Our hypothesis is that the information encoded in the lists can be utilized to estimate the similarities amongst POIs and, hence, these similarities can drive a personalized recommendation system or enhance the performance of an existing one. This is based on the fact that POI lists are user generated content and can be considered as collections \u2026",

The results of the scrambled queries are then used to cover the original user interest. We model the problem theoretically, define a set of privacy objectives with respect to web search and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed solution with a set of real queries on a large web collection. Experiments show great improvements in retrieval effectiveness over a previously reported baseline in the literature.

The system offers high quality personalized recommendations, non-invasive operation and protection of user privacy. A key feature of Pythia is the exploitation of the vast amounts of personal data generated by smartphones to automatically build user profiles, and make contextual suggestions to tourists. More precisely, the system utilizes (sensitive) personal data, such as location traces, browsing history and web searches (query logs), to build a POI-based user profile. This profile is then used by a contextual suggestion engine for making POI recommendations to the user based on her current location. Strong privacy guarantees are achieved by placing both mechanisms at the user-side. As a proof of concept, we present a Pythia prototype which implements the aforementioned \u2026",

When studying the influence problems, we focus on the stochastic processes underlying the solution of DeGroot problems. In case of one decision maker, the analysis of the DeGroot model leads to the formation of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and in the case of two external competing players the model is reduced to a Stochastic Game (SG).

In particular, we present a network economy, called PacketEconomy, where each flow is modeled as a population of rational network packets, and these packets can self-regulate their access to network resources by mutually trading their positions in router queues. Every packet of the economy has its price, and this price determines if and when the packet will agree to buy or sell a better position. We consider a corresponding Markov model of trade and show that there are Nash equilibria (NE) where queue positions and money are exchanged directly between the network packets. This simple approach, interestingly, delivers improvements even when fiat money is used. We present theoretical arguments and experimental results to support our claims.",

The system, which we call Pythia, exploits the computational capabilities of modern smart devices to offer high quality personalized POI (point of interest) recommendations. To protect user privacy, we apply a privacy by design approach within all of the steps of creating Pythia. The outcome is a system that comprises important architectural and operational innovations. The system is designed to process sensitive personal data, such as location traces, browsing history and web searches (query logs), to automatically infer user preferences and build corresponding POI-based user profiles. These profiles are then used by a contextual suggestion engine to anticipate user choices and make POI recommendations for tourists. Privacy leaks are minimized by implementing an important part of the system functionality at the user side, either as a mobile app or as a client-side web application, and by taking additional precautions, like data generalization, wherever necessary. As a proof of concept, we present a prototype that implements the aforementioned mechanisms on the Android platform accompanied with certain web applications. Even though the current prototype focuses only on location data, the results from the evaluation of the contextual suggestion algorithms and the user experience feedback from volunteers who used the prototype are very positive.

The objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule. SUM is an NP-hard problem even when the number of machines is defined to be m= 2. In this work, efficient approximation algorithms for SUM, when the number of machines is an arbitrary constant, are presented. The results hold for SUM and several extensions of SUM, like the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP). The approximation algorithms can achieve any given approximation ratio \u03f5 (approximation schemes) and admit efficient parallelization. The core of the algorithms is a new rounding procedure, the so-called Combinatorial Randomized Rounding (CRR) technique.

In this context we implement and evaluate the PacketEconomy mechanism in the discrete\u2010event simulator OMNET++, using the standard INET library for simulating Internet Protocol version 6 networks and evaluate throughput, end\u2010to\u2010end delay, and packet drop rates. Additionally, we examine whether the flows have a game\u2010theoretic incentive to participate in the market economy, while covering both Transmission Control Protocol\u2013 and User Datagram Protocol\u2013based flows in multiple different cases. The mechanism achieves QoS by allowing packets with different QoS requirements waiting to be served in router queues to mutually trade positions by exchanging money.

            "Abstract": "Mass tourism increasingly gives way to creative and niche tourism. The creative visitor is a more informed tourist, better integrating with the place of a visit, its local culture, history and people. The best ambassadors of a region are local stakeholders who are able to include their offerings within the wider cultural context of the region, as well asvisitors who enjoyed a personalised experience, tailored to their wishes, needs and interests. Recent advances in computer-assisted tourism services are well-suited to support the personalisation of the touristic product. Specifically, recommender systems make it possible to support a personalised experience by tailoring offered information and services to the specific context of an individual visit. MYVISITPLANNER is a cloud-based service employing a recommender engine to offer personalised suggestions of cultural activities and a planning tool to create valid tour plans for visitors and residents of an area. In doing so, it also addresses the need of local authorities and regional stakeholders to raise the visibility of their offerings, by providing an easy to use platform for their recording and inclusion in individual tour planning. This paper offers an overview of the underlying logic and implementation for a personalised activities recommender system, developed as part of the intelligent itineraries planning system MYVISITPLANNER. The recommender engine takes into account both a taxonomy of possible activities, as well as user preferences and past recommendations, making it capable of offering recommendations tailored to the overall visit profile.",

More precisely, we use public lists of POIs to build the PoiGraph, a social graph of POIs, and then apply the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm and the Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) measure to estimate the user rating of each POI and the pairwise similarity between POIs, respectively. We evaluate our approach on POIs from the cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, and Rhodes. As a data source we use the corresponding publicly accessible user-specified lists of POIs of Foursquare. Our results show that for each POI the authority score obtained with the HITS algorithm is firmly correlated with the actual rating of Foursquare.

We examine the behaviour of the DeGroot learning model when external strategic players that aim to influence the opinion formation process are introduced. More specifically, we consider the case of a single decision maker and that of two competing players, with a fixed number of possible influence actions for each of them. In the former case, the DeGroot model takes the form of a Markov Decision Process (MDP), while in the latter case it takes the form of a Stochastic Game (SG). These models are solved using probabilistic model checking techniques, as well as other solution techniques beyond model checking. The viability of our analysis is attested on a well-known social network, the Zachary\u2019s karate club. Finally, the evaluation of influence in a social network simultaneously with the decision maker\u2019s cost is supported, which is \u2026",

Additionally, it tracks the first and last item of any itemset in the window in O (1) time complexity as well as the lightest hitters with no additional computational costs. These properties allow us to efficiently implement a mechanism to limit the heaviest hitters by evicting them from or not allowing them in the window. We describe the algorithms and data structure which implement this functionality, we explain how they can be used to accomplish the goal of limiting the heaviest hitters and perform experiments to produce quantitative results to support our theoretical arguments.",

The system, which we call Pythia, exploits the computational capabilities of modern smart devices to offer high quality personalized POI (point of interest) recommendations. To protect user privacy, we apply a privacy by design approach within all of the steps of creating Pythia. The outcome is a system that comprises important architectural and operational innovations. The system is designed to process sensitive personal data, such as location traces, browsing history and web searches (query logs), to automatically infer user preferences and build corresponding POI-based user profiles. These profiles are then used by a contextual suggestion engine to anticipate user choices and make POI recommendations for tourists. Privacy leaks are minimized by implementing an important part of the system functionality at the user side, either as a mobile app or as a client-side web application, and by taking additional precautions, like data generalization, wherever necessary. As a proof of concept, we present a prototype that implements the aforementioned mechanisms on the Android platform accompanied with certain web applications. Even though the current prototype focuses only on location data, the results from the evaluation of the contextual suggestion algorithms and the user experience feedback from volunteers who used the prototype are very positive",

Although federated learning (FL) enables learning without raw data transmission, recent attacks showed that FL alone does not eliminate privacy concerns. To overcome this challenge, we integrate a privacy-preserving enhancement with a secure aggregation scheme that satisfies the security requirements against an honest-but-curious (HBC) entity, without affecting the quality of the original model. Finally, we discuss the peculiarities observed in the application of FL in a collaborative filtering (CF) task as well as we evaluate the privacy-preserving mechanism in terms of computational cost.",

The standard problem of minimizing the makespan of the schedule (SUM) and the bicriteria problem of scheduling with bounded makespan and cost (SUMC) are addressed, and randomized fully linear time approximation schemes are shown for both of them. While matching the approximation guarantee and the complexity of the best known sequential results of Jansen and Porkolab (12]), the proposed algorithms exhibit a signi cantly simpler and more general rounding scheme, especially for the bicriteria SUMC problem, and admit simple optimal work parallelizations1 of O (log n){time complexity. The core of the algorithms, which also draw techniques from other related works (12], 11], 1]), is an interesting new randomized rounding procedure, the Filtered Randomized Rounding (FRR). In the settings of the problems considered, FRR boosts the deviation bounds of the rounded linear packing constraints to any given constant ratio. Finally, the notion of poly {bottleneck combinatorial optimization problems is de ned and used to build O (nlognlog logn) time approximation schemes for two natural optimization versions of SUMC, that is minimizing the makespan when the cost of the schedule is bounded (SUMCoptT) and minimizing the cost when the makespan is bounded (SUMCoptC). These algorithms too, admit simple optimal work parallelizations.",

We present an approach for context processing that comprises a newly designed and fine-tuned POI (Point Of Interest) data collection technique, a crowdsourcing approach to speed up data collection and two radically different approaches for suggestion processing (a k-NN based and a Rocchio-like). In the context processing, we collect POIs from three popular place search engines, Google Places, Foursquare and Yelp. The collected POIs are enriched by adding snippets from the Google and Bing search engines using crowdsourcing techniques. In the suggestion processing, we propose two methods. The first submits each candidate place as a query to an index of a user\u2019s rated examples and scores it based on the top-k results. The second method is based on Rocchio\u2019s algorithm and uses the rated examples per user profile to generate a personal query which is then submitted to an index of all candidate places. The track evaluation shows that both approaches are working well; especially the Rocchio-like approach is the most promising since it scores almost firmly above the median system and achieves the best system result in almost half of the judged contextprofile pairs. In the final TREC system rankings, we are the 2nd best group in MRR and TBG, and 3rd best group in P@ 5, out of 15 groups in the category we participated.",

In this paper, we present a game-theoretic model, in which the game is played between SPIT senders and internet telephony users. The game includes call filters and audio CAPTCHA, so as to classify incoming calls as legitimate or malicious. We show how the resulting model can be used to decide upon the trade-offs present in this problem and help us predict the SPIT sender\u2019s behavior.

            "Abstract": "We present a personal data management framework called Polis, which abides by the following principle: Every individual has absolute control over her personal data, which reside only at her own side. Preliminary results indicate that beyond the apparent advantages of such an environment for users\u2019 privacy, everyday transactions remain both feasible and straightforward.",

            "Abstract": "We examine the problem of assigning n independent jobs to m unrelated parallel machines, so that each job is processed without interruption on one of the machines, and at any time, every machine processes at most one job. We focus on the case where m is a fixed constant, and present a new rounding approach that yields approximation schemes for multi-objective minimum makespan scheduling with a fixed number of linear cost constraints. The same approach gives approximation schemes for covering problems like maximizing the minimum load on any machine, and for assigning specific or equal loads to the machines.",

            "Abstract": "Starting from the premise that modern routers are not protected from aggressive and unresponsive flows, we define a new, almost stateless, active queue management scheme, called Prince. The basic idea is to protect the fair share of well-behaved flows. We adopt a game theoretic view, where incentive is given to the majority flow by dropping its packets at congestion. In order to find the majority flow, we focus on the queue of the router and detect the flow with the most packets in it. From a game-theoretic point of view, Prince manages to track and bound aggressive flows and favor socially responsible ones. Our results show that in this context Prince resembles MaxMin Fairness allocation. Finally, we also examine a streaming version of the algorithm that can be fine-tuned to any desired performance/accuracy trade-off point.",
