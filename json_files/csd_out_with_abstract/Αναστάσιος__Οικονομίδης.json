            "Abstract": "Accurate and early predictions of students\u2019 performance could significantly affect interventions during teaching and assessment, which gradually could lead to improved learning outcomes. In our research work, we seek to identify and formalize temporal parameters as predictors of performance (\u201ctemporal learning analytics\u201d-TLA) and examine students' temporal behaviour (ie in terms of time-spent) during testing. The goal is to specify a functional set of parameters that will be embedded in an adaptive assessment system in order to contribute to personalization of feedback services. We adopted the Partial Least-Squares (PLS) analysis method for formulating the causal dependencies between latent variables and the relations to their indicators. In this paper we present the motivation and rationale of our work, along with the followed methodology, initial results and contributions so far, and our plans on future work.",

First, a Web-based questionnaire was developed and placed on most popular Greek forums. Then, 300 Greek Internet users stated their opinions regarding digital music and the following downloading methods: 1) Http downloading, 2) P2P downloading, 3) Torrent downloading, and 4) Combined iTunes method. The results revealed that P2P programs are the first choice for downloading mp3. The responders were satisfied with the P2P\u2019s easiness of use, the variety of songs and the no need to pay. However, they worried about P2P\u2019s safety. Gender differences were identified in several areas. Music industry managers could consider these findings in their strategies to reach the consumers. Advertising companies could use the results to target differently male or female consumers.",

These routing protocols are designed taking for granted that all nodes are cooperative and willing to forward control and data packets from and to other nodes. However, when selfish nodes exist in the network, the network performance may degrade significantly. In previous research, selfish nodes are predetermined, meaning that a node is either selfish or not from the beginning (i.e., when deployment takes place) and retains that behavior over time. However, in reality selfishness is not static, but an outcome of restricted energy. In this paper, we investigate the operation of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol, as selfish behavior emerges in a MANET due to energy depletion. We define different levels of selfishness, and we investigate the protocol performance when the nodes inside the network \u2026",

Many application, such as surveillance of a military region, entail unattended operation, where sensor nodes are randomly deployed in an area, known as sensor area. Such a sensor network may be vulnerable to several harmful threats such as wormhole, blackhole, selective forwarding, hello flood, and Sybil attack. One of the most complicated threat is the Sybil attack, where one or more malicious nodes illegitimately declare multiple identities. Additionally, the attack could be even more arduous, if the malicious node(s) declare that the Sybil nodes are directly connected to them. The so-called indirect Sybil attack is the main focus of this study. A performance analysis is devised, where the expected potential number of indirect Sybil nodes in randomly deployed WSNs is computed \u2026",

It is a fixed structure, multiaction, reward-penalty learning automaton, characterized by a star-shaped state transition diagram. Each branch of the star contains D states associated with a particular action. The branches are connected to a central \"neutral\" state. The most general version of STAR involves probabilistic state transitions in response to reward and/or penalty, but deterministic transitions can also be used. The learning behavior of STAR results from the stack-like operation of the branches; the learning parameter is D. By mathematical analysis, it is shown that STAR with deterministic reward/probabilistic penalty and a sufficiently large D can be rendered /spl epsi/-optimal in every stationary environment. By numerical simulation it is shown that in nonstationary, switching environments, STAR usually outperforms classical variable structure automata such \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents PAT (Programming Adaptive Testing), a Web-based adaptive testing system for assessing students\u2019 programming knowledge. PAT was used in two high school programming classes by 73 students. The question bank of PAT consists of 443 questions. A question is classified in one out of three difficulty levels. In PAT the levels of difficulties are adapted to Bloom\u2019s taxonomy lower levels and students are examined in their cognitive domain. This means that PAT has been designed according to pedagogical theories in order to be appropriate for the needs of the course \u201cApplication Development in a Programming Environment\u201d. If a student answers a question correctly a harder question is presented, otherwise an easier one. Easy questions examine the student\u2019s knowledge, while difficult questions examine the student\u2019s skills to apply prior knowledge to new problems. A student answers a personalized test consisting of 30 questions. PAT classifies a student in one out of three programming skills\u2019 levels. It can predict the corresponding classification of students in Greek National Exams. Furthermore, it can be helpful to both students and teachers. A student could discover his/her programming shortcomings. Similarly, a teacher could objectively assess his/her students as well discover the subjects that need to be repeated.",

In the first scenario, students investigate the ancient architecture, archaeological artefacts and historical location at an archaeological site. In the second scenario, students investigate the environmental and natural resource management, endangered species and flora at a national forest. The third scenario describes collaborative game-based learning at outdoors. Multicast Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are employed to support students' communication and collaboration. Simulation results show the feasibility of multicast MANETs to support students' communication and collaboration during these three outdoor educational scenarios.",

Unlike the past research which aimed to suppress that kind of behavior and isolate selfish nodes, we propose a scheme which exploits selfish behavior to improve the routing protocol's performance. We introduce an altruism coefficient which represents each node's overall satisfaction from the network services and while increased, it decreases selfish behavior. We then apply our scheme to an existing routing protocol and evaluate its performance. We show by simulation, that when selfish nodes exist in the network, our scheme improves the performance of the routing protocol.",

The suggested approach forms and revises the student models on-the-fly, using three popular stream mining classification techniques. All methods use specific time-based features as predictors, and the students' self-assessment achievement levels as target values. The obtained results demonstrate that level of certainty, effort and time-spent on answering correctly/wrongly could contribute to pursuing fine-grained and robust student models during self-assessment.",

For this purpose, a routing protocol is needed.An ad-hoc network has certain characteristics, which imposes new demands on the routing protocol. The most important characteristic is the dynamic topology, which is a consequence of node mobility. Nodes can change position quite frequently, which means can consist of laptops and personal digital assistants and are often very limited in resources such as CPU capacity, storage capacity, battery power and bandwidth.

Teachers should be able to exploit, use, and apply digital technologies in all educational activities. This paper investigates teachers\u2019 perceptions regarding their digital skills for performing their teaching and professional responsibilities during the pandemic. More than eight hundred teachers participated in a survey regarding the use of digital technologies in their teaching and their professional responsibilities. Indicative digital tools that can be used by digital competent teachers are also presented to cover all areas of the teachers\u2019 professional activities. Their answers revealed that they mostly used digital tools for finding, evaluating, and developing educational resources as well for teaching. They also used digital tools for self-study, students\u2019 assessment, as well as interacting and communicating with students. However, they hardly used digital tools for other teaching activities such as feedback and final evaluation of the students, or revising the educational resources. Finally, they could not deal with long-term planning, management, and development of either their school or education in general. Although it is important for teachers to effectively respond to their daily emergent teaching responsibilities, consideration should also be given to the long-term planning and development of the digital school and digital education in general.",

            "Abstract": "Mobile learning is gaining high momentum and popularity. In order to develop effective Mobile Learning Applications (MLAs), it is important to consider quality requirements. MLAs should satisfy the learner's needs while enhancing the learning quality. This paper presents a framework for MLA requirements, where the mobile learner performs an educational activity supported by context aware adaptations. It presents and analyses four requirements' dimensions: educational, socio-cultural, economical, and technical. Either the teacher, or the learner himself, or the system will select the appropriate parameters for the particular learner at the particular situation.",

This study focuses on the broadband business field and provides a model for analyzing the new perspectives for new investors in the field. It integrates real options and game theory and considers price and quantity competition for various stages of the business game in order to find the optimal business strategy. Both techniques are based on quantitative analysis, while the complicated broadband business field requires a multi-criteria analysis including also qualitative thinking. The various business factors are integrated into a single utility function using the analytic hierarch process. Finally, we discuss a real world case study in the specific business field.",

In addition to energy consumption considerations, security has emerged as an equally important aspect in their network design. This is because WSNs are vulnerable to various types of attacks and to node compromises that threaten the security, integrity, and availability of data that resides in these networked systems. This paper develops a powerful, anomaly detection system that relies on visual analytics to monitor and promptly detect a particularly devastating form of attack, the wormhole attack. Wormhole attacks can severely deteriorate the network performance and compromise the security by disrupting the routing protocols. The proposed system, called VA-WAD, efficiently utilizes the routing dynamics to expose an adversary conducting a wormhole attack. Then, the \u2026",

In this paper, we argue that doctoral training activity for TEL needs to be situated at the intersection of disciplines in order to facilitate innovation. For this, we first review the state of disciplinarity in TEL, reviewing existing meta-studies of the field. Then, we survey 35 doctoral education programmes in Europe in which doctoral students working on TEL topics are enrolled. Findings indicate that most doctoral schools are associated with a single discipline and offer methodological rather than content-specific modules. TEL-specific content is provided only in exceptional cases, creating a potentially isolating gap between master-level education and scientific conferences. On this background, we argue that cross-institutional doctoral training is important to progress TEL as a field. In this paper, we study and share the approach of an international doctoral summer school organised by the European society EA-TEL over the past 15 years. The summer school provides foundational methodological knowledge from multiple disciplines, content-specific topical knowledge in TEL, access to cutting edge scientific discourse, and discussion of horizontal issues to doctoral students. We further provide an analysis of shifting programme topics over time. Our analysis of both, institutional as well as cross-institutional doctoral training in TEL, constitutes this paper\u2019s core contribution in that it highlights that further integration of perspectives and \u2026",

In many of them, upon detection, a selfish node is punished with isolation from network services access and in most cases with no possibility for redemption. In this paper, we show that selfish behavior can be exploited to improve network performance. We modify an existing routing protocol by introducing an altruism coefficient to model the overall satisfaction of every node from the network services. When the altruism coefficient is increased, the selfish behavior is decreased. We extend our approach by introducing a common welfare factor, which actually enforces the nodes to cooperate when the network connectivity is critical.

            "Abstract": "Recent evolution in the Information Systems (IS) community has involved neuroscience tools and methods in order to develop new theories concerning Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and further understand IS acceptance models. Thus, the field of NeuroIS has emerged. Moreover, NeuroIS researchers have proposed encephalograph (EEG) as valuable usability metric. Particularly, EEG frontal asymmetry has been related to approach/withdraw behaviour and positive/negative affect concerning users\u2019 perceptions. Furthermore, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been established as the most notable model regarding IS acceptance. This study is a first attempt to integrate EEG frontal asymmetry with TAM in order to associate brain activation with the two most important variables of TAM: Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use. Specifically, thirty one undergraduate students were chosen to use a Computer-Based Assessment (while being connected to the EEG) in the context of an introductory informatics course. Results indicate a direct positive association of frontal asymmetry on the aforementioned variables. These findings suggest that frontal asymmetry could be useful for validating and developing Information Technology (IT) theories, as well as designing and explaining the acceptance and adoption of new IS systems or products.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we estimate the value of an Information Communication Technology (ICT) investment opportunity, modeled as a Real Option (RO), when there is competition threat that can influence negatively its value or even more eliminate it. So far in the ICT literature, competition modeling is mainly focusing on duopoly market conditions, where investment actions taken by the firm may likely result in strategic answers by its competitors. However, after the ICT liberalization the number of firms has been increased, and the market structure tends to change from oligopoly to perfect competition. So, it is not practical to employ endogenous competition modeling. We relax the existing literature assumptions concerning exogenous competition modeling by considering that the competitors\u2019 arrival rate and the competitive erosion during the waiting and operating phase for the RO to invest follow stochastic processes in discrete time domain. We provide a ROs model, which estimates the value of a future investment opportunity when competitive entry can take part of the overall market value away from the firm that possesses this option. The results of our model prove that longer \u201cwait-and-see\u201d periods before exercising the ICT real option may indicate higher options values compared to the shorter ones, for some specific business conditions despite the competition threat for possible elimination of the future investment opportunity.",

We also consider that each node either moves on foot or using a slow vehicle. In MANETs, the mobile nodes communicate among themselves either directly or via their intermediate nodes. When they need one-to-many or many-to-many communication, then a multicasting protocol is employed. In this paper, we compare two of the best multicasting protocols: i) MAODV (Multicast Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol), and ii) ODMRP (On Demand Multicast Routing Protocol). We compare them with respect to their achieved PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) and Latency. We investigate what network partitioning into subgroups and for what conditions is more efficient.",

We propose the use of multicast MANETs (Mobile Ad Hoc Networks) and investigate via simulation whether they can efficiently support the communications during such operations. MANETs are suitable for such operations, since they do not need any pre-existing infrastructure. We simulate two realistic scenarios. The first one is a rescue operation to find any survivors at a mountain. We split the rescuers into four teams. The rescuers in each team are coordinated and scan an area of 1000m* 4000m. The purpose of this experiment is to find out the number of the rescuers per team that achieves reliable communication. We also investigate the effect of the antenna range transmissions. The second scenario is a gas pipe explosion in an inhabited area. The damage is in an area of 1500m* 1500m. A rescue group of 40 rescuers and 10 doctors scans the area for any survivors. We use two multicast groups: the rescuers and the doctors. We also use one unicast connection between the rescuer\u2018s leader and the doctor\u2018s leader. We examine the effect of the traffic on the communication reliability.",

            "Abstract": "Individual emotions play a crucial role during any learning interaction. Identifying a student's emotional state and providing personalized feedback, based on integrated pedagogical models, has been considered to be one of the main limits of traditional tools of e-learning. This paper presents an empirical study that illustrates how learner mood may be predicted during online self-assessment tests. Here a previous method of determining student mood has been refined based on the assumption that the influence on learner mood of questions already answered declines in relation to their distance from the current question. Moreover, this paper sets out to indicate that ldquoexponential logicrdquo may help produce more efficient models, if integrated adequately with affective modelling. The results show that these assumptions may prove useful to future research.",

However, ROs are based on the concept to delay investment for collecting more information and learning more about business conditions and during this delay another competitor may act gaining significant competition advantage. In addition, RO models are strictly quantitative and very often telecommunications investments may contain qualitative factors, which cannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, ROs analysis results in some factors that can be treated more efficiently when taken qualitatively. This work deals with quantitative and qualitative analysis and integrates ROs and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) into a common decision analysis framework providing a multicriteria model, for analyzing telecommunication investments in the deregulated business field.",

The inherently vulnerable characteristics of WSNs appoint them susceptible to various types of attacks. This work restrains its focus on how to defend against a particularly harmful form of attack, the Sybil attack. Sybil attacks can severely deteriorate the network performance and compromise the security by disrupting many networking protocols. This paper presents a rule-based anomaly detection system, called RADS, which monitors and timely detects Sybil attacks in large-scale WSNs. At its core, the proposed expert system relies on an ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging-based detection algorithm that operates in a distributed manner requiring no cooperation or information sharing between the sensor nodes in order to perform the anomaly detection tasks.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we estimate the value of an Information Communication Technology (ICT) investment opportunity, modeled as a Real Option (RO), when there is competition threat that can influence negatively its value or even more eliminate it. So far in the ICT literature, competition modeling is mainly focusing on duopoly market conditions, where investment actions taken by the firm may likely result in strategic answers by its competitors. However, after the ICT liberalization, the number of firms has been increased and the market structure tends to change from oligopoly to perfect competition. So, it is not practical to employ endogenous competition modeling. We relax the existing literature assumptions concerning exogenous competition modeling by considering that the competitors\u2019 arrival rate and the competitive erosion during the waiting phase for the RO to invest follow stochastic processes in discrete time domain. We provide a ROs model, which estimates the value of a future investment opportunity when competitive entry can take part of the overall market value away from the firm that possesses this option. The results of our models prove that longer \u201cwait-and-see\u201d periods before exercising the ICT real option may indicate higher options values compared to the shorter ones, for some specific business conditions despite the competition threat for possible elimination of the future investment opportunity.",

Using three web analytics tools (Semrush, SpyFu, and Alexa) the following metrics were measured for each ROER: Authority Score, Referring Domains, Backlinks, Linking Sites into, Monthly Visits, Traffic Distribution per Country, Percentage Visits by Direct, Referral or Search, Number of Unique Visitors, Number of Pages per Visit, Daily Pageviews per visitor, Average Visit Duration, Daily time on site, and Bounce Rate. It seems that MIT OpenCourseWare and Commons are the most successful ROER. Administrators and managers of ROER should collaborate among themselves, promote their ROER to librarians, teachers, and students, populate their ROER with quality and useful ROER, support and empower the visitors with effective tools in order to increase their reputation, popularity, and usage.",

First, they seldom make use of information about how confident a student is in the answer given, and second, it is quite possible that students can get good marks by a combination of partial knowledge and guesswork [4]. More generally, in Computer Based Learning Environments, the representation and maintenance of user\u2019s knowledge can be considered as one of the critical factors that affect the system\u2019s effectiveness. In such systems the evaluation of user knowledge derives from tests and tasks that the system proposes to the user to accomplish. Thus, they inherit the limitations of testing, mentioned above. This paper describes an approach that refines assessment results through user knowledge exploration, incorporating probabilities. We argue that the proposed approach may lead to a better mapping of the assessment results to user knowledge.",

Its successful implementation depends on users' acceptance. However, no study exists exploring the factors that influence students' acceptance of mobile-based assessment. Furthermore, research that combines acceptance with motivational factors is limited. The current study builds on the theoretical framework of the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and proposes the Mobile Based Assessment - Motivational and Acceptance Model (MBA-MAM), a combined model that explains and predicts Behavioral Intention to Use Mobile-based Assessment.

            "Abstract": "Information Communication Technology (ICT) projects may contain \u201cwait and see\u201d components, which give ICT managers the option to defer decisions until some uncertainty is resolved. In this paper, we treat these ICT opportunities as Real Options (RO) and assume that there is competition threat that can influence negatively or even worst eliminate their values. So far in the ICT literature, competition modelling is mainly focusing on duopoly market conditions, where investment actions taken by the firm may likely result to strategic answers by its competitors. However, after the ICT liberalization, the number of firms has been increased and the market structure tends to change from oligopoly to perfect competition. So, it is not practical to employ endogenous competition modelling. We consider exogenous competition modelling assuming that competitors are entering randomly into the market and cause a degradation of the available to the firm of interest overall market value. We model the cost of competition as the part of the overall investment revenue V or alternatively \u201coverall market pie\u201d, which is subtracted by the competitors, from the firm of interest. However, the uncertainty about competition may be genuine, meaning that we simply do not know the exact level of competition cost. In addition, while V is stochastic in nature according to ROs analysis we may also do not know its present level. To handle this, we introduce fuzzy logic and combine it with ROs under competition threat. The theory developed implicitly contains not only the deferral flexibility of projects but also the possibility of considering vague information, which needs to be taken into \u2026",

The proposed TAMBA model explains about 50% of the variance in teachers' intention to adopt mobile\u2010based assessment. Perceived Ease of Use was found to be the most important determinant in teachers' intention to use mobile \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Motivation is an important issue to consider when designing learning activities, including mobile learning and assessment. While previous research provides evidence for the motivational impact of mobile learning, not many pedagogical frameworks exist for the design of mobile-assisted learning and assessment. The current study is grounded in the Self-Determination Theory of motivation and proposes a pedagogical framework for mobile-assisted formative assessment, aiming at enhancing student motivation. For a preliminary evaluation of the framework, fifty-one students from a public European high school participated in a series of formative assessment activities. The tasks that were implemented according to the proposed mobile-based formative assessment framework had a significant positive impact on student perceived levels of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, enhancing students\u2019 intrinsic motivation levels. Study findings highlighted the capacity of the proposed framework to guide the design of mobile-based formative assessment activities that enhance and promote student motivation. The study makes a theoretical contribution by proposing a framework that aligns mobile learning and assessment with elements of the Self-Determination Theory of motivation and also has a practical contribution by implementing mobile learning and assessment practices that have the potential to promote student motivation.

The devised model is quite generic, and as such, it could flexibly be adapted to various IoT architectures. Its flexibility lies in the underlying theory; it is based on a dynamic G-network, where the positive arrivals denote the data streams that originated from the various data collection networks (e.g., sensor networks), while the negative arrivals denote the security attacks that result in data losses (e.g., jamming attacks). In addition, we take into account the intensity of an attack by considering both light and heavy attacks. The light attack implies simple losses of traffic data, while the heavy attack causes massive data loss. The introduced model is solved subject to the arrival and departure rates in terms of: 1) average number of data packets in the application domain and 2) attack impact (loss rate). A \u2026",

The data exchange through the nodes is coordinated by routing algorithms like DSDV so that any node may forward data from a sender to a receiver. Because the network resources such as bandwidth and energy are scarce, power control algorithms have been developed in order to reduce the interference and the contention among the nodes, as well as to save energy. However, a power control algorithm should be thoroughly examined in order to verify if and when these goals are achieved. We ran simulations comparing the performance of DSDV and DSDV-based CLUSTERPOW control algorithm and found that CLUSTERPOW presents scalability issues and enhances network performance only under specific conditions.",

Game theory provides robust tools to model and investigate such attacks. In this paper, we study a class of such jamming games played at the physical layer among a set of monitor nodes and the jammer. We formulate the problem using a Bayesian Stackelberg game. The derived Stackelberg equilibrium strategies define the expected performance of the defender under jamming attacks, and motivate a security-aware protocol design for this type of wireless networks. Different network scenarios are studied to illustrate that the proposed game theoretic approach significantly reduces the ability of the attacker to jam the network.",

Many sensor network implementations use DSDV as their routing protocol. The wireless sensor networks' resources such as throughput and energy are scarce and need to be carefully used. Power control can be implemented by CLUSTERPOW algorithm. Among other factors that could waste the networks' resources and deplete the nodes' energy, is the routing protocol's overhead. DSDV is designed for mobile ad hoc networks and a large ratio of its traffic is generated to keep the routes updated. We studied the behavior of the protocols through simulation and found out that by carefully adjusting some parameters the performance improves, the routing overhead reduces and less energy is consumed.",

We develop a framework for classifying the research on real ICT projects' evaluation using ROs. We analyse these projects with respect to three issues: the complexity of the ICT project; the ROs calculation method; the assumptions made. The ROs applicability on ICT projects has been successfully tested in a dozen real cases. The focus so far is on the evaluation of ICT investments that embed a single, apriori known option.

Therefore it is important to extend CAT's functionality to include more variables in its student model that define the examinee as an individual beyond the mastery level, for improved performance and more efficient test delivery.

Apart from being part of MEC, D2D can extend cellular coverage allowing users to communicate directly when telecommunication infrastructure is highly congested or absent. This significant departure from the typical cellular paradigm imposes the need for decentralised network routing protocols. Moreover, enhanced capabilities of mobile devices and D2D networking will likely result in proliferation of new malware types and epidemics.

Most previous studies investigate the transfer of ICT training and its application in the daily teaching practice by ordinary teachers, usually neglecting the important population of the teachers\u2019 trainers. These teachers\u2019 trainers receive advanced ICT training before start training their colleagues. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the teachers\u2019 trainers\u2019 transfer of ICT training analyzing the structural relationships of their afore-mentioned variables with their gender, ICT self-efficacy, and a set of ICT individual factors.

The results indicate that the CBAAM is valid for both countries in overall. However, there are some cultural differences. Greek students\u2019 behavioral intention is triggered mainly by Perceived Playfulness and Perceived Ease of Use, while Mexican students\u2019 behavioral intention is caused by Perceived Playfulness and Perceived Usefulness. This study is a first step towards a cross-cultural analysis regarding CBA\u2019s acceptance and use.",

Its design is based on an evaluation framework developed from the integration of a number of important issues emerged from research on instructional design and system evaluation the past fifteen years and is concerned with both social and practical acceptability of hypermedia courseware. The term social acceptability is related with the social basis of an educational system. Practical acceptability is examined through the evaluation of the following sectors: content, presentation and organization of the content, technical support and update processes and finally, the evaluation of learning. All sectors are equally important, as hypermedia courseware has to be simultaneously pedagogically and technically sound.

Fuelled by recent advances in networking, communications, computation, software, and hardware technologies, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is considered as the next breakthrough technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. However, realising a network of physical objects accessed through the Internet brings a potential threat in the shadow of the numerous benefits. The threat is \u201csecurity\u201d.

            "Abstract": "Despite the proliferation of e-government in recent years few studies evaluate the efficacy of e-government websites. The aim of this article is to investigate the state of ministries' websites in Europe. Ten types of ministries in ten European countries were selected, thus giving a total of 100 websites. In order to evaluate these 100 European ministries' websites from the citizens' perspective, an evaluation framework (eGovQual) consisting of 100 criteria was developed. The thirteen main evaluation dimensions of the eGovQual are the following: 1) Content, 2) Presentation-Media-Format, 3) User Interface, 4) Structure & Organization, 5) Navigation, 6) Orientation, 7) Interactivity & Feedback, 8) Services-Functions-Facilities-Operations-Applications, 9) Reliability & Availability, 10) Maintainability, 11) Performance, 12) Openness-Compatibility-Interoperability, 13) Security. Then seven University students evaluated these websites using eGovQual. The evaluation results revealed that most European ministries' websites achieve a satisfactory quality level. The websites of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, and Environment excelled. However, there are inefficiencies with respect to the dynamic interaction and communication with the citizen, the e-services, the personalization, and consideration given to those with special needs. Furthermore, the sites' administrators should continuously adopt new technological advances (eg mobile government, Web 2.0) in order to effectively serve the citizens.",

            "Abstract": "Traditional investment appraisal techniques, such as net present value (NPV) do not capture the flexibility in the investment deployment strategy inherent in most of the technology projects. In this paper, we use Real Options (ROs) to capture the value of flexibility in the evaluation of a real-life telemetry and automation investment, for a water management utility company. We examine the investment\u2019s profitability of an Information, Communication and Automation Technology (ICAT) platform on which a SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system will be built and operate. The investor is faced with the problem of valuing a number of investment opportunities based on the initial base scale of ICAT infrastructure investment. We treat these opportunities as ROs, quantify flexibility by adopting step-wise investment deployment strategy and estimate the overall value of the investment opportunity. The results prove that ROs evaluation can increase profitability of investments, especially in cases where their NPV value is negative or marginally positive.",

While there is a significant amount of research that investigates the acceptance of computer- based assessment from one side and the acceptance of mobile learning from the other, relatively few studies focus explicitly on the factors that influence the acceptance of Mobile-based Assessment. The current study implements a mobile-based outdoor educational activity in the city's Botanic Gardens during an environmental education project. 50 secondary school students participated in a mobileassisted assessment procedure using Quick Response (QR) - coding technology through their mobile devices. The study examines the impact of Perceived Mobility, Authentic Context and Interest/Enjoyment on students' Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use and Behavioral Intention to Use Mobile-based Assessment. Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used for the data analysis. Results show that Perceived Mobility, Authentic Context and Interest/Enjoyment, Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use are all significant determinants of Behavioral Intention to Use mobilebased assessment. Furthermore, the study examines the impact of using mobile devices during the learning activity on students' learning motivation. Implications for designing and implementing mobile-based assessment procedures are discussed.",

This paper presents the feedback attributes that would be adapted to the learner\u2019s state. In CAT, feedback would be generated before and after a question, problem or task is presented to the learner. This paper proposes various pre-question and after-the-question feedback types. These feedback types would be personalized to specific mind states of the learner. These include cognitive, emotional and conational feedback types. The proposed feedback attributes and personalized feedback types would be useful for analysts, designers, developers and evaluators of CAT systems to make appropriate decisions.",

Mobile technologies provide new and enhanced learning opportunities, such as personalization and adaptivity, context-awareness and ubiquity, interactivity, communication and collaboration among learners, and seamless bridging between contexts in both formal and informal learning (Sung et al. 2016; West and Vosloo 2013).Current research in mobile learning primarily focuses on the following:(i) the effects of integrating mobile devices with teaching and learning on students\u2019 learning performance (Sung et al. 2016),(ii) the motivational impact of mobile learning (Hwang and Wu 2014) and (iii) the factors that affect the acceptance of mobile devices into teaching and learning (Nikou and Economides 2018). Researchers also have tried to combine technology acceptance with motivation theories in order to explain and predict behavioural intention to use mobile learning (Nikou and Economides 2017a). Many scholars agree that initial acceptance of any information technology is not enough and, therefore, they suggest that the continuance intention towards using a technology should be used as a success criterion instead (Bhattacherjee and Barfar 2011; Bhattacherjee 2001).

Trying to bridge the gap between students\u2019 diversity and personal traits, new approaches in Language Learning (LL) need to be considered. To this end, the new advances in technology and specifically in telecommunications can prove to be of use. This paper favours the exploitation of Computer-Conferencing (CC) technologies for the current demands of EAP. It discusses the merits of synchronous and asynchronous communication and deduces that asynchronous communication is the most beneficial feature of CC in LL, for reasons such as reflectivity, interactivity, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, motivation, accessibility, collaboration and the pedagogical outcomes of the print form of oral communication. In conjunction with general findings in LL, the paper attempts to approach the role of CC learning environments in EAP. After a needs analysis regarding an ESP course, the paper presents a model of CC implementation into the traditional EAP classroom in accordance with the four language skills.",

Most previously proposed congestion pricing models are complicated and therefore difficult to be accepted by customers. Simple data pricing methods are needed in today\u2019s 3G networks. A congestion pricing method is proposed only for customers willing to pay more during congestion. Other simple methods include usage pricing with cost constrains, event and content based pricing. Event and content based pricing have been successfully used in 2G and 2.5 G (GPRS) mobile networks. A taxonomy of services with respect to their traffic behavior (controlable traffic or not) as well to the content (controlable content or not) is proposed in order to price the services using usage, event or content pricing.",

In this paper, we report on the results from an alternative approach for dynamic student behavioral modeling based on the analysis of time-based student-generated trace data. The goal was to unobtrusively classify students according to their time-spent behavior. We applied 5 different supervised learning classification algorithms on these data, using as target values (class labels) the students' performance score classes during a Computer-Based Assessment (CBA) process, and compared the obtained results.

In these situations, MANETs (Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks) are used. When these nodes need one-to-many or many-to-many communication then multicasting is employed. Two of the best multicast protocols, MAODV (Multicast Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol) and ODMRP (On Demand Multicast Routing Protocol), are compared. The performance measures to be evaluated are the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) and the Latency. Previous studies evaluate these algorithms with respect to the network traffic and the node speed. This study evaluates these algorithms with respect to the network traffic, the node speed, as well as the area and the antenna range for different simulation scenarios. MAODV performs better for high traffic. ODMRP performs better for large areas and high node speeds and poorer for small antenna ranges.",

Game theory has been proven very useful for accurately modeling the underlying strategic interactions between the sensor nodes and for providing the relays with incentives to forward the other nodes' data. In the present paper, we study a class of such games played at the network layer among a set of relay nodes and the source-destination pair. We formulate the source routing problem using a Stackelberg game framework. The Stackelberg equilibrium strategies derived from our game define the expected performance of the network under different traffic conditions, and motivate an efficient routing protocol design for this type of wireless networks.

            "Abstract": "In recent years, handheld devices have become one of the fastest growing communication gadgets. Mobile technology is becoming widespread and research in this area is urgently needed. Using a survey instrument, the thoughts of male and female students regarding the importance and costs of mobile devices were investigated. It was found that students tend to consider the following features important: battery life, mp3 player, video camera, photo camera, storage memory, Bluetooth, design and elegance, clock, calendar, organizer and reminder. Also, they are eager to spend an amount of money so as their mobile device to support them. On average, both genders would pay extra money for such features. However, the majority of females think less of the price than males do. On the contrary, most of the respondents do not consider the following important: touch screen, voice commands, chat, teleconference \u2026",

However, in the last decade relevant literature has maintained that most educational software does not meet its promise. One of the reasons for the lack of educational software of high quality is that educational research cannot keep pace with the advances of technology and as a result existing evaluation methods are often inadequate. Yet, in the past fifteen years a number of important issues emerged from research on instructional design and system evaluation that can be used from evaluators of educational software. This paper is an attempt to integrate some of these.",

For this purpose electroencephalogram (EEG) was adopted and Event Related Desynchronization/Event Related Synchronization (ERD/ERS) has been used as an index in order to investigate the alpha brain responses. Statistically significant results suggest that the combination of audio-visual stimuli with binaural beats and flickering light color at 8 and 10 Hz respectively can evoke significant Following Frequency Response (FFR) of the low and upper alpha oscillations.",

Based on their answers, all participants have many passwords for their everyday needs and they try to select passwords that are not only memorable, but also secure. Unfortunately, they can not deal with proper password selection and they become victims of dictionary attacks. Understanding this situation, participants were very positive in learning more about the new authentication methods. They found both techniques memorable and friendly\u2013visual passwords at most.

They do not necessarily rely on existing infrastructures. When the mobile nodes need oneto-many or many-to-many communication then multicasting is employed. Two of the best multicast protocols, MAODV (Multicast Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol) and ODMRP (On Demand Multicast Routing Protocol), are compared. The performance measures to be evaluated are the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) and the Latency. This paper investigates two problems: i) does nodes partitioning into sub-groups improve performance? and ii) what is the best number of sub-groups? Three different movement scenarios are examined: i) Random movement, where all nodes move unpredictably in the area, ii) Directed movement, where the nodes move freely along the x-axis but directionally from y (0, 0) to y (0, 2000) along the y-axis, and iii) Directed II, where the nodes move as in the Directed movement and the subgroup leaders communicate with each other. Two different speed values are also examined: i) 1 m/s (average walking speed), and ii) 10 m/s (slow vehicle speed).",

As a result, the involved senior managers are increasingly being confronted with the need to make significant investment decisions related to the e-learning business activities. The valuation of e-learning business activities is a challenging task since it is characterized by rapidly changing business and technology conditions. In this paper, we apply ROs (Real Options) to the e-learning investments evaluation. Given the investment\u2019s requirements, assumptions and risks, the goal is to maximize the investment\u2019s value by identifying a good way to structure it using carefully chosen ROs. However, ROs models are based on quantitative analysis and the required input parameters sometimes are difficult to be estimated for evaluating real life investment opportunities. In addition, e-learning investments experience tangible and intangible factors and the latter can be mainly treated by qualitative analysis. For this reason, we integrate ROs thinking and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to take into account financial tangible, intangible and risk factors providing a decision analysis framework. The proposed framework provides a better understanding of projects risks and various intangible factors inherent in e-learning projects enabling these projects to be deployed more optimum and valued with higher accuracy. Finally, we apply the proposed model in an e-learning case study showing how it can be formulated and solved.",

            "Abstract": "Wireless networks will play an important role in education. The infrastructure of wireless networks mostly focuses on wireless ad-hoc networks. They will provide freedom from place restrictions, flexibility, dynamic interaction, scalable multicast services and adaptive architecture. One of their most appealing services is group communication. New educational models and wireless architectures have been proposed to enhance collaborative training. Wireless ad-hoc networks are multihop wireless networks and can provide a dynamic educational environment. However, the lack of fixed infrastructure in ad-hoc wireless networks generates new research problems. This paper examines the different ways wireless technology work and the required prerequisites to integrate it into the educational area. It also describes educational opportunities and challenges of teaching in a real time wireless classroom environment. Since ad-hoc networks do not need fixed infrastructure, the developed protocols must be self-configuring. Additionally, this paper refers to the constraints and barriers, which prevent wireless networks from being accepted. It provides educational models and techniques in order to easier the transition from traditional computerized training systems to wireless training systems. Different approaches for multicast services propose the utilization of several routing protocols or hybrid adaptive mechanisms for joining/leaving groups. Lastly, the paper compares models and architectures in educational wireless networks, taking into consideration the shortages of the educational systems, and predicts future trends and perspectives of integrated \u2026",

So far in the ICT literature, competition modeling is mainly focusing on duopoly market conditions, where investment actions taken by the firm may likely result in strategic answers by its competitors. However, after the ICT liberalization, the number of firms has been increased and the market structure tends to change from oligopoly to perfect competition. So, it is not practical to employ endogenous competition modeling. We consider exogenous competition modeling. We also relax literature assumptions by considering that the competitors' entry into the market causes competitive erosions during the waiting phase for the RO to invest and also during the operation phase, which \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Since researchers acknowledged the several advantages of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) over traditional linear test administration, the issue of item exposure control has received increased attention. Due to CAT\u2019s underlying philosophy, particular items in the item pool may be presented too often and become overexposed, while other items are rarely selected by the CAT algorithm and thus become underexposed. Several item exposure control strategies have been presented in the literature aiming to prevent overexposure of some items and to increase the use rate of rarely or never selected items. This paper reviews such strategies that appeared in the relevant literature from 1983 to 2005. The focus of this paper is on studies that have been conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of item exposure control strategies for dichotomous scoring, polytomous scoring and testlet-based CAT systems. In addition, the paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy group using examples from simulation studies. No new research is presented but rather a compendium of models is reviewed with an overall objective of providing researchers of this field, especially newcomers, a wide view of item exposure control strategies.",

We applied a three-step process mining methodology on logged interaction traces from a case study with 259 undergraduate university students. The analysis revealed sequences of interactions in which low goal-orientation students answered quickly and correctly on difficult items, without reviewing them, while they submitted wrong answers on easier items.

            "Abstract": "The inadequacy of traditional quantitative cost-benefit analysis for evaluating information and communications technologies (ICT) infrastructure investments have led researchers to suggest real options (ROs) analysis for valuating ICT projects. However, ROs models are strictly quantitative and often, ICT investments may contain qualitative factors that cannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, ROs analysis results in some factors that can be treated more efficiently when taken qualitatively. This paper combines ROs and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) into a common decision analysis framework, providing an integrated multiobjective, multicriteria model called ROAHP for prioritizing a portfolio of interdependent ICT investments. The proposed model is applied to an ICT case study showing how it can be formulated and solved.",

            "Abstract": "Though revolutionizing, Computer Based Assessment (CBA) has not accomplished to become an established system of evaluation in Foreign Language Assessment (FLA). Research in CBA is very narrow and short-term, while the findings are usually misleading. This is mainly due to the inability from the part of New Technologies to simulate the human examiner and the lack of flexibility as regards language errors. In many cases, the performance of examinees during CBA varies from the corresponding performance during a traditional, paper-and-pencil examination. The reason for this has to do either with student or system inability. CBA systems are programmed to assess the competence of a wide number of individual students. Yet, our experience as teachers reveals that the examiner is not an impersonal \u201cchecker\u201d but an active, emotional intervener between the examinee and the test. The paper aims to prove that Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) can deservedly substitute the human examinee, by assessing the true cognitive state and foreign language competence of each student. CAT technologies can introduce a new, student-based era in Foreign Language Assessment that will be personalized, flexible, and sensitive to human cognition, language processing and error correction. To this end, research in FLA needs to fully exploit the current findings in CAT, Cognitive Science, Foreign Language Learning, and Error Correction. After reporting the findings in error correction, the paper separates wrong answers into errors and mistakes and proposes an innovative methodology for CAT as regards FLA that will approximate the exact \u2026",

However, this task is not trivial, because students in a group may not be fulfilled by the same items, yet wish to meet their own expectations. Existing approaches either merge individual profiles and recommend items accordingly, or fuse the lists of individual recommendations. Both perspectives achieve low quality performance and goodness of recommendation for majority of students in heterogeneous groups. This paper follows a game-theoretic approach for solving conflict of interest among students and recommending resources to both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups in collaborative learning contexts. The group members are the players, the resources comprise the set of possible actions, and selecting those items that will maximize all students' satisfaction - both \u2026",

In order to achieve adaptive behavior an ILE should have a rich representation of the learning context, which is defined, among others, by the learner\u2019s characteristics, the type of the educational material, the advisory history, etc. Actually, the user model used by the system, and especially the representation and maintenance of user\u2019s knowledge can be considered as one of the critical factors that affect the system\u2019s effectiveness, in terms of it\u2019s capability to adapt to the individual learner\u2019s needs. In general, the evaluation of user knowledge derives from tests and tasks that the system proposes to the user to accomplish. This paper describes an approach that refines assessment results through user knowledge exploration, incorporating probabilities. We argue that the proposed approach leads to a better mapping of the assessment results to user knowledge in terms of its adaptivity to the response style of each individual learner.",

However, many are risky and are often considered runaway, because they do not meet original expectations of cost, time, or benefits. Effective management of risks in ICT projects is therefore extremely important. In this paper we propose real options (ROs) thinking for controlling risks in ICT projects. We present a framework for understanding and hedging risks in ICT projects based on the finance literature on ROs. However, existing RO models are based on quantitative analysis and the required input parameters sometimes may be difficult to be estimated for evaluating real life investment opportunities. Instead we adopt a qualitative options thinking for finding the optimum deployment strategy for an ICT project.

We compare via simulation their performance with respect to the pause time of nodes movement. We find which routing protocol is appropriate for certain network conditions. When the nodes move continually then AODV seems to be better than DSDV. When nodes stay unmoving for a long time then DSDV is preferable.",

            "Abstract": "This paper reviews all different variables that have been used in adaptive educational systems and then discuss their potential use to a hypothetical user model for Computer Adaptive Testing. From all the variables presented that triggers adaptation, modelling of'knowledge on the domain presented','background-experience','preferences','personal data'and'mental models' can produce more efficient CATs in terms of time, as fewer items will be needed to assess performance. Moreover, it could affect items' quality, since items can be more complex taking into account user characteristics, resulting in testing sessions that can contribute to the learning process and not merely arrange examinees on a problem complexity scale.",

            "Abstract": "A student's emotional state is crucial during learning. When a student is in a very negative mood, learning is unlikely to occur. On the other hand, a too-positive mood can also impair learning. Thus a key issue for instructional technology is recognising the student's mood, so as to be able to provide appropriate feedback. This paper introduces student's mood models during an online self-assessment test. Two models were evaluated using data emanating from experiments with 153 high school students from three different regions of Greece. The results confirm the models' ability to estimate a student's mood.",

However, the lack of language competences is still one of the main barriers to participation in European education, training, and youth programs. This work aims to identify, analyze and present the language needs of the participants involved in mobility activities supported under Erasmus+\u2009Key Action 1. Data were collected by means of an online questionnaire to identify all the necessary information regarding the language needs of the Erasmus+\u2009KA1 Mobility participants as well as their motivations to participate in the mobility. Also, in order to collect additional information in creating a profile and identifying the linguistic needs of all the Erasmus+\u2009participants, a series of semi-structured interviews with Erasmus+\u2009key stakeholders and with Erasmus+\u2009National Agency Officers was conducted \u2026",
