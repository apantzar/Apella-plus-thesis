            "Abstract": "Nowadays, the Passivity-Based Control (PBC) has been successfully applied to digitally controlled Grid-Connected Inverter (GCI) with  LCL  filter. As a nonlinear method, the PBC controller has strong robustness against the parameter drift of the  LCL  filter and the grid impedance, where the parameters of the PBC controller still need to be designed carefully to achieve a good control performance. The existing design methods are based on separating the PBC controller into three control loops. Therefore, the design process is cumbersome, especially for inexperienced engineers, due to the complex structure of the PBC controller. In this article, an intelligent Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to simplify the parameters design of the PBC controller, where the difficulty of manual calculations is avoided and the parameters can be more easily and efficiently obtained using MATLAB in offline mode \u2026",

In this paper, a method for the calculation of reliability (i.e. number of failures / 10 6  hours) of a three-phase full-bridge inverter, which is employed in the dynamic waste heat recovery system of an aircraft, is presented. The main factors for the reliability analysis that have to be considered is the topology of the inverter, the ambient temperature conditions, the power switches (type and modulation technique), and the harmonic filter. The power inverter reliability has been calculated using a software program developed under the Matlab platform, which was used to calculate the failure rate of each device of the inverter, such as the power switches, the DC-bus capacitor and the filter inductor, given the operating switching frequency value. The results indicate that at higher switching frequency levels the inverter of the DWHR system exhibits a high failure rate \u2026",

The total cost function minimization is implemented using genetic algorithms, which have the ability to calculate the global optimum in the overall state space with relative computational simplicity. The proposed method has been applied for the design of desalination systems, which cover the potable water demands of a small community and of a residential household, respectively, in order to prove its effectiveness in various desalination system size scales.

The optimal switching frequency as well as the optimal values and types of the PV inverter components is calculated such that the PV inverter LCOE generated during the PV system lifetime period is minimized. The LCOE is also calculated considering the failure rates of the components, which affect the reliability performance and lifetime maintenance cost of the PV inverter. A design example is presented, demonstrating that compared to the nonoptimized PV inverter structures, the PV inverters designed using the proposed optimization methodology exhibit lower total manufacturing and lifetime maintenance cost and inject more energy into the electric-grid and by that minimizing LCOE.",

The resulting PWM frequency depends on the target FPGA or CPLD device speed grade and the duty cycle resolution requirements. The post-layout timing simulation results are presented, showing that PWM frequencies up to 3.985 MHz can be produced with a duty cycle resolution of 1.56%.

To address this, regulations have been imposed on PV systems to ensure that more active and flexible power control is performed. As an advanced control strategy, absolute active power control (AA PC) can effectively solve overloading issues by limiting the maximum possible PV power to a certain level (i.e., the power limitation) and can also benefit the inverter reliability because of the reduced thermal loading of the power devices. However, its feasibility is challenged by the associated energy losses.

The proposed sensor node is appropriate for large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) agricultural applications, which are capable of collecting information about the health status of multiple plants over a broad area, with low cost and low power-consumption.

            "Abstract": "The market of PV systems is rapidly expanding during the last years and the transformerless DC/AC inverters are key components in this evolution. Despite its design and control simplicity, a transformerless full-bridge DC/AC inverter may exhibit a high leakage ground current, due to capacitive coupling between the solar panels and ground, which prohibits its employment in single-phase PV systems. Thus, multiple alternative transformerless PV inverter topologies have been developed in the past, which, however, comprise additional power devices and/or passive components. In this paper, a new modulation method is proposed for optimally controlling the power switches of transformerless single-phase full-bridge PV inverters, such that their leakage ground current is minimized. The design results demonstrate that by using the proposed technique, the leakage ground current of transformerless full-bridge inverters \u2026",

Results of the application of a novel MPPT technique to a hybrid renewable energy system are also presented. The proposed MPPT unit is part of an Energy Management System (EMS) composed of DC/DC power converters controlled by a microcontroller unit. The advantage of the proposed method, compared to other techniques used in the past, is that the generated power controls directly the DC/DC converters, while it does not require the exact knowledge of the optimal PV and W/G power vs. voltage and speed of rotation characteristics, thus reducing the complexity of the system. The experimental results show that by the use of the proposed MPPT control method the power produced by the PV and W/G sources is near optimal.",

Regulations have been imposed on the PV systems, where more active power control should be flexibly performed. As an advanced control strategy, the Absolute Active Power Control (AAPC) can effectively solve the overloading issues by limiting the maximum possible PV power to a certain level (i.e., the power limitation), and also benefit the inverter reliability. However, its feasibility is challenged by the energy loss. An increase of the inverter lifetime and a reduction of the energy yield can alter the cost of energy, demanding an optimization of the power limitation. Therefore, aiming at minimizing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), the power limit is optimized for the AAPC strategy in this paper. The optimization method is demonstrated on a 3-kW \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A battery-charging system for stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) applications is presented. Advantages of the proposed method are: better exploitation of the available PV energy by means of a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique employed in the control algorithm, increased battery lifetime due to higher level state of charge operation, and the charging control process does not depend on accurate battery current measurements, reducing the effect of the current sensor sensitivity on the battery final state of charge. Also, since it is based on the battery current regulation principle, it can be effectively used with large battery strings. The experimental results verify that, using the proposed method, a better exploitation of the available PV energy, compared to a commercial battery charger based on the on/off principle, is achieved, and simultaneously a 100% battery state of charge is reached in shorter time.",

The digital SPWM generation unit implementations have dominated over their counterparts based on analog circuits. In this paper, an FPGA-based SPWM generator is presented, which is capable to operate at switching frequencies up to 1 MHz (requiring FPGA operation at 100-160 MHz), thus it is capable to support the high switching frequency requirements of modern power electronic DC/AC converters. The successful operation of the proposed SPWM generator at high switching frequencies is demonstrated with post place-and-route simulation results for design verification and actual runs on hardware for design validation and proof-of-concept. The switching frequency of this system is an order of magnitude faster than previously \u2026",

In this paper, we provide an algorithmic framework, along with an interactive web-based tool, to enable short-to-middle term forecasts of photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind generators output. Importantly, we propose a generic PV output estimation method, the backbone of which is a solar irradiance approximation model that incorporates free-to-use, readily available meteorological data coming from online weather stations. The model utilizes non-linear approximation components for turning cloud-coverage into radiation forecasts, such as an MLP neural network with one hidden layer. We present a thorough evaluation of the proposed techniques, and show that they can be successfully employed within a broad geographical region (the \u2026",

In all of these applications, appropriate energy management processes must be performed for maximizing the energy produced by the wind turbines and transfer the generated energy to the consumer with high efficiency and required power quality. In this chapter, an overview of modern energy management techniques for WECS is presented, in terms of both the hardware architecture employed and the control methods that are applied.",

In this paper, the use of Stochastic Weather Generators (SWGENs) is introduced for the optimal design and reliability evaluation of hybrid Photovoltaic/Wind-Generator systems providing energy to desalination plants. A SWGEN is proposed, which is based on parametric Markov-Switching Auto-Regressive (MSAR) models and is capable to simulate realistic hourly multivariate time series of solar irradiance, temperature and wind speed of the target installation site. Numerical results are presented, demonstrating that: (i) SWGENs enable to evaluate the reliability of RES-based desalination plants during their operation over a 20 years lifetime period and (ii) using \u2026",

Additionally, it has a flexible architecture that can be tuned to a variety of single-phase dc/ac inverter applications.

The proposed TDR sensor comprises a sensing probe constructed using low-cost and widely-available multilayer and stainless steel tubes. A simple signal-conditioning circuit has been designed for interfacing the acquired measurements to a digital data-acquisition device through an I 2 C communication bus. Thus, the manufacturing cost and power consumption of the proposed sensor are relatively low, enabling its incorporation in Wireless Sensor Networks which are power-supplied by Renewable Energy Sources.
