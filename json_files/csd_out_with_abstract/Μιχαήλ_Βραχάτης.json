In this contribution, we combine gene differential analysis (single gene view) with gene co-expression analysis (systemic view) to provide insights on the implicated molecular mechanisms across breast cancer progression. Important gene-gene links in a gene co-expression network are identified and clustered with Density and Distance Content driven (DeDiCo) algorithm, which has been recently published by members of our groups. This algorithm presents very good performance regarding its accuracy on both synthetic and real-life datasets and ability to determine arbitrarily shaped clusters without any assumptions on the shape and the number of the clusters.

Thereby, many methodologies for automatic music composition have been or could be described as \u201cintelligent,\u201d but what exactly is it that makes them intelligent? Furthermore, is there any categorization of intelligent music composition (IMC) methodologies that is both consistent and descriptive? This chapter aims to provide some insights on what IMC methodologies are, through proposing and analyzing a detailed categorization of them. Toward this perspective, methodologies that incorporate bioinspired intelligent algorithms (such as cellular automata, L-systems, genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence, among others) as well as their combinations are considered and briefly reviewed. At the same time, a consistent categorization of these methodologies is proposed, taking into account the utilization of their intelligent algorithm in accordance to their overall compositional aims. To this end, three main categories can be defined: the \u201cunsupervised,\u201d the \u201csupervised,\u201d and the \u201cinteractive\u201d IMC methodologies.",

More specifically, we suggest to utilize the differential evolution algorithm to endemically evolve its own control parameters. To achieve this, two simultaneous instances of Differential Evolution are used, one of which is responsible for the evolution of the crucial user-defined mutation and recombination constants. This self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm alleviates the need of tuning these user-defined parameters while maintains the convergence properties of the original algorithm. The evolutionary self-adaptive scheme is evaluated through several well-known optimization benchmark functions and the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is promising.",

A number of methodologies have been developed in the past decades for this purpose. Deflection and stretching are two techniques that can be integrated with any optimization algorithm in order to detect multiple minimizers by properly transforming the objective function. Requiring only a minimal number of control parameters, both techniques have been used with metaheuristics as well as gradient-based optimization algorithms, enhancing their performance while demanding only minor implementation effort. Up until now their applications span various scientific fields, ranging from game theory and numerical optimization to astrophysics, computational intelligence, and medical informatics.

Because of a variety of parameters, such as multiple accounting ratios or many potential explanatory variables, the complexity of this problem is very high. For this reason, the probability for a company to go bankrupt or not is very difficult to be calculated. Moreover, the precise determination of the bankruptcy is a very important issue.

The development of technologies capable to simultaneously study the expression of every gene in an organism has provided a wealth of biological insight. Although the classification of the data obtained from microarray studies is very important in medical diagnosis of many diseases, it still presents a challenge since the number of genes is usually very high compared to the number of the samples. To this end, different dimension reduction techniques have been considered to tackle the very high dimensionality of this kind of data. In this paper, we present and implement a system that combines an unsupervised clustering algorithm and the Principal Component Analysis technique for dimension reduction, in an attempt to exploit the advantages of both approaches. Subsequently, the classification system employs artificial neural networks to classify the gene expression data. Comparative results from three publicly available gene expression classification problems indicate that high classification rates are possible. Moreover, the subsets of features that contribute significantly to the success of the neural classifiers can be identified.",

The k-means has a time complexity that is dominated by the product of the number of patterns, the number of clusters, and the number of iterations. Also, it often converges to a local minimum. In this paper, we present an improvement of the k-means clustering algorithm, aiming at a better time complexity and partitioning accuracy.

A hybrid prediction scheme which combines several classifiers, rather than selecting a single robust method, is a good alternative solution. In order to address this issue, we have provided an ensemble of classifiers to create a hybrid decision support system. This method based on stacking variant methodology that combines strong ensembles to make predictions. The presented hybrid method has been compared with other known-ensembles. The experiments conducted on several standard benchmark datasets showed that the proposed scheme gives promising results in terms of accuracy in most of the cases.",

The performance of Pi-Sigma Networks is evaluated through several well known neural network training benchmarks. In the experiments reported here, Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms for Pi-Sigma networks training are presented. More specifically the distributed version of the Differential Evolution algorithm has been employed. To this end, each processor is assigned a subpopulation of potential solutions. The subpopulations are independently evolved in parallel and occasional migration is employed to allow cooperation between them. The proposed approach is applied to train Pi-Sigma networks using threshold activation functions. Moreover, the weights and biases were confined to a narrow band of integers, constrained in the range [\u2212 32, 32], thus they can be represented by just 6 bits. Such networks are better suited for hardware implementation than the real weight ones. Preliminary results suggest that this training process is fast, stable and reliable and the distributed trained Pi-Sigma network exhibited good generalization capabilities.",

To do so we have resorted to evaluating the optimal military expenditure for the two countries, allied in the context of the Integrated Defence Doctrine, which is compatible with the constraints imposed by the resources of their economies. All experiments and scenarios examined lead to the conclusion that the current defence burden of the two allies seems to be driving their economies beyond capacity limits. The fact remains, however, that under the circumstances, a one-sided disarmament policy like the one currently followed by Greece, is a risky choice given that the long-term armament programmes pursued by Turkey, whose role in this arms race has been proven as leading, leave very small room to the Greek and Cypriot sides to reduce their own defence expenditure.",

The most commonly used computational approach for analyzing microarray data is cluster analysis. In this paper, we investigate the application of an unsupervised extension of the recently proposed k-windows clustering algorithm on gene expression microarray data. This algorithm apart from identifying the clusters present in a dataset also calculates their number thus no special knowledge about the data is required. To improve the quality of the clustering, we selected the most highly correlated genes with respect to the class distinction of the genes. The results obtained by the application of the algorithm exhibit high classification success.",

Particle Swarm Optimization has the tendency to distribute the best personal positions of the swarm near to the vicinity of problem's optima. In an attempt to efficiently guide the evolution and enhance the convergence, we evolve the personal experience of the swarm with the Differential Evolution algorithm. Extensive experimental results on twelve high dimensional multimodal benchmark functions indicate that the hybrid variants are very promising and improve the original algorithm.",

In this framework, nonlinear mappings have been used extensively to model conservative or dissipative dynamical systems [1 10]. A crucial role in the study of such mappings is played by their periodic orbits, since they can provide useful information regarding the geometric and dynamical properties of the mapping, especially in cases of chaotic behavior [11]. The detection of periodic orbits is a very challenging task, since analytic expressions are available only in a limited number of cases that refer mostly to polynomial mappings of low degree. For this purpose, traditional root finding algorithms, such as the Newton family methods, have been widely applied for computing periodic orbits numerically. However, such algorithms fail in cases where the mapping lacks of nice mathematical characteristics, such as continuity and differentiability. Recently, population based stochastic optimization algorithms have been introduced as an alternative tool for computing periodic orbits of nonlinear mappings, through the transformation of the corresponding root finding problem to an",

            "Abstract": "The Lucas function is a recently proposed one-way function used in public key cryptography. The security of cryptosystems based on the Lucas function relies on the difficulty of solving the Lucas logarithm problem. In this paper, the Lucas logarithm problem is studied using interpolation techniques. In particular, the inverse Aitken and the inverse Neville interpolation methods are applied to values of the Lucas sequence to obtain a polynomial that interpolates the Lucas logarithm. The results indicate that in all the considered instances of the problem a polynomial of low degree that interpolates the desired values exists.",

            "Abstract": "Optimization methods are fundamental in science and technology, due to their application in numerous, diverse, fields. In most applications, the corresponding objective functions are multimodal, discontinuous, and frequently, they are contaminated by noise. Such problems cannot be solved effectively through classical Nonlinear Programming techniques. Evolutionary Algorithms are stochastic optimization methods that exploit function values solely. They are not affected by possible discontinuities of the objective function, and have proved to be noise tolerant.This paper addresses the problem of Particle Identification by Light Scattering, which is, in general, contaminated by noise. To this end, two evolutionary algorithms, namely, Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution, are employed. In particular, two variants of each algorithm are considered. Both algorithms are efficient, and exhibit robust behavior with respect to noise. Overall, the obtained experimental results are satisfactory.",

The question of conservation and decomposition of a multiple root into simple roots are discussed. The main theorem on the conservation of the number of roots of a deformed (not necessarily homogeneous) algebraic system is proved by making use of a homotopy connecting initial roots of the given system and roots of a perturbed system. Hereby we give an estimate on the size of perturbation that does not affect the number of roots. Further on we state the existence of a slightly deformed system that has the same number of real zeros as the original system in taking the multiplicities into account. We give also a result about the decomposition of multiple real roots into simple real roots.",

Applications of them can be met in optimal design of systems, optimal operation of systems, determination of performance limitations of systems, or simply the solution of sets of equations. Many recent advances in science, economics and engineering rely on numerical techniques for computing globally optimal solutions to corresponding optimization problems [7]. Due to the existence of multiple local and global optima all these problems cannot be solved by classical nonlinear programming techniques.It is worth noticing that, in general, Global Optimization (GO) strategies possess strong theoretical convergence properties, and, at least in principle, are straightforward to implement and apply. Issues related to their numerical efficiency are considered by equipping GO algorithms with a \u201ctraditional\u201d local optimization phase. Global convergence, however, needs to be guaranteed by the global-scope algorithm component which, theoretically, should be used in a complete,\u201cexhaustive\u201d fashion. These remarks indicate the inherent computational demand of the GO algorithms, which increases non-polynomially, as a function of problemsize, even in the simplest cases.",

MANBIS applies the bisection method to obtain an approximate root according to a predetermined accuracy. Thus, the only computable information required is the algebraic signs of the considered function, which is the smallest amount of information (one bit of information) necessary for the purpose needed, and not any additional information. MANBIS is able to compute very efficiently a user-given percentage of roots and draws its strength from the fact that the roots are expected to be many.

Several improvements of the Probabilistic Neural Network have been proposed such as the Evolutionary Probabilistic Neural Network that employs the Particle Swarm Optimization stochastic algorithm for the proper selection of its spread (smoothing) parameters and the prior probabilities. To further improve its performance, a fuzzy class membership function has been incorporated for the weighting of its pattern layer neurons. For each neuron of the pattern layer, a fuzzy class membership weight is computed and it is multiplied to its output in order to magnify or decrease the neuron\u2019s signal when applicable. Moreover, a novel scheme for multi\u2013class problems is proposed since the fuzzy membership function can be incorporated only in binary classification tasks.

The existence of outliers in a data set is a common issue that needs to be tackled. The identification of such values is a difficult, yet very useful project. In many cases errors or dissimilar values to the majority of the data are useless. Nevertheless, valuable information can be hidden in outliers' set. During the last years, although several models have been developed for outlier detection, there is always space for new, intelligent, more efficient and less time consuming techniques for this issue. In the present work we provide a new ensemble method for outlier detection. In order to test the proposed methodology, comparisons are made with widely used techniques for outlier detection.

Affinity Propagation is, consequently, utilized to provide a group of clusters within such a region. Finally, these regions are merged to form actual clusters.

This leads to a bilevel programming problem that is generally di cult to solve, due to nonlinearities, nonconvexities that arise and the large dimensionality of the problem due to the existence of many followers. In these problems metaheuristic algorithms become attractive. In this study an algorithm for solving such problems is developed, using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is based on collective intelligent behaviors in nature and has gained wide recognition the last years.

The main difficulty for the computation of a family of periodic orbits of a given period is the determination within a given region of an individual member of this family which corresponds to a periodic orbit. To compute with certainty accurate individual members of a specific family we apply an efficient method using the Poincar\u00e9 map on a surface of section of the considered problem. This method converges rapidly, within relatively large regions of the initial conditions. It is also independent of the local dynamics near periodic orbits which is especially useful in the case of conservative dynamical systems that possess many periodic orbits, often of the same period, close to each other in phase space.

Nonetheless, the tremendous amount of data that can be obtained from microarray studies presents a challenge for data analysis. The most commonly used computational approach for analyzing microarray data is cluster analysis, since the number of genes is usually very high compared to the number of samples. In this paper, we investigate the application of the recently proposed k-windows clustering algorithm on gene expression microarray data. This algorithm apart from identifying the clusters present in a data set also calculates their number and thus requires no special knowledge about the data. To improve the quality of the clustering, we employ various dimension reduction techniques and propose a hybrid one. The results \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this chapter, we review existing locally recurrent neural networks and introduce a novel artificial neural network architecture that merges the locally recurrent probabilistic neural networks (LRPNN) with swarm intelligence algorithms and concepts. In particular, we develop an enhanced LRPNN model, referred to as Partially Connected LRPNN (PC-LRPNN). In contrast to LRPNN, where the recurrent layer consists of a set of fully connected neurons, the proposed new architecture assumes a swarm of neurons in the recurrent layer. Each neuron of the swarm presumes a neighbourhood of neurons with which it communicates through interconnections. The locality that determines the neighbourhoods is defined based on existing neighbourhood and communication schemes proposed in the swarm intelligence literature. Obviously, the PC-LRPNN offers a more general scheme, in which the fully connected LRPNN can be considered as a particular case, where all links in the recurrent layer are implemented. The neighbourhood topology of the new, swarm-based recurrent layer can be either static or dynamic. Dynamic neighbourhoods have been studied extensively in the field of swarm intelligence, since swarms with dynamic communication schemes among individuals have been shown to achieve remarkably better results than swarms with static communication schemes in the field of optimization. Also, the plasticity of the neighbourhoods can be useful in cases where better fit to unknown data is required. In the present chapter we will limit our exposition to the static neighbourhoods, which are defined once during training, and remain unchanged \u2026",

Music has self-referentiality, i.e., does not necessarily relate to extramusical concepts, and is organized on multiple interrelated levels of abstraction, a fact that makes it a peculiar test-bed for AI methods. This chapter focuses on how different AI methods model abstractions from musical surfaces, how they model knowledge, and knowledge acquisition mechanisms. The main categories presented herein are (i) nonadaptive methods that rely on user modeling for generating interesting and meaningful music, (ii) probabilistic approaches that learn, either implicitly or explicitly, from data, and (iii) evolutionary methods that allow intuitive user interaction.

In complex systems the uncertainty is usually addressed with the use of probabilistic models where information about the distribution of the uncertain parameters is available or derived. However, in many engineering problems such information is unknown. Evermore, quite often the decision is made once, rendering irrelevant the probabilistic framework. In this study a multicriteria methodology is used in order to model the clearance of the energy market. The proposed model deals with uncertainty as far as the desired energy policy and restrictions are concerned with use of interval analysis. This way, the robustness of the optimal solution for different energy policies, which is necessary in order to evaluate them, is studied, thus creating a decision support system for the market operator.",

We further extend this class of models by introducing new features, such as the Epanechnikov kernels as an alternative to the Gaussian ones, and PSO for parameter configuration of the Bayesian model.

            "Abstract": "Clustering can be defined as the process of \"grouping\" a collection of objects into subsets or clusters. The clustering problem has been addressed in numerous contexts and by researchers in different disciplines. This reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as an exploratory data analysis approach. Unsupervised clustering algorithms have been developed to address real world problems in which the number of clusters present in the dataset is unknown. These algorithms approximate the number of clusters while performing the clustering procedure. This paper is a first step towards the development of unsupervised clustering algorithms capable of identifying clusters within clusters. To this end, an unsupervised clustering algorithm is modified so as to take into consideration the fractal dimension of the data. The experimental results indicate that this approach can provide further qualitative information compared to \u2026",

The proposed class comprises four algorithms: the first two incorporate techniques for the adaptation of a common stepsize for all coordinate directions and the other two allow an individual adaptive stepsize along each coordinate direction. All the algorithms are computationally efficient and possess interesting convergence properties utilizing estimates of the Lipschitz constant that are obtained without additional function or gradient evaluations. The algorithms have been implemented and tested on some well-known test cases as well as on real-life artificial neural network applications and the results have been very satisfactory.",

Experiments show that the k-windows algorithm can effectively and efficiently identify the changes on the pattern structure.",

We present a detailed study of SALI's behaviour for chaotic orbits and show that in this case the SALI exponentially converges to zero, following a time rate depending on the difference of the two largest Lyapunov exponents \u03c3 1, \u03c3 2 ie\\mbox {SALI}\\propto {\\rm e}^{-(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2) t}.

We name this approach correspondence analysis with grey data. The aim of the paper at hand is to show that the correspondence analysis can be enriched to tackle uncertainties caused by grey data. We investigate here mainly the grey eigenvalue problem. The proposed approach is validated by using data from a real-life application and the corresponding computational processes are explained in detail through a simple representative numerical example.

The proposed approach can provide intuition regarding the behavior of the algorithm in unknown high-dimensional problems. It also provides an alternative visualization framework for problems of any dimension, which alleviates drawbacks of the most popular projection methods.

The established techniques that are used to evaluate a generator are focused on statistical features that are designed to detect correlations into generated random number sequences.

Furthermore, a generalized radial basis function neuro-fuzzy controller (GRBFNFC) is constructed and designed automatically by the proposed CSIA.

Its main advantage, apart from its efficiency, is the fact that it requires only the sign of the function at a certain point and not its actual value. Also, its simplicity makes it a suitable preprocessing step for reducing the size of the problem, prior to more robust but also more demanding methods.

            "Abstract": "One of the main reasons for the slow convergence and the suboptimal generalization results of MLP (Multilayer Perceptrons) based on gradient descent training is the lack of a proper initialization of the weights to be adjusted. Even sophisticated learning procedures are not able to compensate for bad initial values of weights, while good initial guess leads to fast convergence and or better generalization capability even with simple gradientbased error minimization techniques. Although initial weight space in MLPs seems so critical there is no study so far of its properties with regards to which regions lead to solutions or failures concerning generalization and convergence in real world problems. There exist only some preliminary studies for toy problems, like XOR. A data mining approach, based on Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOM), is involved in this paper to demonstrate that a complete analysis of the MLP weight space is possible even in the case of complex real world problems. This is the main novelty of this paper. The conclusions drawn from this novel application of SOM algorithm in MLP analysis extend significantly previous preliminary results in the literature. MLP initialization procedures are overviewed along with all conclusions so far drawn in the literature and an extensive experimental study on more representative tasks, using our data mining approach, reveals important initial weight space properties of MLPs, extending previous knowledge and literature results.",

            "Abstract": "The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary method which is used to search for the global optimal solution by iteration. However, PSO has the problem that the particle swarm algorithm falls easily into premature convergence and has a low search efficiency. In this paper, after analyzing several existing improved particle swarm algorithms, a new improved particle swarm algorithm is proposed based on the fact that symmetrical particles distribution can enhance the optimation search results. The proposed algorithm can adjust the inertia weight factor adaptively in different phases of the process according to the variation of the cosine function. In addition, the acceleration coefficents based on linear variation are disturbed under a certain condition. Moreover, an appropriate value of the parameter in this condition is determined via experiments. Several classic functions have been used to test this new algorithm and then the results of this new algorithm are analyzed by comparing it with several relevant algorithms in the literature. The results show that this new algorithm can not only improve the convergence speed significantly, but also improve the premature convergence phenomenon.",

Motivated by the dynamics and the proximity characteristics of Differential Evolution's mutation strategies tending to distribute the individuals of the population to the vicinity of the problem's minima, we introduce two new Differential Evolution mutation strategies. The new mutation strategies incorporate spatial information about the neighborhood of each potential solution and exhibit a niching formation, without incorporating any additional parameter. Experimental results on eight well known multimodal functions and comparisons with some state-of-the-art algorithms indicate that the proposed mutation strategies are competitive and very promising, since they are able to reliably locate and maintain many global optima \u2026",

They were introduced by Kosko for the representation of causal relationships among concepts, as well as, for the analysis of inference patterns [1, 2]. Up\u2013to\u2013date FCMs have been applied in various scientific fields, including bioinformatics, manufacturing, organization behavior, political science, and decision making. Although FCMs constitute a promising modeling methodology, they have some deficiencies regarding the robustness of their inference mechanism and their ability to adapt the experts\u2019 knowledge through optimization and learning [1, 2]. FCMs are described by a graph with the nodes representing concepts and the arcs between the concepts denoting the relationship between them. The successful operation of FCMs relies on the proper determination of their weights. Concepts and weights are fuzzy sets and their values are restricted within a range of values which are given by the experts for each problem domain. One could also treat the concepts and the weights, as interval numbers that lie within the range provided by the experts, rather than as fuzzy sets. This new model is called Interval Cognitive Maps (ICMs).Interval analysis is a deterministic way of representing uncertainty in values by replacing a number with a range of values. Interval analysis was introduced to deal with numerical errors which occurred in mathematical computations performed on digital computers. The result of an ordinary computation (non\u2013interval) is a single number, a point on the real number line \u2026",

In particular we pronounce the strengths of DE algorithms in tackling many difficult problems from diverse scientific areas, including single and multiobjective function optimization, neural network training, clustering, and real life DNA microarray classification. To improve the speed and performance of the algorithm we employ distributed computing architectures and demonstrate how parallel, multi\u2013population DE architectures can be utilised in single and multiobjective optimization. Using data mining we present a methodology that allows the simultaneous discovery of multiple local and global minimizers of an objective function. At a next step we present applications of DE in real life problems including the training of integer weight neural networks and the selection of genes of DNA microarrays in order to boost \u2026",

Depending primarily on the value of its non-linearity parameter, the logistic map exhibits a great variety of behavior, including stable states, cycling and periodical activity and the period doubling phenomenon that leads to high-order chaos. From the real data sequences, binary sequences are derived. Consecutive L bit sequences are given as input to a cellular automaton with the task to regenerate the subsequent L bits of the binary sequence in precisely L evolution steps. To perform this task a genetic algorithm is employed to evolve cellular automaton rules. Various complex binary sequences are examined, for a variety of initial values and a wide range of values of the non-linearity parameter.

In the paper at hand, we propose to capture phrasing structural information from inter onset and pitch intervals of pairs of consecutive notes in a musical piece, by incorporating this information into a weighted variation of a first order Markov chain model. Additionally, we propose an evolutionary procedure that automatically tunes the introduced weights and exploits the full potential of the proposed model for tackling the composer identification task between two composers. Initial experimental results on string quartets of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven suggest that the proposed model performs well and can provide insights on the inter onset and pitch intervals on the considered musical collection.",

The results obtained by subjective tests indicate that evolution is driven towards more user\u2013preferable sounds. In turn, by monitoring features of the melodies in different evolution stages, indications are provided that some sound features may subsume information about aesthetic criteria.

This result allows us to equip algorithms of this class with a strategy for adapting the overall direction of search to a descent one. In this way, a decrease of the batch-error measure at each training iteration is ensured, and convergence of the sequence of weight iterates to a local minimizer of the batch error function is obtained from remote initial weights. The effectiveness of the theoretical result is illustrated in three application examples by comparing two well-known training algorithms with local learning rates to their globally convergent modifications.",

ZEAL is based on the theory of formal orthogonal polynomials. It proceeds by evaluating numerically certain integrals along the boundary of W involving the logarithmic derivative f\u2032/f and by solving generalized eigenvalue problems. The multiplicities are computed by solving a linear system of equations that has Vandermonde structure. ZEAL is written in Fortran 90.",

A memory-based adaptation of the learning rate for the on-line back-propagation (BP) is proposed and used to seed an on-line evolution process that applies a differential evolution (DE) strategy to (re-) adapt the neural network to modified environmental conditions. Our approach looks at on-line training from the perspective of tracking the changing location of an approximate solution of a pattern-based, and thus, dynamically changing, error function. The proposed hybrid strategy is compared with other standard training methods that have traditionally been used for training neural networks off-line. Results in interpreting colonoscopy images and frames of video sequences are promising and suggest that networks trained with this strategy detect malignant regions of interest with accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "Supervised learning in neural networks based on the popular backpropagation method can be often trapped in a local minimum of the error function. The class of backpropagation-type training algorithms includes local minimization methods that have no mechanism that allows them to escape the influence of a local minimum. The existence of local minima is due to the fact that the error function is the superposition of nonlinear activation functions that may have minima at different points, which sometimes results in a nonconvex error function. This work investigates the use of global search methods for batch-mode training of feedforward multilayer perceptrons. Global search methods are expected to lead to \u201coptimal\u201d or \u201cnear-optimal\u201d weight configurations by allowing the neural network to escape local minima during training and, in that sense, they improve the efficiency of the learning process.

Function\\Stretching\" consists of a two {stage transformation of the objective function that eliminates local minima, while preserving global ones.

We develop an appropriate scheme that transforms the problem of finding periodic orbits into the problem of detecting global minimizers of a function, which is defined on the Poincar\u00e9 surface section of the Hamiltonian system. By combining the PSO method with deflection techniques, we succeeded in tracing systematically several periodic orbits of the system. The method succeeded in tracing the initial conditions of periodic orbits in cases where Newton iterative techniques had difficulties. In particular, we found families of two- and three-dimensional periodic orbits associated with the inner 8:1 to 12:1 resonances, between the radial 4:1 and corotation resonances of our 3D Ferrers bar model.

Our work represents an extension of a method introduced in an earlier paper, with which one could only find homoclinic orbits possessing a certain symmetry.

We compare this hybrid strategy to other standard training methods that have traditionally been used for training neural networks off-line. Preliminary results in interpreting colonoscopy images and frames of video sequences suggest that networks trained with this strategy detect malignant regions of interest with high accuracy. Extensive testing in interpreting more complex regions is necessary to fully investigate the properties, the effect of the heuristic parameters and the performance of the hybrid learning strategy in this context.",

We determine it either by computational experiments or with theoretical tools. We investigate the behaviour of powers of matrices constructed from the generators \u03b1 of the multiplicative group for several primes p in Zp. We study how the sequence of powers of these matrices leads to the identity matrix in respect to the generator \u03b1, the prime numbers p and the elements of the main diagonal of the matrices.

This kind of information can aid in the characterization of gene function, the determination of experimental treatment effects, and the understanding of other molecular biological processes. Discovering the patterns hidden in the gene expression microarray data and subsequently using them to classify the various conditions is a tremendous opportunity and challenge for functional genomics and proteomics. An interesting approach to address this task is to utilize computational \u2026",

To address noise and non-stationarity, a common approach is to combine a method for the partitioning of the input space into a number of subspaces with a local approximation scheme for each subspace. Unsupervised clustering algorithms have the desirable property of deciding on the number of partitions required to accurately segment the input space during the clustering process, thus relieving the user from making this ad hoc choice. Artificial neural networks, on the other hand, are powerful computational models that have proved their capabilities on numerous hard real-world problems. The time series that we consider are all daily spot foreign exchange rates of major currencies. The experimental results reported suggest that predictability \u2026",

The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game, specifically, as a bilevel optimization problem that belongs to the mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints. In this game, a player that acts as leader determines the actions of the players that act as followers and play a Nash game among them through a subsidy program.

In this paper we propose a hybrid approach that combines differential evolution mutation operators in an attempt to balance their exploration and exploitation capabilities. Additionally, a self-balancing hybrid mutation operator is presented, which favors the exploration of the search space during the first phase of the optimization, while later opts for the exploitation to aid convergence to the optimum.

Unsupervised algorithms tend to produce rhythms that are described either as simplistic and repetitive, or very complex and unstable. This work examines a modification of the legacy L-systems that are hereby termed as Finite L-systems (FL-systems). With this modification, the produced symbolic sequences are more controllable, offering a rhythm production alternative that is more flexible than the L-systems. In particular, when used for unsupervised rhythm production, FL-systems construct rhythmic sequences with great variability in terms of complexity and repetitiveness. This trend indicates that their combination with learning algorithms may provide a flexible supervised rhythm production system.",

We develop an appropriate scheme that transforms the problem of finding periodic orbits into the problem of detecting global minimizers of a function, which is defined on the Poincar\u00e9 surface section of the Hamiltonian system. By combining the PSO method with deflection techniques, we succeeded in tracing systematically several periodic orbits of the system. The method succeeded in tracing the initial conditions of periodic orbits in cases where Newton iterative techniques had difficulties. In particular, we found families of two- and three-dimensional periodic orbits associated with the inner 8:1 to 12:1 resonances, between the radial 4:1 and corotation resonances of our 3D Ferrers bar model. The main advantages of the proposed algorithm are its simplicity \u2026",

We also study the extent to which these rules retain their predictive power when the sequence is contaminated with noise. Complex binary sequences are derived by applying two binary transformations on realvalued sequences generated by the well known tent map. To identify short-term predictors we employ Genetic Algorithms. The dynamics of the tent map depend strongly on the value of the control parameter, r. The experimental results suggest that the same is true for the number of predictors. Despite the chaotic nature of the tent map and the complexity of the derived binary sequences, the results reported suggest that there exist settings in which an unexpectedly large number of predictive rules exists. Furthermore, rules that permit the risk free prediction of the value of the next bit are detected in a wide range of parameter settings. By incorporating noise in the data generating process, the rules that allow the risk free prediction of the next bit are eliminated. However, for small values of the variance of the Gaussian noise term there exist rules that retain much of their predictive power.",

This work describes a novel mechanism that allows a system, namely the evoDrummer, to create novel rhythms with reference to a base rhythm. The user interactively defines the amount of divergence between the base rhythm and the generated ones. The methodology followed towards this aim incorporates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms and allows the evoDrummer to provide several alternative rhythms with specific, controlled divergence from the selected base rhythm. To this end, the notion of rhythm divergence is also introduced, based on a set of 40 drum\u2013specific features. Four population initialization schemes are discussed and an extensive experimental evaluation is provided. The obtained results demonstrate that, with proper population initialization, the evoDrummer is \u2026",

This capability can be exploited to improve performance on classification tasks. A fast three-step algorithm for training GLRPNN is also proposed. The first two steps are identical to the training of traditional PNN, while the third step exploits the differential evolution optimization method. The performance of the proposed methodology on the task of text-independent speaker verification is contrasted with that of locally recurrent PNN, diagonal recurrent neural networks, infinite impulse response and finite impulse response MLP-based structures, as well as with a Gaussian mixture models-based classifier.",

Depending primarily on the value of the non-linearity parameter r, the logistic function exhibits a great variety of behavior, including stable states, cycling and periodical activity and the period doubling phenomenon that leads to high-order chaos. Binary sequences of length 2L were used in our computer experiments. The first L bits (first half) were given as input to Cellular Automata (CA) with the task to regenerate the remaining L bits (second half) of the binary sequence in less than L evolution steps of the CA. To perform this task a suitably designed Genetic Algorithm (GA) was developed for the evolution of CA rules. Various complex binary sequences were examined, for a variety of initial values of x0 and a wide range of the non-linearity parameter, r. The proposed hybrid prediction algorithm, based on a combination of GAs and CA proved quite efficient.",

Traditional root finding algorithms, such as the Newton-family algorithms, have been widely applied for the detection of periodic orbits.

In such cases, stochastic optimization algorithms have proved to be a valuable tool. In this paper, a new approach for computing periodic orbits through particle swarm optimization is introduced. The results indicate that the algorithm is robust and efficient. Moreover, the method can be combined with established techniques, such as deflection, to detect several periodic orbits of a mapping.

The approach presented in this paper builds on interval analysis and attempts to define guaranteed bounds in the search space prior to applying a global search algorithm for training an MLP. These bounds depend on the machine precision and the term \u201cguaranteed\u201d denotes that the region defined surely encloses weight sets that are global minimizers of the neural network\u2019s error function.

            "Abstract": "Curve fitting is usually based on the least squares method (l2 norm) and empirical selection of curves using the trial-and error-technique. This approach is simple and successful in the cases measurements contain only random, especially normally distributed errors. In the case of series of monitoring measurements in engineering surveys, to some degree noisy, usually unevenly distributed versus time and including step-like offsets, this approach may lead to very complicated functions, occasionally lacking any clear physical significance and potential for further mathematical analysis. In such cases, however, optimal fitting may alternatively be obtained using simpler functions and the l1 and l\u221e norms. Interestingly, the use of these norms in the geodetic literature is at least extremely limited, although present-day computers have minimized any limitations in their application. As an example, fitting of various exponential curves in a geodetic record for monitoring a landslide indicates that the use of the l1 and l\u221e norms can provide acceptable fitting (ie small mean absolute and standard errors) with simpler curves which have a more clear physical significance and higher potential for further analysis than by more complicated curves obtained with conventional least square (l2 norm) techniques.",

Parallel tangent methods are used in global optimization to modify and improve the simple gradient descent algorithm by using from time to time the difference between the current point and the point before two steps as a search direction, instead of using the gradient. In this study, we investigate the combination of the BPVS method with the parallel tangent approach for neural network training.

On the basis of the facts that the parallel k-means algorithm can be effectively used in clustering the horizontal distributed data set, the objective function of the parallel k-means algorithm is modified, and the constrained parallel k-means algorithm is designed, then the constrained information of site users is introduced into the distributed clustering process in the form of chunklets, which can guide the algorithm to a bias search. Theoretically the algorithm guarantees the inter-cluster distance among the unconstrained samples to be the closest, and guarantees the average distance between constrained samples in a chunklet and the corresponding cluster center to be the closest one. The results from the experiments show that the algorithm can effectively enhance the clustering precision of parallel k-means, meanwhile it can obtain the clustering results on the distributed data set, which are equivalent to the results of the constrained k-means algorithm running on a centralized data set.",

If the topological degree of an appropriate set of equations has a non\u2013zero value, we know that there exists at least one periodic orbit of a given period in the given region. We discuss in detail the problems that these methods face, due to the existence of periodic orbits near the domain\u2019s boundary and due to the discontinuity curves that appear in maps defined on the torus. We use the characteristic bisection method for actually locating periodic orbits. We apply this method successfully, both to the standard map, which is a map defined on the torus, and to the beam-beam map which is a continuous map on the \u2026",

Fluorescence in situ hybridization of selected microsatellite markers on salivary gland polytene chromosomes allowed the alignment of these groups to the second, fourth, fifth and sixth chromosome. None of the markers tested showed segregation either with the X or the third chromosome. However, this map constitutes a substantial starting point for a detailed genetic map of C. capitata.

The f-MCG is a measure of the magnetic component of the electromagnetic fields emitted from the fetal heart, reflecting the underlying dynamics. The extremely weak magnetic fields emitted from the fetal heart can be recorded with the use of specific totally non-invasive Superconductive Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID). From a total of 10 considered cases, 5 were complicated and presented arrhythmia and 5 were normal. Recordings were performed at the late stage of pregnancy. The analysis of the collected signals is based on the reconstruction of the phase space form the one-dimension signals to higher-dimension phase space. An especially developed clustering algorithm is applied on the reconstructed data in order to investigate the distribution of the dynamics in the higher-dimension reconstructed phase space.",

In this paper, the operators of the Differential Evolution algorithm are employed to generate the starting points of a global optimization method with dynamic search trajectories.

In the paper at hand, we take the first steps towards a theoretical foundation of clustering, by proposing a new notion of \u201cclusterability\u201d of data sets based on the density of the data within a specific region. Specifically, we give a formal definition of what we call \u201c\u03b1-clusterable\u201d set and we utilize this notion to prove that the principles proposed in Kleinberg\u2019s impossibility theorem for clustering [25], are consistent. We further propose an unsupervised clustering algorithm which is based on the notion of \u03b1-clusterable set. The proposed algorithm exploits the ability of the well known and widely used particle swarm optimization [31] to maximize the recently proposed window \u2026",

Phys. Commun. 138 (2001) 53]. The main advantage of the characteristic bisection method is that it converges with certainty within a given starting rectangular region. In this paper we further improve this technique by applying, on a surface of section of a Poincar\u00e9 map, an iterative scheme based on the composition of the characteristic bisection method with other more rapid root-finding methods such as Newton's or Broyden's methods. Thus, the composite schemes compute rapidly with certainty periodic orbits of molecular systems. By applying these methods to the LiNC/LiCN molecular system we obtain promising results. We have reproduced previous results using considerable less CPU time. Also, we have located and computed new \u2026",

A particularly interesting task in this context is to predict the structure of proteins. Artificial Neural Networks can efficiently handle classification and prediction tasks. On the other hand, Memetic Algorithms belong to the class of heuristic methods that have been developed to address hard optimization problems. Since training Artificial Neural Networks is such a problem, Memetic Algorithms can be used to address it. In this paper we propose a Local-Search-Based Memetic Algorithm, and study its performance as a neural network training method. The resulting Neural Network is applied for the prediction of the cellular localization sites of two proteins. The performance of the proposed method is compared to that of alternative memetic and global optimization algorithms.",

To this end, a Lamarck-inspired combination of Evolutionary Algorithms and Stochastic Gradient Descent is proposed. The Evolutionary Algorithm works on the termination point of the Stochastic Gradient Descent. Thus, the method consists in a Stochastic Gradient Descent-based on-line training stage and an Evolutionary Algorithm-based retraining stage. On-line training is considered eminently suitable for large (or even redundant) training sets and/or networks; it also helps escaping local minima and provides a more natural approach for learning nonstationary tasks. Furthermore, the notion of retraining aids the hybrid method to exhibit reliable and stable performance, and increases the generalization capability of the trained neural network. Experimental results suggest that the proposed hybrid strategy is capable to train on-line, efficiently and effectively. Here, an artificial neural network architecture has been successfully used for detecting abnormalities in colonoscopic video images.",

This is performed through the minimization of a properly defined objective function. This novel method overcomes some deficiencies of other learning algorithms and, thus, improves the efficiency and robustness of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. The operation of the new method is illustrated on an industrial process control problem, and the obtained simulation results support the claim that it is robust and efficient.",

To this end, clustering algorithms are typically employed to identify groups (clusters) of similar objects. A critical issue for any clustering algorithm is the determination of the number of clusters present in a dataset. In this contribution we present a clustering algorithm that in addition to partitioning the data into clusters, it approximates the number of clusters during its execution. We further present modifications of this algorithm for different distributed environments, and dynamic databases. Finally, we present a modification of the algorithm that exploits the fractal dimension of the data to partition the dataset.",

A solution to this problem is the application of the local boosting of weak classifiers ensemble method. A main drawback of this approach is the time that is required at the prediction of an unseen instance as well as the decrease of the classification accuracy in the presence of noise in the local regions. In this research work, an improved version of the local boosting of weak classifiers, which incorporates prototype selection, is presented. Experimental results on several benchmark real-world data sets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the local boosting of weak classifiers in terms of predictive accuracy and the time that is needed to build a local model and classify a test instance.",

The message that undergoes encryption is called the plaintext (or cleartext), while the transformed message is called ciphertext. Cryptanalysis refers to the process of discovering the plaintext from the ciphertext without knowing the decryption key. A cryptographic algorithm, cipher, is a mathematical function employed for the encryption and decryption of messages. Ciphers can be divided into two categories, the symmetric-key and the public-key ciphers. In symmetric-key ciphers the sender and the receiver of the message secretly choose the key that will be used for encryption and decryption. A drawback of this type of cryptosystems is that it requires prior communication of the key between the sender and the receiver \u2026",

Because of a variety of parameters, such as multiple accounting ratios or many potential explanatory variables, the complexity of this problem is very high. For this reason, the probability for a company to go bankrupt or not is very difficult to be calculated. Moreover, the precise determination of the bankruptcy is a very important issue. All the above details constitute a complex problem and by taking into account the data that need to be processed, we conclude that machine learning techniques and reliable predictive models are necessary.

            "Abstract": "A large variety of issues influence the success of data mining on a given problem. Two primary and important issues are the representation and the quality of the dataset. Specifically, if much redundant and unrelated or noisy and unreliable information is presented, then knowledge discovery becomes a very difficult problem. It is well-known that data preparation steps require significant processing time in machine learning tasks. It would be very helpful and quite useful if there were various preprocessing algorithms with the same reliable and effective performance across all datasets, but this is impossible. To this end, we present the most well-known and widely used up-to-date algorithms for each step of data preprocessing in the framework of predictive data mining.",

Traditional evolutionary techniques applied in clustering are typically hindered by the high cost involved in the computation of the objective function. In this paper, the authors proposed a novel objective function that can provide fitness function values in sub-linear time. Next an evolutionary scheme was developed to evolve cluster solutions and demonstrate how the number of clusters can be estimated from the final result. Finally, by employing real world datasets, the high quality clustering results that this scheme can provide was shown.",

Population oriented approaches such as evolutionary algorithms and particle swarm optimization can be distinguished into the class of archive-based algorithms and algorithms without archive. While the latter may lose the best solutions found so far, archive based algorithms keep track of these solutions. In this article, a new particle swarm optimization technique, called DOPS, for multi-objective optimization problems is proposed. DOPS integrates well-known archiving techniques from evolutionary algorithms into particle swarm optimization. Modifications and extensions of the archiving techniques are empirically analyzed and several test functions are used to illustrate the usability of the proposed approach.

Extraction of this knowledge requires the collection and analysis of data originating from several, ideally all, organizations on the field. In this paper, we propose a protocol for electronic data gathering that ensures precise data gathering and provides privacy for each contributing organization.

The topological degree of a function is a mathematical tool of great importance for investigating the existence and the number of roots of a function with certainty. For the computation of the topological degree according to Stenger's theorem, a sufficient refinement of the boundary of the polyhedron under consideration is needed. The sufficient refinement can be computed using the optimal complexity algorithm of Boult and Sikorski. However, the application of this algorithm requires the computation of the infinity norm on the boundary of the polyhedron under consideration as well as an estimation of the Lipschitz constant of the function.
