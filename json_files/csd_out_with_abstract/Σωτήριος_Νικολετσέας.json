            "Abstract": "The Moran process, as studied by Lieberman, Hauert and Nowak (2005) [1], is a birth-death process that models the spread of mutations in two-type populations (residents-mutants) whose structure is defined by a digraph. The process' central notion is the probability that a randomly placed mutant will occupy the whole vertex set (fixation probability). We extend this model by considering type-specific graphs, and consequently present results on the fundamental problems related to the fixation probability and its computation. Finally, we view the resident-mutant competing forces as players that choose digraphs and indicate that the mutant's complete graph is a dominant strategy.",

The newly red particles are now available to infect more white ones. When is it the case that all white will become red? It turns out that this simple question is an instance of information propagation between random walks and has important applications to mobile computing where a set of mobile hosts acts as an intermediary for the spread of information. In this paper we model this problem by k concurrent random walks, one corresponding to the red particle and k-1 to the white ones. The infection time T k of infecting all the white particles with red color is then a random variable that depends on k, the initial position of the particles, the number of nodes and edges of the graph, as well as on the structure of the graph.

We propose a novel network parameter, the mobility level, which, although simple and local, captures these high dynamics taking into account the spatial and speed characteristics of motion. We propose adaptive data dissemination protocols that use the mobility level estimation to optimize performance, by exploiting high mobility (redundant message ferrying) as a cost-effective replacement of flooding and by favoring nodes of high mobility. These dissemination schemes are enhanced by a distance-sensitive, probabilistic message flooding inhibition mechanism that further reduces communication cost.",

In this process, agents of a two-type population (i.e. mutants and residents) are associated with the vertices of a graph. Initially, only one vertex chosen uniformly at random (u.a.r.) is a mutant, with fitness , while all other individuals are residents, with fitness 1. In every step, an individual is chosen with probability proportional to its fitness, and its state (mutant or resident) is passed on to a neighbor which is chosen u.a.r. In this paper, we introduce and study for the first time a generalization of the model of [10] by assuming that different types of individuals perceive the population through different graphs defined on the same vertex set, namely  for residents and  for mutants.

The basic idea of the new protocol presented here is, instead of using a fixed sized support for the whole duration of the protocol, to employ a support of some initial (small) size which adapts (given some time which can be made fast enough) to the actual levels of traffic and the (unknown and possibly rapidly changing) network area by changing its size in order to converge to an optimal size, thus satisfying certain Quality of Service criteria. We provide here some proofs of correctness and fault tolerance of this adaptive approach and we also provide analytical results using Markov Chains and random walk techniques to show that such an adaptive approach is, for this class of ad-hoc mobile networks, significantly more efficient than a simple non-adaptive implementation of the basic \u201crunners support\u201d idea.",

            "Abstract": "Geographic routing scales well in sensor networks, mainly due to its stateless nature. Most of the algorithms in this area are concerned with guaranteeing a path toward the destination in the context of any network topology, while the optimality of the path is of little interest. In this paper, we are presenting a novel geographic routing algorithm with obstacle avoidance properties. It aims at finding the optimal path from a source to a destination when some areas of the network are unavailable for routing due to low local density or obstacle presence. It locally and gradually with time (but, as we show, quite fast) evaluates and updates the quality of the previously used paths and ignores non\u2010optimal paths for further routing. By means of extensive simulations, we are comparing its performance to existing state of the art protocols, showing that it performs much better in terms of path length and hop count thus minimizing \u2026",

In particular, we define a new charging model that greatly differs from existing models in that it takes into account real technology restrictions of the chargers and nodes of the system, mainly regarding energy limitations. Our model also introduces nonlinear constraints (in the time domain), that radically change the nature of the computational problems we consider. In this charging model, we present and study the Low Radiation Efficient Charging Problem (LREC), in which we wish to optimize the amount of \u201cuseful\u201d energy transferred from chargers to nodes (under constraints on the maximum level of imposed radiation).

Machine Learning (ML) has been recognised as a promising, efficient and reliable tool for fault detection use cases, as it allows to export important knowledge from monitored assets. Scientists deal with issues such as the small amount of data that indicate potential problems, or the imbalance which exists between the standard process data and the data inadequacy of the systems to make a high precision forecast. Currently, in this context, even large industries are not able to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in their tools, processes and equipment, when adopting strategies to anticipate crucial events.

We propose, in such a case, that a small subset of the deployed hosts (which we call the support) should be used for network operations. However, the vast majority of the hosts are moving arbitrarily according to application needs. We then provide a simple, correct and efficient protocol for communi-cation that avoids message flooding. Our protocol manages to establish communication between any pair of mobile hosts in small, a-priori guaranteed expected time bounds even in the worst case of arbitrary motions of the hosts that not in the support (provided that they do not deliberately try to avoid the support). These time bounds, interestingly, do not depend, on the number of mobile hosts that do not belong in the support.They depend only on the size of the area of motions. Our protocol can be implemented in very efficient ways by exploiting knowledge of the space of motions or by adding more power to the hosts of the support. Our results exploit and further develop some fundamental properties of random walks in finite graphs.",

In a recent work [8], we considered acknowledgment-based protocols, where a user gets feedback from the channel only when she attempts transmission. In this case she will learn whether her transmission was successful or not. One of the main results of [8] was that no acknowledgment-based protocol can be in equilibrium. In fact, it seems that many natural acknowledgment-based protocols fail to prevent users from unilaterally switching to persistent protocols that always transmit with probability 1. It is therefore natural to ask how powerful a protocol must be so that it can beat persistent deviators.In this paper we consider age-based protocols, which can be described by a sequence of probabilities of transmitting in each time step. Those probabilities are given beforehand and do not change based on the transmission history \u2026",

This paper applies symbolic combinatorial techniques in order to characterize the interplay between two parameters of a random graph, namely its density (the number of edges in the graph) and its robustness to link failures. Here, robustness means multiple connectivity by short disjoint paths: a triple (G, s, t), where G is a graph and s, t are designated vertices, is called \u2113-robust if s and t are connected via at least two edge-disjoint paths of length at most \u2113. We determine the expected number of ways to get from s to t via two edge-disjoint paths of length \u2113 in the classical random graph model G n, p by means of \u201csymbolic\u201d combinatorial methods. We then derive bounds on related threshold probabilities as functions of \u2113 and n.",

            "Abstract": "We call radiation at a point of a wireless network the total amount of electromagnetic quantity (energy or power density) the point is exposed to. The impact of radiation can be high and we believe it is worth studying and control; towards radiation aware wireless networking we take (for the first time in the study of this aspect) a distributed computing, algorithmic approach. We exemplify this line of research by focusing on sensor networks, studying the minimum radiation path problem of finding the lowest radiation trajectory of a person moving from a source to a destination point in the network region. For this problem, we sketch the main ideas behind a linear program that can provide a tight approximation of the optimal solution, and then we discuss three heuristics that can lead to low radiation paths. We also plan to investigate the impact of diverse node mobility to the heuristics' performance.",

A well known hierarchical speci\ufb01cation model, considered in this work, is that of Lengauer [9, 10] referred to as L-speci\ufb01cations. In this paper we discuss a restriction on the L-speci\ufb01cations resulting to graphs which we call Well-Separated (WS). This class is characterized by a polynomial time (to the size of the speci\ufb01cation of the graph) testable combinatorial property. In this work we study the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) on WS L-speci\ufb01ed hierarchical planar graphs. The optimization version of RCP studied here, consists in assigning colors to the vertices of a graph, such that any two vertices of distance at most two get di\ufb00erent colors. The objective here is to minimize the number of colors used. This problem is equivalent to the problem of vertex coloring the square of a graph G, G2, where G2 has the same vertex set as G and there is an edge between any two vertices of G2 if their distance in G is at most 2. We \ufb01rst show that RCP is PSPACE-complete for WS L-speci\ufb01ed hierarchical planar graphs. Second, we present a polynomial time 3-approximation algorithm as well as a more e\ufb03cient 4-approximation algorithm for RCP on graphs of this class. We note that, the best currently known approximation ratio for the RCP on ordinary (non-hierarchical) planar graphs of general degree is 2 ([6, 1]). Note also that the only known results on any kind of coloring problems have been shown for another special kind of hierarchical graphs (unit disk graphs) achieving a 6-approximation solution [13].",

In this paper, we follow a new approach in studying the problem of efficiently charging a set of rechargeable nodes using a set of wireless energy chargers, under safety constraints on the electromagnetic radiation incurred. In particular, we define a new charging model that greatly differs from existing models in that it takes into account real technology restrictions of the chargers and nodes of the system, mainly regarding energy limitations. Our model also introduces non-linear constraints (in the time domain), that radically change the nature of the computational problems we consider. In this charging model, we present and \u2026",

The distributed co-operation of such nodes may lead to the accomplishment of large sensing tasks, having useful applications in practice. We present a new protocol for data propagation towards a control center (\u201csink\u201d) that avoids flooding by probabilistically favoring certain (\u201cclose to optimal\u201d) data transmissions. This protocol is very simple to implement in sensor devices and operates under total absence of co-ordination between sensors. We consider a network model of randomly deployed sensors of sufficient density. As shown by a geom-etry analysis, the protocol is correct, since it always propagates data to the sink, under ideal network conditions (no failures). Using stochastic processes, we show that the protocol is very energy efficient. Also, when part of the network is inoperative, the protocol manages to propagate data very close to the sink, thus in this sense it is robust. We finally present and discuss large-scale experimental findings validating the analytical results.",

We introduce a metric for the relative mobility of the nodes, according to which the nodes are classified into mobility classes. These mobility classes determine, for any pair of origin and destination, the routing technique that best corresponds to their mobility properties.

            "Abstract": "Motivated by emerging applications, we consider sensor networks where the sensors themselves (not just the sinks) are mobile. We focus on mobility scenarios characterized by heterogeneous, highly changing mobility roles in the network. To capture these high dynamics we propose a novel network parameter, the mobility level, which, although simple and local, quite accurately takes into account both the spatial and speed characteristics of motion. We then propose adaptive data dissemination protocols that use the mobility level estimation to improve performance. By basically exploiting high mobility (redundant message ferrying) as a cost-effective replacement of flooding, eg, the sensors tend to dynamically propagate less data in the presence of high mobility, while nodes of high mobility are favored for moving data around. These dissemination schemes are enhanced by a distance-sensitive probabilistic \u2026",

On the other hand, undirected networks (i.e. undirected graphs) seem to have a smoother behavior, and thus it is more challenging to find suppressors/amplifiers of selection, that is, graphs with smaller/greater fixation probability than the complete graph (i.e. the homogeneous population).

In most cases, random walks are studied on graphs like Gn,p and grid. Instead, we here choose the RGG model, which abstracts more accurately spatial proximity in a wireless sensor network. We first evaluate an adaptive walk (the random walk with inertia) on the RGG model; its performance proved to be poor and led us to define and experimentally evaluate a novel random walk that we call \u03b3\u2010stretched random walk.

Thus, data collection and annotation is an important step towards the successful development and realization of such systems. Nevertheless, in order to create reliable datasets, current data collection and annotation methodologies often require a controlled environment while also the presence of the volunteer contributing to the process, or any subject for that matter, and an expert, monitoring the procedure, is mandatory. These processes are heavily restrained by the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. To address such issues, in this paper we propose a humancentered Web-based dataset creation and annotation tool that utilizes the Web Bluetooth API. The user can effectively collect gestures from a nearby device that supports the BLE protocol, assign tags to the collected data, and store them remotely, in real-time. The data storage, as well as its annotation, can also be performed remotely by an expert stakeholder. An off-the-shelf wearable sensorial device has been used indicatively for our tool demonstration purposes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that exploits the Web Bluetooth API capabilities for the development of a Browser-based real-time data collection, storage, and annotation tool. Our tool can be also expanded to other applications that use the sensing device with only minor configuration changes and is also operable through any smartdevice that supports a Web-Browser.

In this paper we study the average case analysis of Weighted Max Cut, assuming the input is a weighted random intersection graph, i.e. given  we wish to find a partition of  into two sets so that the total weight of the edges having one endpoint in each set is maximized. We initially prove concentration of the weight of a maximum cut of  around its expected value, and then show that, when the number of labels is much smaller than the number of vertices, a random partition of the vertices achieves asymptotically optimal cut weight with high probability (whp). Furthermore, in the case  and constant average degree, we show that whp, a majority type algorithm outputs a cut with weight that is larger than the weight of a random cut by a multiplicative constant strictly larger than 1. Then, we highlight a connection between the computational problem of finding a weighted maximum cut in  and the problem of finding a 2-coloring with minimum discrepancy for a set system  with incidence matrix . We exploit this connection by proposing a (weak) bipartization algorithm for the case  that, when it terminates, its output can be used to find a 2-coloring with minimum discrepancy in .

The FAP is usually modelled by variations of the graph coloring problem. The Radiocoloring (RC) of a graph G(V,E) is an assignment function \u03a6: V \u2192 IN such that \u00a6\u03a6(u)-\u03a6(v)\u2265 2, when u; v are neighbors in G, and \u00a6\u03a6(u)-\u03a6(v)\u22651 when the minimum distance of u; v in G is two.

            "Abstract": "Existing geographic routing algorithms for sensor networks are mainly concerned with finding a path toward a destination, without explicitly addressing the impact of obstacles on the routing performance. When the size of the communication voids is increased, they might not scale well with respect to the quality of paths, measured in terms of hop count and path length.This paper introduces a routing algorithm with early obstacle detection and avoidance. The routing decisions are based on path optimality evaluation, made at the node level, gradually over time. We implement our algorithm and evaluate different aspects: message delivery performance, topology control overhead and algorithm convergence time. The simulation findings demonstrate that our algorithm manages to improve significantly and quite fast the path quality while keeping the computational complexity and message overhead low \u2026",

In this paper we discuss a restriction on the L-specifications resulting to graphs which we call Well-Separated (WS). This class is recognized in polynomial time. In this work we study the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) on WS L-specified hierarchical planar graphs. The optimization version of RCP studied here, consists in assigning colors to the vertices of a graph, such that any two vertices of distance at most two get different colors. The objective here is to minimize the number of colors used. We first show that RCP is PSPACE-complete for WS L-specified hierarchical planar graphs. Second, we present a polynomial time 3-approximation algorithm as well as a more efficient asymptotic 10/3-approximation algorithm for RCP on graphs of this class. We note that,",

Our analytic and simulation findings suggest that any single criterion does not simultaneously satisfy both energy efficiency and low latency. Towards parameterized energy\u2013latency trade-offs we provide as well hybrid combinations of the two criteria (direction and proximity to the sink).

The FAP is usually modelled by variations of the graph coloring problem. The Radiocoloring (RC) of a graph G(V,E) is an assignment function \u03a6: V \u2192 IN such that \u2223\u03a6(u) - \u03a6(v)\u2223 \u22652, when u, v are neighbors in G, and \u2223\u03a6(u) - \u03a6(v)\u2223 \u22651 when the distance of u, v in G is two. The range of frequencies used is called span. Here, we consider the optimization version of the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) of finding a radiocoloring assignment of minimum span, called min span RCP. In this paper, we deal with a variation of RCP: that of satisfying frequency assignment requests with some periodic behavior. In this case, the interference graph is an (infinite) periodic graph.

In this case she will learn whether her transmission was successful or not. Users that do not transmit will not receive any feedback. We are interested in equilibrium protocols, where no player has an incentive to deviate. The limited feedback makes the design of equilibrium protocols a hard task as best response policies usually have to be modeled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, which are hard to analyze. Nevertheless, we show how to circumvent this for the case of two players and present an equilibrium protocol. For many players, we give impossibility results for a large class of acknowledgment-based protocols, namely \\emph{age-based} and \\emph{backoff} protocols with finite expected finishing time. Finally, we provide an age-based equilibrium protocol, which has infinite expected finishing time, but every player finishes in linear time with high probability.",

By efficiently combining human with machine intelligence, we provide a complementary sensing method for the comprehensive and large-scale monitoring of the disease in broad regions, and in real-time. Moreover, the users of our platform are encouraged to engage in the sensing process through a personalized health monitoring system in order to keep a constant awareness of their symptoms and, thus, deliver a successful adherence to their treatment. As an important use case, we adapted our platform to the USA region, but it can be easily extended to any other area with minor modifications.

The energy balance property guarantees that the average per sensor energy dissipation is the same for all sensors, during the entire execution of the protocol. This property is important since it prolongs the network's lifetime by avoiding early energy depletion of sensors. We propose a new algorithm that in each step decides whether to propagate data one-hop towards the final destination (the sink), or to send data directly to the sink. This randomized choice balances the (cheap) one-hop transmissions with the direct transmissions to the sink, which are more expensive but \"bypass\" the sensors lying close to the sink. Note that, in most protocols, these close to the sink sensors tend to be overused and die out early. By a detailed analysis we precisely estimate the probabilities for each propagation \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We elaborate on two fundamental models for the emerging technology of Wireless Power Transfer in ad hoc communication networks. The first model is scalar, basically assuming that the received power by multiple transmitters is additive. The second model is vectorial, highlighting the detailed interference between RF waves of different power sources, thus, it is more precise (especially in the far field regions of dense charging systems) and allows addressing interesting superadditive (constructive) and cancellation (destructive) phenomena on the received power. Under these models, we present selected state of the art algorithms for key problems, such as how to deploy and configure the wireless chargers and how to achieve good trade-offs between efficient charging and electromagnetic radiation. We conclude with some future trends and directions in this fascinating topic.",

            "Abstract": "Geographic routing is becoming the protocol of choice for many sensor network applications. Some very efficient geographic routing algorithms exist, however they require a preliminary planarization of the communication graph. Planarization induces overhead which makes this approach not optimal when lightweight protocols are required. On the other hand, georouting algorithms which do not rely on planarization have fairly low success rates and either fail to route messages around all but the simplest obstacles or have a high topology control overhead (eg contour detection algorithms). This chapter describes the GRIC algorithm which was designed to overcome some of those limitations. The GRIC algorithm was proposed in (Powell & Nikoletseas, 2007a). It is the first lightweight and efficient on demand (ie all-to-all) geographic routing algorithm which does not require planarization, has almost 100% delivery \u2026",

A new modelisation of the process of energy consumption as a random walk along with a new analysis are proposed. Two new algorithms are presented and analysed. The first one is easy to implement and fast to execute. However, it needs a priori assumptions on the process generating data to be propagated. The second algorithm overcomes this need by inferring information from the observation of the process. Furthermore, this algorithm is based on stochastic estimation methods and is adaptive to environmental changes. This represents an important contribution for propagating energy balanced data in wireless sensor netwoks due to their highly dynamic nature.",

            "Abstract": "Recent dramatic developments in microelectromechanical (MEMS) systems, wireless communications, and digital electronics have already led to the development of smallsized, low-power, low-cost sensor devices. Such extremely small devices integrate sensing, data processing, and wireless communication capabilities. Current devices have a size at the cubic centimeter scale, a CPU running at 4 MHz, some memory, and a wireless communication capability at a 4-kbps rate. Also, they are equipped with a small but effective operating system and are able to switch between \u201csleeping\u201d and \u201cawake\u201d modes to save energy. Pioneering groups (like the \u201cSmart Dust\u201d Project at Berkeley, the \u201cWireless Integrated Network Sensors\u201d Project at UCLA, and the \u201cUltra low Wireless Sensor\u201d Project at MIT) pursue further important goals, like a total volume of a few cubic millimeters and extremely low energy consumption, by using alternative technologies, based on radio frequency (RF) or optical (laser) transmission.Examining each such device individually might appear to have small utility; however, the effective distributed coordination of large numbers of such devices may lead to the efficient accomplishment of large sensing tasks. Large numbers of sensor nodes can be deployed in areas of interest (such as inaccessible terrains or disaster places) and use self-organization and collaborative methods to form a sensor network.",

On the other hand, each agent that receives an offer decides whether it will undertake the task or not, based on the inferred cost (computed via a Cost function) and some join policy. In their policies, the crowd and the server take into account several aspects, such as the number and quality of participating agents, the progress of execution of the task and possible network effects, present in real-life systems.

However, the solution of using GPS based modules in order to perform localization in WSNs is a rather expensive solution and in the case of indoor applications, such as smart buildings, is also not applicable. Therefore, several techniques have been studied in order to perform relative localization in WSNs; that is, to compute the position of a node inside the network area relatively to the position of other nodes. Many such techniques are based on indicators like the Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Link Quality Indicator (LQI). These techniques are based on the assumption that there is strong correlation between the Euclidian distance of the communicating motes and these indicators. Therefore, high values of RSSI and LQI should indicate physical proximity of two communicating \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we initiate the study of populations of agents with very limited capabilities that are globally able to compute order statistics of their arithmetic input values via pair-wise meetings. To this extent, we introduce the Arithmetic Population Protocol (APP) model, embarking from the well known Population Protocol (PP) model and inspired by two recent papers in which states are treated as integer numbers. In the APP model, every agent has a state from a set Q of states, as well as a fixed number of registers (independent of the size of the population), each of which can store an element from a totally ordered set S of samples. Whenever two agents interact with each other, they update their states and the values stored in their registers according to a joint transition function. This transition function is also restricted; it only allows (a) comparisons and (b) copy/paste operations for the sample values that are stored in the registers of the two interacting agents. Agents can only meet in pairs via a fair scheduler and are required to eventually converge to the same output value of the function that the protocol globally and stably computes. We present two different APPs for stably computing the median of the input values, initially stored on the agents of the population. Our first APP, in which every agent has 3 registers and no states, stably computes (with probability 1) the median under any fair scheduler in any strongly connected directed (or connected undirected) interaction graph. Under the probabilistic scheduler, we show that our protocol stably computes the median in O (n^ 6) number of interactions in a connected undirected interaction graph of n \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Hierarchical specifications of graphs have been widely used in many important applications, such as VLSI design, parallel programming and software engineering. A well known hierarchical specification model, considered in this work, is that of Lengauer [9, 10] referred to as L-specifications. In this paper we discuss a restriction on the L-specifications resulting to graphs which we call Well-Separated (WS). This class is characterized by a polynomial time (to the size of the specification of the graph) testable combinatorial property.        In this work we study the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) on WS L-specified hierarchical planar graphs. The optimization version of RCP studied here, consists in assigning colors to the vertices of a graph, such that any two vertices of distance at most two get different colors. The objective here is to minimize the number of colors used. This problem is equivalent to the problem of vertex coloring the square of a graph G, G           2, where G           2 has the same vertex set as G and there is an edge between any two vertices of G           2 if their distance in G is at most 2.        We first show that RCP is       -complete for WS L-specified hierarchical planar graphs. Second, we present a polynomial time 3-approximation algorithm as well as a more efficient 4-approximation algorithm for RCP on graphs of this class.        We note that, the best currently known approximation ratio for the RCP on ordinary (non-hierarchical) planar graphs of general degree is 2 ([6, 1]). Note also that the only known results on any kind of coloring problems have been shown for another special kind of hierarchical graphs (unit disk graphs \u2026",

This talk presents representative algorithms for important problems in wireless sensor networks, such as data propagation and energy balance. The protocol design uses key algorithmic techniques like randomization and local optimization. Crucial performance properties of the protocols (correctness, fault-tolerance, scalability) and their trade-offs are investigated through both analytic means and large scale simulation. The experimental evaluation of algorithms for such networks is very beneficial, not only towards validating and fine-tuning algorithmic design and analysis, but also because of the ability to study the accurate impact of several important network parameters and technological details.",

The basic idea of our protocol is for the sink to benefit of the local information that sensors spread in the network as they move, in order to extract current local conditions and accordingly adjust its trajectory. Thus, sensory motion anyway present in the network serves as a low cost replacement of network information propagation. In particular, we investigate two variations of our method: a) the greedy motion of the sink towards the region of highest density each time and b) taking into account the aggregate density in wider network regions.

The second method suggests an incremental deployment of (potentially heterogeneous) sensor nodes. Both methods incur significant gains and satisfactory trade-offs to several performance metrics.",

In particular, we study the effect of these parameters on two different approaches for designing routing protocols: (a) the route creation and maintenance approach and (b) the \"support\" approach, that forces few hosts to move acting as \"helpers\" for message delivery. We study one representative protocol for each approach, i.e., AODV for the first approach and RUNNERS for the second. We have implemented the two protocols and performed a large scale and detailed simulation study of their performance. For the first time, we study AODV (and RUNNERS) in the 3D case. The main findings are: the AODV protocol behaves well in networks of high user density and low mobility rate, while its performance drops for sparse networks of highly mobile users \u2026",

Even if it succeeds, the request is answered by returning a stable link to a random node of the network. Furthermore, each node is allowed to perform at most g such requests where g is constant (independent of n).We present a protocol that manages (with probability tending to 1) to establish a very long path (ie of length \u0398 n\u00b5) of stable links in such a network, provided g 4ln2 1 f. This protocol thus manages to establish end-to-end communication for a large part of the network, even in the (worst) case when the failure probaility f is constant and the number g of random requests is constant too. This protocol is optimal in the sense that no linear path can be established with a sublinear number of requests. We also show that our protocol is fair in the sense that any node can equiprobably be in the established path. We expect this protocol to be useful for establishing communication in uncontrolled adverse communication environments.",

Instead, our approach uses sensors in a passive way: they only record and judiciously spread information about observed target presence in their vicinity; this information is then used by the (powerful) tracking agent to locate the target by just following the traces left at sensors. Our protocol is greedy, local, distributed, energy efficient and very successful, in the sense that (as shown by extensive simulations) the tracking agent manages to quickly locate and follow the target; also, we achieve good trade-offs between the energy \u2026",

We investigate a few representative, important aspects of energy efficiency: a) the robust and fast data propagation b) the problem of balancing the energy dissipation among all sensors in the network and c) the problem of efficiently tracking moving entities in sensor networks. Our work here is a methodological survey of selected results that have already appeared in the related literature. In particular, we investigate important issues of energy optimization, like minimizing the total energy dissipation, minimizing the number of transmissions as well as balancing the energy load to prolong the system\u2019s lifetime. We review characteristic protocols and techniques in the recent literature, including probabilistic forwarding and local optimization methods. We study the problem of localizing and tracking multiple moving targets from a network design perspective ie towards estimating the least possible number of sensors, their positions and operation characteristics needed to efficiently perform the tracking task. To avoid an expensive massive deployment, we try to take advantage of possible coverage overlaps over space and time, by introducing a novel combinatorial model that captures such overlaps. Under this model, we abstract the tracking network design problem by a covering combinatorial problem and then design and analyze an efficient approximate method for sensor placement and operation.

Towards improved energy-latency trade-offs, we propose a biased, adaptive sink mobility scheme, that adjusts to local network conditions, such as the surrounding density, remaining energy and the number of past visits in each network region. The sink moves probabilistically, favoring less visited areas in order to cover the network area faster, while adaptively stopping more time in network regions that tend to produce more data. We implement and evaluate our mobility scheme via simulation in diverse network settings. Compared to known blind random, non-adaptive schemes, our method achieves significantly reduced latency, especially in networks with non-uniform sensor distribution, without compromising the energy efficiency and delivery success.",

Examining each such resource constraint device individually might appear to have small utility, however the distributed self-collaboration of large numbers of such devices into an ad-hoc network may lead to the efficient accomplishment of large sensing tasks ie reporting data about the realization of a local event happening in the network area to a faraway control center.The problem considered is the development of a randomized algorithm to balance energy among sensors whose aim is to detect events in the network area and report them to a sink. The network is sliced by the algorithm into layers composed of sensors at approximately equal distances from the sink [8, 4, 5], see Figure 1. The slicing of the network depends on the communication distance. The sink initiates the process by sending a control message containing a counter which value is initially one. Sensors receiving the message assign themselves to slice number corresponding to the counter, increment the counter and propagate the message in the network. A sensor already assigned to a slice ignores subsequent received control messages.",

In a recent work [7], we considered acknowledgment-based protocols, where a user gets feedback from the channel only when she attempts transmission. In this case she will learn whether her transmission was successful or not. One of the main results of [7] was that no acknowledgment-based protocol can be in equilibrium. In fact, it seems that many natural acknowledgment-based protocols fail to prevent users from unilaterally switching to persistent protocols that always transmit with probability 1. It is therefore natural to ask how powerful a protocol must be so that it can beat persistent deviators. In this paper we consider age-based protocols, which can be described by a sequence of probabilities of transmitting in each time step. Those probabilities are given beforehand and do not change based on the transmission history. We present a 3-player age-based protocol that can prevent users from unilaterally deviating to a persistent protocol in order to decrease their expected transmission time. It is worth noting that the answer to this question does not follow from the results and proof ideas of [7]. Our protocol is non-trivial, in the sense that, when all players use it, finite expected transmission time is guaranteed. In fact, we show that this protocol is preferable to any deadline protocol in which, after some fixed time, attempt transmission with probability 1 in every subsequent step. An advantage of our protocol is that it is very simple to describe, and users only need a counter to keep track of time. Whether there exist n-player age-based protocols that do not use \u2026",

A multitude of critical aspects, including mobility, severe limitations and limited reliability, create a new set of crucial issues and trade-offs that must be carefully taken into account in the design of robust and efficient algorithms for these environments. The communication among mobile hosts is one among the many issues that need to be resolved efficiently before MANET becomes a commodity.In this paper, we propose to discuss the communication problem in MANET as well as present some characteristic techniques for the design, the analysis and the performance evaluation of distributed communication protocols for mobile ad hoc networks. More specifically, we propose to review two different design techniques. While the \u2026",

In this new paradigm for wireless sensor networks a mobile entity called mobile charger (MC) traverses the network and replenishes the dissipated energy of sensors. In this work we first provide a formal definition of the charging dispatch decision problem and prove its computational hardness. We then investigate how to optimise the trade-offs of several critical aspects of the charging process. In the light of these optimisations, we study the impact of the charging process to the network lifetime for three characteristic underlying routing protocols. Finally, we propose a mobile charging protocol that locally adapts the circular trajectory of the MC to the energy dissipation rate of each sub-region of the network. We compare this protocol against several MC trajectories by a detailed \u2026",

A  very natural question that arises in the context of stability  properties of such networks is how network structure precisely affects these properties. In this work we embark on a systematic study of this question in the context of  Adversarial Queueing Theory, which assumes that packets are adversarially injected into the network. We consider size, diameter, maximum vertex degree, minimum number of disjoint paths that cover all edges of the network and network subgraphs as crucial structural parameters of the network, and we present a comprehensive collection of structural results, in the form of stability and instability bounds on injection rate of the adversary for various greedy protocols: \u2014Increasing the size of a network may result in dropping its instability bound.

Given a static underlying graph , a temporal graph on  is a sequence of snapshots , one for each time step . In this paper we study stochastic temporal graphs, i.e. stochastic processes  whose random variables are the snapshots of a temporal graph on . A natural feature observed in various real-life scenarios is a memory effect in the appearance probabilities of particular edges; i.e. the probability an edge  appears at time step  depends on its appearance (or absence) at the previous  steps. In this paper we study the hierarchy of models memory-, addressing this memory effect in an edge-centric network evolution: every edge of  has its own independent probability distribution for its appearance over time. Clearly, for every , memory- is a special case of memory-. We make a clear distinction between the values  (\"no memory\") and  (\"some memory\"), as in some cases these models exhibit a fundamentally different computational behavior, as our results indicate. For every  we investigate the complexity of two naturally related, but fundamentally different, temporal path (journey) problems: MINIMUM ARRIVAL and BEST POLICY. In the first problem we are looking for the expected arrival time of a foremost journey between two designated vertices . In the second one we are looking for the arrival time of the best policy for actually choosing a particular - journey.

            "Abstract": "We investigate the efficiency of protocols for basic communication in ad-hoc mobile networks. All protocols are classified in the semi-compulsory, relay category according to which communication is achieved through a small team of mobile hosts, called the support, which move in a predetermined way and serves as an intermediate pool for receiving and delivering messages. We implement a new semi-compulsory, relay protocol in which the motion of the support is based on a so-called \u201chunter\u201d strategy developed for a pursuit-evasion game. We conduct an extensive, comparative experimental study of this protocol with other two existing protocols, each one possessing a different motion for its support. We considered several types of inputs, including among others two kinds of motion patterns (random and adversarial) for the mobile hosts not in the support. Our experiments showed that for all protocols the throughput scales almost linearly with the number of mobile hosts in the network, and that a small support size suffices for efficient communication. An interesting outcome is that in most cases the new protocol is inferior to the other two, although it has a global knowledge of the motion space.",

Although several energy-aware MAC layer protocols exist that operate very well in the case of single point-to-point transmissions, none is especially designed and suitable for multiple broadcast transmissions. The key idea of our protocols is the passive monitoring of local network conditions and the adaptation of the protocol operation accordingly. The main contribution of our adaptive method is to proactively avoid collisions by implicitly and early enough sensing the need for collision avoidance. Using the above ideas, we design, implement and evaluate three different, new strategies for proactive adaptation. We show, through a detailed and extended simulation evaluation, that our parameter-based family of protocols for multi-path data propagation significantly reduce the \u2026",

Specifically, we design simple distributed protocols consisting of a small number of states and interaction rules for the construction of both arbitrary and binary trees. Further, we theoretically and experimentally evaluate a plethora of energy redistribution protocols that exploit different levels of knowledge in order to achieve desired energy distributions which require, for instance, that every agent has twice the energy of the agents of higher depth (according to the tree network). Our study shows that without using any knowledge about the network structure, such energy distributions cannot be achieved in a timely manner, which means that there might be high energy loss during the redistribution \u2026",

We first provide a protocol with 4 states per vertex that always computes the initial majority value, under any fair scheduler. Under the uniform probabilistic scheduler of pairwise interactions, we prove that our protocol stabilizes in expected polynomial time for any network and is quite fast on the clique.

The FAP is usually modelled by variations of the graph coloring problem. The Radiocoloring (RC) of a graph G (V, E) is an assignment function \u039b: V\u2192 IN such that| \u039b (u)\u2212 \u039b (v)|\u2265 2, when u, v are neighbors in G, and| \u039b (u)\u2212 \u039b (v)|\u2265 1 when the distance of u, v in G is two. The discrete number of frequencies used is called order and the range of frequencies used, span. The optimization versions of the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) are to minimize the span (min span RCP) or the order (min order RCP). Here, we consider the optimization version of RCP where one tries to minimize the order of the assignment.In this paper, we deal with an interesting variation of the radiocoloring problem: that of satisfying frequency \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Random walks in Wireless Sensor Networks can serve as fully local, very simple strategies for sink motion that lift from sensors the computational burden of propagating collected data via complex routing algorithms. In such schemes, sensors maintain a passive role waiting for the sink to visit them and collect their data. Therefore, energy dissipation is significantly reduced at the expense of increasing the latency of data delivery. To achieve satisfactory energy-latency trade-offs, the sink walks can be made adaptive, depending on critical network parameters (density, history of past visits in each network region) as well as characteristic attributes of the network topology. In this chapter, we study known random walks on two well established network models; the Grid and the Random Geometric Graphs. Towards better balances of memory/performance, we propose four new random walks that we experimentally evaluate in terms of several performance metrics that capture important differences in the network traversal process. The simulation findings demonstrate that even with limited memory usage, random walks can prove themselves very efficient when carefully designed.",

We consider the data gathering problem where data are generated by the sensors and must be routed toward a unique sink. Sensors route data by either sending the data directly to the sink or in a multi-hop fashion by delivering the data to a neighbouring sensor. Direct and neighbouring transmissions require different levels of energy consumption. Basically, the protocols balance the energy consumption among the sensors by computing the adequate ratios of direct and neighbouring transmissions. An abstract model of energy dissipation as a random walk is proposed, along with rigorous performance analysis techniques.

            "Abstract": "We employ here the Probabilistic Method, a way of reasoning which shows existence of combinatorial structures and properties to prove refute conjectures. The radiocoloring problem (RCP) is the problem of assigning frequencies to the transmitters of a network so that transmitters of distance one get frequencies that differ by at least two and any two transmitters of distance one get frequencies that differ by at least one. The objective of an assignment may be to minimize the number of frequencies used (order) or the range of them (span). Here, we study the optimization version of RCP where the objective is to minimize the order. In graph theory terms the problem is modelled by a variation of the vertex graph coloring problem. We investigate upper bounds for the minimum number of colors needed in a radiocoloring assignment of a graph G. We first provide an upper bound for the minimum number of colors needed to radiocolor a graph G of girth at most 7. Then, we study whether the minimum order of a radiocoloring assignment is determined by local conditions, ie by the minimum order radiocoloring assignment of some small subgraphs of it. We state a related conjecture which is analogous to a theorem of Molloy and Reed for the vertex coloring problem [12]. We then investigate whether the conjecture contradicts a Theorem of Molloy and Reed for the vertex coloring when applied on the graph G2 obtained by G. The graph G2 has the same vertex set as G and there is an edge in G2 between any two vertices iff their distance in G is at most 2. We prove that there is no case where the conjecture stated here contradicts the Theorem of Molloy and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in radio networks is the problem of assigning frequencies to transmitters, by exploiting frequency reuse while keeping signal interference to acceptable levels. The FAP is usually modelled by variations of the graph coloring problem. A Radiocoloring (RC) of a graph G (V, E) is an assignment function \u03a6: V\u2192 N such that| \u03a6 (u)-\u03a6 (v)|\u2a7e 2, when u, v are neighbors in G, and| \u03a6 (u)-\u03a6 (v)|\u2a7e 1 when the distance of u, v in G is two. The number of discrete frequencies and the range of frequencies used are called order and span, respectively. The optimization versions of the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) are to minimize the span or the order. In this paper we prove that the radiocoloring problem for general graphs is hard to approximate (unless NP= ZPP) within a factor of n 1/2-\u03b5 (for any \u03b5> 0), where n is the number of vertices of the graph.

Wireless ad hoc sensor networks have become a very important research subject due to their potential to provide diverse services in numerous appli-tions. The realization of sensor networks requires intensive technical research and development e? orts, especially in power-aware scalable wireless ad hoc c-munications protocols, due to their unusual application requirements and severe constraints. On the other hand, a solid theoretical background seems necessary for sensor networks to achieve their full potential. It is an algorithmic challenge to achieve e? cient and robust realizations of such large, highly dynamic, complex, n-conventional networking environments. Features, including the huge number of sensor devices involved, the severe power, computational and memory limi-tions, their dense deployment and frequent failures, pose new design, analysis and implementation challenges. This event is intended to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present their contributions related to all aspects of wireless sensor networks.

In this paper we propose a family of new protocols suitable of multi-path broadcast of data, and show, through a detailed and extended simulation evaluation, that our parameter-based protocols significantly reduce the number of collisions and thus increase the rate of successful message delivery (to above 90%) by trading off the average propagation delay. At the same time, our protocols are shown to be very energy efficient, in terms of the average energy dissipation per delivered message.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multidisciplinary Gesture Recognition case study using a Machine Learning approach for the detection and classification of allergic rhinitis-related gestures. Allergic diseases and especially allergic rhinitis are among the most common diseases in the world, mostly underappreciated, causing considerable impairment of daily activities, including job, and school productivity. For this reason, close monitoring and early recognition of symptoms worsening are considered essential. We hypothesize that recognizing allergic rhinitis to patients by such an approach may be a useful tool for such purpose.In our study, for the first time, the most common allergic rhinitis gestures are identified, based on patients' description and specialists' experience. Our data is retrieved by a large pool of active allergic rhinitis patients attending three specialized outpatient clinics in Greece. Gestures are recorded with \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An intersection graph of n vertices assumes that each vertex is equipped with a subset of a global label set. Two vertices share an edge when their label sets intersect. Random intersection graphs (RIGs) (as defined in Karo\u0144ski et al. Comb. Probab. Comput. J. 8, 131\u2013159 (1999); Singer-Cohen (1995)) consider label sets formed by the following experiment: each vertex, independently and uniformly, examines all the labels (m in total) one by one. Each examination is independent and the vertex succeeds to put the label in her set with probability p. Such graphs can capture interactions in networks due to sharing of resources among nodes. In this paper, we discuss various structural and algorithmic results concerning random intersection graphs and we focus on the computational problem of properly coloring random instances of the binomial random intersection graphs model.

            "Abstract": "The term crowd sourcing characterizes large scale experimental set-ups which engage large numbers of individuals. The individuals interact, using their portable devices (eg mobile phones and tablets), with specialized information systems that collect and process information sent by the individuals.The main advantage of crowd sourcing is that it mobilizes large crowds of people who volunteer to contribute, using the sensors of their mobile devices, towards the collection of environmental data and information (eg weather conditions, city traffic status, pollution indicators, seismic wave propagation etc.) or their behavior itself (eg movement). Based on this local data and other information sent by the crowd, the experimenters can derive useful global information about the evolution of a physical phenomenon or explain an observed macroscopic behavior of the crowd population itself. Thus, typically, crowd sourcing mostly benefits the experimenter while it either benefits minimally the participating crowd or benefits it in a long term way.",

In this work, we analyze a specific multimedia service that can be used by several interesting applications: video broadcasting. Particularly, we throughly discuss and evaluate the role of redundancy in improving this service. We have verified that although redundancy does increase the effectiveness in video broadcasting, coding techniques do not improve redundancy's efficiency.",

Recently, a novel approach is catching momentum because of important applications; that of having a mobile sink move inside the network area and collects the data with low energy cost. Here we extend this line of research by proposing and evaluating three new protocols. Our protocols are novel in a) investigating the impact of having many mobile sinks; b) in weak models with restricted mobility, proposing and evaluating a mix of static and mobile sinks; and c) proposing a distributed protocol that tends to equally spread the sinks in the network to further improve performance. Our protocols are simple, based on randomization and assume locally obtainable information. We perform an extensive evaluation via simulation \u2026",

The energy balance property guarantees that the average per sensor energy dissipation is the same for all sensors in the network, throughout the execution of the data propagation protocol. This property is crucial for prolonging the network lifetime, by avoiding early energy depletion of sensors.We survey representative solutions from the state of the art. We first present a basic algorithm that in each step probabilistically decides whether to propagate data one-hop towards the final destination (the sink), or to send it directly to the sink. This randomized choice trades-off the (cheap, but slow) one-hop transmissions with the direct transmissions to the sink, which are more expensive but bypass the bottleneck region around the sink and propagate data fast.

Our work focuses on networks with high rate of such changes to connectivity. For such dynamically changing networks we propose protocols which exploit the co-ordinated (by the protocol) motion of a small part of the network. We show that such protocols can be designed to work correctly and efficiently even in the case of arbitrary (but not malicious) movements of the hosts not affected by the protocol.We also propose a methodology for the analysis of the expected behavior of protocols for such networks, based on the assumption that mobile hosts (those whose motion is not guided by the protocol) conduct concurrent random walks in their motion \u2026",

The agents in this model are capable of mutual energy transfer, acting both as transmitters and receivers of wireless energy.

The basic idea of data propagation in VTRP is the varying range of data transmissions, i.e. we allow the transmission range to increase in various ways.

Motivated by important applications (mostly related to ambient intelligence and remote monitoring) and as a first step towards introducing mobility, we propose the basic idea of having a sink moving in the network area and collecting data from sensors. We propose four characteristic mobility patterns for the sink that we combine with different data collection strategies. Through a detailed simulation study, we evaluate several important performance properties of each approach. Our findings demonstrate that by taking advantage of the sinks mobility and shifting work from sensors to the powerful sink, we can significantly reduce the energy spent in relaying traffic and thus greatly extend the lifetime of the network.",

Still, most of the algorithms are concerned with finding some path, while the optimality of the path is difficult to achieve. In this paper we are presenting a novel geographic routing algorithm with obstacle avoidance properties. It aims at finding the optimal path from a source to a destination when some areas of the network are unavailable for routing due to low local density or obstacle presence. It locally and gradually with time (but, as we show, quite fast) evaluates and updates the suitability of the previously used paths and ignores non optimal paths for further routing. By means of extensive simulations, we are comparing its performance to existing state of the art protocols, showing that it performs much better in terms of path length thus minimizing latency, space, overall traffic and energy consumption.",

To achieve satisfactory energy-latency trade-offs the sink walks can be made adaptive, depending on network parameters such as density and/or history of past visits in each network region; but this increases the memory requirements. Towards better balances of memory/performance, we propose three new random walks: the Random Walk with Inertia, the Explore-and-Go Random Walk and the Curly Random Walk; we also introduce a new metric (Proximity Variation) that captures the different way each walk gets close to the network nodes over time. We implement the new walks and experimentally compare them to known ones. The simulation findings demonstrate that the new walks\u2019 performance (cover time \u2026",

Hence, crowds can be engaged in many different types of activities spanning from idea generation to crisis management. These crowds are also motivated to participate and contribute differently, for some crowds monetary compensation is a strong motivator while in other initiatives, contributing to a larger cause is more prominent. This paper aims to cluster different crowdsourcing initiatives into different modes to deepen the understanding of what motivates the crowds.

In this work, the stability properties of the FIFO protocol are analyzed in depth and new performance bounds are presented. Roughly speaking, stability requires that the number of packets in a network remains bounded, as the network runs for an arbitrarily long period of time. We focus on a basic adversarial model for packet arrival and path determination for which packets are injected with predetermined paths, such that the time-averaged arrival rate of packets requiring a single edge is no more than 1. We discover: - FIFO is stable for any adversary with injection rate r less than or equal to 1/9 (r \u2264 1/9 ) for a specific simple network with four queues. - We present a \u2026",

Wireless sensor networks (WSN), which operate on rechargeable batteries, could be based on a fresh basis which aims both at environmental power collection and wireless charging in various shapes and scales. Consequently, a potential illimitable energy supply can override the hypothesis of the limited energy budget (which can also impact the system\u2019s efficiency). The presented platform is able to efficiently power a low power IoT system with processing, sensing and wireless transmission potentials. It incorporates a cutting-edge energy management IC that enables exceptional energy harvesting, applicable on low power and downsized energy generators. In contrast to other schemes, it supports not only a range of power supply alternatives, but also a compound energy depository system.

We algebraically characterize the network structures in which energy-balanced data flows are maximal. Moreover, we algebraically characterize communication links which are not used by an optimal flow. This leads to the characterization of minimal network structures supporting the maximal flows.We note that energy-balance, although implying global optimality, is a local property that can be computed efficiently and in a distributed manner.

This still holds for the general case of the RF Wireless Communication networks.

            "Abstract": "We propose local mechanisms for efficiently marking the broader network region around obstacles, for data propagation to early enough avoid them towards near-optimal routing paths. In particular, our methods perform an on-line identification of sensors lying near obstacle boundaries, which then appropriately emit beacon messages in the network towards establishing efficient obstacle avoidance paths. We provide a variety of beacon dissemination schemes that satisfy different trade-offs between protocol overhead and performance. Compared to greedy, face routing and trust-based methods in the state of the art, our methods achieve significantly shorter propagation paths, while introducing much lower overhead and converging faster to near-optimality.",

We address the Internet of Things paradigm by using diverse heterogeneous devices such as smartphones, sensor motes, NFC technology and traditional electrical devices, each one serving a specific role in the test-bed facility. Also, we extend a basic actuation component by making it self-aware, in terms of supported resources. Those enhancements allow us to enrich the test-bed's capabilities in terms of M2M communication, portability and decentralization of the actuation process. Finally, we provide a simple smart room scenario for a tunable combination of energy efficiency and comfort, which automatically adjusts the room's light level based on ambient conditions and user preferences and demonstrate the feasibility of our system.",

The collected data is disseminated to a static control point\u2013data sink in the network, using node to node\u2013multi-hop data propagation,[4, 6]. However, sensor devices consume significant amounts of energy in addition to increased implementation complexity since a routing protocol is executed. Also, a point of failure emerges in the area near the control center where nodes relay the data from nodes that are farther away.Additionally, a new category of important sensor networks applications emerges where motion is a fundamental characteristic of the examined system. In such applications sensors are attached to vehicles, animals or people that move around large geographic areas. Data exchange between individual sensors and infrastructure nodes will drive applications such as traffic and wild life monitoring, smart homes and hospitals and pollution control. Clearly, the usual approach of having a statically placed control center is unable to operate efficiently in such scenarios.",

A fundamental question that naturally poses itself concerns the preservation (or loss) of important correctness and performance properties of the individual protocols when they are composed in a large network. In this work, we specifically address stability properties of greedy, contention-resolution protocols operating over a packet-switched communication network.We focus on a basic adversarial model for packet arrival and path determination for which the time-averaged arrival rate of packets requiring a single edge is no more than 1. Stability requires that the number of packets in the system remains bounded \u2026",

In particular, we first mathematically analyze and experimentally evaluate the energy efficiency and latency of three characteristic protocols, each one selecting the next hop node with respect to a different criterion (minimum projection, minimum angle and minimum distance to the destination). Our analytic and simulation findings suggest that any single criterion does not simultaneously satisfy both energy efficiency and low latency. Towards parameterized energy-latency trade-offs we provide as well hybrid combinations of the two criteria (direction and proximity to the sink). Our hybrid protocols achieve significant perfomance gains and allow fine-tuning of desired performance. Also, they have nice energy balance properties, and can prolong the network lifetime.",

The current state of the art is unsatisfactory: some algorithms are very efficient, however they require a preliminary planarization of the communication graph. Planarization induces overhead and is thus not realistic for some scenarios such as the case of highly dynamic network topologies. On the other hand, georouting algorithms which do not rely on planarization have fairly low success rates and fail to route messages around all but the simplest obstacles. To overcome these limitations, we propose the GRIC geographic routing algorithm. It has absolutely no topology maintenance overhead, almost 100% delivery rates (when no obstacles are added), bypasses large convex obstacles, finds short paths to the destination, resists link failure and is fairly simple to implement. The case of hard concave obstacles is also \u2026",
