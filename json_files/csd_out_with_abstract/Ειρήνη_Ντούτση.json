On the other hand, the data mining techniques used for extracting essential information from raw data are rather complex, thus not synchronized to underlying data changes. There is a need of detecting whether synchronization operations should take place so as to rescue resources. Motivated from the above problem, we introduce the notion of similarity in data and pattern space and examine their relationship.",

            "Abstract": "Recommendation systems have received significant attention, with most of the proposed methods focusing on personal recommendations. However, there are contexts in which the items to be suggested are not intended for a single user but for a group of people. For example, assume a group of friends or a family that is planning to watch a movie or visit a restaurant. In this paper, we propose an extensive model for group recommendations that exploits recommendations for items that similar users to the group members liked in the past. We do not exhaustively search for similar users in the whole user base, but we pre-partition users into clusters of similar ones and use the cluster members for recommendations. We efficiently aggregate the single user recommendations into group recommendations by leveraging the power of a top-k algorithm. We evaluate our approach in a real dataset of movie ratings.",

We obtain a scalable stream clustering method which is open source and can be used by the Apache Spark community.

At the Workshop, we revisited the origins of Web Science, explored the challenges and opportunities of the Web, and looked ahead to potential futures for both the Web and Web Science. We explain issues that society faces in the Web by the ambivalences that are inherent in the Web. All the enormous benefits that the Web offers-for information sharing, collective organization and distributed activity, social inclusion and economic growth-will always carry along negative consequences, too, and 30 years after its creation negative consequences of the Web are only too apparent. The Web continues to evolve and its next major step will involve Artificial Intelligence (AI) at large. AI has the potential to amplify positive and negative outcomes, and we explore these possibilities, situating them within the wider debate about the future of regulation and governance for the Web. Finally, we outline the need to extend Web Science as the science that is devoted to the analysis and engineering of the Web, to strengthen our role in shaping the future of the Web and present five key directions for capacity building that are necessary to achieve this: (i), supporting interdisciplinarity, (ii), supporting collaboration, (iii), supporting the sustainable Web, (iv), supporting the Intelligent Web, and (v), supporting the Inclusive Web.

A large variety of fairness-aware machine learning solutions have been proposed which propose fairness-related interventions in the data, learning algorithms and/or model outputs. However, a vital part of proposing new approaches is evaluating them empirically on benchmark datasets that represent realistic and diverse settings. Therefore, in this paper, we overview real-world datasets used for fairness-aware machine learning. We focus on tabular data as the most common data representation for fairness-aware machine learning. We start our analysis by identifying relationships among the different attributes, particularly w.r.t. protected attributes and class attributes, using a Bayesian network. For a deeper understanding of bias and fairness in the datasets, we investigate the interesting relationships using exploratory analysis.",

Wireless networks are becoming the nerves of our territory, especially in the urban setting; through these nerves, the movement of people and vehicles may be sensed and possibly recorded, thus producing large volumes of mobility data. This is a scenario of great opportunities and risks. On one side, data mining can be put to work to analyse these data, with the purpose of producing useful knowledge in support of sustainable mobility and intelligent transportation systems. On the other side, individual privacy is at risk, as the mobility data may reveal, if misused, highly sensitive personal information. In a nutshell, a novel multi-disciplinary research area is emerging within this challenging con? ict of opportunities and risks and at the crossroads of three s-jects: mobility, data mining and privacy. This book is aimed at shaping up this frontier of research, from a computer science perspective: we investigate the v-ious scienti? c and technologicalachievementsthat are needed to face the challenge, anddiscussthecurrentstate oftheart, theopenproblemsandtheexpectedroad-map of research. Hence, this is a book for researchers:? rst of all for computer science researchers, from any sub-area of the? eld, and also for researchers from other disciplines (such as geography, statistics, social sciences, law, telecommunication and transportation engineering) who are willing to engage in a multi-disciplinary research area with potential for broad social and economic impact.",

While there is much research in adapting patterns in the presence of drift or shift, there is less research on how to maintain an overview of pattern changes over time. A major challenge lays in summarizing changes in an effective way, so that the nature of change can be understood by the user, while the demand on resources remains low. To this end, we propose FINGERPRINT, an environment for the summarization of cluster evolution. Cluster changes are captured into an \u201cevolution graph\u201d, which is then summarized based on cluster similarity into a fingerprint of evolution by merging similar clusters. We propose a batch summarization method that traverses and summarizes the Evolution Graph as a whole, and an incremental method that is applied during the process \u2026",

Nowadays precise information about taxi-rides is available and can be used to infer the taxi-passenger demand across different locations and time-points. In this paper, we propose an approach for predicting the pick-demand of a given taxi-stand, that takes into account not only the demand-history of the particular stand but it also considers information from neighboring stands. Our model is an LSTM neural network augmented with information from the spatial neighborhood of the stands.

            "Abstract": "Counterfactuals have become a popular technique nowadays for interacting with black-box machine learning models and understanding how to change a particular instance to obtain a desired outcome from the model. However, most existing approaches assume instant materialization of these changes, ignoring that they may require effort and a specific order of application. Recently, methods have been proposed that also consider the order in which actions are applied, leading to the so-called sequential counterfactual generation problem. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic method for sequential counterfactual generation. We formulate the task as a multi-objective optimization problem and present an evolutionary approach to find optimal sequences of actions leading to the counterfactuals. Our cost model considers not only the direct effect of an action, but also its consequences. Experimental results show that compared to state of the art, our approach generates less costly solutions, is more efficient, and provides the user with a diverse set of solutions to choose from.",

Online learning tries to find a trade-off between exploiting previously learned information and incorporating new information into the model. This requires both the incremental update of the model and the ability to unlearn outdated information. The improper use of unlearning, however, can lead to the retroactive interference problem, a phenomenon that occurs when newly learned information interferes with the old information and impedes the recall of previously learned information.

However, obtaining, archiving and annotating large amounts of tweets is costly. In this paper, we describe TweetsKB, a publicly available corpus of currently more than 1.5 billion tweets, spanning almost 5 years (Jan\u201913\u2013Nov\u201917). Metadata information about the tweets as well as extracted entities, hashtags, user mentions and sentiment information are exposed using established RDF/S vocabularies. Next to a description of the extraction and annotation process, we present use cases to illustrate scenarios for entity-centric information exploration, data integration and knowledge discovery facilitated by TweetsKB.",

            "Abstract": "Automated data-driven decision-making systems are ubiquitous across a wide spread of online as well as offline services. These systems, depend on sophisticated learning algorithms and available data, to optimize the service function for decision support assistance. However, there is a growing concern about the accountability and fairness of the employed models by the fact that often the available historic data is intrinsically discriminatory, i.e., the proportion of members sharing one or more sensitive attributes is higher than the proportion in the population as a whole when receiving positive classification, which leads to a lack of fairness in decision support system. A number of fairness-aware learning methods have been proposed to handle this concern. However, these methods tackle fairness as a static problem and do not take the evolution of the underlying stream population into consideration. In this paper, we introduce a learning mechanism to design a fair classifier for online stream based decision-making. Our learning model, FAHT (Fairness-Aware Hoeffding Tree), is an extension of the well-known Hoeffding Tree algorithm for decision tree induction over streams, that also accounts for fairness. Our experiments show that our algorithm is able to deal with discrimination in streaming environments, while maintaining a moderate predictive performance over the stream.",

Several approaches have been lately proposed for solving independently the different aspects of the problem. There exist methods for clustering over full dimensional streams and methods for finding clusters in subspaces of high dimensional static data. Yet only a few approaches have been proposed so far which tackle both the stream and the high dimensionality aspects of the problem simultaneously. In this work, we propose a new density-based projected clustering algorithm, HDDSTREAM, for high dimensional data streams. Our algorithm summarizes both the data points and the dimensions where these points are grouped together and maintains these summaries online, as new points arrive over time and old points expire due to ageing.

            "Abstract": "Traditionally, clustering algorithms focus on partitioning the data into groups of similar instances. The similarity objective, however, is not sufficient in applications where a fair-representation of the groups in terms of protected attributes like gender or race, is required for each cluster. Moreover, in many applications, to make the clusters useful for the end-user, a balanced cardinality among the clusters is required. Our motivation comes from the education domain where studies indicate that students might learn better in diverse student groups and of course groups of similar cardinality are more practical e.g., for group assignments.To this end, we introduce the fair-capacitated clustering problem that partitions the data into clusters of similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem: i) we rely on fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint and ii) we propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. The hierarchical approach embeds the additional cardinality requirements during the merging step while the partitioning-based one alters the assignment step using a knapsack problem formulation to satisfy the additional requirements. Our experiments on four educational datasets show that our approaches deliver well-balanced clusters in terms of both fairness and cardinality while maintaining a good clustering quality.",

Ageing is a typical way of adapting to change in a stream environment as it potentially allows us to discard outdated information from the learning models and focus on the most recent information. Most of the existing approaches follow a fixed ageing strategy which remains the same over the whole stream; for example, a fixed window size in the sliding window model or a fixed ageing factor in the damped window model.

            "Abstract": "Monitoring and interpretation of changing patterns is a task of paramount importance for data mining applications in dynamic environments. While there is much research in adapting patterns in the presence of drift or shift, there is less research on how to maintain an overview of pattern changes over time. A major challenge is summarizing changes in an effective way, so that the nature of change can be understood by the user, while the demand on resources remains low. To this end, the authors propose FINGERPRINT, an environment for the summarization of cluster evolution. Cluster changes are captured into an \u201cevolution graph,\u201d which is then summarized based on cluster similarity into a fingerprint of evolution by merging similar clusters. The authors propose a batch summarization method that traverses and summarizes the Evolution Graph as a whole and an incremental method that is applied during the \u2026",

These standards should be independent of the underlying data mining systems and should allow the communication between different vector applications. In this paper we address the current and evolving efforts towards this aim. As we will see there are a lot of standards and tools, with PMML being the most prominent one, however most of them deal with patterns in a traditional manner (usually with relational tables). As the amount of data produced by data processing systems increases, it has become clear the need for a system, similar to DBMS, for efficient pattern management.",

Trajectory similarity search forms an important class of queries in TD with applications in trajectory data analysis and spatiotemporal knowledge discovery. In contrast to related works which make use of generic similarity metrics that virtually ignore the temporal dimension, in this paper we introduce a framework consisting of a set of distance operators based on primitive (space and time) as well as derived parameters of trajectories (speed and direction). The novelty of the approach is not only to provide qualitatively different means to query for similar trajectories, but also to support trajectory clustering and classification mining tasks, which definitely imply a way to quantify the distance between two trajectories.

The stream comes from a mobile robot which autonomously navigates in an unknown environment perceiving it through its sensors. The sensor data arrives fast, is huge and evolves quickly over time as the robot explores the environment and observes new objects or new parts of already observed objects. To deal with the nature of data, we propose a grid-based algorithm that updates the grid structure and adjusts the so far built clusters online. Our method is capable of detecting object formations over time based on the partial observations of the robot at each time point. Experiments on real data verify the usefulness and efficiency of our method.",

It is known that oxygen isotopes are not stable under high temperatures, making their application in the analysis of cremated material problematic. We study through Data Mining techniques the effect of oxygen on isotopic fingerprinting (treated as a supervised learning task) and on origin prediction (treated as a supervised task) and explore whether including oxygen in these analyses makes a significant difference to the results.",

Recommendations for users, or groups, are determined by considering users similar to the users in question. Scanning the whole database for locating similar users, though, is expensive. Existing approaches build cluster models by employing full-dimensional clustering to find sets of similar users. As the datasets we deal with are high-dimensional and incomplete, full-dimensional clustering is not the best option. To this end, we explore the fault-tolerant subspace clustering approach. We extend the concept of fault tolerance to density-based subspace clustering, and to speed up our algorithms, we introduce the significance threshold for considering only promising dimensions for subspace extension.

While technology allows previously unthinkable optimizations in the automation of expensive human decision making, the risks that the technology can pose are also high, leading to an ever increasing public concern about the impact of the technology in our lives. The area of responsible AI has recently emerged in an attempt to put humans at the center of AI-based systems by considering aspects, such as fairness, reliability and privacy of decision-making systems. In this talk, we will focus on the fairness aspect. We will start with understanding the many sources of bias and how biases can enter at each step of the learning process and even get propagated/amplified from previous steps. We will continue with methods for mitigating bias which typically focus on some step of the pipeline (data, algorithms or results) and why it is important to target bias in each step and collectively, in the whole (machine) learning pipeline. We will conclude this talk by discussing accountability issues in connection to bias and in particular, proactive consideration via bias-aware data collection, processing and algorithmic selection and retroactive consideration via explanations.",

            "Abstract": "Data-driven learning algorithms are employed in many online applications, in which data become available over time, like network monitoring, stock price prediction, job applications, etc. The underlying data distribution might evolve over time calling for model adaptation as new instances arrive and old instances become obsolete. In such dynamic environments, the so-called data streams, fairness-aware learning cannot be considered as a one-off requirement, but rather it should comprise a continual requirement over the stream. Recent fairness-aware stream classifiers ignore the problem of class imbalance, which manifests in many real-life applications, and mitigate discrimination mainly because they \"reject\" minority instances at large due to their inability to effectively learn all classes. In this work, we propose \\ours, an online fairness-aware approach that maintains a valid and fair classifier over the stream. \\ours~is an online boosting approach that changes the training distribution in an online fashion by monitoring stream's class imbalance and tweaks its decision boundary to mitigate discriminatory outcomes over the stream. Experiments on 8 real-world and 1 synthetic datasets from different domains with varying class imbalance demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art fairness-aware stream approaches with a range (relative) increase [11.2\\%-14.2\\%] in balanced accuracy, [22.6\\%-31.8\\%] in gmean, [42.5\\%-49.6\\%] in recall, [14.3\\%-25.7\\%] in kappa and [89.4\\%-96.6\\%] in statistical parity (fairness).",

            "Abstract": "How did the popularity of the Greek Prime Minister evolve in 2015? How did the predominant sentiment about him vary during that period? Were there any controversial sub-periods? What other entities were related to him during these periods? To answer these questions, one needs to analyze archived documents and data about the query entities, such as old news articles or social media archives. In particular, user-generated content posted in social networks, like Twitter and Facebook, can be seen as a comprehensive documentation of our society, and thus, meaningful analysis methods over such archived data are of immense value for sociologists, historians, and other interested parties who want to study the history and evolution of entities and events. To this end, in this paper we propose an entity-centric approach to analyze social media archives and we define measures that allow studying how entities were \u2026",

            "Abstract": "With the rapid progress of mobile devices and positioning technologies, Trajectory databases (TD) have been in the core of database research during the last decade. Analysis and knowledge discovery in TD is an emerging field which has recently gained great interest. Extracting knowledge from TD using certain types of mining techniques, such as clustering and classification, impose that there is a mean to quantify the distance between two trajectories. Having as a main objective the support of effective similarity query processing, existing approaches utilize generic distance metrics that ignore the peculiarities of the trajectories as complex spatio-temporal data types. In this paper, we define a novel set of trajectory distance operators based on primitive (space and time) as well as derived parameters of trajectories (speed and direction).

In this chapter, we explore new techniques to process isotopic data with the ultimate goal of constructing a map of locally characteristic isotopic fingerprints that help predict the places of origin of particular findings and, thus, supports archaeologists in deriving and testing hypotheses. In particular, we propose a new method for feature selection and apply it to a sample dataset of animal bones from the reference region. This application confirms that a multivariate fingerprint is clearly superior over univariate analysis and that the impact of oxygen on the reliability of the fingerprints is not very prominent. These findings confirm that it is possible to explore cremated human material for provenance analysis \u2026",

Some biological disciplines, especially physical anthropology, archaeozoology and palaeobotany, are specialized on the investigation of bioarchaeological finds, but at the same time separated themselves to a certain degree from the larger subject of biology. Today, also geologists, mineralogists, and to a growing extent also computer scientists are engaged in bioarchaeological research. The majority of natural sciences involved, however, belong to the so-called \u201csmall academic subjects\u201d, which are at a high risk of losing their academic identity and visibility in the modern structures of German universities. To support their survival, scientific networking, the foundation of centres, and alliances in the field of academic teaching are recommended. How such a networking can be brought into being is illustrated by use of the example of the research group \u201cTransalpine mobility and culture transfer\u201d at the Ludwig-Maximilian-University in Munich.",

Towards this aim we examine three well known models from the database domain, the relational, the object-relational and the semi-structured (XML) model.

However, many existing real-world data sets come with a low sampling quality, and often with gaps, lacking data for some recording periods. As a result, in such data, NILM algorithms can hardly recognize devices and estimate their power consumption properly. An important step towards improving the performance of these energy disaggregation methods is to improve the quality of the data sets. In this paper, we carry out experiments using several methods to increase the sampling rate of low sampling rate data. Our results show that augmentation of low-frequency data can support the considered NILM algorithms in estimating appliances' consumption with a higher F-score measurement.",

From a fresh-based perspective, we propose using different aging schemes for decreasing the effect of historical ratings and increasing the influence of fresh and novel ratings. From a context-based perspective, we focus on providing different suggestions under different temporal specifications. To facilitate user browsing, we propose an effective presentation layer for time-aware recommendations based on user preferences and summaries for the suggested items.

We propose an opinion stream classifier that only uses a seed of labeled documents as input and thereafter adapts itself, as it reads documents with unknown labels. Since the stream of opinions is subject to concept drift, we use two adaptation mechanisms: forward adaptation, where the classifier incorporates to the training set only those un-labeled documents that it considers informative enough in comparison to those seen thus far; and backward adaptation, where the classifier gradually forgets old documents by eliminating them from the model.

So far, the subspace clustering methods are mainly static and thus, cannot address the dynamic nature of modern data. In this paper, we propose an incremental version of the density based projected clustering algorithm PreDeCon, called incPreDeCon.

This came at the cost of storing multiple entity-centric models in primary memory, many of which would never be used again as their entities would not receive future instances in the stream.

MNB is particularly appropriate for opinionated streams, because it allows the seamless adjustment of word probabilities, as new words appear for the first time. However, to adapt properly to drift, MNB must also be extended to take the age of documents and words into account.In this study, we incorporate ageing into the learning process of MNB, by introducing the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Computer Vision (CV) has achieved remarkable results, outperforming humans in several tasks. Nonetheless, it may result in major discrimination if not dealt with proper care. CV systems highly depend on the data they are fed with and can learn and amplify biases within such data. Thus, both the problems of understanding and discovering biases are of utmost importance. Yet, to date there is no comprehensive survey on bias in visual datasets. To this end, this work aims to: i) describe the biases that can affect visual datasets; ii) review the literature on methods for bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets; iii) discuss existing attempts to collect bias-aware visual datasets. A key conclusion of our study is that the problem of bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets is still open and there is room for improvement in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be addressed; moreover, there is no such thing as a bias-free dataset, so scientists and practitioners must become aware of the biases in their datasets and make them explicit. To this end, we propose a checklist that can be used to spot different types of bias during visual dataset collection.",

Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize \u2026",

In fact, isotopic fingerprinting aims at describing spatial areas by a characteristic fingerprint of isotopic measurements. The data upon which such an isotopic map is based is a prototype of enriched geo-data: it consists of isotopic values that specifically represent samples taken from archaeological finds or geological formations, each associated with the spatial location of the site where these samples were found (or excavated). In this work, we use isotopic data from animal remains in the Central European Alps to derive isotopic fingerprints of this alpine region. These fingerprints are used for determining the places of origin of individual finds, an information necessary for archaeologists exploring past mobility and trade in that region.

A case study using a large Twitter archive of 4 years illustrates the insights that can be gained by such an entity-centric multi-aspect analysis.",

As it usually happens in data management world, the challenge after storing the data is the implementation of appropriate analytics that could extract useful knowledge. However, traditional data warehousing systems and techniques were not designed for analyzing trajectory data. Thus, in this work, we investigate how the traditional data cube model is adapted to trajectory warehouses in order to transform raw location data into valuable information. In particular, we focus our research on three issues that are critical to trajectory data warehousing:(a) the trajectory reconstruction procedure that takes place in order to transform sampled location data originated eg from GPS recordings into trajectories and load them to a moving object database,(b) the ETL procedure that feeds a trajectory data warehouse, and (c) the aggregation of cube measures for OLAP purposes. We provide design solutions for all these issues and we test their applicability and efficiency in real world settings.",

This simple representational extension, when used as a pre-processor for numeric data, is shown to yield significant gains in accuracy combined with attractive build times. It is also shown to improve the accuracy for the second best classification option, which has valuable ramifications for post-processing. To do so an intuitive and practical version of pre-pruning is employed. Moreover, the implementation of a simple pruning scheme serves as an example of pruning applicability over the resulted trees and also as an indication that the proposed discretization absorbs much of pruning potential. Finally, we construct several versions of the basic algorithm to examine the value of every component that comprises it.",

In many applications, however, the data comes sequentially and its characteristics might evolve with time. In such a setting, it is counter-intuitive to \u201cfix\u201d a (fair) model over the data stream as changes in the data might incur changes in the underlying model therefore, affecting its fairness.

Thus, solutions are needed that achieve multi-fairness,accurate predictive performance in overall, and balanced performance across the different classes.To this end, we introduce a new fairness notion,Multi-Max Mistreatment(MMM), which measures unfairness while considering both (multi-attribute) protected group and class membership of instances. To learn an MMM-fair classifier, we propose a multi-objective problem formulation. We solve the problem using a boosting approach that in-training,incorporates multi-fairness treatment in the distribution update and post-training, finds multiple Pareto-optimal solutions; then uses pseudo-weight based decision making to select optimal solution(s) among accurate, balanced, and multi-attribute fair solutions",

First, the opinionated documents constitute an evolving stream, where both the author's attitude and the vocabulary itself may change. Second, labels of documents are scarce and labels of words are unreliable, because the sentiment of a word depends on the (unknown) context in the author's mind. Most of the research on mining over opinionated streams focuses on the first aspect of the problem, whereas for the second a continuous supply of labels from the stream is assumed. Such an assumption though is utopian as the stream is infinite and the labeling cost is prohibitive. To this end, we investigate the potential of active stream learning algorithms that ask for labels on demand. Our proposed ACOSTREAM 1 approach works with limited labels: it uses an initial seed of labeled documents, occasionally requests additional labels for documents from the human expert and incrementally adapts to the underlying stream while exploiting the available labeled documents. In its core, ACOSTREAM consists of a MNB classifier coupled with \"sampling\" strategies for requesting class labels for new unlabeled documents. In the experiments, we evaluate the classifier performance over time by varying: (a) the class distribution of the opinionated stream, while assuming that the set of the words in the vocabulary is fixed but their polarities may change with the class distribution; and (b) the number of unknown words arriving at each moment, while the class polarity may also change. Our results show that active learning on a stream of opinionated documents \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Traditional decision tree induction algorithms are greedy with locally-optimal decisions made at each node based on splitting criteria like information gain or Gini index. A reinforcement learning approach to decision tree building seems more suitable as it aims at maximizing the long-term return rather than optimizing a short-term goal. In this paper, a reinforcement learning approach is used to train a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which enables the creation of a short and highly accurate decision tree. Moreover, the use of reinforcement learning naturally enables additional functionality such as learning under concept drifts, feature importance weighting, inclusion of new features and forgetting of obsolete ones as well as classification with incomplete data. To deal with concept drifts, a reset operation is proposed that allows for local re-learning of outdated parts of the tree. Preliminary experiments show that such \u2026",

Learning how to make those choices on-the-job, often by copying the evaluation protocols used in the existing literature, can easily lead to the development of problematic habits.

We analyze the nature and amount of these redundancies and their impact on the evaluation of recommendation methods. While the general and obvious conclusion is that redundancies should be avoided and datasets should be carefully preprocessed, we observe more specifically that their impact depends on the complexity of the methods.

To this end, we explore the fault tolerance subspace clustering approach that detects clusters of similar users in subspaces of the original feature space and also allows for missing values. Our experiments on real movie datasets show that the diversification of the similar users through subspace clustering results in better recommendations comparing to traditional collaborative filtering and full dimensional clustering approaches.",

For the many applications where cluster change is relevant, among them customer relationship management, fraud detection and marketing, it is also necessary to provide insights about the nature of change: Is a cluster corresponding to a group of customers simply disappearing or are its members migrating to other clusters? Is a new emerging cluster reflecting a new target group of customers or does it rather consist of existing customers whose preferences shift? To answer such questions, we propose the MONIC framework for modelling and tracking of cluster transitions. Our cluster transition model encompasses changes that involve more than one cluster, thus allowing for insights on cluster change in the whole clustering. Our transition tracking mechanism is not based on the topological properties of clusters, which are only available for some types of clustering, but on the contents of the underlying data stream. We present our first results on monitoring cluster transitions over the ACM digital library.",

In particular, we investigate how the dissimilarity between two sets of frequent itemsets is affected by the minSupport threshold used for their generation and the adopted compactness level of the itemsets lattice, namely frequent itemsets, closed frequent itemsets or maximal frequent itemsets. Our analysis shows that utilizing frequent itemsets comparison for dataset comparison is not as straightforward as related work has argued, a result which is verified through an experimental study and opens issues for further research in the KDD field.",

Our experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that such a joint approach is superior to separate treatment of unfairness in representation learning or supervised learning. Additionally, our regularizers can be adaptively weighted to balance the different components of the loss function, thus allowing for a very general framework for conjoint fair representation learning and decision making.

            "Abstract": "Traditional active learning tries to identify instances for which the acquisition of the label increases model performance under budget constraints. Less research has been devoted to the task of actively acquiring feature values, whereupon both the instance and the feature must be selected intelligently and even less to a scenario where the instances arrive in a stream with feature drift. We propose an active feature acquisition strategy for data streams with feature drift, as well as an active feature acquisition evaluation framework. We also implement a baseline that chooses features randomly and compare the random approach against eight different methods in a scenario where we can acquire at most one feature at the time per instance and where all features are considered to cost the same. Our initial experiments on 9 different data sets, with 7 different degrees of missing features and 8 different budgets show that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Data Mining techniques are commonly used to extract patterns, like association rules and decision trees, from huge volumes of data. The comparison of patterns is a fundamental issue, which can be exploited, among others, to synthetically measure dissimilarities in evolving or different datasets and to compare the output produced by different data mining algorithms on a same dataset. In this paper, we present the Panda framework for computing the dissimilarity of both simple and complex patterns, defined upon raw data and other patterns, respectively. In Panda the problem of comparing complex patterns is decomposed into simpler sub-problems on the component (simple or complex) patterns and so-obtained partial solutions are then smartly aggregated into an overall dissimilarity score. This intrinsically recursive approach grants Panda with a high flexibility and allows it to easily handle patterns with highly \u2026",
