            "Abstract": "It is a strongly held view that the scientific branch of computer security that deals with Web-powered databases (Rahayu & Taniar, 2002) than can be accessed through Web portals (Tatnall, 2005) is both complex and challenging. This is mainly due to the fact that there are numerous avenues available for a potential intruder to follow in order to break into the Web portal and compromise its assets and functionality. This is of vital importance when the assets that might be jeopardized belong to a legally sensitive Web database such as that of an enterprise or government portal, containing sensitive and confidential information. It is obvious that the aim of not only protecting against, but mostly preventing from potential malicious or accidental activity that could set a Web portal\u2019s asset in danger, requires an attentive examination of all possible threats that may endanger the Web-based system.",

Research on copyright protection of digital data must counterbalance the failures of legal measures against digital piracy. Digital watermarking tops the list of technical countermeasures and recent research has focused on proposing watermarking methods for relational data as well as on the types of attacks which aim at removing or destroying the watermark. With the database field of research in urgent need of developing tools and platforms for the benchmarking of these watermarking methods, the present work has undertaken to construct a benchmarking system for the automatic evaluation and fair comparison of watermarking schemes for relational data.

In case large real data sets are not available, benchmarking requires the generation of artificial data sets following the realworld behavior of spatial objects that change their locations, shapes and sizes over time. In this report, a generator for changing raster data, called \u201cGenerator of Time-Evolving Regional Data\u201d(G-TERD), is presented. The basic concepts that determine the function of G-TERD are the structure of complex two-dimensional raster objects, their color, maximum speed, zoom and rotation-angle per time slot, the influence of other moving or static objects on the speed and on the moving direction of an object, the position and movement of the scene-observer, the statistical distribution of each changing factor and finally, time. In the framework developed, the user can control the generator response by setting several parameters values.",

This paper considers the query as a hyper-rectangle iso-oriented towards the axes of the multi-dimensional space and proposes:(i) main-memory algorithmic strategies, which are simple to implement and (ii) secondary-memory pruning mechanisms for processing range skyline queries efficiently.

This paper proposes a novel specification-based methodology for the detection of exploitations of SQL injection vulnerabilities. The new approach on the one hand utilizes specifications that define the intended syntactic structure of SQL queries that are produced and executed by the web application and on the other hand monitors the application for executing queries that are in violation of the specification.",

It is today the most common technique to indirectly attack Web-powered databases and disassemble effectively the secrecy, integrity and availability of Web portals. The basic idea behind this insidious and pervasive attack is that predefined logical expressions within a pre-defined query can be altered simply by injecting operations that always result in true or false statements. With this simple technique, the attacker can run arbitrary SQL queries and thus s/he can extract sensitive customer and order information from e-commerce applications, or she/he can bypass strong security mechanisms and compromise the back-end databases and the file system of the data server. Despite these threats, a surprisingly high number of systems on the internet are totally vulnerable to this attack.",

This structure is able to store consecutive historical raster images, a database of evolving images. Moreover, it can be used to support query processing in such a database. Five such spatio-temporal queries along with the respective algorithms that take advantage of the properties of the new structure are introduced.

            "Abstract": " This book is a gentle introduction to dominance-based query processing techniques and their applications. The book aims to present fundamental as well as some advanced issues in the area in a precise, but easy-to-follow, manner. Dominance is an intuitive concept that can be used in many different ways in diverse application domains. The concept of dominance is based on the values of the attributes of each object. An object \ud835\udc5d dominates another object \ud835\udc5e if \ud835\udc5d is better than \ud835\udc5e. This goodness criterion may differ from one user to another. However, all decisions boil down to the minimization or maximization of attribute values. In this book, we will explore algorithms and applications related to dominance-based query processing. The concept of dominance has a long history in finance and multi-criteria optimization. However, the introduction of the concept to the database community in 2001 inspired many \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Due to the increasing demand for cloud services and the threat of privacy invasion, the user is suggested to encrypt the data before it is outsourced to the remote server. The safe storage and efficient retrieval of d-dimensional data on an untrusted server has therefore crucial importance. The paper proposes a new encryption model which offers spatial order-preservation for d-dimensional data (SOPE model). The paper studies the operations for the construction of the encrypted database and suggests algorithms that exploit unique properties that this new model offers for the efficient execution of a whole range of well-known queries over the encrypted d-dimensional data. The new model utilizes well-known database indices, such as the B+-tree and the R-tree, as backbone structures in their traditional form, as it suggests no modifications to them for loading the data and for the efficient execution of the supporting query algorithms. An extensive experimental study that is also presented in the paper indicates the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed encryption model for real-life d-dimensional data applications.",

In case large real data sets are not available, benchmarking requires the generation of artificial data sets following the real-world behavior of spatial objects that change their locations, shapes and sizes over time. Only a few innovative papers have recently addressed the topic of spatio-temporal data generators. However, all existing approaches do not consider several important aspects of continuously changing regional data. In this report, a new generator, called generator of time-evolving regional data (G-TERD), for this class of data is presented. The basic concepts that determine the function of G-TERD are the structure of complex 2-D regional objects, their color, maximum speed, zoom and rotation-angle per time slot, the influence of other moving or static objects on the speed and on the moving direction of an object, the \u2026",

The more possibilities and opportunities develop, the more systems are subject to attack by intruders. Thus, the big question is about how to recognize and handle subversion attempts. One answer is to undertake the prevention of subversion itself by building a completely secure system. However, the complete prevention of breaches of security does not yet appear to be possible to achieve. Therefore these intrusion attempts need to be detected as soon as possible (preferably in real time) so that appropriate action might be taken to repair the damage. This is what an intrusion detection system (IDS) does. IDSs monitor and analyze the events occurring in a computer system in order to detect signs of security problems.

In many cases, the amount of information available and the rate of change may hide the optimal and truly desired solution. This reveals the need of a mechanism that will highlight the best options to choose among every possible scenario. Based on this the skyline query was proposed which is a decision support mechanism, that retrieves the valuefor- money options of a dataset by identifying the objects that present the optimal combination of the characteristics of the dataset. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art techniques for skyline query processing, the numerous variations of the initial algorithm that were proposed to solve similar problems and the application-specific approaches that were developed to provide a solution efficiently in each case. Aditionally in each section a taxonomy is outlined along with the key aspects of each algorithm and its relation to previous studies.",
