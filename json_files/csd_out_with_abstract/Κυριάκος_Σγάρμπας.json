            "Abstract": "The most important asset of semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods is the use of available unlabeled data combined with an enough smaller set of labeled examples, so as to increase the classification accuracy compared with the default procedure of supervised methods, in which during the training only the labeled data are used. The encapsulation of classifier ensembles that produce different models through training process into semi-supervised schemes seems to be a promising strategy for enhanced learning ability. In this work, a Self-trained Rotation Forest (Self-RotF) algorithm and a variant of this (Weighted-Self-RotF) are presented. We performed an in depth comparison with other well-known semi-supervised classification methods on standard benchmark datasets and after having tested their performance with statistical tests, we finally reached to the point that the presented technique had better accuracy \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the present work we used a word clustering algorithm based on the perplexity criterion, in a Dialogue Act detection framework in order to model the structure of the speech of a user at a dialogue system. Specifically, we constructed an n-gram based model for each target Dialogue Act, computed over the word classes. Then we evaluated the performance of our dialogue system on ten different types of dialogue acts, using an annotated database which contains 1,403,985 unique words. The results were very promising since we achieved about 70% of accuracy using trigram based models.",

            "Abstract": "The automation of Directory Assistance Services (DAS) through speech is one of the most difficult and demanding applications of human-computer interaction because it deals with very large vocabulary recognition issues. In this paper, we present a spoken dialogue system for automating DAS.1 Taking into account the major difficulties of this endeavor a stepwise approach was adopted. In particular, two prototypes D1.1 (basic approach) and D1.2 (improved version) were developed successively. The results of D1.1 evaluation were used to refine D1.1 and gradually led to D1.2 that was also improved using a feedback approach. Furthermore, the system was extended and optimized so that it can be utilized in real-world conditions. We describe the general architecture and the three stages of the system's development in detail. Evaluation results concerning both the speech recognizer's accuracy and the \u2026",

The paper provides a very brief introduction to basic quantum theory issues, such as quantum registers and quantum gates, as well as basic limitations of brain computer interface systems. Finally, we present references, ideas and research guidelines on how quantum theory can be used to deal with such limitations. Our ideas might result in \"brain quantum-computer interfaces\", as soon as quantum computers become widely available, resulting in real-time apparatus.",

The nature of this task prevents analysts from collecting large amount of data for building accurate predictive models. Semi-supervised algorithms overcome this phenomenon and can perform robust behavior based on a few data. Experiments using data from Greek firms have been made in this work, comparing many semi-supervised schemes against well-known supervised algorithms and the results are promising.",

Treatment planning and therapy follow-up require the detection of neoplastic and edematous tissue boundaries, a very time consuming task when manually performed by medical experts based on the 3D MRI data. Automating the detection process is challenging, due to the high diversity in appearance of neoplastic tissue among different patients and, in many cases, similarity between neoplastic and normal tissue.

The most common type of ambiguity is lexical ambiguity, and this is noticed even in highly inflectional languages such as Greek. In the present article, all the patterns of predictable lexical ambiguity in Modern Greek Language are registered, verified and quantified as occurred in the Neurolingo computational lexicon, after a study of morpho-syntactic characteristics that differentiate the ambiguous words.",

The proposed H1N1 interactome demonstrated significant transformations among activated and suppressed pathways in time. Enhanced interplay was observed at day 1, while the maximal network complexity was reached at day 8 (correlated with viral clearance and iBALT tissue formation) and one interaction was present at day 40. Next, we searched for common interactivity features between the murine-adapted PR8 strain and other influenza A subtypes/strains.

            "Abstract": "In this work, we present a modular large scale network-based methodology that captures the changes in age-related mechanisms. Our proposed method, combined with integrated diverse-omics data, identified the cross-tissue temporally conserved pathways, that may serve as potential biomarkers among distinct aging states.Recently many Systems Biology approaches were employed to investigate the different molecular aspects of aging [1]. In this study, we provide pathway biomarkers that elucidate the changes between early and late phase of aging. Our approach can detect module-based biomarkers from composite biological networks of gene expression datasets (GEDs) and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks. We used two GEDs from human brain and muscle tissues, with NCBI's GEO accession numbers GSE1572 and GSE8479. In order to identify highly differentiated pathways, we isolated the 6\" youngest\" and the 6\" oldest\" samples. We constructed a reliable PPI network with 59403 interactions among 11266 proteins, based on OPHID, MINT and BioGRID databases. A core component of our method is DMSP algorithm [2], which extracts a module from a weighted graph based on an initial\" seed\" protein. Initially, we constructed small-sized modules (ranging from 2-20 members) in both states based on the same seeds. The weighted graph was created from the PPI network after assigning as weight on an edge the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between the expression profiles of the two corresponding genes of the GED. As seed proteins, we considered the hub nodes (above 50 connections) of the PPI network and after \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Text categorization or better text classification has recently attracted the interest of several researchers, since the amount of generated documents on daily basis is vast and on many situations their manipulation is infeasible without using any appropriate Machine Learning tools. Several variants of real-life applications belong to this field and much research has been made the last two decades over them. However, default learning methods do not exploit uncategorized files which are in abundance on several fields. Thus, new learning schemes are exploited for boosting learning performance of supervised algorithms. Active Learning is such a representative example, incorporating both labeled and unlabeled data and integrating human's expertise knowledge with the obtained predictions by supervised learners. In this work, four learners are compared under two different Active Learning approaches against random sampling, examining the efficacy of annotating unlabeled documents that verify specific queries. Classification error has been recorded for two different public provided datasets highlighting the improved learning behavior of using specific queries instead of random sampling approach, under the existence of a really small portion of the initial data.",

            "Abstract": "In the present work we have implemented the Edit Distance (also known as Levenshtein Distance) on a dictionary-based algorithm in order to achieve the automatic induction of the normalized form (lemma) of regular and mildly irregular words with no direct supervision. The algorithm combines two alignment models based on the string similarity and the most frequent inflexional suffixes. In our experiments, we have also examined the language-independency (i.e. independency of the specific grammar and inflexional rules of the language) of the presented algorithm by evaluating its performance on the Modern Greek and English languages. The results were very promising as we achieved more than 95 % of accuracy for the Greek language and more than 96 % for the English language. This algorithm may be useful to various text mining and linguistic applications such as spell-checkers, electronic dictionaries \u2026",

For this study, the ECoG signals were recorded while a subject performed two different syllable repetition tasks. We found that the optimal frequency resolution to detect speech activity from ECoG signals was 8 Hz, achieving 98.8% accuracy by employing support vector machines as a classifier. We also defined the cortical areas that held the most information about the discrimination of speech and nonspeech time intervals.

            "Abstract": "The most important asset of semisupervised classification methods is the use of available unlabeled data combined with a clearly smaller set of labeled examples, so as to increase the classification accuracy compared with the default procedure of supervised methods, which on the other hand use only the labeled data during the training phase. Both the absence of automated mechanisms that produce labeled data and the high cost of needed human effort for completing the procedure of labelization in several scientific domains rise the need for semisupervised methods which counterbalance this phenomenon. In this work, a self-trained Logistic Model Trees (LMT) algorithm is presented, which combines the characteristics of Logistic Trees under the scenario of poor available labeled data. We performed an in depth comparison with other well-known semisupervised classification methods on standard benchmark \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is an ever-growing research area offering a powerful set of methods, either single or multi-view, for exploiting both labeled and unlabeled instances in the most effective manner. Self-training is a representative SSL algorithm which has been efficiently implemented for solving several classification problems in a wide range of scientific fields. Moreover, self-training has served as the base for the development of several self-labeled methods. In addition, gradient boosting is an advanced machine learning technique, a boosting algorithm for both classification and regression problems, which produces a predictive model in the form of decision trees. In this context, the principal objective of this paper is to put forward an improved self-training algorithm for classification tasks utilizing the efficacy of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) trees in a self-labeled scheme in order to build a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The increasing number of sparsely and unevenly sampled gene expression experiments in aging research pose significant constraints in gene network inference. In addition, the inconsistency in predictions among gene regulatory network methods hampers the identification of true biological structure. Recent approaches show that ensemble predictions derived from community-based methods are more accurate and provide truly testable hypotheses. Such ensemble strategies combined with multiple aging datasets establish a robust cost-effective way for unraveling cross-tissue aging mechanisms and exonerate the need for refined microarray design.Over the last years, a substantial number of methods provided novel insights at different molecular aspects of aging with the use of systems biology network-based approaches. The decline in cellular function during aging is the cumulative result of changes in the expression level of a number of genes. Towards this orientation, the construction of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) plays a prevalent role in the system modeling of interactions and regulations among genes. However, the choice of the network inference method still remains challenging, since recent studies have shown that no single method performs optimally across diverse data. For this reason, we propose the integration of predictions from multiple methods, since it has been proved to lead to more confident networks [1].",

More specifically, an application that assists the archiving and retrieving of the patients' health records was developed, and four treatment supportive services were considered.

Additionally, assuming that the speech activity of a subject is expressed as ECoG signal activity disparately distributed over the space of the electrodes, we examined the spectral information in response to the electrode locations. The study was based on spectral features (power spectral density) estimated for each electrode. Quantitative analysis based on the Relief algorithm was followed to estimate the degree of importance of each electrode for describing the voice activity. The experimental results showed that the spectral analysis with resolution of 8 Hz offers the highest voice discrimination performance (94.2%) using support vector machines as classifier \u2026",

The proposed algorithm performs optimal insertion, meaning that if applied to a minimal DAWG, the DAWG after the insertion will also be minimal. The time required to add a new word is O(n) with respect to the size of the DAWG. Repetitive application of the proposed insertion algorithm can be used to construct minimal deterministic DAWGs incrementally, although the algorithm is not time-efficient for building minimal DAWGs from a set of words: to build a DAWG of n words this way, O(n2) time is required. However, the algorithm is quite useful in cases where existing minimal DAWGs have to be updated rapidly (e.g. speller dictionaries), since each word insertion traverses only a limited portion of the graph and no additional minimization \u2026",

We extracted time-domain features from the raw ECoG and spectral features from the ECoG high gamma band (70-110Hz). The RelieF algorithm was used for selecting a subset of features to use with seven machine learning algorithms for classification. With this approach we were able to detect voice activity from ECoG signals, achieving a high accuracy using the 100 best features from all electrodes (96%) or only 12 features from the two best electrodes (94%) using the support vector machines or a linear regression classifier.

The Modern Greek language presents a high flexibility in its syntactic structure.

The allowable combinations of lexical categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) forming the above phrases, as well as the combinations of these phrases, forming clauses, are encoded according to the PC-PATR formalism and are presented in this paper. The presented rules cover the majority of the syntactic phenomena of the Modern Greek language, adequate for speech and natural language applications.",

Then, we performed feature selection and classification between alertness and fatigue states, using the functional connectivity as features. High accuracy (84.7%) was achieved, with 22 discriminative connections from PDC network. The selected features revealed alterations of the functional network due to mental fatigue and specifically reduction of information flow among areas. Finally, a feature ranking is provided, which can lead to electrode minimization for real-time fatigue monitoring applications.",
