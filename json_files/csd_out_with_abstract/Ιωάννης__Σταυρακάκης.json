Various policies for recharging battery exhausted nodes have been proposed using special recharging vehicles. The focus in this paper is on a simple recharging policy that permits a recharging vehicle, stationed at the sink node, to move around and replenish any node\u2019s exhausted battery when a certain recharging threshold is violated. The minimization of the recharging distance covered by the recharging vehicle is shown to be a facility location problem, and particularly a 1-median one. Simulation results investigate various aspects of the recharging policy related to the recharging threshold and the level of the energy left in the network nodes\u2019 batteries. In addition, it is shown that when the sink\u2019s positioning is set to the solution of the particular facility location problem, then the recharging distance is minimized irrespectively of the recharging threshold.",

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes a routing protocol that jointly exploits location and motion information in a dynamically adjusted way, towards self-adaptability in different combinations of mobility and node density conditions. The protocol employs a metric of the rate at which a packet approaches its destination over a multihop path, as an effect of both the forwarding to the next hop node and the carry action due to the movement of the receiving node. The metric employs an estimation of the time that a next-hop candidate will retain the message, if selected. This time determines the relative importance of the forwarding and the carry actions. Simulation results demonstrate that the protocol is successful in adapting to a very wide range of mobility and density conditions and compares favorably with other protocols designed for a particular network condition.",

While this broad awareness for (low-priced) limited resources can bring benefits, it also intensifies competition phenomena in distributed and uncoordinated environments, shaping, in turn, the users' decisions whether to compete or not. This paper investigates the uncoordinated resource selection problem and discusses how competition awareness shapes decision-making under different levels of rationality. The case of strategic and fully rational users provides benchmarks and \"reference\" understanding, against which other more realistic or human-centric cases are compared.",

We propose normative abstractions for the way drivers pursue parking space and the way they respond to partial or complete information for parking demand and supply as well as specific pricing policies on public and private parking facilities. The drivers are viewed as strategic agents who make rational decisions attempting to minimize the cost of the acquired parking spot. We formulate the resulting games as resource selection games and derive their equilibria under different expressions of uncertainty about the overall parking demand. The efficiency of the equilibrium states is compared against the optimal assignment that could be determined by a centralized entity and conditions are derived for minimizing the related price of anarchy value. Our results provide useful hints for the pricing and practical management of on-street and private parking resources. More importantly, they exemplify counterintuitive less-is-more effects about the way information availability modulates the service cost, which underpin general competitive service provision settings and contribute to the better understanding of effective information mechanisms.",

            "Abstract": "Several critical operations such as, data collection, routing, service discovery, etc., employ various types of information dissemination in order to be carried out. To avoid costly flooding-based solutions reaching out to all nodes, it is frequently sufficient that only a proper subset of the nodes (or backbone network) be involved, i.e., the one ensuring that every other node will be at most d hops away from a node belonging to the said subset of nodes. Finding this subset is equivalent to the construction of a d-hop Connected Dominating Set (d-CDS). Given the high complexity (non-polynomial) and the requirement of global information for constructing a Minimum d-CDS (d-MCDS), in this paper a distributed algorithm that relies on local information (i.e., d hops away) to construct an approximation of the d-MCDS is developed. The proposed algorithm is studied and compared against a centralized one that is an approximate \u2026",

We argue and demonstrate experimentally that (popular) playout policies which permit the divergence of the playout points of different nodes can deteriorate drastically the performance of P2P live streaming. Consequently, we argue in favor of keeping different playout points \u201cnear-in-time\u201d, even if this requires sacrificing (dropping) some late frames that could otherwise be rendered (assuming no strict bidirectional interactivity requirements are in place). Such nearly synchronized playout policies create \u201cpositive correlation\u201d with respect to the available frames at different playout buffers. Therefore, they increase the number of upstream relay nodes from which a node can pull frames and thus boost the playout quality of both single-parent (tree) and multiple-parent (mesh) systems. On the contrary, diverging playout points reduce the number of upstream parents that can offer a gapless relay of the stream. This is clearly undesirable and should be avoided as it contradicts the fundamental philosophy of P2P systems which is to supplement an original service point with as many additional ones presented by the very own users of the service.",

The basic features of the proposed scheme are that: (a) the rate increment is modulated by the distance between the flow\u2019s current rate and a targeted maximum rate determined by the streaming application; (b) the multiplicative decrease factor is shaped by the induced packet losses. These features are responsible for a dynamic and self-adjusting rate adaptation behavior that is shown to improve convergence to fairness, the oscillatory behavior and induced packet losses.

Consequently, topology-independent MAC policies that guarantee a number of successful transmissions independently of the underlying topology, can be employed as a suitable choice for the particular vehicular environment. One such policy is revisited in this paper and its performance is demonstrated against VeMAC\u2013a well-established MAC protocol in the area of vehicular networks\u2013using simulation results.

The performance of TDMA MAC schemes with common frame for which the assignment of time slots to a node is not aware of the time slots assigned to the neighbor nodes (topology-unaware schemes like the Deterministic Policy and the Probabilistic Policy), is studied as well. A comparison based on analytical models reveals the advantages of topology control, as well as its dependence on the mobility of the nodes and its resolution. It is shown that topology control with \u201chigh resolution\u201d in highly mobile environments may not be effective and conditions are established under which topology control is beneficial. Simulation results for a variety of network topologies support the claims and the expectations of the aforementioned analysis and show that the system throughput achieved under topology control can be higher under both policies and especially under the Probabilistic Policy. Simulation results also show how mobility affects system throughput and that topology control may not be suitable for highly mobile environments.",

            "Abstract": "Fog-assisted cloud computing advances have paved the way for new solutions in online gaming, by integrating all rendering resources directly into the edges of the cloud. However, despite the numerous benefits, these systems still remain prone to network delays, ergo, the discovery of an optimal rendering service placement in the fog layer, that effectively reduces capital deployment cost for the game providers and access latency cost for the game clients, is a challenging issue. In fact, it falls into the category of the well-known (NP-hard) facility location problems. As such, conventional centralized approaches, that require global network knowledge, in most cases are deemed unscalable and cost-prohibitive, thus, distributed solutions must be further explored. The approach followed here, introduces a Rendering Service Allocation Policy (RSAP) to autonomously allocate services towards an optimal placement \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The emergence of intelligent sensing and communication technologies fosters the generation and dissemination of huge amounts of information that collectively enriches people\u2019s awareness about their environment and its resources. With this information at hand, users then decide how to access these resources to best serve their interests. However, situations repeatedly emerge where the users\u2019 welfare is better satisfied by the same finite set of resources and the uncoordinated access to them gives rise to tragedy of commons effects and serious congestion problems. In this paper, we study generic scenarios, where some nonexcludable finite resource is of interest to a population of distributed users with variable perceptions about the resource supply and demand for it. The high-level question we address is how efficiently the competition about the resources is resolved under different assumptions about the way the users make their decisions. The users are first viewed as strategic perfectly informed software agents that make fully rational decisions attempting to minimize the cost of accessing the acquired resource. We then exploit insights from experimental economics and cognitive psychology to model agents of bounded rationality who either do not possess perfect information or cannot exploit all the available information due to time restrictions and computational limitations. We derive the operational states in which the competing influences are balanced (ie, equilibria) and compare them against the Nash equilibria that emerge under full rationality and the optimum resource assignment that could be determined by a centralized entity.

A key challenge in using probabilistic flooding is the determination of the forwarding probability so that global network outreach is achieved while keeping the message overhead as low as possible. By showing that a probabilistic flooding network generated by applying probabilistic flooding to a connected random graph network can be bounded by properly parameterized random graph networks and invoking random graph theory results, bounds on the value of the forwarding probability are derived guaranteeing global network outreach with high probability, while significantly reducing the message \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Audio and video communication over the wired Internet is already popular and has an increasing degree of penetration to the Internet users. The rapid development of broadband wireless networks, such as wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), third generation (3G) and fourth generation (4G) cellular networks, will probably result in an even more intensive penetration of multimedia-based services. The provision of multimedia-based services over the wired Internet presents significant technical challenges, since these services require Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees from the underlying wired network. In the case of wireless networks these challenges are even greater due to the characteristics of a wireless environment, such as: highly dynamic channel characteristics; high burst error rates and resulting packet losses; limited bandwidth; delays due to handoffs in case of user mobility.In Section 3.2, we present a classification of the media types (discrete and continuous media), and the multimedia-based services (non real-time and real-time). The requirements of the multimedia services for preserving the intra-media and inter-media synchronizations\u2013which are quite challenging over packet-switched networks\u2013are also discussed. A short discussion on Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding and the transmission of VBR content over CBR channels follows. In Section 3.3, we classify the real-time multimedia based services into three categories (one-way streaming, on demand delivery and conversational communication) and present their specific QoS requirements.

In this paper we propose an enhancement to the random walk with choice by considering a new metric that captures not only the actual visits to a given node, but also the intensity of the visits to the neighbourhood of the node. We compare the random walk with choice with its enhanced counterpart. Simulation results show a significant improvement in cover time, maximum node load and load balancing, mainly in random geometric graphs.",

The proposed detection engine is deployed at each node and performs detection using a set of specifications, which describe the correct operation of the MAC protocol operating at the host node. The proposed engine introduces a number of significant advantages since it can effectively detect both known and unknown attacks in real time and with minimum overhead.

Typically, the platforms that host these communities engage autonomous users and deliver a utility that depends on the participants' number and behaviors. In this respect, the challenge for platform designers is to engage people into mechanisms of active contribution and collaboration.In this deliverable, we investigate different dimensions inherent in these platforms bringing in front the composite socio-psychological incentives that motivate participation, privacy issues and the market viewpoint that may apply to them. We first review formal definitions of virtual communities and related research that introduces criteria for classification of various virtual community paradigms. Relative inputs from theories on the broader context of collective action, public goods' management and social dilemmas have also been accommodated. We then identify and discuss incentives and social mechanisms that are activated in different types of virtual communities, drawing insights and results from social psychology literature and studies on online communities. Finally, we examine existing communities with specific focus on the exposed mechanisms that can affect positively or negatively people's behavior and, ultimately, impact on the \u2026",

Protocols studied include the following: Plain Flooding (PF), Standard Link State (SLS), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Hierarchical Link State (HierLS), Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP), and Hazy Sighted Link State (HSLS). It is shown that PF and ZRP scale better with mobility, SLS and ZRP scale better with respect to traffic, and HSLS scales better with respect to network size. The analysis provides deeper understanding of the limits and trade-offs inherent in mobile ad hoc network routing. Our analysis is complemented with a simulation experiment comparing HSLS and HierLS. An important contribution of this paper is that HSLS is an scalable, easy-to-implement, alternative to hierarchical approaches for large ad hoc networks.",

            "Abstract": "In order to support location-based services, vehicles share their location with a server to receive relevant data. Revealing a vehicle\u2019s location compromises its privacy. One way to reduce this problem is obfuscating the vehicle\u2019s location by adding artificial noise. However, this increases the area where the true location of the vehicle may be. Hence, under limited available bandwidth, the server will provide fewer data relevant to the vehicle\u2019s true location, reducing the effectiveness of the location-based service.

Through such Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperation, the impact of location obfuscation is mitigated.

The model assumes a mobile sink passing near the sensors, and asking the sensors to transmit their data.

This paper presents various algorithms that revises this standard behavior and attempts to be more selective in choosing the caches that gets to store a local copy of the requested document.

The Centralized Ad-Hoc Network Architecture (CANA) proposed in this article aims at increasing substantially the capacity of traditional Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). It is based on a dual frequency system in which the operation in the original WLAN frequency supports the centralization of some of the traditionally distributed and problematic adhoc functionalities enabled at the new frequency; higherrate, shorter-range, peer-to-peer and multi-hop transmissions are possible at the new frequency, resulting in a significant increase of the WLAN capacity. In order to take advantage of the extra capacity, modifications are defined and described by exploring the HiperLAN/2 standard. The gain of the induced dual mode of operation depends on several parameters that define the performance of CANA. This article explores the performance issues that CANA arises by providing both analytical and simulation results. The overhead of CANA is rather low if one takes into account the profits of such architecture.",

One of the major challenges in this emerging highly user-centric networking paradigm is how to make these exploding in numbers yet, individually, of vanishing demand services available in a cost-effective manner. Of prime importance to the latter (and focus of this paper) is the determination of the optimal location for hosting a UCS. Taking into account the particular characteristics of UCS, we formulate the problem as a facility location problem and devise a distributed and highly scalable heuristic solution to it. Key to the proposed approach is the introduction of a novel metric drawing on Complex Network Analysis. Given a current location of UCS, this metric helps to a) identify a small subgraph of nodes with high capacity to act as service demand concentrators; b) project on them a reduced yet accurate view of the global demand distribution that preserves the key attraction forces on UCS; and, ultimately, c) pave the service migration path towards its optimal location in the network. The proposed iterative UCS migration algorithm, called cDSMA, is extensively evaluated over synthetic and real-world network topologies. Our results show that cDSMA achieves high accuracy, fast convergence, remarkable insensitivity to the size and diameter of the network and resilience to inaccurate estimates of demands for UCS across the network.

            "Abstract": "The position of the nodes within a network topology largely determines the level of their involvement in various networking functions. Yet numerous node centrality indices, proposed to quantify how central individual nodes are in this respect, yield very different views of their relative significance. Our first contribution in this paper is then an exhaustive survey and categorization of centrality indices along several attributes including the type of information (local vs. global) and processing complexity required for their computation. We next study the seven most popular of those indices in the context of Internet vulnerability to address issues that remain under-explored in literature so far. First, we carry out a correlation study to assess the consistency of the node rankings those indices generate over ISP router-level topologies. For each pair of indices, we compute the full ranking correlation, which is the standard choice in literature, and the percentage overlap between the k top nodes. Then, we let these rankings guide the removal of highly central nodes and assess the impact on both the connectivity properties and traffic-carrying capacity of the network. Our results confirm that the top-k overlap predicts the comparative impact of indices on the network vulnerability better than the full-ranking correlation. Importantly, the locally computed degree centrality index approximates closely the global indices with the most dramatic impact on the traffic-carrying capacity; whereas, its approximative power in terms of connectivity is more topology-dependent.",

Nevertheless, they are relatively slow in reaching out to the network nodes, particularly when applied to wireless networks (such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)), where the steps of the walk are of limited range, they reach only physically-close neighbours and are unable to move the walker far away from just covered area; as a consequence, time and resources are wasted in revisits of already covered nodes. In this paper we develop an innovative mechanism (referred to as the Jumping Random Walk (J-RW)) that alleviates drastically the aforementioned problems and is shown to improve substantially (compared to the RW) the cover time/overhead or coverage of WSNs modelled as a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "With the accelerated growth of the social networking platforms the largest source of data on the Internet today is user generated. Following similar ways as with the user generated content, end-users are increasingly prompt to create a rich ecosystem of service instances that necessitates the distributed and scalable treatment to the fundamental problem of their optimal placement. To cope with the lack of global network topology and service demand information, typically required by a centralized approach, we propose an iterative scalable service migration mechanism that moves each service instance to prominent locations resembling a local search approach. Each neighborhood of service host candidates is selected with respect to a node centrality metric (wCBC) that captures the capacity of a node to act as service demand concentrator under shortestpath routing. The same metric, correctly tuned, help us project the demand generated by the rest of the network nodes on the selected neighborhood over which a small-scale 1-median determines the next best solution. First we provide theoretical insights for our migration heuristic and conduct a proof-of-concept study under the hypothesis of feasible centrality computations. Its advantages against typical local search schemes and effectiveness already with minimal size of the selected neighborhood, are demonstrated over both synthetic and real-world topologies. Then, we exploit the straightforward wCBC interpretation and propose a distributed practical implementation that uses passive measurements of transit traffic to determine each migration hop.

Since the networks presence and available capacities change rapidly and in an unforeseen manner (because of changing conditions due the uncertainty in car movement, data transmission needs and network characteristics), the efficiency of such a planning may be severely compromised. Consequently, mechanisms that determine the deviation from the foreseen conditions are derived in this paper, which modify the transmission plan depending on the type of deviation observed.

We find that the Nash equilibrium predicts reasonably well the competition for the convenient parking when it has few spots, but not when it has more availability. We then show that the Rosenthal equilibrium, a bounded-rational approach, is a better description of the experimental results accounting for the randomness in the decision process.

We study such concerns by considering a group of independent, rational, self-aware nodes that cooperate using on-line caching algorithms, where the exposed resource is the storage of each node. Motivated by content networking applications\u2013including web caching, CDNs, and P2P\u2013this paper extends our previous work on the off-line version of the problem, which was limited to object replication and was conducted under a game-theoretic framework. We identify and investigate two causes of mistreatment:(1) cache state interactions (due to the cooperative servicing of requests) and (2) the adoption of a common scheme for cache replacement/redirection/admission policies. Using analytic models, numerical solutions of these models, as well as simulation experiments, we show that online cooperation schemes using caching are fairly robust to mistreatment caused by state interactions. When this becomes possible, the interaction through the exchange of miss-streams has to be very intense, making it feasible for the mistreated nodes to detect and react to the exploitation. This robustness ceases to exist when nodes fetch and store objects in response to remote requests, ie, when they operate as Level-2 caches (or proxies) for other nodes. Regarding mistreatment due to a common scheme, we show that this can easily take place when the \u201coutlier\u201d characteristics of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Mobile Ad Hoc Networks are susceptible to a variety of attacks that threaten their operation and the provided services. Intrusion Detection Systems may act as defensive mechanisms, since they monitor network activities in order to detect malicious actions performed by intruders. Anomaly-based detection engines are a topic of ongoing interest in the research community, due to their advantage in detecting unknown attacks. However, this advantage is offset by a number of limitations such as high rates of false alarms, imposition of processing overhead, lack of adaptability under dynamic network conditions etc. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the most recent literature in the area of anomaly detection for MANETs. The provided weaknesses and limitations, which are thoroughly examined in this paper, constitute open issues in the area of MANET security and will drive future \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Access to a common (communication) resource has been one of the fundamental problems in the various networking technologies that have emerged over the last half a century. Among those, the problem of accessing a common resource by distributed, non-communicating users (i.e., through an uncoordinated approach) has been a central one and has received wide attention since the appearance of the ALOHA approach. The lack of coordination brings some advantages or keeps complexity low, but it also incurs some cost in terms of resource capacity waste and reduced throughput. Recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have enabled the generation and dissemination of vast amounts of information that enhance awareness about the environment and its resources. While such resource awareness brings benefits, it also intensifies competition and results in potentially significant \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Scalable service placement is a challenging problem in dynamic environments such as ad hoc or autonomic networks. Existing approaches typically consider static and reduced size networking environments and try to determine the optimal service position (the node at which some cost is minimized) by solving the 1-median problem. Since such approaches are complex and are based on global information knowledge, they are nonscalable and cannot cope with dynamic environments. A more reasonable approach to service placement for large, ad hoc and autonomic environments would be through service migration. That is, instead of solving continuously a large optimization problem requiring global information, consider policies for moving the service position (one hop/node at a time) based on local information, towards more effective positions. Developing service migration policies with good properties is a major challenge, since such policies may be sub-optimal (that is, they never converge to the optimal position), follow a non-monotonically cost decreasing path to the optimal position, etc. In this paper, the aforementioned issues are discussed and a simple service migration policy is proposed for undirected tree topologies. For this case it is shown analytically that the information available at the current service node only is sufficient for determining the direction towards nodes with monotonically decreasing service provision costs. Consequently, the proposed policy moves the service continuously towards the optimal position in every step and reaches the optimal position through a shortest path migration trajectory. As the optimal position \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The proliferation of wireless sensor networks supports nowadays numerous areas of everyday life and activities. Each sensor node senses some data of interest (eg, humidity, temperature) and the corresponding measurements need to be tagged with the reference time (usually sink node\u2019s time) they took place, in order to be further analyzed. Given that clocks deviate, time synchronization is a challenging problem in this network environment. In this paper, the focus is on synchronizing the particular measurements in a per hop basis as they are transmitted encapsulated in data packets towards the sink node, instead of synchronizing the node clocks, thus, inducing no extra overhead. In this direction, a synchronization algorithm is proposed here based on MAC layer time stamping. Analytical results regarding the average time deviation and the corresponding variance under the proposed algorithm show a dependency on the residual time (ie, the time period a data packet remains with a node), the distance (ie, the number of hops between the sink node and the sensor node that sensed the data initially) and the average skew deviation value. The effectiveness of the algorithm as well as the validation of the analytical results are demonstrated thoroughly using simulation results.",

In such settings, especially when deployed in outdoor environments with limited external control, energy consumption and robustness are challenging problems for the system\u2019s operation. In the present paper, a drone-assisted wireless sensor network is studied, the aim being to coordinate the routing of information (among the ground nodes and its propagation to the drone), investigating several drone trajectories or route shapes and examining their impact on information collection (the aim being to minimize transmissions and consequently, energy consumption). The main contribution lies on the proposed algorithms that coordinate the communication between (terrestrial) sensor nodes and the drone that may follow different route shapes. It is shown through simulations using soft random geometric graphs that the number of transmitted messages for each drone route shape depends on the rotational symmetry around the center of each shape. An interesting result is that the higher the order of symmetry, the lower the number of transmitted messages for data collection. Contrary, for those cases that the order of symmetry is the same, even for different route shapes, similar number of messages is transmitted. In addition to the simulation results, an experimental demonstration, using spatial data from grit bin locations, further validates the proposed solution under real-world conditions, demonstrating \u2026",

However, the distributed and cooperative nature of routing in such networks makes them vulnerable to a variety of attacks. This paper proposes a host-based monitoring mechanism, called SIDE that safeguards the operation of the AODV routing protocol. SIDE encompasses two complementary functionalities: (i) a specification-based detection engine for the AODV routing protocol, and (ii) a remote attestation procedure that ensures the integrity of a running SIDE instance. The proposed mechanism operates on a trusted computing platform that provides hardware-based root of trust and cryptographic acceleration, used by the remote attestation procedure, as well as protection against runtime attacks. A key advantage of the proposed mechanism is its ability to effectively detect both \u2026",

This control is typically based only on the characteristics of the particular (tagged) traffic stream and would fail to optimally adjust to non-nominal network conditions such as overload. In this paper, a dynamic regulation and scheduling (dynamic-R&S) scheme is proposed whose regulation function is modulated by both the tagged stream's characteristics and information capturing the state of the coexisting applications as provided by the scheduler. The performance of the proposed scheme-versus an equivalent static one-is investigated under both underload and overload traffic conditions. The substantially better throughput/jitter characteristics of the dynamic-R&S scheme are established.",

To study the effect of buffering and playout adaptation, we present an analytical model based on the M/G/1 queueing system with finite buffer capacity, and traffic intensity equal to or greater than unity. This model fits well a range of new applications that have limited buffer resources for the reception of incoming frames. We introduce the variance of distortion of playout (VDoP), a new metric that accounts for the overall presentation disruption caused by buffer underflows, intentionally introduced gaps during slowdown periods and data loss from overflows. VDoP is an elegant and fair metric for the estimation of playout quality and will hopefully assist the development of better adaptation algorithms \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are typically bound to operate autonomously on a field, under severe energy constraints and without any centralized control. It is thus essential to develop self organization protocols/algorithms which enable the autonomous, distributed and energy efficient network self organization. Budget based clustering approaches have recently been proposed for this purpose, by specifying rules for distributing a given budget of tokens to neighbors. In this paper, two strictly localized, budget based clustering algorithms are pro posed: the directed budget based (DBB) and directed budget based with random delays (DBB-RD). The basic, innovative idea is to utilize clustering status information that can be readily available (e.g. through the HELLO exchanges) to reduce or eliminate token distribution contentions (both intra and inter cluster) that severely limit the effectiveness of earlier budget based \u2026",

We first discuss traffic engineering techniques inside a single domain. We show that by using a non-linear programming formulation of the traffic engineering problem it is possible to meet the requirements of demanding customer traffic, while optimising the use of network resources, through the means of an automated provisioning system.

The introduced analysis allows for a differentiation between the source of the message and the intermediate nodes (in terms of e.g. transmission power, speed or cooperation degree). Analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the delivery delay and the induced overhead are extracted, taking into account the fact that the source node may continue spreading copies after the message delivery. In addition, a fairly accurate approximate expression for the cdf of the delivery delay is also derived and validated through simulations.",

It is observed that the cover time of many of already existing random walk based variants is large in random geometric graphs of low degree (as it is commonly the case is wireless environments).

This success has motivated the application of the theory for delay-related QoS too. However, up until now this application has been justified only heuristically for queues with variable service rate. The paper fills this gap by establishing rigorously that the effective bandwidth/capacity theory may be used for the asymptotically correct calculation and enforcement of delay tail-probabilities in systems with variable rate servers too.

Instead, a distributed management of the engaged autonomic entities, which take decisions dynamically, should be key to efficient content distribution.

In recent work of ours we identified mistreatment as a potentially serious problem for nodes participating in such cooperative caching arrangements. Mistreatment materializes when a node\u2019s access cost for fetching objects worsens as a result of cooperation. To that end, we outlined an emulation-based framework for the development of mistreatment-resilient distributed selfish caching schemes.

            "Abstract": "Time synchronization is a challenging problem for wireless sensor networks, as clocks deviate and sensor measurements need to be associated with the reference clock time they took place. In Internet of Things (IoT) environments, crucial factors like energy, robustness, limited capabilities and extreme ambient conditions (e.g., when nodes are deployed in soil) lead researchers to consider various schemes of relaxing the synchronization requirements. In this paper, a lightweight synchronization algorithm is proposed for wireless sensor networks, focusing on synchronizing the particular measurements in a per hop basis as they are transmitted encapsulated in data packets towards the sink node. The aim is to synchronize data measurements instead of node clocks, and thereby, induce negligible extra overhead, since extra messages and re-synchronization periods are not required.

            "Abstract": "A nomadic sensor network consists of: (a) sensor nodes, that are fixed at some points and collect information about states or variables of the environment, and (b) mobile nodes that collect and disseminate this information. Mobile nodes usually belong to different classes, and are thus interested in different subsets of sensor node information. In such networks, dissemination of information content at smaller costs can be achieved if mobile nodes are cooperative and collect and carry information not only in their own interest, but also in the interest of other mobile nodes. A specific modeling scenario is considered in this paper where the network has the form of a graph; sensor nodes are located on the vertices of the graph and U-nodes move along the edges according to a random waypoint model. We present a game-theoretic analysis to find conditions under which a cooperative equilibrium can be sustained.",

Since applications may have very different quality of service (QoS) requirements, a performance measure associated with a random cell would not necessarily reveal the impact of multiplexing on the QoS of a specific application. For this reason, it is important that the traffic stream of interest be tagged and its distortion due to multiplexing be evaluated; for analysis purposes the co-existing traffic is aggregated and forms the background traffic. In the past studies the background traffic has been assumed to be uncorrelated and be diverted after a single multiplexing stage.The objective in this work is to evaluate the impact of temporal and spatial correlations on the end-to-end performance of a tagged traffic stream. Such correlations can be significant due to temporal correlation in the background traffic \u2026",

However, there are many cases in which the mobile station receives AVs that have not been previously used, but the employed mechanism rejects them as outdated. This phenomenon, called false synchronization, causes signaling overhead and delays, and increases the cost of the network use. False synchronizations are more frequent in 3G-WLAN integrated networks. The frequency of false synchronizations decreases with \u03b1, while at the same time the risk of a replay attack increases.

In particular, a video segmentation scheme called variable chunk size is presented. This scheme uses the request frequencies to dynamically adjust the size of the chunk and it is shown to be capable of combining a high BHR (byte hit ratio) with small response time to demand changes. Video segmentation is also considered as a mechanism to provide for caching differentiation based on access costs. By employing access cost dependent chunk sizes, an overall access cost reduction is demonstrated.",

As centralized solutions over large-scale distributed environments are extremely expensive, inefficient or even infeasible, distributed approaches that rely on partial topology and demand information are the only credible approaches to the service placement problem, even at the expense of non-guaranteed optimality. In this paper, we propose a distributed service migration heuristic that iteratively solves instances of the 1-median problem pushing progressively the service to more cost-effective locations. Key to our algorithm is a traffic-aware centrality metric, called weighted conditional betweenness centrality (wCBC), that captures the ability of a node to act as service demand concentrator and is employed in both selecting the nodes and setting their weights for the 1-median \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cloud gaming architectures have emerged in efforts to provide efficient execution of computer video games in computer machines and mobile devices with low processing/rendering capabilities. Such approaches are prone to network delays since the rendering process is offloaded to the cloud, hence, increasing cloud\u2019s computational needs and decreasing user coverage. To tackle this challenge cloud-edge hybrid gaming systems were proposed in order to reduce network latency and improve user experience. By deploying rendering devices at the edge of the cloud and in close proximity to the end users, cloud-edge hybrid systems aim at augmenting the cloud\u2019s computational capacity and reducing the game\u2019s response time. In current work a preliminary simulation model to evaluate the performance of such systems and test the above hypothesis is presented, showing that cloud-edge hybrid gaming systems are able to outperform conventional cloud gaming architectures in latency reduction.",

The security architecture of NGN specifies that a WLAN user must follow a multi-pass authentication and key agreement (AKA) procedure, in order to get access to the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) services. This includes a repetition of authentication steps and protocols which introduce an unnecessary overhead. This paper presents a one- pass AKA procedure that eliminates the repeated steps without compromising the provided level of security. The presented procedure has minimal impact on the network infrastructure and functionality and does not require any changes to the existing authentication protocols. We investigate the induced performance improvement regarding the user authentication cost of the one-pass over the multi-pass AKA. To this end we consider a simple analytic \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The first panel in WAC2005 focused on the relation between autonomicity and complexity. It is widely believed that autonomicity is a principle that can reduce complexity, but there is also concern that autonomicity itself is complexity-producing. Autonomicity promotes all \u201cself-*\u201d attributes of a system and naturally distributes responsibilities and costs, but it can also bring the system close to a state of \u201canarchy\u201d (modern Greek interpretation of \u201cautonomous\u201d) if not properly handled. It appears that the overall system complexity may increase, but it is distributed and shared (hence, it is potentially easier to manage), in a similar way in which Integrated Circuits encapsulate the increased complexity and hide it from the bigger system. In addition to reducing complexity in the above sense, autonomicity can also help design truly adaptable, self-tuning and \u201call-weather\u201d near-optimal systems, something not possible \u2026",

In this paper, different frequency channels that allow for high data rates within a small transmission range are considered in order to create multiple WPAN environments inside a WLAN cell. The latter environment requires the support of a second mode of operation which introduces additional overhead that may degrade the overall system performance. Certain conditions, under which system performance improvement is achievable, are established here. In particular, an analytical mobility model for WPAN \u2026",

An important objective of the research community has been to devise methods that cope with the variations of the network delay-also called delay jitter-that are an inherent characteristic of best effort networks. Jitter destroys the temporal relationships between periodically transmitted media units, that constitute a real-time media stream, thus hindering the comprehension of the stream. Playout adaptation algorithms undertake the labor of the temporal reconstruction of the stream, which is sometimes referred to as the restoration of its' intrastream synchronization quality.

This paper proposes a security binding mechanism, which reduces the execution of the redundant authentication functions of multi-pass authentications in a simple yet effective and secure manner. To achieve this, the proposed mechanism authenticates a user in the second and third step of a multi-pass authentication, by using the user's authentication credentials of the initial step.

The derived algorithm is also applicable, under a slight modification, in a system where the best effort traffic is absent and is capable of guaranteeing that if it does not find a solution to the CAC problem, then a solution does not exist.

An effective mapping between DiffServ QoS and H/2 parameters is expected to increase the performance of the system while maintaining the QoS constraints.

            "Abstract": "In a delay tolerant network (DTN) the nodes may behave autonomously deciding on their own whether to implement or not the rules of a routing algorithm. In this paper, the effects of node cooperation (or lack of it) are explored for three well-known routing algorithms proposed for DTNs with respect to the message delivery delay and the transmission overhead incurred until message delivery or the termination of the message spreading process. The results show that the sensitivity of the algorithms to the cooperation degree can be high, to the point of making them inferior to algorithms they typically outperform under a fully cooperative environment. Finally, it is demonstrated how a simple mechanism that incorporates the cooperation degree can help improve effectiveness.",

Topology-unaware MAC policies, that allocate slots deterministically or probabilistically have been proposed in the past and evaluated under heavy traffic assumptions. In this paper, the heavy traffic assumption is relaxed and the system throughput achieved by these policies is derived as a function of the traffic load. The presented analysis establishes the conditions and determines the values of the access probability for which the system throughput under the probabilistic policy is not only higher than that under the deterministic policy but it is also close to the maximum achievable, provided that the traffic load and the topology density of the network are known.

Network coverage is analytically investigated here considering multiple random walkers in geometric random graph topologies of various densities. The analytical results derived here are shown to be in accordance with other results in the literature (eg, coverage under multiple random walkers for fully connected network topologies). Moreover, when there exist certain coverage and time constraints (ie, the minimum fraction of network nodes to be covered within a certain time period), the required minimum number of random walkers satisfying these constraints is also analytically derived. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple random walkers for service discovery purposes and support the claims and expectations of the analysis.",

Under C-RAN, the radio elements (e.g., eNB or gNB in 5G) are split into a basic radio part (Distributed Unit, DU), and a pool-able base band processing part (Central Unit, CU). This functional split results in high bandwidth and delay constrained traffic flows between DUs and CUs (referred to as fronthaul), calling for the deployment of a specialized network to accommodate them or for integrating them with the rest of the flows (referred to as backhaul) over the existing infrastructure. This work studies the next generation of transport networks, which aims at integrating fronthaul and backhaul traffic over the same transport stratum.

The effectiveness of such a data collection approach can be measured in terms of the sensor energy conserved and the time required to collect the sensor data from the field (or, equivalently, the length of the trajectory implemented by the mobile sink). In this paper we explore two important dimensions in the design of mobile sink-based data collection schemes. One dimension refers to how close to the sensor nodes the sink moves to, to collect the data, which impacts on the transmission energy expenditure by the sensor node. The other dimension refers to the way the sink moves through the sensor field, to collect the data, which impacts on the delay in collecting the data.

It is shown, that a higher byte hit ratio (BHR) can be achieved through partial replacement. The price paid for the improved BHR performance is that the replacement algorithm, e.g. LRU, takes a longer time to induce the steady state BHR. It is demonstrated that this problem could be addressed by a hybrid caching scheme that employs variable sized chunks; the use of small chunks leads to the maximization of BHR in periods of stable video popularity, while large chunks are used when extreme popularity changes occur to assist the fast convergence to the new steady state BHR.",

Each node locally replicates a subset of the server objects, and can access objects stored by other nodes at a smaller cost. In a network with autonomous nodes, the problem is to construct efficient distributed algorithms for content replication that decrease the access cost for all nodes. Such a network also has to deal with churn, i.e. random \u201cjoin\u201d and \u201cleave\u201d events of nodes in the group. Churn induces instability and has a major impact on cooperation efficiency.

In such setting, we identified the problem of a node being mistreated, i.e., its access cost for fetching information objects becoming worse with cooperation than without. We identified two causes of mistreatment: (1) the use of a common caching scheme which controls whether a node should not rely on other nodes in the group by keeping its own local copy of the object once retrieved from the group; and (2) the state interaction that can take place when the miss-request streams from \u2026",

There exists an initiator node that starts a round of searches by randomly querying one or more of its neighbors for a desired object. The queried nodes can also be activated and look for the object. We examine several behavioural patterns of nodes with respect to their willingness to cooperate in the search. We derive mathematical models for the search process based on the balls and bins model, as well as known approximations for the rumour-spreading problem. All models are validated with simulations. We also evaluate the performance of the algorithm and examine the impact of search parameters.",

Drivers decide whether to go for the public or directly for the private facilities, assuming perfect knowledge of prices and costs, total parking capacities and demand; the latter information can be broadcast by an ideal centralized information dissemination mechanism, assisting the otherwise uncoordinated parking search process. Drivers are viewed as strategic decision-makers that aim at minimizing the cost of the acquired parking spot.

Here, an adaptive probabilistic policy for medium access control in ad hoc networks, inspired by the Aloha paradigm, is proposed and analyzed. Simulation results show that this policy is capable of achieving higher system throughput when compared to other policies that have been proposed for ad hoc networks. It is also shown that mobility severely impacts the system throughput and therefore, an alternative approach is proposed that reduces the effects of mobility in the expense of the maximum achievable system throughput.",

In this paper, the problem of determining the optimal location of a service facility is revisited and addressed in a way that is both scalable and deals inherently with network dynamicity. In particular, service migration which enables service facilities to move between neighbor nodes towards more communication cost-effective positions, is based on local information.

The realization of sensor networks to improve the efficiency of nearly every aspect of our daily lives by enhancing the human-to-physical world interaction is one of the most exciting potential sensor network applications utilizing these intelligent sensor nodes. However, this objective necessitates the efficient and application specific communication protocols to assure the reliable communication of the sensed event features and hence enable the required actions to be taken by the actors in the smart environment.

In this paper the performance of a WLAN employing the peer to peer networking paradigm is studied via simulations; the results indicate that the direct application of the peer to peer networking paradigm in a WLAN leads to a substantially decreased throughput for the traffic directed to the Access Point (AP). The study also reveals that the cumulative receiving throughput of nodes located at the periphery of relatively small circular areas around the AP is substantially higher. Thus, the capacity of the multihop cellular network may be enhanced by employing the peer to peer paradigm only outside a circular area around the AP and the cellular paradigm inside this circular area.

Communities in such networks are mainly formed by user selection, which may be based on various factors such as acquaintance, social status, educational background. However, such selection may result in groups that have a low degree of similarity. The proposed framework could improve the effectiveness of these social networks by constructing clusters of nodes with higher interest similarity, and thus maximize the benefit that users extract from their participation. The framework is based on methods for detecting communities over weighted graphs, where graph edge weights are defined based on measures of similarity between nodes' interests in certain thematic areas.

It is shown that a higher byte hit ratio (BHR) can be achieved by appropriately adjusting the replacement granularity. The price paid for the improved BHR performance is that the replacement algorithm takes a longer time to converge to the steady state BHR. For the segmentation of video into chunks two methods are presented.

Service migration is incorporated in the Chord P2P system, imposing certain changes (e.g., the extension of the service discovery scheme of Chord) and introducing an extra system overhead (i.e., update messages) for the efficient operation of the (enhanced) system.

Under probabilistic flooding, an information message, initially located at some network node (i.e., the initiator node), is transmitted to neighbor nodes according to a forwarding probability attempting to reach all network nodes. This paper employs elements from algebraic graph theory to model probabilistic flooding behavior and derive analytical results regarding coverage (i.e., the number of nodes that have received the information message) and a lower bound of the forwarding probability allowing for global network outreach.

            "Abstract": "Transmission resources in a communication network are often shared among a population of distributed users by means of medium access control (MAC). Contention-based multiple access is a method for medium access control, wherein collisions of packets transmitted by different users are not completely avoided. Should a collision occur, it is resolved in accordance with a predetermined collision resolution algorithm. A protocol for contention-based multiple access typically resolves collisions by using simple binary (success and no success) or ternary (idle, success, and collision) feedback on the outcome of contention. Collisions are typically resolved by requiring each user involved in the collision to backoff a number of slots before attempting retransmission. In general, each retransmission is postponed until aParameter estimators, in general, make use of sample observations to determine the values of the parameters to be estimated. The presence of erroneous or misleading sample observations can therefore lead to an unreliable estimation. Methods for identifying and handling sample observations are essential in many estimation problems.",

            "Abstract": "It is well established that increased network transmission speed reduces the effectiveness of feedback-based adaptive rate control mechanisms, due to the increased bandwidth propagation delay product. In this environment, differences in the propagation delays associated with the controlled sources become larger when measured in slots (transmission time of information unit), potentially inducing substantially diversified performance metrics. One of the objectives in this work is to quantify the potential unfairness as well as the reduced effectiveness of this rate control scheme in the presence of non-zero propagation delays. As the network speed increases, it is also expected that traffic sources will seem to be slower due to the relative increase of the information generation time and/or the decrease of the portion of the bandwidth required by a specific source. The other objective in this work is to investigate and \u2026",

In cases where network resource planning indicates that individual access network resources are insufficient to meet service demands, these networks can cooperate and combine their resources to form a unified network that satisfies these demands. We introduce and study the Network Synthesis game, in which individual access networks with insufficient resources form coalitions in order to satisfy service demands. The formation of stable coalitions in the core of the game is investigated, in both cases where payoffs are transferable or are attributed in proportion to the contribution of each member of the coalition.

The realization of sensor networks to improve the efficiency of nearly every aspect of our daily lives by enhancing the human-to-physical world interaction is one of the most exciting potential sensor network applications utilizing these intelligent sensor nodes. However, this objective necessitates the efficient and application specific communication protocols to assure the reliable communication of the sensed event features and hence enable the required actions to be taken by the actors in the smart environment. In this session, the challenges and the existing solutions for the design and development of sensor network communication protocols are presented. More specifically, application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer, in particular, error control and MAC protocols, and physical layer issues as well as the localization protocols and the time synchronization algorithms are discussed in detail. Open research issues for sensor networks are also presented which will be outlined below.",

As such approaches are clearly not scalable in dynamic and large-scale environments, a more reasonable approach to service placement for large, ad hoc and autonomic environments would be through service migration. Such a migration policy has recently been proposed for tree topologies. The focus of the present paper is to devise effective service migration policies for general topologies with equal weight links. The proposed strategy - that incorporates a 2-phase polling mechanism of local scope and, consequently, induces in general a certain overhead - is shown to out-perform the previous one (i.e., getting closer to the optimal placement) for such general topologies. Finally, a hybrid migration policy (combining the present and the past ones) is \u2026",

Given that nodes are autonomous and independently decide which objects to replicate, the problem is to construct efficient distributed algorithms for content replication that induce low average access cost. This problem becomes even more challenging when the group has to deal with churn, i.e., random \u201cjoin\u201d and \u201cleave\u201d events of nodes in the group; churn induces instability and has a major impact on cooperation efficiency.

The modified caching behavior is called Leave Copy Down (LCD); it has the merit of being able to avoid the amplification of replacement errors and also the unnecessary repetitious caching of the same objects at multiple levels. Simulation results against other cache interconnections show that when LCD is applied under typical web workloads, it reduces the average hit distance. We construct an approximate analytic model for the case of LCD interconnection of LRU caches and use it to gain a better insight as to why the LCD interconnection yields an improved performance.",

The power of the approach is demonstrated through a detailed application targeting the analysis of a preexisting routing protocol that bases its next hop forwarding decisions on the location and motion of the neighboring nodes. In the considered application the DREOT \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A novel feedback-based rate adaptation scheme is introduced and investigated in this paper. Its main innovative characteristic is the modulation of the rate increment by the distance between a flow\u2019s present rate and an assumed targeted maximum rate as dictated by the associated application. The previous along with the shaping of the rate decrement by the reported flow\u2019s losses are responsible for a dynamic and self-adjusting behavior that is shown to improve convergence to fairness, the oscillatory behavior of the rate and the induced packet losses when compared with the basic Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AI/MD) scheme. Numerical results illustrate the good properties and intrinsic advantages of the proposed scheme both under the considered modeling assumptions, as well as under more real networking conditions by employing the ns-2 simulator. A brief comparison of the proposed scheme \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A plethora of broadband and multimedia services are making their path to our homes, schools and businesses. An emerging shared medium, which is expected to provide this path consists of a combination of optical fibers and coaxial cables. In such networks, referred to as Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (HFC) cable networks, a contention-based reservation Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is commonly used for coordinating channel access. In contention-based MAC protocols, it is critical to adaptively allocate contention bandwidth vis-a-vis an offered load that may vary over time. In practice, the offered load is often not known a priori, but may be estimated based on a history of contention outcomes. The accuracy of offered load estimation, which is essential for a reliable contention bandwidth allocation scheme, can be adversely affected by the presence of outliers or inconsistent observations. In this paper, we show that a method for outlier control can be used to enhance the accuracy of an offered load estimator for a framed slotted ALOHA protocol. The method, which employs contention statistics from ternary feedback to selectively discard outliers when the statistics are determined to be unreliable, is applicable to offered load estimation in a DOCSIS-based HFC cable network.",
