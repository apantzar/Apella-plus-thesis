Especially in the area of computer vision and speech processing, DL has recently demonstrated better performance and generalisation properties, compared to classical machine learning approaches, which are based on the extraction of hand-crafted model-based features followed by classification. Hand gestures and speech constitute two of the most important modalities in human-to-human communication and man-machine interaction. In biomedical engineering, a lot of new work is directed towards electromyography-based gesture recognition. In this paper, we present a brief overview of DL methods for electromyography-based hand gesture recognition and then we select from literature a simple model based on Convolutional Neural Networks that we \u2026",

A longstanding problem of these interfaces is that the models cannot easily be applied to new users due to the high variability and stochastic nature of the electromyography signals. Further training a new model for every new subject requires the collection of large volumes of data. Therefore, this work proposes a transfer learning (TL) scheme which allows reusing the knowledge of a pre-existing model for a new user. Firstly, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on an initial dataset using the data of multiple subjects. Then, the weights of this model are fine-tuned for a new target subject. The approach is evaluated on the Ninapro datasets DB2 and DB7. The experimentation included three different CNN models and eight \u2026",

In line with latest works in the field, the objective of our work is the construction of a novel Convolutional Neural Network architecture, for the classification of hand-gestures. Our model, while avoiding overfitting, did not perform significantly better compared to a much shallower network. The results suggest that the lack of diversity in the sEMG recordings between certain hand-gestures limits the performance of the model. In addition, the classification accuracy on a database we developed using a commercial device (Myo Armband) was substantially higher (approximately 24%) than a similar benchmark dataset recorded with the same device.",

However, motion estimation requires a significant part of the encoding time. One reason is because H. 264 allows motion estimation based on multiple reference frames. In this paper, a new method for fast reference frame selection is proposed. The method performs a simple and quick test prior to motion estimation in order to choose the best reference frame.",

These materials are gradually being digitized, thus giving the possibility for them to be accessed by all interested people from anywhere at any time. Dealing with the digital surrogates of the cultural assets is demanding and continuous work. It starts with the proper digitization of the asset and continues with its preservation. Digital preservation or digital curation is the managed activities necessary for ensuring both the long-term maintenance of digital information and the continued accessibility of its contents. The digital cultural information can be of all types of media, namely text, photographs, prints, plans and maps, drawings, documentaries and films, sound and video recordings, music, philately, microfilms, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, or even three-dimensional (3-D) objects (BCR, 2008; Desrochers and Thurgood, 2007; IST Cultural Heritage, 2005). 1 Digital imagery is likely to be the majority of the digital cultural heritage material. Huge image repositories, along with the associated metadata, constitute the Archival Information System. Such a system should flexibly and reliably allow the producers to ingest a digital asset and the managers to manage it, while it is distributed to the consumers (Figure 14.1).

However, the extent to which HDRi affects privacy when it is used instead of typical Standard Dynamic Range imaging (SDRi) is not yet clear. In this paper, we investigate the effect of HDRi on privacy via crowdsourcing evaluation using the Microworkers platform. Due to the lack of HDRi standard privacy evaluation dataset, we have created such dataset containing people of varying gender, race, and age, shot indoor and outdoor and under large range of lighting conditions. We evaluate the tone-mapped versions of these images, obtained by several representative tone-mapping algorithms, using subjective privacy evaluation methodology. Evaluation was performed using crowdsourcing-based framework, because it is a popular \u2026",

The proposed framework is tailored upon the isomorphism observed between these parameters and the eigenvalues of diffusion tensors. Since such eigenvalues reflect the diffusivity of edge regions, we embed this information in regularization and data fidelity parameters by means of entropy-based, spatially-adaptive `heatmaps'. The latter are able to repel an active contour from randomly directed edge regions and guide it towards structured ones. Experiments are conducted on endoscopic as well as mammographic images. The segmentation results demonstrate that the proposed framework bypasses iterations dedicated to false local minima associated with noise, artifacts and inhomogeneities, speeding up contour \u2026",

The wavelet and Fourier power spectra of the intensity and the velocity at chromospheric levels show both 3 and 5 minute oscillations.

Typically, there are three oscillating modes present:(1) a major one near 5.5 mHz,(2) a secondary near 6.3 mHz, and (3) oscillations with time-varying frequencies around 7.5 mHz that are present for limited time intervals.

In the present work a new blind fragile data hiding technique for secretly embedding messages into color images, is proposed. The embedding procedure is based on dividing each color image component into even-sized blocks. Information embedding is determined by monitoring the lower-right corner of the DPT coefficient matrix. This particular coefficient suffers the highest change for small pixel modifications. The embedding affects the coefficient's sign. In case that the sign is not the desired one, i.e. negative for a message bit value of '0' and positive for a message bit value of '1', it is changed by repeatedly adding to the block or subtracting from the block the identity matrix.

Not only are the algorithmic paradigms changed, but also the performance in various classification and prediction tasks has been significantly improved with respect to the state-of-the-art, especially in the area of computer vision. The progress made in computer vision has produced a spillover in many other domains, such as biomedical engineering. Some recent works are directed towards surface electromyography (sEMG) based hand gesture recognition, often addressed as an image classification problem and solved using tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This paper extends our previous work on the application of the Hilbert space-filling curve for the generation of image representations from multi-electrode sEMG signals, by investigating how the Hilbert curve compares to the Peano-and Z-order space-filling curves. The proposed space-filling mapping methods are evaluated on a variety of network architectures and in some cases yield a classification improvement of at least 3%, when used to structure the inputs before feeding them into the original network architectures.",

            "Abstract": "With the increasing use of multimedia technologies, image compression requires higher performance as well as new features. To address this need in the specific area of still image encoding, a new standard is currently being developed, the JPEG2000. It is not only intended to provide rate-distortion and subjective image quality performance superior to existing standards, but also to provide features and functionalities that current standards can either not address efficiently or in many cases cannot address at all. Lossless and lossy compression, embedded lossy to lossless coding, progressive transmission by pixel accuracy and by resolution, robustness to the presence of bit-errors and region-of-interest coding, are some representative features. It is interesting to note that JPEG2000 is being designed to address the requirements of a diversity of applications, e.g. Internet, color facsimile, printing, scanning, digital \u2026",

Many new technologies have come into our lives along with multimedia and one of the most recent is watermarking. Digital technology has offered users easy ways to create, process, and distribute digital assets. However, these facilities this may become disadvantages at the same time since it is also much easier to illegally copy and manipulate them. In 2000, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has calculated lost revenues for American motion picture companies from worldwide piracy to be of the amount $2.5 billion a year [1]. Copyright protection is a very important subject but not the only one in which watermarking appears as one of the very promising solutions. In this communication, we are attempting to go back to the early beginning of this exciting new research field, make an overview of its history, discuss the applications and stakes involved, classify the proposed methods, present the problems and benchmarking tools and finally, try to peak into the future.",

It enables a non-uniform distribution of the available bit budget (ie image quality) between a selected region (ROI) and the rest of the image (background). This is achieved by appropriate scaling of the background wavelet coefficients. Two different methods are used for ROI coding, the MAXSHIFT method and the scaling-based method. In the present work it is subjectively and objectively verified that ROI coding offers higher diagnostic value for low bit rate (lossy) compression, as opposed to the non-ROI compression of medical images. The MAXSHIFT method, which is included in the baseline algorithm of the standard, proves to be very effective, thus greatly contributing to the use of lossy coding for medical imagery compression.",

This paper builds on a concept of correlation channel (CC) modeling, which expresses the correlation noise as being statistically dependent on the side information (SI). Compared with classical side-information-independent (SII) noise modeling adopted in current DVC solutions, it is theoretically proven that side-information-dependent (SID) modeling improves the Wyner-Ziv coding performance. Anchored in this finding, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for online estimation of the SID CC parameters based on already decoded information. The proposed algorithm enables bit-plane-by-bit-plane successive refinement of the channel estimation leading to progressively improved accuracy.

In order to reduce the computational complexity, a pseudo-pixel extraction algorithm is applied to the four low-frequency DCT coefficients of each block, resulting in a scaled RGB version of the input image (directly in the DCT domain), where the iCAM06 model is then applied. To cope with the problem of inadequate information of small-sized images, as only 6.25% of the DCT coefficients are used, a 2-fold upsampling is performed at a preprocessing stage.

It is fully reversible, that means, the original image can be recovered from the marked image, after the hidden data has been extracted. The technique was first presented by Zhicheng Ni et al. It has large embedding capacity, with very good signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio (PSNR) of the marked image. PSNR is guaranteed to be above 48dB and the actual threshold is much higher than this. The algorithm has successfully been applied to a large number of images. It is also proved that it is a weak embedding algorithm, in which the message embedded is easily damaged by any alteration of the marked image. However, such data hiding techniques have a large number of applications in the areas of image authentication, tamper-proofing and secure medical image data systems.",

This paper proposes a data hiding scheme that uses the discrete Gould transform in order to invisibly embed a secret message. The Gould coefficients represent the differences between neighboring pixels. Small changes of the coefficients generate even smaller changes to the pixels. By this, a high capacity fragile steganographic technique is achieved. The message is easily destroyed after any manipulation, and therefore, its absence can prove that the image has been altered in some way. Because of this property, the proposed technique finds application in image authentication and tamper proofing. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

            "Abstract": "The range of applications of electromyography-based gesture recognition has increased over the last years. A common problem regularly encountered in literature is the inadequate data availability. Data augmentation, which aims at generating new synthetic data from the existing ones, is the most common approach to deal with this data shortage in other research domains. In the case of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, there is limited research in augmentation methods and quite regularly the results differ between available studies. In this work, we provide a detailed evaluation of existing (ie, additive noise, overlapping windows) and novel (ie, magnitude warping, wavelet decomposition, synthetic sEMG models) strategies of data augmentation for electromyography signals. A set of metrics (ie, classification accuracy, silhouette score, and Davies\u2013Bouldin index) and visualizations help with the assessment and provides insights about their performance. Methods like signal magnitude warping and wavelet decomposition yield considerable increase (up to 16%) in classification accuracy across two benchmark datasets. Particularly, a significant improvement of 1% in the classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art model in hand gesture recognition is achieved. View Full-Text",

These techniques provide better performance in terms of computational load compared to traditional algorithms. Although the accuracy of motion compensation is only slightly lower comparing to the other techniques, results in terms of objective quality (peak signal-to-noise ratio) and entropy are comparable. This fact, nominates them as suitable candidates for inclusion in embedded devices applications where lower complexity translates to lower power consumption and consequently improved device autonomy.",

            "Abstract": "One of the aims of the standardization committee has been the development of Part I, which could be used on a royalty- and fee-free basis. This is important for the standard to become widely accepted. The standardization process, which is coordinated by the JTCI/SC29/WG1 of the ISO/IEC has already produced the international standard (IS) for Part I. In this article the structure of Part I of the JPFG 2000 standard is presented and performance comparisons with established standards are reported. This article is intended to serve as a tutorial for the JPEG 2000 standard. The main application areas and their requirements are given. The architecture of the standard follows with the description of the tiling, multicomponent transformations, wavelet transforms, quantization and entropy coding. Some of the most significant features of the standard are presented, such as region-of-interest coding, scalability, visual weighting \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Texture classification is mainly used for segmentation of texture regions and content-based access to image databases. Lately these texture classification patterns have been applied in an additional area of computer science, the data hiding field. In this paper the use of Rotation-Invariant Local Binary Pattern (LBPROT) is described, in order to invisibly embed secret data into a cover image. Pixel values are modified in such a way that the texture satisfies the message requirements. The method is presented and studied in terms of capacity, image quality and robustness to geometrical attacks. This semi-blind data hiding scheme in spatial domain, was proven to be robust only in rotation attack, strictly rotated by angles of k\u03c0/2. The LBPROT method is compared to the Local Binary Pattern (LBP), which is also used for data hiding. Comparison revealed that both LBPROT and LBP schemes perform well in images with smooth areas and can be used for authentication and secret communications.",

            "Abstract": "A novel approach for color image watermarking is proposed in this communication. The aim of the work is to combine robust and fragile watermarking in order to construct a multipurpose watermarking scheme. Watermarking methods are com-plementing each other such that under any circumstance at least one of them may survive and prove the identity of the owner or the authenticity of the image content. A robust watermark is embedded into the frequency domain; the watermark is made adaptive to the cover image. A semi-fragile watermark is embedded into the spatial domain of the color image. Authentication is achieved by means of embedding an approximation of the image into itself. Specifically, the luminance of the image is inserted into the three color channels, using a mapping function. For image copyright protection, higher robustness can be achieved whereas for image authentication tampered regions can be detected and reconstructed. Both of the goals are accomplished in an oblivious manner. Experimental verifications indicate that the proposed unified image watermarking is an appropriate choice.",

It offers a wide range of functionalities such as lossless and lossy coding, embedded lossy to lossless coding, progression by resolution and quality, high compression efficiency, error resilience and region-of-interest (ROI) coding. Comparative results have shown that JPEG2000 is indeed superior to established image compression standards. Overall, the JPEG2000 standard offers the richest set of features in a very efficient way and within a unified algorithm.

We computed line-of-sight velocities based on Becker's cloud model and we determined the components of the flow velocity vector as a function of distance from the center of the sunspot, assuming an axial symmetry of both the spot and the flow. We found that the flow velocity decreases with decreasing height and that the maximum of the velocity shifts towards the inner penumbral boundary. The flow related to some fibrils deviates significantly from the average Evershed flow. The profile of the magnitude of the flow velocity as a function of distance from the spot center, indicates that the velocity attains its maximum value in the downstream part of the flow channels (assumed to have the form of a loop). This behavior can be understood in terms of a critical flow that pass from subsonic to supersonic near \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Falls can be severe enough to cause disabilities especially to frail populations. Thus, prompt health care provision is essential to prevent and restore any harm. The purpose of this study is to develop a smartphone-based fall detection system that can distinguish between falls and activities of daily living (ADL). The typical fall detection system consists of a sensing component and a notification module. Android devices, equipped with sensors and communication services, are the best candidates for the development of such systems. This work incorporates a threshold based algorithm, whose accuracy is enhanced by a k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. In addition, this paper proposes the implementation of a personalization and power regulation system. It achieves high fall detection accuracy, (97.53% sensitivity and 94.89% specificity), which is comparable to related works.",

SolO will allow close-up and high-latitude studies of our mother star, the Sun, based mostly on remote-sensing measurements (imaging). STIX is a critical SolO instrument, enabling one of its major science goals: understanding and acceleration of electrons at the Sun and their transport into interplanetary space. The attenuator, or shutter, that will be developed by the Greek team, is a critical component of the STIX instrument. Attenuators are dictated by the substantial dynamical range of incident X-ray fluxes from solar flares: the largest X-ray flares can give as many as 10 5  more count rates in X-ray photons \u2026",

Use of key-dependent transforms has been proposed as an extra level of security for these schemes while providing at the same time the ability to distribute different levels of quality to different customers. The major drawback of such schemes, is the computational complexity, both in the generation of such transforms and making them orthogonal. The proposed scheme, creates a modified DCT basis based on a secret key, which is approximately orthogonalized by means of a fast and simple algorithm. The method is very useful in cases of JPEG input images, since it can be applied directly into the compressed domain. The main focus here is both on speed issues as well as on the fact that only authorized users can enjoy the best quality from the marked medium.",

This paper presents a novel technique which enables side-information refinement after DC coefficient band decoding in a transform-domain Wyner-Ziv video codec. The proposed side-information refinement approach performs overlapped block motion estimation and compensation, utilizing multi-hypothesis pixel-based prediction. The experimental results show that the presented Wyner-Ziv video codec incorporating the proposed technique yields significant and systematic compression gains of up to 23.22% with respect to the state-of-the-art DISCOVER codec.",

Moreover, the method exhibits the useful property of reusing the compressed stream for hiding different data numerous times without considerably affecting either the bit-rate or the perceptual quality. This property allows data hiding directly in the compressed stream in real time. The method perfectly suits to covert communication and content authentication applications. ",

Since digital images can be published in the Internet, anyone can access and manipulate them. Such kind of manipulations (attacks) falls in one of the following categories:(a) those applied without malicious purposes and (b) those applied with the aim of removing or destroying the watermark. Our model recovers geometric transformations (ie rotation, scaling, translation or a combination of them). Geometric transformations are considered as some of the basic attacks in digital watermarking in both of the above-mentioned cases. The model focuses not on the watermarking method, but rather on the detector\u2019s capabilities. This is achieved by selecting several regions in an attacked watermarked image, which hold sufficient information about the watermark, and trying to apply an inverse operation in order to extract the watermark. It is assumed that one or more watermarks are spread in the image. An analysis of the attack methods has given the information about the effectiveness of every function or combination of functions in the watermarked material, the amount of data needed in order to represent such an operation and the possibility of an operation to be inverted. By means of all this information we can give a solution to the blind image registration problem in watermarking of digital images, ie the process of inverting the distortion of the attack with the aim to detect the watermark.",

Falls, the leading cause of injury among elderly, are usually severe enough to require immediate medical attention; thus, their detection is of primary importance. To this effect, many fall detection systems that utilize wearable and ambient sensors have been proposed. In this study, we compare three newly proposed data fusion schemes that have been applied in human activity recognition and fall detection. Furthermore, these algorithms are compared to our recent work regarding fall detection in which only one type of sensor is used. The results show that fusion algorithms differ in their performance, whereas a machine learning strategy should be preferred. In conclusion, the methods presented and the comparison of their performance provide useful insights into the problem of fall detection. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "In this paper a watermarking algorithm for digital images is presented. The method operates in the multi-resolution Hadamard transform domain. The watermark is constructed as a normally distributed random vector and is inserted into the perceptually most significant spectral components of the image. It is found that insertion of watermark under these conditions makes the watermark robust to image processing and common geometric operations. By exploiting the statistical properties of the embedded sequence, the mark can be found without using the original image. The algorithm is benchmarked against StirMark and compared to an escrow watermarking technique.",

Among all modules in the encoder, motion estimation plays a key role since it can significantly affect the output quality of an encoded sequence. However, motion estimation requires a significant part of the encoding time. Thus, various fast motion estimation algorithms have been proposed. The H.264 reference encoder has currently adopted three fast motion estimation algorithms. These algorithms aim at reducing the search area by predicting the search points using suitable predictors. In this paper we propose a new spatio-temporal predictor and we study the effectiveness of different predictors in order to find out whether these predictors truly contribute to the decrease of motion estimation time without affecting video quality and adding undesirable complexity to the encoder.",

For example, digital X-ray images of size 2k x 2k with 12 bits of pixel accuracy have become a commodity. Lossless compression of such an image will result in a reduction of its file size by 2 to 3 times (Adams and Kossentini, 2000), namely it will need approximately 20Mbits of storage instead of 50Mbits.

A popular way for modeling the geometry is to tile the surface of the 3-D object with triangles (see Figure 16.1, left). The shape guides the 3-D rendering engine in calculating the screen pixels covered by the 3-D object. The color of these pixels is defined with a combination of a mathematical model of materials and 2-D textures (see Figure 16.1, right). 2-D textures add important visual information to graphical applications requiring a high level of realism and immersion (Figures 16.2 and 16.3).

An attempt has been made to find the most appropriate alternative to the RGB color space. Color spaces with linear relation to the RGB color space with uncorrelated components are found to be most suitable for watermarking. Another objective has been to propose an adaptive watermarking scheme for any type of color image, including computer generated color images. The adaptivity is achieved by keeping the visibility metric (PSNR) in a predefined quality range while changing the watermark embedding strength. The length of the watermark is kept constant for each of the color channels. In order to select the suitable space for watermark casting each of the color channels is transformed through Discrete Wavelet Transform and then the Discrete Hadamard Transform is applied to the approximations only. By this multiple transformation we are in a position to select the most appropriate coefficients for the watermarking, which are close to the low frequencies and uncorrelated in nature. Higher level of security is achieved by introducing encryption among the selected transformed coefficients using a private encryption key. Detection is oblivious and only the watermark generation and the coefficient encryption keys are required for the detection, and not the original image. Scheme is tested against a variety of legitimate and illicit image processing operations including compression, scaling, uniform or gaussian noise addition, median filtering, cropping, multiple watermarking and StirMark benchmark.",

            "Abstract": "Point clouds are one of the most promising technologies for 3D content representation. In this paper, we describe a study on quality assessment of point clouds, degraded by octree-based compression on different levels. The test contents were displayed using Screened Poisson surface reconstruction, without including any textural information, and they were rated by subjects in a passive way, using a 2D image sequence. Subjective evaluations were performed in five independent laboratories in different countries, with the inter-laboratory correlation analysis showing no statistical differences, despite the different equipment employed. Benchmarking results reveal that the state-of-the-art point cloud objective metrics are not able to accurately predict the expected visual quality of such test contents. Moreover, the subjective scores collected from this experiment were found to be poorly correlated with subjective scores \u2026",

The proposed method takes advantage of the different block sizes used by the H.264 encoder during the inter prediction stage in order to hide the desirable data. It is a blind data hiding scheme, i.e. the message can be extracted directly from the encoded stream without the need of the original host video. This fragile data hiding approach can be mainly used for content-based authentication and covert communication.",

Specific cases of heavy load mathematical transformations for large media objects are discussed. A proposal for incorporating the watermarking procedure in the Grid architecture is also briefly presented.",

By applying multiple runs of the embedding process, a significant capacity gain is obtained at the expense of lower quality.",

The data hiding algorithm used to embed the message-image is a fragile, blind algorithm based on discrete Pascal transform. Experimental results show that this scheme is able to restore the original image when tampered, by producing a sufficient quality representation of its original content.",

The proposed scheme does not need the original image for extracting the watermark, and induces not noticeable distortion during the watermarking procedure. The embedding algorithm has low computational complexity, can be applied to very small images (down to 16 x 16), and provides capabilities of multicasting. The watermarked images show robustness against geometrical attacks like rotation, flipping, translation, aspect ratio changes and resizing, warping, shifting, drawing, scattered tiles, shaking as well as their combinations.",
