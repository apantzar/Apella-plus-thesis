            "Abstract": "The use of Virtual Environments as a user interface can be important for certain types of applications, especially in the fields of education and entertainment. These synthetic worlds are even more attractive for the user when they exhibit dynamic characteristics and are populated by virtual agents. There is, however, a lack of generalpurpose tools for designing and implementing intelligent virtual environments, and especially in the case of defining virtual agents\u2019 tasks, where there is a strong dependence between the task execution and the context. In this paper, we present our approach towards a context-independent definition of tasks using a high-level language. With the proposed task definition language, one can combine numerous built-in functions and commands to describe complex tasks as a combination of parallel, sequential and conditional execution of actions. It can be used to program complicated virtual agent interactions with the environment without going into much detail on how these tasks are implemented and how parallelism is achieved. The main advantage of the proposed language is that it enables tasks to be easily constructed and reused by different agents and in different environments. Our approach has been based on SimHuman, a platform for rendering and animating Virtual Agents in real-time.",

            "Abstract": "In the field of cultural heritage, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of monuments is a usual activity for many professionals. The aim in this paper focuses on the new technology educational application combining science, history, and archaeology. Being involved in almost all stages of implementation steps and assessing the level of participation, university students use tools of computer gaming platform and participate in ways of planning the virtual environment which improves their education through e-Learning. The virtual 3D environment is made with different imaging methods (helium-filled balloon, Structure for motion, 3D repository models) and a developmental plan has been designed for use in many future applications. Digital tools were used with 3D reconstructed buildings from the museum archive to Unity 3D for the design. The pilot study of Information Technology work has been employed to introduce cultural heritage and archaeology to university syllabuses. It included students with a questionnaire which has been evaluated accordingly. As a result, the university students were inspired to immerse themselves into the virtual lab, aiming to increasing the level of interaction. The results show a satisfactory learning outcome by an easy to use and real 3D environment, a step forward to fill in needs of contemporary online sustainable learning demands. View Full-Text",

This paper introduces a framework of self-organised Peircean semiotic processes, which is used to demonstrate the emergence of grounded representational structures in a virtual agent interacting with the environment.A completed semiosis consists of the three inferential procedures: abduction, deduction and induction, which drive the agent\u2019s logical argumentation. In the abductive phase, the agent observes the environment and describes the nature of a surprising phenomenon on the basis of its anticipations. An analogy between the surprising phenomenon and the agent\u2019s anticipations is attempted, in order to indicate a possible direction of a hypothesis explaining the phenomenon, and the formulation of this hypothesis takes place.",

One such promising approach are Virtual Museums, ie digital environments for the presentation of exhibit collections. Currently one may identify two distinct trends in Virtual Museums: exhibition spaces built in Virtual Worlds such as Second Life, and the Google Art Project. A common characteristic of these approaches is that they both aim to replicate the experience of visiting the physical museum space and observing the exhibits. However, looking deeper into several aspects of their interface, one can notice significant differences: modelled vs digitized exhibition space, low-res vs hi-res image presentation, single-vs multi-user visiting experience, static vs interactive exhibits, etc. The aim of our research is to compare the two environments in terms of their effect on the visiting experience and to attempt to identify the critical design features that contribute mostly to the experience. We have setup a study for the comparative evaluation of the two approaches based on the visiting experience of the same exhibition space. We have selected a museum wing already present in the Google Art Project (the 5th floor of the Museum of Modern Art of New York-MoMA) and modelled a replicate of it in OpenSimulator, an open source alternative to Second Life. The analysis of the results indicate that both approaches have been found attractive by the users, but for different reasons, and led to the identification of a number of features that positively affected \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Virtual Agents are autonomous embodied entities in virtual environments that look and behave like living organisms. They are usually equipped with sensors that read the state of the environment and effectors that apply actions on other entities. Believable agent behavior requires nonomniscience: each agent should contain its own representation of the environment based on its sensing abilities and its interaction history. However, the storage and maintenance of a multitude of different knowledge bases in a dynamic environment with a large number of agents raises memory and performance issues, as data is duplicated and a lot of calculations are repeated. This paper presents an architecture for multiagent virtual environments that is based on a spatiotemporal database, which maintains an abstract representation of the environment and the moving entities, and delivers all the sensory information required by the agents. The use of the spatiotemporal database enhances the agents\u2019 reasoning about the position and motion of other entities by providing a number of queries for spatiotemporal reasoning.",

            "Abstract": "Interactive installations in museums usually adopt hybrid technologies that combine physical elements with digital content, and studies so far show that this approach enhances the interest and engagement of visitors compared to non-interactive media or purely digital environments. However, the design of such systems is complicated, as it involves a large number of stakeholders and specialists. Additionally, the functional components need to be carefully orchestrated to deliver a rich user experience. Thus, there is a need for further research on tools and methods that facilitate the process. In this paper we present the design and development of a mixed reality installation for the Museum of Marble Crafts in Tinos island in Greece, which places visitors in the role of the crane operator and they have to complete challenges in a gamified version of the old quarry. The system lets users operate a tangible controller and their actions are executed by digital workers in a rich 3D environment. Our design approach involved iterative prototyping, research and co-design activities. The creative process has been supported by a series of organized workshops. The evaluation results indicate that mixed reality can be a promising medium for rich interactive experiences in museums that combine tangible and intangible heritage. View Full-Text",

On the other hand, smartphones have been used as external controllers of large-screen installations or game environments, and they may also be effective in supporting 3D navigations. This paper aims to examine whether a smartphone-based control is a reliable alternative to mid-air interaction for four degrees of freedom (4-DOF) fist-person navigation, and to discover suitable interaction techniques for a smartphone controller. For this purpose, we setup two studies: A comparative study between smartphone-based and Kinect-based navigation, and a gesture elicitation study to collect user preferences and intentions regarding 3D navigation methods using a smartphone. The results of the first study were encouraging, as users with smartphone input performed at least as good as with Kinect and most of them preferred it as a means of control, whilst the second study produced a number of noteworthy results regarding proposed user gestures and their stance towards using a mobile phone for 3D navigation.

            "Abstract": "Populating virtual worlds with computer controlled characters is a key issue in virtual heritage applications, an argument that can also be held as valid for the majority of virtual world applications. Virtual heritage worlds usually tend to be either devoid of people, or include computer-controlled characters that function as animated props, demonstrating pre-scripted and repetitive behaviour. In more advanced approaches, digital characters in special roles, such as virtual guides, may also be situated in the virtual world. Recent virtual heritage reconstruction works seem to acknowledge the necessity of incorporating non-human controlled characters that include intelligence in order to enhance presence and provide the user with an engaging experience. This paper presents the design and development of Virtual Agora, a virtual heritage application in the Open Simulator environment aiming to replicate daily life in an ancient Greek agora using biologically-inspired motivational agents. The application follows a multi-layered motivational model for agents that includes biological, as well as psychosocial needs. Every agent possesses a set of basic attributes that relate to its biological and physical characteristics, as well as its personality. Furthermore, agents are endowed with a set of behaviours that satisfy particular goals and consist of a sequence of actions towards achieving this goal. In addition to this generic action set, every agent possesses an extra set of actions, based on its assignment of a role or profession. The roles and the respective behaviours have been designed and selected based on available resources regarding life in the ancient \u2026",

The research findings revealed connections between the museums\u2019 content and the documented tangible heritage based on the formulated conceptual and heatmaps, which can be used at the early design stages of the current project\u2019s interactive applications, especially in mobile tours. Finally, the research findings verify that despite the limitations and issues for further research, the introduced HERMeS methodology and digital tools are reliable and contribute to the respective field\u2019s theory.

Being presented as 3D visualization spaces they adopt a spatial model of navigation, in which information artifacts have a certain position in space and users can access them through their avatar. However, compared to traditional hypermedia and webbased information systems, Virtual Worlds offer little support for discovering semantically related artifacts and for following the preferences and actions of other users. Furthermore, there is a lack of interoperability with other information systems that would enhance the world\u2019s objects with semantically related content. In this paper we present a framework for extending virtual worlds with interactions and visualizations that support improved semantic and social browsing in the 3D environment, and propose an integrated architecture for their interface with external information sources through the employment of Linked Data. Following the proposed framework, we have implemented a prototype environment that presents a gallery of famous paintings and we have performed a user evaluation in order to assess its usability, focusing especially on its novel features for semantic and social browsing.",

            "Abstract": "Interior space design is a collaborative process for deriving different proposals on the content and structure of any type of interior space. This process is partially supported by mainstream CAD systems which are not designed for that particular task but for general engineering-or architectural-design development. Although, several add-on modules have been developed for supporting mainly arctitectural design, still, significant effort is required in order to employ a CAD system due to their increased requiremenets and slow learning curve. However, if end-users (eg, consumers) are to be directly involved in the process, new environments that emphasize on usability and intuitive interactions have to be introduced. VR technology can help in this direction as it provides the theories and tools to construct and manipulate 3D spaces using a \u2018real-world\u2019metaphor. Desktop virtual environments can serve as a means to implement design applications for the end-users. In this paper we propose a methodology for designing and implementing virtual reality applications to support the process of interior space design focusing on usability for non-expert users. We present a prototype implementation of the proposed methodology and an informal user-centered evaluation of the environment.",

This paper presents the development and user-centred evaluation of a cultural heritage application about sculpturing Cycladic figurines, which places users in the role of an ancient craftsman or sculptor who progressively creates a statue by selecting and applying the appropriate tools with bare-hand interactions tracked by the Leap Motion sensor. The evaluation of the user experience of ten adults and ten children in two subsequent studies reveals that users find the experience very positive and engaging but \u2026",

The rich educational information presented in the virtual environment and the presence of remote users could also be beneficial for the visitors of the physical exhibition space. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a virtual exhibition that allowed local and remote visitors coexist in the environment, access the interactive content and communicate with each other. The virtual exhibition was accessible to the remote users from the Web and to local visitors through an installation in the physical space. The installation projected the virtual world in the exhibition environment and let users interact with it using a handheld gesture-based device. We performed an evaluation of the 3D environment with the participation of both local and remote visitors. The evaluation results indicate that the virtual world was considered exciting and easy to use by the majority of the participants. Furthermore, according to the evaluation results, virtual museums and exhibitions seem to have significant advantages for remote visitors compared to typical museum web sites, and they can also be an important aid to local visitors and enhance their experience.",

            "Abstract": "Virtual Reality technology [1-3], has introduced a new spatial metaphor with very interesting applications on Intelligent Navigation [4], social behaviour over virtual worlds [5], full body interaction [6], virtual studios [7], etc. During the past few years, the Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) has emerged as the de facto standard for describing 3-D systems on the World Wide Web. It is platform-independent, easy to use, and gives Web authors the possibility to embed virtual worlds inside their pages. While Java has dramatically altered the way applications are created and distributed, VRML's impact goes beyond, changing the nature of the applications themselves while enriching and deepening the meaning of the data it encapsulates [8]. Recently, a purely theoretical attempt has been made in order to analyse the model-based semantics for Virtual Reality modelling [9]. Another attempt [10] tries to classify the types of behaviour present in Virtual Reality systems. An interesting application would be the creation of worlds that represent real places or buildings, where the user can be able to access various kinds of information interacting with objects or avatars and travel at the same time in the virtual space. Such applications would require the development of overlying modules which would be capable of communicating with the VRML browsers, providing special control on certain virtual entities, maintaining Information Databases, Interacting with the user, etc. In this system, we have created an interactive application that guides the user inside a virtual university.

The aim of this study is to examine whether a smartphone-based control is a reliable alternative to mid-air interaction for 4-DOF fist-person navigation. We setup an experiment, where users had to navigate and complete a given task in two different scenes using three input modalities. The input modalities and interaction techniques were a known Kinect-based navigation method using body tilt and shoulder rotation, a smartphone-based control though tilting and rotating the device, and a traditional keyboard-based input used as a basis of comparison.

Several researchers in the field of psychology and neural science agree that emotion is an essential aspect of human intelligence, diverging from the traditional treatment of emotion as something that inhibits rational thinking. This argument has also influenced the area of artificial intelligence and especially the young, yet vibrant field of Intelligent Virtual Agents, where it has become accepted that emotion is a key issue to achieve believable agent behaviour. The increased interest for emotions has resulted in several computational emotional models having been presented, with diverse approaches, generically classified into cognitive and non-cognitive, inspired by areas such as neural science.

Despite its potential, this approach has not yet been evaluated in formal educational settings.

            "Abstract": "Autonomy is a fundamental property for an intelligent virtual agent. The problem in the design of an autonomous IVA is that the respective models approach the interactive, environmental and representational aspects of the agent as separate to each other, while the situation in biological agents is quite different. A theoretical framework indicating the fundamental properties and characteristics of an autonomous biological agent is briefly presented and the interactivist model of representations combined with the concept of a semiotic process are used as a way to provide a detailed architecture of an autonomous agent and its fundamental characteristics. A part of the architecture is implemented as a case study and the results are critically discussed showing that such architecture may provide grounded representational structures, while issues of scaling are more difficult to be tackled.",

Nowadays, there are a number of architectures and languages for designing virtual agents and scripting their control process, but the majority of them cannot cope with the vagueness that characterizes a designer\u2019s description of a location or direction using natural language, and, thus, fail to demonstrate complex spatial behavior in dynamic environments. We propose a framework for handling spatial vagueness in virtual agent control, which uses binary fuzzy relations to represent vague location descriptions and a fuzzy rule-based system for the agent control.

            "Abstract": "Virtual Exhibitions are single-or multi-user realistic 3D representations of artifact collections, in which visitors navigate, observe the exhibits, learn related information about them presented in various media, and in some cases interact with them. Given that virtual exhibitions have no physical restrictions, they may host a limitless number of exhibits in a very large presentation space. On the other hand studies have shown that visitors have various goals concerning their experience within an exhibition space, they follow different navigation strategies in browsing the exhibits, and they may be interested only in parts of the collection. These differentiations among online users raise a need for adaptation and personalization of the 3D environment and its content.Researchers in Adaptive Hypermedia distinguish between adaptation of content, adaptation of presentation and modality, and adaptation of structure. In the case of Virtual Exhibitions the content can be adapted by dynamically altering the artifacts presented in the exhibition spaces based on given criteria, eg user interests. The presentation and modality of the exhibition collection can be adapted by selecting between different media that may accompany the artifacts and by adjusting the presentation text to the visitors\u2019 preferences and goals. Finally, the adaptation of structure of 3D environments is not as trivial as in the case of Webbased and hypermedia presentations, where hyperlinks can be added or removed and navigation maps can be dynamically generated. In the case of Virtual Exhibitions the environment is assisting visitors\u2019 navigation towards places of interest rather than restructuring \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a dynamic field that is constantly expanding into new application areas, discovering new research challenges and facilitating the devel-ment of innovative products. Today\u2019s information overload and rapid technological advancement raise needs for effective management of the complexity and heteroge-ity of knowledge, for intelligent and adaptable man\u2013machine interfaces and for pr-ucts and applications that can learn and take decisions by themselves. Although the mystery of human-level intelligence has just started to be uncovered in various int-disciplinary fields, AI is inspired by the respective scientific areas to explore certain theories and models that will provide the methods and techniques to design and-velop human-centered applications that address the above-mentioned needs. This volume contains papers selected for presentation at the 5th Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence (SETN 2008), the official meeting of the Hellenic Society for Artificial Intelligence (EETN). Previous conferences were held at the University of Piraeus (1996), at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (2002), at the University of the Aegean (2004) and at the Institute of Computer Science at FORTH (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas) and the University of Crete (2006).",

            "Abstract": "Virtual Worlds have not been deployed widely in collaborative design, and their respective value is largely unknown. In this paper we make a combined use of established principles in design and computer-mediated communication studies to provide an account of their value for collaborative design by presenting three case studies concerned with: (a) review sessions of the architectural design of a cottage; (b) collaborative design of the interior space of an academic laboratory; (c) collaboration of design teams for the user interface design of a multimedia kiosk. We have found that collaborative design in VWs is a very engaging experience for remote participants and can add value to the activities of conceptual design and/or design review in the domains of design examined.",

These worlds are even more attractive for the user when they are neither static nor pre-scripted, but have dynamic characteristics and are populated by autonomous entities, also called virtual agents. There has been a lot of research concerning visualization, animation and behavior of virtual agents, but there are no generic architectures, methodologies and tools for the development of intelligent virtual environments, i.e. 3D environments with autonomous virtual agents. In this paper, we present SimHuman, a tool for the construction of virtual worlds with autonomous entities, targeted for a specific group of applications, such as simple simulation systems, virtual environments, educational applications, multimedia presentations, etc. It consists of a programming library and two \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, plenty of novel educational tools using mobile augmented reality (mobile AR) have been developed, altering the way students interact with a cultural heritage environment. Nevertheless, the relevant literature still lacks studies exploring the usability, effectiveness and acceptance of the technology by users, and there is still need for in-depth research to better understand the way students interact with mobile AR interfaces in this context. This study explores the use of mobile-AR technology in an open-air archaeological site and the results of this study are aimed at increasing the current literature on the digital encahcement of open spaces of cultural interest. This study also seeks to provide cultural heritage administrators and teachers with some key elements and factors that should be taken into account when deciding on the methods used to guide students to archaeological sites to develop new and more effective digital approach strategies. The paper describes the design, development and evaluation of the pilot application\" Oracle of Delphi app\", an educational augmented reality application for the Delphi outdoor archaeological site. It is a location-aware portable game aimed at secondary school students and aims to involve them in a playful exploration of the area through which they will learn about the most important monuments of the sacred site of Delphi and discover their history. This study is the only attempt so far to create an educational game using mobileAR for a guided tour of the archaeological site of Delphi which is then tested and evaluated by the students.",

In PBL, students learn by addressing ill-defined and open-ended problems reflecting on their experiences. This paper aims to investigate the suitability of Virtual Worlds (VWs) as a platform for hosting PBL activities and to report on their strengths and difficulties in terms of usability, collaboration support and learning effectiveness. As a case study, the authors have set up a VW on the basis of open source software, developed a number of in-world supporting tools, and ran two PBL activities in the area of User Interface Design. Students were asked to collaboratively design and present the user interface of applications in various problem areas and platforms. Each group collected resources, presented and argued about concepts, and built together an interactive user interface prototype with explanatory annotations. The final prototypes were presented to the class. The learning activities has been evaluated and the results have revealed several strong points of VWs that validate their potential for PBL activities, but also indicated a number of problems to be tackled.",
