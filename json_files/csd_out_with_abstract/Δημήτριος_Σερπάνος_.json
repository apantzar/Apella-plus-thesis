            "Abstract": "The article proposes a method for diagnosing faults and cyberattacks in electric power generation units that consist of a wind-turbine and of an asynchronous (DFIG) generator. The method relies on a differential flatness theory-based implementation of the nonlinear Kalman Filter, known as Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter. The estimated outputs provided by the Kalman filter are subtracted from the real outputs measured from the power unit, thus generating the residuals sequence. It is proven that the sum of the squares of the residuals vectors, weighted by the inverse of the residuals covariance matrix, stands for a stochastic variable that follows the \u03c7 2  distribution. By exploiting the statistical properties of the \u03c7 2  distribution one can define confidence intervals which allow for deciding at a high certainty level about the appearance of a fault or cyberattack in the wind-power system.",

One particular type of side channel attacks, called cache-based side channel attacks, aims to deduce information about the state of a cryptographic algorithm or its key by observing the data-dependent behavior of a microprocessor\u2019s cache memory. These attacks have been proven successful and very hard to protect against. In this paper, we introduce the use of the Cache Decay approach as an aid to guard against cache-based side channel attacks. Cache Decay controls the lifetime (called decay interval) of the cache items and was initially proposed for cache power leakage savings. By randomly selecting the decay interval of the cache, we actually create caches with non-deterministic behavior in regard to their \u2026",

The problem appears in digital rights management, secure boot, e-appliances, etc. All existing approaches are either partial or unreliable. Today, dependable security is necessary not only for e-commerce, but also to ensure that, under critical conditions of information warfare, remote clients behave predictably and securely, and cannot compromise the infrastructure. We prove that the problem of correct program execution is unsolvable without adoption of a trusted hardware platform. Since it is impractical to consider as trusted a complex computer system, we identify the minimal hardware support that enables a complete solution. We propose two simple hardware mechanisms which require minimal change to the currently popular PC architecture: (i) the use of a trusted \"sealed\" \u2026",

We describe a flexible, scalable software simulation environment, which has been developed for the analysis and evaluation of proposed active attacks as well as for the development of practical methods for their implementation.

Design techniques that can protect cryptosystems from leaking information have been studied by several groups. Power attacks, which infer program behavior from observing power supply current into a processor core, are important forms of attack. Various methods have been proposed to counter the popular and efficient power attacks. However, these methods do not adequately protect against power attacks and may introduce new vulnerabilities. We address a novel approach against power attacks, i.e., dynamic voltage and frequency switching (DVFS). Three designs, naive, improved and advanced implementations, have been studied to test the efficiency of DVFS against power attacks.

The video encoding unit performs the video data encoding, while the network protocol processing unit deals with the network protocol processing. In order to provide a low-cost, scalable system, we have used commercial, off-the-shelf components. We have implemented our system using a small cluster of personal computers, connected via an optical fiber (raw ATM communication).

            "Abstract": "Fault diagnosis in energy conversion systems is performed with the use of neural networks and statistical decision making. An energy conversion system comprising a solar power unit, a DC-DC converter and a DC motor is considered and the related condition monitoring problem is solved. A neural network is used to model the dynamics of this energy conversion system after processing its input and output measurements, being accumulated at different operating conditions. The considered neural model is trained with the use of first-order gradient algorithms and consists of a hidden layer of Gauss-Hermite polynomial activation functions and of an output layer with linear weights. The neural network and the resulting model represents the fault-free functioning of the energy conversion system. At a next stage, the measurements of the real output of the energy conversion system are compared against the estimated \u2026",

            "Abstract": "There have been considerable efforts to have audiovisual multimedia systems and applications converge, in home environments with homes as spaces of convergence, and for nomadic users with advanced mobile devices as points of convergence. These trends are important but also have limitations that have to be addressed and overcome, ie homecentric systems fail to account for increased mobility and desire to provide continuous service across spatial boundaries outside the home; device-centric convergence, eg in 3G phones, supports nomadic use but provides a very limited user experience as no single device and interface will fit many different applications well; furthermore, in both cases there are a lot of different security aspects that arise and have to be taken in care. The trend in our era, is to move beyond home and device-centric convergence toward truly usercentric convergence of multimedia, where the user is acting as the point at which services (multimedia applications) and the means for interacting with them (devices and interfaces) converge.One of the biggest challenges that we are facing in the deployment of architectures in such environments is related to, on the one hand, the security and protection of digital contents that interchanged between users in such pervasive ubiquitous computing environments and on the other hand with the provision to the users with security mechanisms that allow them to perform secure transactions (eg authentication, privacy protection, secure data transfer, etc.) in those environments.

Systems that closely intertwine computers and physical systems need to be designed and maintained using a unified approach that takes into account both safety and security as well as their interactions. Cyber-physical and IoT systems are vulnerable to traditional security and safety problems. However, they are also subject to other concerns that are not met either by non-cyber-controlled physical systems or by IT-oriented computer systems. Some of these problems are caused by Internet connectivity, while others are due to the complexity of software. Cyber attacks and physical attacks can be used in tandem to create a cyber-physical attack. Not only does information security affect safety, but safety methodologies also limit the applicability of traditional information security practices. Design \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Memory encryption has gained much attention lately as a way to offer a secure environment to fight against software and hardware attacks. Many researchers provided memory encryption schemes whereby one or more levels of the memory hierarchy were encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm such as AES. Counter mode (CM) encryption, also called one-time-pad (OTP) encryption, is proven to be quite effective for main memory encryption. However, CM encryption requires an extra sequence number (counter) to be associated with every memory location (L2 block cacheline granularity is used). The per-block counters must be updated every time a block is written back to memory otherwise known-plaintext attacks may occur. Thus, the size of those counters is a critical parameter in the system design. In this work, we propose the use of silent stores as a method of providing the CM encryption with less overhead \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Active hardware attacks succeed in deriving cryptographic secrets from target devices. They were originally proposed for systems implementing RSA, Fiat-Shamir (1988) scheme, and Schnorr's scheme. Common targets for these attacks are systems used for client authentication in order to access services, e.g., pay-per view TV, video distribution and cellular telephony. These client systems hold secrets, typically cryptographic keys, owned by the service provider and often implement the Fiat-Shamir identification scheme. Given the strength of active attacks and the increasingly wide deployment of client systems, it is desirable to design proactive countermeasures for them. We focus on the Fiat-Shamir scheme. We prove that the conventional active attack can be easily avoided through appropriate system and protocol configuration; we denote this configuration as the precautious Fiat-Shamir Scheme.

On the one hand, security concerns arise from the expanding attack surface of long-running technical systems due to the increasing connectivity on all levels of the industrial automation pyramid. On the other hand, safety concerns magnify the consequences of traditional security attacks. Based on the thorough analysis of potential security and safety issues of IoT systems, the chapter surveys machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) methods that can be applied to counter the security and safety threats that emerge in this context. In particular, the chapter explores how ML/DL methods can be leveraged in the engineering phase for designing more secure and safe IoT-enabled long-running technical systems.

By performing approximate linearization in the dynamic model of the power system, through Taylor series expansion and through the computation of Jacobian matrices, the application of the H-infinity Kalman Filter as a robust state estimator is possible. The H-inflnity Kalman Filter stands for a model of the fault-free functioning of the system and by subtracting from its outputs the outputs of the power unit the residuals'sequence is generated. Next, it is shown that the sum of the square of the residuals vectors being weighted by the inverse of the residuals' covariance matrix, is a stochastic variable that follows the \u03c7 2  distribution.

We prove that an existing attack, known as the Bellcore attack, is incomplete. We propose an extension to the protocol that proactively secures Fiat--Shamir systems from the Bellcore attack and we prove its strength. Finally, we introduce a new attack model, which, under stronger assumptions, can derive the secret keys from both the original Fiat--Shamir scheme as well as its proposed extension.

We consider any RU through exams' sources and any DU through exams' buffers and servers. Any exam created by a RU source is temporarily stored into a DU buffer and then is evaluated by a DU server. The proposed methodology is based on a buffers' model that evaluates the total RU-DU exams' traffic load, taking into account the sources' productivity and the exams' priority.

The workshop is unique in the sense that not only solved research problems are presented and discussed but also (partly) unsolved problems and in-depth topical reviews can be unleashed in the sci-ti? c arena. Consequently, the workshop provides the participants with an environment where collaboration rather than competition is fostered. The earlier workshops, SAMOS I\u2013IV (2001\u20132004), were composed only of invited presentations. Due to increasing expressions of interest in the workshop, the Program Committee of SAMOS V decided to open the workshop for all submissions. As a result the SAMOS workshop gained an immediate popularity; a total of 114 submitted papers were received for evaluation. The papers came from 24 countries and regions: Austria (1), Belgium (2), Brazil (5), Canada (4), China (12), Cyprus (2), Czech Republic (1), Finland (15), France (6), Germany (8), Greece (5), Hong Kong (2), India (2), Iran (1), Korea (24), The Netherlands (7), Pakistan (1), Poland (2), Spain (2), Sweden (2), T-wan (1), Turkey (2), UK (2), and USA (5).

Such environments must be developed satisfying the basic security requirements for real-time, secure data communication, and protection of data and measurements, data integrity and confidentiality.

To accomplish solution of the inverters' condition monitoring problem, a differential flatness theory-based filtering method under the name of Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter is employed. The filter emulates the functioning of the inverter in the fault-free case. It makes use of state-variable transformations (diffeomorphisms) which depend on differential flatness theory. These transformations allow to express the dynamics of the system into the canonical (Bruunovsky) form. For the latter description, the associated filtering problem is solved after using the typical Kalman Filter's recursion. Next, a residuals' sequence is generated by comparing the output of the filter to the output of the voltage inverter. It is proven that the sum of the square of the residuals when \u2026",

We introduce a new distributed scheduling algorithm, FIRM, which provides improved performance characteristics over alternative distributed algorithms. FIRM achieves saturation throughput 1 with lower delay than the most efficient alternative (up to 50% at high load). Furthermore, it provides improved fairness (it approximates FCFS) and tighter service guarantee than others. FIRM provides a basis for a class of distributed scheduling algorithms, many of which provide even more improved performance characteristics.",

            "Abstract": "One of the main difficulties in the detection and prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is that the incoming packets cannot be traced back to the source of the attack, because (typically) they contain invalid or spoofed source IP address. For that reason, a victim system cannot determine whether an incoming packet is part of a DDoS attack or belongs to a legitimate user. Various methods have been proposed to solve the problem of IP traceback for large packet flows. These methods rely on the assumption that they can gather a sufficient number of packets from the same source, in order to reconstruct the traversed path or to determine the source address. In this paper we introduce a packet marking scheme which enables the unique identification of the path that each incoming packet has traversed, relying only on the information inside that packet. We show how the proposed scheme enables real time identification and filtering of the DDoS attack traffic. The proposed scheme is simple to implement, introduces no bandwidth overhead, low computational overhead and has low fault probability. Using the above metrics, we compare our proposed scheme with existing marking schemes and demonstrate its advantages over them. Finally, we introduce a method that can be used post mortem, in order to determine the source IP address of the attacking systems (up to the nearest router to the source).",

Another critical problem with such algorithms is that they are not reliable and thus do not ensure any provable assurances. One approach to establish reliability of the algorithms is to classify arbitrary data with an appropriate (pragmatically useful) level of abstraction based on the logical data properties that are amenable to assurances, ie a formal proof that data represented by a class indeed respects properties of the class. Furthermore, the formal proofs are fundamental for the security assurance of the applications using the algorithms in general and data security in particular.",

The linearization takes place around a temporary equilibrium which is recomputed at each time-step of the control method. For the approximately linearized model of the ship's propulsion system, an H-infinity (optimal) feedback controller is developed. For the computation of the controller's gains an algebraic Riccati equation is solved at each iteration of the control algorithm.The stability properties of the control method are proven through Lyapunov analysis.",

This property provides an important tool in the design of Web caching architectures, because it allows designers to calculate appropriate cache sizes to achieve the desired hit ratios. The appropriate cache size combined with an LFU replacement policy achieves high cache hit rates. However, LFU replaces objects based on frequency measurements of past accesses. Thus, the system achieves high hit rates only after these measurements are reliable and converge to the final Zipf distribution. In this paper, we provide an analysis using Chernoff's bound and a calculation of an upper bound of the number of initial requests that need to be processed in order to obtain measurements of popularity with high confidence and a measured Zipf distribution which converges to the correct one.",

            "Abstract": "The problem of statistical fault diagnosis for the quadruple watertanks system is examined. The solution of the fault diagnosis problem for the dynamic model of the four-water tanks system is a non-trivial case, due to nonlinearities and the system's multivariable structure. In the article's approach, the system's dynamic model undergoes first approximate linearization around a temporary operating point which is recomputed at each sampling period. The linearization procedure relies on Taylor series expansion and on the computation of the Jacobian matrices of the state-space description of the system. The H-infinity Kalman Filter is used as a robust state estimator for the approximately linearized model of the quadruple water tanks system. By comparing the outputs of the H-infinity Kalman Filter against the outputs measured from the real water tanks system the residuals sequence is generated. It is concluded that the sum of the squares of the residuals' vectors, being weighted by the inverse of the associated covariance matrix, stands for a stochastic variable that follows the \u03c72 distribution. As a consequence, a statistical method for condition monitoring of the quadruple water tanks system is drawn, by using the properties of the \u03c72 distribution and the related confidence intervals. Actually, normal functioning can be ensured as long as the value of the aforementioned stochastic variable stays within the previously noted confidence intervals. On the other side, one can infer the malfunctioning of the quadruple water tanks system with a high level of certainty (e.g. of the order of 96% to 98%), when these confidence intervals are exceeded.

            "Abstract": "Appropriate use of randomness in the development of scheduling algorithms is a powerful tool, because it leads to systems that are theoretically efficient and fair, while feasible to analyze and obtain concrete performance bounds. However, randomness is hard to implement, due to the high complexity and long delay of efficient random number generators. Thus, deterministic schedulers for high-speed switches have been developed. In this paper, we introduce high-speed schedulers for packet switches, which employ randomness and provide high performance at low cost. The schedulers implement variations of an existing, optimal on-line bipartite graph matching algorithm and achieve fair service and improved performance over PIM at a significantly lower cost; PIM is the main alternative algorithm with random decisions and has been used as the basis for a wide range of deterministic algorithms.",

However, here we focus only on the core and critical component of the middleware, i.e. Execution Monitor which is a part of the module \"Architectural Differencer\" of AWDRAT. The role of the execution monitor is to identify inconsistencies between runtime observations of the target system and predictions of the System Architectural Model. Therefore, to achieve this goal, we first define the formal (denotational) semantics of the observations (runtime events) and predictions (executable specifications as of System Architectural Model); then based on the aforementioned formal semantices, we formalize the behavior of the \"Execution Monitor\" of the middleware.",

Modeling and simulation are used to effectively optimize the design and operation of all of these urban systems. It is possible that in an urban simulation community workshop, citizens can work interactively in front of computers and be able using the click of the mouse to walk up to their own front porch, looking at the proposed shopping mall alternatives across the street from virtually any angle and proposed bridge or tunnel and see how it can reduce traffic congestion. Buildings can be scaled down or taken out, their orientation can be changed in order to check the view and orientation in order to have better site with efficient energy-conservation. The stone or brick material on a building can be replaced by colored concrete, or more trees and lampposts can be placed on the site. Such flexibility in simulation and animation allows creative ideas in the design and orientation of urban sites to be demonstrated to citizens and decision makers before final realization.",

In the present thesis, we present a graph-based solution to the malware detection problem, which implements resources extraction from executable samples and applies machine learning algorithms to those resources so as to decide on the nature of the executable (malicious or benign). Given an unknown Windows executable sample, we first extract the calls that the sample makes to the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) and arrange them in the form of an API Call Graph, based on which, an Abstract API Call Graph is constructed. Subsequently, using a Random Walk Graph Kernel, we are able to quantify the similarity between the graph of the unknown sample and the corresponding graphs hailing from a labeled dataset of known samples (benign and malicious Windows executables), in order to carry out the binary classification using Support Vector Machines. Following the aforementioned process, we achieve accuracy levels up to 98.25%, using a substantially smaller dataset than the one proposed by similar efforts, while being considerably more efficient in time and computational power.",

Due to the difference between traditional and wireless networks, in particular in terms of available bandwidth and network structure, the concepts used for supporting real-time applications in both networks are different. This paper gives an overview of the key technical challenges that are fundamental and need to be solved in order to easily support real-time applications in wireless and mobile environments. In a first step, issues related to service provisioning in mobile networks are discussed. This is followed by a look at the Quality of Service supported by wireless networks and possible techniques for improving it. Finally, concepts for securing the communication between the users of real-time applications in wireless \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A systematic method for the detection of attacks against sensors of the power grid is developed using Kalman filtering and statistical decision making criteria. The Kalman filter is used as a virtual sensor that emulates the functioning of the grid's sensors in the fault-free mode. The output of the Kalman filter is compared against the output of the real sensors and the resulting differences generate the residuals' sequence. The square of the residuals' vector, weighted by the inverse of the associated covariance matrix is a random variable that follows the \u03c7 2  distribution. This variable can serve as a statistical test about the deviation of the sensors functioning from the normal mode. By exploiting the properties of the \u03c7 2  distribution and by using the confidence intervals approach, one can define thresholds against which the value of the statistical test is compared. If these thresholds are exceeded by the value of the \u2026",

First a neural network with Gauss\u2013Hermite activation function is used for modelling the dynamics of the PMSLM. The neural network is used as the fault-free model of the PMLSM. Next, to perform fault diagnosis, the output of the neural network is compared against the output that is measured in real-time from the PMLSM, when both the NN and the electric machine receive the same input. Thus, the residuals' sequence is generated. It is proven that the sum of the squares of the residuals' vectors, being weighted by the inverse of the associated covariance matrix, is a \u2026",

Using VoIP, we can make telephone calls over the Internet or any IP-based corporate networks. With VoIP in place, the Internet does not remain a data-only network; it becomes a telephone network as well. So, what is the motivation for VoIP? There are several appealing reasons why we want this technology. The most compelling reason behind the emergence of this technology is the enormous cost savings through integration of both voice and data, two large revenue-making media for telecommunication companies, over the same communication infrastructure. The other major motivation for VoIP is the widespread adoption of IP platform. Today IP is a well-entrenched technology which is deployed in servers, routers, desktop PCs, laptops, and in many hand-held mobile devices \u2026",

Their design, which enables realtime operation as well as continuous operation under failures, has made them attractive for the management and control of critical infrastructures, such as power, water supply, and transport infrastructures. Their increasing adoption in infrastructures has led to their exposure to attacks from various actors; such attacks, if successful, can have catastrophic results for infrastructures and cause even loss of life. Thus, their security and resilience are critical. In this paper, we provide a short description of problems and solution approaches for the security of ICSs. Considering their special purpose and their characteristics, we address application-level security demonstrating that a complete solution requires a combination of design methods \u2026",

The combination of the detection and mitigation methods provide an increased level of security in comparison to approaches based on a single method. Furthermore, the scheme is developed in a way to comply with the novel SHIELD secure architecture being developed, which aims at providing interoperability with other secure components as well as metrics to quantify their security properties.",

            "Abstract": "Today\u2019s networks support applications that deliver text, audio, images and video, often in real time and with a high degree of interactivity, using a common infrastructure. More often than not, traffic is carried over packet-switched networks that treat all data the same, under what is known as best-effort service. Packet switching can achieve very high efficiency through statistical multiplexing of data from numerous sources; however, due to the very nature of packet switching, one should expect fluctuations in throughput, delay, reliability, etc., for any given flow. The greater the statistical multiplexing capabilities, the greater the efficiency and also the greater the variability of achieved performance; in this sense, best-effort service provides maximum efficiency with highly unpredictable service quality. Clearly, not all traffic flows are created equal. Interactive web-based applications tend to be very sensitive to throughput \u2026",

Since, the (provable) behavioral correctness of a software system is a fundamental pre-requisite of the system's security. Therefore, the goal of the work is to first formalize the behavioral semantics of the middleware as a pre-requisite for our proof of the behavioral correctness. However, in this paper, we focus only on the core and critical component of the middleware, ie Execution Monitor which is a part of the module\" Architectural Differencer\" of AWDRAT. The role of the execution monitor is to identify inconsistencies between runtime observations of the target system and predictions of the specification System Architectural Model of the system. As a starting point we have defined the formal (denotational) semantics of the observations (runtime events) and predictions (executable \u2026",

Considering video services as highly demanding applications in a multimedia environment, we analyze and compare centralized and distributed architectures for multimedia video servers. Comparisons are made in terms of the blocking probability of a video client's request, considering as important parameters the input/output capacity of the system and the amount of storage. Through a combination of analytical results and simulations, we conclude that in general a centralized architecture is preferable. The results indicate, however that in a distributed architecture containing a large number of powerful servers, performance is similar to the centralized architecture under high load conditions, while the blocking probabilities are quite small under light load conditions.

            "Abstract": "Web caches can achieve high hit rates through exploitation of the properties of object access distribution, which is governed by Zipf\u2019s law, in general. Web caches need to store the most popular objects and typically employ the Least Frequently Used (LFU) replacement policy, which achieves high cache hit rates, and often the highest hit rate. Correct implementation of LFU requires that replacement decisions are made based on frequency access information (popularity), for all the objects accessed since the beginning of a cache\u2019s operation. The immensely large number of such objects renders the implementation of LFU impractical in many environments. In this paper, we introduce an alternative implementation of LFU, the Window-LFU policy, which makes replacement decisions based on access frequency measurements in a recent past, called time-window. Window-LFU achieves cache hit rates equivalent to those of LFU, but with access information from a shorter history, leading to high performance at a low cost (significantly lower than that of LFU). We provide analytical results which enable one to estimate the appropriate window size, in order to achieve the target cache hit rate of LFU. Furthermore, we present simulation results using actual traces, which indicate that the proposed Window-LFU policy behaves as expected and in some configurations it leads to better results than theoretically expected, due to dependencies between successive Web objects requests in real environments.

Such switches require high-speed schedulers, in order to resolve conflicts among packet destinations and to achieve low latency, high bandwidth communication, while providing fairness guarantees. In general, these schedulers are categorized as centralized or distributed, depending on their operation.In this paper, we evaluate hardware and software implementations of two schedulers: 2-dimensional round-robin and FIRM, which are centralized \u2026",

The use of switched backplanes in routers provides an important direction in communication system architecture and promises to increase dramatically their ability to switch IP packets. We describe the main features of router architectures focusing on schedulers for switched backplanes. We introduce a classification for available algorithms identifying their basic features. We demonstrate that new schedulers can be developed by enforcing fairness and by incorporating features that have been used separately in the past as the classification shows. This leads to switches that provide higher performance than conventional ones, as we demonstrate with the description of a class of such algorithms.",

There is lately a strong interest for case studies on the password habits of populations with different cultures and/or languages. In this paper, we augment the existing literature with a case study of Greek web sites. We analyze clear text and encrypted passwords for almost 19,000 accounts and we draw conclusions on similarities with and oppositions to alike empirical studies. Our findings indicate that a significant percentage of users chooses easily-guessed passwords. The average password length is less than 7 characters and most passwords contain only letters and numbers. However, there are users that prefer passwords containing characters from the Greek alphabet. Such passwords are much harder to guess and our proposal is to encourage their usage.",

The WWIC 2010 call for papers attracted 45 submissions from more than 25 countries and each contribution was subject to thorough peer review by recognized int-national experts that acted as members of the Technical Program Committee. The selection process resulted in 16 accepted papers, which were thematically grouped into 5 technical sessions. The major themes of WWIC 2010 were cooperation, management of multimedia traffic, advancing IEEE 802.11, cognitive optimization, mesh and multi-hop networks, security, signaling, control, and wireless sensor networks.",

Modeling known threats at abstract but practical level is key to assure security of efficient and scalable IoT applications. To this end, the method classifies set of known attacks into  computational ,  data integrity  and  communication  attacks. Then, each attack class is  decomposed  into  declarative properties  and  definitive properties . A  declarative property  specifies an attack as a single big-step relation between initial and final state by ignoring intermediate states, while a  definitive property  specifies an attack as a sequence of numerous small-step relations considering all intermediate states between initial and final state. Finally, the declarative properties are translated into runtime security monitor that assures protection of the application execution against known threats without defying runtime application\u2019s performance requirements. in particular, we evaluate the methodology through its application to an energy management application of smart home.",

Safety and security must be treated as a unified problem with a coherent set of approaches to solve these new challenges. This book provides our most recent thinking on safe and secure CPS and IoT systems. The chapters survey existing methods to identify challenges and propose new methodologies. While progress has been made in the past several years, we believe that much more work remains to be done. That work must go beyond technical solutions.

The functional enrichment and statistical significance of the resulting clusters is evaluated by precision-recall curves and calculated p-values. Moreover, we analyzed the upstream regions of all genes that comprise each cluster, in order to verify that the derived correlation classes capture the expression of genes with common regulation.

Such monitors are typically non-adaptive against constantly changing attacks of variable extent. Our run-time monitor detects attacks by checking the consistency between the application run-time behavior and its specified (expected) behavior model.

On a first look, it may seem like a kind of best programming practice that can only improve overall security of the module. Especially, an architect can see it as a rather strong countermeasure against attacks based on computational faults\u2013so called fault attacks. In this article, however, we will show that such a practice can induce particular cryptographic weaknesses. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as a general security improvement. Especially, it can even increase a vulnerability to the fault attacks. Its usage in cryptographic modules shall, therefore, undergo a proper cryptanalysis before being actually deployed.",

Pulse super-worms can be very effective and efficient, because they exploit one significant Internet vulnerability: the assumption of Internet's development model that all routers are trustworthy and can coordinate to defend against attacks from external enemies, who have been considered the only enemies traditionally.

To achieve these goals we utilize improved design techniques and circuitry, and we eliminate functionalities of marginal benefit.

Results showed that this method hides processor state with 27% energy reduction and 16% time overhead for DES encryption and decryption algorithms.

Embedded intelligence increasingly pervades industry, infrastructure, and public and private spaces, being identified as a society and economy emerging \u201cneural system\u201d that supports both societal changes and economic growth. As cost/performance improves, everyday life connected objects increasingly rely on embedded intelligence in an ever-growing array of application fields, specialized technologies, and engineering disciplines.

For instance, most embedded systems are cost-sensitive and with real-time constraints, optimized for power and specific tasks, built around a wide array of processors, often resource-constrained, which need to operate under extreme environmental conditions, and where reliability and security can have severe implications.

In this paper, we explore the problem of managing the on-chip shared caches in a CMP workstation where malicious threads or just cache \u201chungry\u201d threads try to hog the cache giving rise to DoS opportunities. An important characteristic of our method is that there is no need to distinguish between malicious and \u201chealthy\u201d threads. The proposed methodology is based on a statistical model of a shared cache that can be fed with run-time information and accurately describe the behavior of the shared threads \u2026",

The dependability of these critical systems, including requirements related to reliability, safety, and security, is of utmost importance and requires specific attention in all phases of the system lifecycle. These systems have traditionally been under strict control of the organization delivering and owning them and their continuous, predictable operation has been closely monitored and maintained. However, critical systems are increasingly connected to the Internet, to peer and vendor sites, or to regulatory bodies and their management and control is often outsourced. The notions of both a system and an organization are more diffuse as critical systems move towards cross-organizational and distributed control structures. No longer is one single organization in control of these systems, rather \u2026",

The main problem in these systems is the construction of a periodic schedule (in cycles), where in every cycle each information object is transmitted several times; the number of appearances of each object is a function of its size and popularity. Existing algorithms try to transmit each object in a cycle with perfect periodicity, i.e. all object instances (appearances) in the cycle are equally spaced in time. These algorithms construct optimal schedules for environments with memory-less clients, optimizing the aggregate access delay for objects, and thus, minimizing client energy consumption accordingly.In this article, we provide an analysis of broadcast systems for memory-equipped (caching) clients.

Currently, interword communication for parallel processing is performed over a simple interconnect such as a star network with the comparand register as the hub. We follow an alternative approach and we focus on improved interword connectivity rather than highly sophisticated memory word structures. We introduce an associative processor with a single-stage hypercube interconnection among memory words, and with the word-network interface providing routing function and small buffering (two field-size memory buffers, one for transmission and one for reception).

The pervasiveness of embedded systems and the increasing deployment of CPSs lead to an emerging infrastructure that spans globally and enables the development of new applications and services that were infeasible or inconceivable in the recent past. The immediate availability of operational data as well as computational power in conjunction with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provides significant opportunities for systems and services worldwide. To achieve this vision, CPSs need to be efficient, scalable, and extensible in terms of both hardware and software. The adoption of CPSs in various application domains leads to strong constraints on their design and implementation. More precisely, CPS technologies are quite demanding for the purpose of satisfying strong application and operational environment requirements, including real-time constraints, safety and security, continuous operation, scalability, extensibility, autonomy, power consumption, and internetworking. Although CPSs typically abide by several of these requirements, the application domains, ranging from manufacturing to transport and from health to power, impose different constraints on each specification. For example, industrial production systems have stricter requirements for real-time constraints and continuous operation than home automation systems, while they have more relaxed stipulations for power consumption relative to autonomous, mobile health-monitoring systems.",

These algorithms achieve high throughputs by approximating the one provided by FINE introduced in (M. Gamvrili et al., 2003) with a significantly lower implementation cost.

            "Abstract": "Conventional approaches for ensuring the security of application software at run-time, through monitoring, either produce (high rates of) false alarms (e.g. intrusion detection systems) or limit application performance (e.g. run-time verification). We present a runtime security monitor that detects both known and unknown cyber attacks by checking that the run-time behavior of the application is consistent with the expected behavior modeled in application specification. This is crucial because, even if the implementation is consistent with its specification, the application may still be vulnerable due to flaws in the supporting infrastructure (e.g. the language runtime system, libraries and operating system). This runtime security monitor is sound and complete, eliminating false alarms, as well as efficient, so that it does not limit runtime application performance and so that it supports real-time systems. The security monitor takes as input the application specification and the application implementation, which may be expressed in different languages. The specification language of the application software is formalized based on monadic second order logic and event calculus interpreted over algebraic data structures. This language allows us to express behavior of an application at any desired (and practical) level of abstraction as well as with high degree of modularity. The security monitor detects every attack by systematically comparing the application execution and specification behaviors at runtime, even though they operate at two different levels of abstraction. We define the denotational semantics of the specification language and prove that the monitor is \u2026",

Results showed that this method hides processor state with 27% energy reduction and 16% time overhead for DES encryption and decryption algorithms. Furthermore, system leakage power, as an obstacle to power attacks in the future technology, was studied. Results showed that leakage power scaling makes the power analysis really difficult to be carried out and leaves crypto embedded processors secure without any kind of overheads.",

            "Abstract": "Machine learning (ML) based secure and autonomous cyber physical systems are often not reliable and interpretable mainly because the employed ML techniques suffer from false alarms that may result in physical and financial loss. We assert that reliability and interpret-ability of the ML methods depends on underlying statistical models that infer results. Therefore, we introduce a rigorous method for the model selection. Current selection methods choose a model using statistical criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC). These criteria may lead to selection of an inappropriate model (e.g. over/under-fitting) because they only consider relative-quality (statistical) of the model without considering absolute-quality (formal) of the model based on the model/data specification. To this end, we argue the suitability of recently developed-decidability procedures/solvers. Such solvers infer if a selected model can(not) classify a given data and \u2026",

The main problem in these systems is to construct a periodic (cyclic) schedule, where in every cycle each information object is transmitted several times, depending on its size and popularity. Existing algorithms consider memory-less clients and construct optimal schedules that optimize the aggregate access delay for objects; thus, they minimize client energy consumption. In this work, we analyze broadcast systems with memory equipped (caching) clients. We change the scheduling optimization criterion to include actual object reception time and thus, we provide a more realistic model for estimation of actual client power consumption. We prove that caching clients achieve reduced object reception time, leading to improved energy consumption. We give a simple proof that \u2026",

However, it has been proven to be costly in switching environments, which require high speed decisions, as the experience with the first randomized algorithm, namely PIM, is shown. In this paper, we introduce a class of practical scheduling algorithms that employ randomness in a fashion that leads to fast, low cost implementations.

PriviPK uses a new CL key agreement protocol that has the unique property that it allows users to update their public keys without the need to contact a third party (such as a CA) for the recertification process, which allows for cheap forward secrecy and key revocation operations.

The following scenario exemplifies how an ensemble method can improve a classifier\u2019s performance. Suppose a set of K binary classifiers is constructed, each of which predicts the class with an average error rate of \u03b5. As previously mentioned, an ensemble classifier performs the classification based on the majority vote of each base classifier. In the case that all base classifiers are identical, the error rate of the ensemble will remain \u03b5, while, if the base classifiers are independent (ie they portray non-correlated error), then the ensemble will make false prediction if and only if more than half of the base \u2026",

This paper analyzes busses, crossbars, and some multi-stage networks. We compare the delay required transfer a specific amount of information (bits) between two cores.

In preparing this year\u2019s conference, our emphasis has been given on developing an environment where participants enjoy discussing research and development results, discoveries, observations, ideas and exchanging future prospects on intriguing issues.The program committee and their co-chairs (Dimitrios Serpanos, Yoshiaki Kakuda, I-Ling Yen) did an outstanding job of creating a highly attractive technical program. They contributed their invaluable time and effort to help facilitate the symposium, collect papers review them and select papers for the symposium. Without their dedicated help, ISADS 2009 would not have been so successful. I would also like to thank all the reviewers for their hard work. They presented their detailed comments and suggestions to guarantee high quality papers. I also highly appreciate our keynote speakers for their contributions to the program in spite their tough schedules. I am very grateful to all the authors of papers for presenting and sharing their creative concepts and ideas with us.

Therefore, the goal of this study is to, first, formalize the behavioral semantics of the middleware and, second, to prove its behavioral correctness. In this study, we focus only on the core and critical component of the middleware: the execution monitor. The execution monitor identifies inconsistencies between runtime observations of an industrial control system (ICS) application and predictions of the specification of the application. As a starting point, we have defined the formal (denotational) semantics of the observations (produced by the application at run-time), and predictions (produced by the executable specification of the application). Then, based on the formal semantices, we have formalized the behavior of the execution monitor. Finally, based on the semantics, we have proved soundness (absence of false alarms) and completeness (detection of arbitrary attacks) to assure the behavioral correctness of the monitor.

            "Abstract": "Conventional approaches for ensuring the security of application software at run-time, through monitoring, either produce (high rates of) false alarms (eg intrusion detection systems) or limit application performance (eg run-time verification). We present a runtime security monitor that detects both known and unknown cyber attacks by checking that the run-time behavior of the application is consistent with the expected behavior modeled in application specification. This is crucial because, even if the implementation is consistent with its specification, the application may still be vulnerable due to flaws in the supporting infrastructure (eg the language runtime system, libraries and operating system). This runtime security monitor is sound and complete, eliminating false alarms, as well as efficient, so that it does not limit runtime application performance and so that it supports real-time systems. The security monitor takes as \u2026",

First, by removing an algorithmic bottleneck in prior work, Tiny ORAM is the first hardware ORAM design to support arbitrary block sizes (e.g. 64 Bytes to 4096 Bytes). With a 64-Byte block size, Tiny ORAM can finish an access in 1.4\u03bcs, over 40\u00d7 faster than the prior-art implementation. Second, through novel algorithmic and engineering-level optimizations, Tiny ORAM reduces the number of symmetric encryption operations by ~3\u00d7 compared to a prior work.

Design techniques that can protect cryptosystems from leaking information have been studied by several groups. Power attacks, which infer program behavior from observing power supply current into a processor core, are important forms of attack. Various methods have been proposed to counter the popular and efficient power attacks. However, these methods do not adequately protect against power attacks and may introduce new vulnerabilities. We address a novel approach against power attacks, i.e., dynamic voltage and frequency switching (DVFS). Three designs, naive, improved and advanced implementations, have been studied to test the efficiency of DVFS against power attacks.

To emulate the functioning of the grid's sensors in the fault-free mode, the Kalman Filter is used as a virtual sensor. By comparing the output of the Kalman Filter against the output of the real sensors, the resulting differences generate the residuals' sequence. By weighting the square of the residuals' vector with the inverse of the associated covariance matrix a random variable is defined which is shown to follow the \u03c7 2  distribution. This variable provides a statistical test about the deviation of the sensors functioning from the normal mode. Moreover, by exploiting the properties of the \u03c7 2  distribution and by using the confidence intervals approach, one can define thresholds against which the value of the statistical test is compared.

However, this filter is primarily designed for linear systems and to enable its use in the case of the nonlinear dynamics of the wind-turbine and DFIG, the state-space model of this power system undergoes first approximate linearization through Taylor series expansion and the computation of Jacobian matrices. By subtracting the outputs estimates provided by the H-infinity Kalman Filter from the real outputs of the power unit the residuals' sequence is generated.

            "Abstract": "Many network technologies aim to exploit the bandwidth of high-speed links, which now achieve data transfer rates up to several terabits per second. As packet interarrival times shrink to a few tens of nanoseconds, network systems must address a transmission-processing gap by providing extremely fast data paths as well as high-performance subsystems to implement such functions as protocol processing, memory management, and scheduling. Today, network processors are an important class of embedded processors, used all across the network systems space-from personal to local and wide area networks. Network processor architectures focus on exploiting parallelism to achieve high performance. They usually employ conventional architectural concepts to accelerate the processing required to switch packets between different protocol stacks. The architectures support the mechanisms that network protocols \u2026",

We present two contributions, each of which uses a different approach to distribute the content.In the first part of this chapter, we consider a terrestrial overlay network and build on top of it a VoD service for fixed clients. The goal is to minimize the operational cost of the service. Our contibutions are as follows. First, we introduce a new video distribution architecture that combines open-loop and closed-loop schemes. This combination makes the overall system highly scalable, very cost-effective, and ensures a zero start-up delay. Our second contribution is a mathematical model for the cost of delivering a video as a function of the popularity of that video. Our analytical model, along with some extensions, allows us to explore several scenarios: (i) long videos of 90 min (movies), (ii) short videos of a few min (clips), (iii) the \u2026",

Our assessment verifies that when implemented in the .NET Compact Framework, the controlled randomness protocol imposes a configurable and tolerable amount of overhead computation while it offers a significant security improvement compared to a conventional implementation of a key management protocol.",

As they are often deployed in public space and/or our personal environment, they increasingly access and manipulate sensitive or private information. Their architectures need to address security and privacy issues appropriately, considering them from the inception of the overall system structure. In this paper, we present security and privacy issues of distributed smart camera systems. We describe security requirements, possible attacks, and common risks, analyzing issues at the node and at the network level and presenting available solutions. Although security issues of distributed smart cameras are analogous to networked embedded systems and sensor networks, emphasis is given to special requirements of smart camera networks, including privacy and continuous real-time operation.",

This property leads to effective Web caches, which store the most popular objects and typically employ the LFU replacement policy, which achieves high, and often the highest, cache hit rates. However, Web cache design based only on Zipf's law has two main disadvantages: (i) it does not exploit the temporal and spatial locality of user accesses on a per session basis, and (ii) LFU implementation is costly and impractical in many environments, because it requires statistics on all objects accessed since the beginning of a cache's operation. We consider all parameters of locality of references in the Web (temporal, spatial and popularity) and draw an analogy with processor caches. Given cache replacement policies that address different locality characteristics, we argue that there exist replacement algorithms that combine these characteristics \u2026",

The result is a wide variety of protocols which provide solutions to very specific problems and environments. In this paper, we introduce an architecture for secure networks, which is based on layers, in analogy to the OSI protocol stack Adoption of a layered approach leads to many advantages in secure network design: modularity, flexibility, ease of standardization, etc. We introduce a reference model with 4 layers and argue that it is suitable for conventional network architectures.
