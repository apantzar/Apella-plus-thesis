The VoIP prevailing protocol is SIP, which it is vulnerable to threats that allow SPIT to be deployed. In this paper we assess the risk of identified threats and vulnerabilities of the SIP protocol. Then, we conduct an analytical survey of already proposed anti-SPIT techniques and we evaluate their effectiveness, in terms of how they deal with the threats and vulnerabilities. Finally, we complete our evaluation by presenting a theoretical evaluation framework, based on additional qualitative and quantitative criteria.",

The assurance of their protection is crucial, as their reliance on information technology is a continuing challenge for both security experts and chief executives. As risk assessment could be a necessary process in an organization, one of its deliverables could be utilized in addressing threats and thus facilitate the development of a security strategy. Given the large number of heterogeneous methods and risk assessment tools that exist, comparison criteria can provide better understanding of their options and characteristics and facilitate the selection of a method that best fits an organization's needs. This article aims to address the problem of selecting an appropriate risk assessment method to assess and manage information security risks, by proposing a set of comparison criteria, grouped into four categories.

Usually, organizations perform risk analysis in order to adjust their security practices and controls to an acceptable level of risk. One of the various outputs of a risk analysis is a set of recommended practices expressed in high\u2010level statements of a natural language. In order to be applied to the real world, it is necessary to technically implement those requirements tailored to the specific organizational context. This is usually performed by experienced individuals. For this technical implementation and the configuration of the information technology facilities, several formal policy languages exist, which define access control policies, roles and responsibilities.

A detailed demonstration of its exploitation is also provided. The demonstration is mainly based on the evaluation of Certificate Revocation Lists, as well as of the Online Certificate Status Protocol.

We present a new analysis and source code classification technique, and a prototype tool aiming to aid code reviews in the detection of general information flow dependent bugs. Our approach is based on classifying the criticality of likely exploits in the source code using two measuring functions, namely Severity and Vulnerability. For an AUT, we analyse every single pair of input vector and program sink in an execution path, which we call an Information Block (IB). A classification technique is introduced for quantifying the Severity (danger level) of an IB by static analysis \u2026",

Nowadays, HCE staff uses HISs to assist themselves in diagnosing, to record information of a purely medical nature or even to assist themselves in patient treatment. These data are related directly to identifiable persons, their illness, their treatment, and sometimes their habits; hence they are extremely sensitive.Another fundamental change in the Health Care community is the transition from the traditional model of a stand-alone HIS, that is the HIS operating within the boundaries of a single HCE, to the networked HIS, that is a HCE's HIS interconnected to HISs of other HCEs or even of third parties, over national or \u2026",

Frequently, such lists are the only safeguard web browsers implement against such threats. In this paper, we examine the level of protection that is offered by popular web browsers on iOS, Android and desktop (Windows) platforms, against a large set of phishing and malicious URL. The results reveal that most browsers \u2013 especially those for mobile devices \u2013 offer limited protection against such threats.

            "Abstract": "With HMI systems becoming increasingly connected with the internet, more and more critical infrastructures are starting to query PLC/RTU units through the Web through MODBUS ports. Commands sent from such interfaces are inevitably exposed to potential attacks even if encryption measures are in place. During the last decade, side channels have been widely exploited, focusing mostly on information disclosure. In this paper, we show that despite encryption, targeted side channel attacks on encrypted packets may lead to information disclosure of functionality over encrypted TCP/IP running MODBUS RTU protocol. Specifically, we found that any web interface that implements unpadded encryption with specific block cipher modes (eg CFB, GCM, OFB and CTR modes) or most stream ciphers (eg RC4) to send MODBUS functions over TCP/IP is subject to differential packet size attacks. A major cause for this attack is the very small number of potential MODBUS commands and differences in packet sizes, which leads to distinctions in traffic. To support the importance of these findings, we conducted research on Shodan looking for relevant devices with open MODBUS ports over TCP/IP that utilize encrypted web traffic. The result was that a significant amount of web interfaces communicate with MODBUS ports and many use unpadded ciphers and SSL with AES-GCM or RC4. We also implemented a PoC on a simulated architecture to validate our attack models.",

It also compares their attributes and technologies in creating a taxonomy. Conceptual and qualitative studies about infrastructure interdependencies along with modeling and simulation approaches are examined.

Both sides seem to underestimate the fact that an electronic voting system is an information system with functional, as well as nonfunctional, requirements.

CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, due to their excessive demands for bandwidth. We suggest that anti-SPIT protection should be combined with appropriate admission control policies, for mitigating the effects of DoS attacks. In order to identify how effective is this technique, we quantify the costs and the benefits in bandwidth usage through probabilistic model checking four different admission control policies.

VoIP technology may provide new means for the transmission of bulk unsolicited messages and calls (spam over Internet telephony - SPIT), mainly due to the reduced cost compared to traditional telephony. Therefore, mechanisms are essential to address the SPIT problem, while maintaining the advantages of VoIP technology. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive threat analysis that addresses the ascendant VoIP protocol, the session initiation protocol, in terms of its vulnerability regarding SPIT deliverance. Our analysis introduces the requirements that the mechanisms dealing \u2026",

In this paper we study the psychosocial perspective of the insider via social media, Open Source Intelligence, and user generated content classification. Inductively, we propose a prediction method by evaluating the predisposition towards law enforcement and authorities, a personal psychosocial trait closely connected to the manifestation of malevolent insiders. We propose a methodology to detect users holding a negative attitude towards authorities. For doing so we facilitate the use of machine learning techniques and of a dictionary-based approach, so as to detect comments expressing negative attitude. Thus, we can draw conclusions over a user behavior and beliefs via the content the user generated within the limits a social medium.

            "Abstract": "As the fastest growing segment of aviation, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) continue to increase in number, technical complexity and capabilities. Numerous civilian and commercial uses are drastically transforming civil protection, asset delivery, commercial and entertaining activities. However, UAS pose significant challenges in terms of safety, security and privacy within society. An increasing phenomenon, nowadays, is drone-related incidents near airport facilities, which are expected to proliferate in frequency, complexity and severity, as drones become larger and more powerful. Critical infrastructures need to be protected from such aerial attacks, through effective counteracting technologies, risk management and resilience plans. In this paper, we present a survey of drone incidents near airports and a literature review of sensor technologies, able to prevent, detect, identify and mitigate rogue drones. We exhibit the benefits and limitations of available counter-drone technologies (C-UAS); however, defending airports against misused drone activity is a hard problem. Therefore, we analyze three realistic attack scenarios from malicious drones and propose an effective C-UAS protection plan for each case. We discuss applicability limitations of C-UAS in the aviation context and propose a resilience action plan for airport stakeholders for defending against airborne threats from misused drones.

SIP advertises a contact point of an individual to the Web. This contact point, similar to an e-mail address, can be exploited for spam purposes. Spam over Internet Telephony, also called SPIT, in general denotes any bulk unsolicited information sent to any potential calling-end of a VoIP infrastructure. Even though SPIT is a new concept, it is more reasonable to address this problem right now, rather than waiting until the problem prevails. To mitigate SPIT, adequate technical countermeasures are required. The solution space may expand to nontechnical ones, as well. In this paper, we propose the SPIDER (SPam over Internet telephony Detection sERvice) platform, a modular and efficient system for fighting SPIT.

Thus, the only way to timely acquire them, in case such a need arises during a digital investigation, is by software that collects them when they are generated by the suspect's actions. In this paper we examine the feasibility of ad-hoc data acquisition from smartphone sensors by implementing a device agent for their collection in Android, as well as a protocol for their transfer. Then, we discuss our experience regarding the data \u2026",

The use of such devices for web browsing and accessing email services is also getting continuously more popular. The same holds true with other more sensitive online activities, such as online shopping, contactless payments, and web banking. However, the security mechanisms that are available on smartphones and protect their users from threats on the web are not yet mature, as well as their effectiveness is still questionable. As a result, smartphone users face increased risks when performing sensitive online activities with their devices, compared to desktop/laptop users. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the phishing protection mechanisms that are available with the popular web browsers of Android and iOS.

This paper describes a method for risk assessment that is tailored for smartphones. The method does not treat this kind of device as a single entity. Instead, it identifies smartphone assets and provides a detailed list of specific applicable threats. For threats that use application permissions as the attack vector, risk triplets are facilitated. The triplets associate assets to threats and permission combinations. Then, risk is assessed as a combination of asset impact and threat likelihood. The method utilizes user input, with respect to impact valuation, coupled with statistics for threat likelihood calculation. Finally, the paper provides a case study, which demonstrates the risk assessment method in the Android platform.",

A rapidly increasing number of cybersecurity incidents emerge due to complex interconnected sensors, devices, and systems used in the Internet of Things. In this paper, we tackle the need for automation in security risk analysis and restructuring of such networks. The presented framework models the connections of assets and devices so as to depict their interdependencies on a company's business processes and effectively reduces their overall risk against cybersecurity threats. It achieves this by (1) identifying critical components and dependency structural risks, (2) prioritizing assets based on their influence on business processes and (3) proposing network restructures and asset clusters. To do that, the proposed algorithm utilizes (i) dependency risk graphs for modeling and analyzing networks \u2026",

Despite its huge potential value, one can foresee considerable drawbacks and undesirable potential uses of it in terms of privacy. In specific, the pervasive computing paradigm raises the level of the challenge to protect privacy of end-users, mainly due to the fact that devices operating in such an environment will be embedded in the fabric of the everyday life and will exhibit enhanced tracking and profiling capabilities. What is needed, inter alia, is appropriate mechanisms that are able to evolve with the needs of the users and interact with them in order to meet their privacy requirements.

As a result, airports enhance infrastructure's intelligence and evolve as smart facilities to support growth, by offering a pleasurable travel experience, which plays a vital role in increasing revenue of aviation sector. New challenges are coming up, which aviation has to deal and adapt, such as the integration of Industrial IoT in airport facilities and the increased use of Bring Your Own Device from travelers and employees. Cybersecurity is becoming a key enabler for safety, which is paramount in the aviation context. Smart airports strive to provide optimal services in a reliable and sustainable manner, by working around the domains of growth, efficiency, safety andsecurity.

These graphs help assess the expected risk of critical infrastructure dependency chains. This research extends an existing dependency risk analysis methodology towards risk management. The relationship between dependency risk paths and graph centrality measures is explored in order to identify nodes that significantly impact the overall dependency risk. Experimental results using random graphs to simulate common critical infrastructure dependency characteristics are presented. Based on the experimental findings, an algorithm is proposed for efficient risk mitigation. The algorithm can be used to define priorities in selecting nodes for the application of mitigation controls.",

Adversaries exploit vulnerable accessible device or malware attacks networked services, in an attempt to gain access to critical systems and machinery that are interconnected over networks. Given the importance of the oil and gas sector on the global economy and the diversity of critical systems often being controlled over remote locations, it is highly important to understand and mitigate such attacks. In this paper, we survey cyber-attacks on all three domains of the oil and gas sector (upstream, midstream, downstream) starting from the early 90s up until 2020. For each domain, we document and analyze verified attacks based on real-world reports and published demo attacks on systems \u2026",

Despite the fact that there has been considerable progress at the European and International level towards the development of National Cyber Security Strategies and the adoption of an effective comprehensive legal framework of prevention measures against cyber attacks, there is confusion regarding the application of these rules. More specifically, it has not been clarified: a) in which cases do cyber attacks constitute a \u2018threat or use of force\u2019so that the prohibition of article 2 (4) of the UN Charter can apply, b) in which cases do cyber attacks constitute a \u2018threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression\u2019so that the Security Council may decide upon measures to restore international peace and security under Article 42 of the UN Charter, and c) in which cases cyber attacks can be treated as an \u2018armed attack\u2019, making it possible for a UN Member State to respond by exercising its legitimate right of self\u2010-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The difficulty in applying the traditional rules of International Humanitarian Law to categorize cyber attacks stems from a number of factors. The most important of them is the failure to estimate properly the impact of a cyber attack in the host country and in the international environment. Additionally, the inability to positively identify the key actor of an attack makes it often quite hard to handle the issue of \u2018attribution\u2019. The aim of this paper is to \u2026",

In this context, this work examines the protection that is offered by the private browsing mode of the most popular desktop browsers in Windows (i.e., Chrome, Firefox, IE and Opera). Our experiments uncover occasions in which even if users browse the web with a private session, privacy violations exist contrary to what is documented by the browser.

VoIP technologies take advantage of existing data networks to provide inexpensive voice communications world-wide as a promising alternative to the traditional telephone service. At the same time, VoIP provides the means for transmitting bulk unsolicited calls, namely SPam over Internet Telephony (SPIT). SPIT is, up to a given extend, similar to email spam. However, it is expected to be more frustrating because of the real-time processing requirements of voice calls. In this paper we set the foundations of an adaptive approach that handles SPIT through a policy-based management approach (aSPM). aSPM incorporates a set of rules for SPIT attacks detections, together with appropriate actions and controls that should be enforced so as to counter these attacks. Furthermore, the policy is formally described \u2026",

A delay incident in one airport may affect the operational efficiency of others and generate various side effects to the whole aviation network. Flight delays are a widespread phenomenon nowadays, costing billions to the air transportation economy and degrading passenger's quality of service. Dependency graphs have been proposed in the past to understand the delay propagation phenomenon and analyze such cascading events by using dependency chains. In this work, we propose a risk-based method to analyze interdependencies and congestions in the aviation network. The methodology and the developed tool can assess delay incidents in airports and produce weighted risk dependency graphs, presenting how a delay that occurred in one airport may affect other interconnected airports.

            "Abstract": "The world has been afflicted by the rise of misinformation. The sheer volume of news produced daily necessitates the development of automated methods for separating fact from fiction. To tackle this issue, the computer science community has produced a plethora of approaches, documented in a number of surveys. However, these surveys primarily rely on one-dimensional solutions, i.e., deception detection approaches that focus on a specific aspect of misinformation, such as a particular topic, language, or source. Misinformation is considered a major obstacle for situational awareness, including cyber, both from a company and a societal point of view. This paper explores the evolving field of misinformation detection and analytics on information published in news articles, with an emphasis on methodologies that handle multiple dimensions of the fake news detection conundrum. We analyze and compare existing research on cross-dimensional methodologies. Our evaluation process is based on a set of criteria, including a predefined set of performance metrics, data pre-processing features, and domains of implementation. Furthermore, we assess the adaptability of each methodology in detecting misinformation in real-world news and thoroughly analyze our findings. Specifically, survey insights demonstrate that when a detection approach focuses on several dimensions (e.g., languages and topics, languages and sources, etc.), its performance improves, and it becomes more flexible in detecting false information across different contexts. Finally, we propose a set of research directions that could aid in furthering the development of more \u2026",

To demonstrate this, we developed a horror story, i.e., a Panopticon method, in order to reveal this threat and contribute in raising the social awareness over it. The Panopticon relies on data/opinion mining techniques; hence it classifies comments, videos and playlists, collected from the popular social medium YouTube.

ISO and US standards for cloud platforms are used to detect cloud-based attack vectors, threats and vulnerabilities both for CPS and traditional IT systems. Poisson distributions are proposed as a scientific means to quantify the likelihood of threat manifestation for assessing security risks. The key advantage of the presented method is its non-subjective likelihood threat estimation (contrary to current standards) and its ability to assess risk based on novel asset-based processes that fully support cloud services and CPS \u2026",

In the context of information security, it is defined as \u201cthe psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information\u201d. A very common and popular social engineering attack against valuable assets of companies, organizations and individuals, is phishing. This method remains as the top threat vector for cyberattacks, due to the indisputable fact that the exploitation of human vulnerabilities continues to be the most attractive, and at the same time, successful path for achieving it. Such attacks are used prevalently across the adversary spectrum, from novice cyber-criminals to advanced nation-state operations. This paper grapples with the development of a platform that evaluates human resources of an information system, by pinpointing potential weaknesses that can be used to exploit the human factor, aiming at an increase in security awareness level of users being assessed. During our research, we gathered, studied, classified and evaluated tools used to implement phishing attacks. Afterwards, we developed an integrated web-based framework capable of unifying those tools properly, performing a tool chain. Additionally, we devised plausible attack scenarios, with their anticipated results. In our research, we developed a reporting system, geared by predetermined custom metrics per victims' behavior. Furthermore, apart from the framework itself, our contribution includes spotting several legal issues arising from its usage at workplaces.

Yet, they cannot detect flaws that manifest due to erroneous translation of the software\u2019s functional requirements into the source code. The automated detection of logical errors that are attributed to a faulty implementation of applications\u2019 functionality, is a relatively uncharted territory. In previous research, we proposed a combination of automated analyses for logical error detection. In this paper, we develop a novel business-logic oriented method able to filter mathematical depictions of software logic in order to augment logical error detection, eliminate previous limitations in analysis and provide a formal tested logical error detection classification without subjective discrepancies. As a proof of concept, our method has been implemented in a prototype tool called PLATO that can detect various types of logical errors. Potential logical errors are thus detected that are ranked using a fuzzy logic system with two scales characterizing their impact:(i) a Severity scale, based on the execution paths\u2019 characteristics and Information Gain,(ii) a Reliability scale, based on the measured program\u2019s Computational Density. The method\u2019s effectiveness is shown using diverse experiments.

This method cannot guarantee that the resulting policies are compatible, neither it can ensure that the resulting protection levels are equivalent. We introduce a Security Policies Repository (SPR), which consists of a knowledge base, storing multiple security policies in a structured way. The SPR facilitates the juxtaposition of security policies, in order to detect, analyze, and resolve conflicts, and to compare and negotiate the protection level of each of the co- operating information systems. Reconciliation of security policies is achieved by means of developing mutually accepted meta-policies.",

A common way to launch a SPIT attack is the use of an automated procedure (bot), which generates calls and produces audio advertisements. In this paper, our goal is to design appropriate CAPTCHA to fight such bots. We focus on and develop audio CAPTCHA, as the audio format is more suitable for VoIP environments and we implement it in a SIP-based VoIP environment.

While this provides advantages for employees and businesses, it also leads to a multitude of shortcomings, most prevalent of which is the emergence of additional security risks. Previous to the outbreak, company computer networks were mainly confined within its facilities. The pandemic has now caused this network to \u201cspread thin,\u201d as the majority of employees work remotely. This has opened up a variety of new vulnerabilities, as workers\u2019 cyber protection is not the same at home as it is in office. Although the effects of the virus are now subsiding, working remotely has embedded itself as the new normal. Thus, it is imperative for company management to take the necessary steps to ensure business continuity and be prepared to deal with an increased number of cyber threats. In our research, we provide a detailed classification for a group of tools which will facilitate risk mitigation and prevention. We also provide a selection of automated tools such as vulnerability scanners, monitoring and logging tools, and antivirus software. We outline each tool using tables, to show useful information such as advantages, disadvantages, scalability, cost, and other characteristics. Additionally, we implement decision trees for each category of tools, in an attempt to assist in navigating the large amount of information presented in this paper.

Amongst the main reasons are their small size, their enhanced functionality and their ability to host many useful and attractive applications. However, this vast use of mobile platforms makes them an attractive target for conducting privacy and security attacks. This scenario increases the risk introduced by these attacks for personal mobile devices, given that the use of smartphones as business tools may extend the perimeter of an organization's IT infrastructure. Furthermore, smartphone platforms provide application developers with rich capabilities, which can be used to compromise the security and privacy of the device holder and her environment (private and/or organizational).

Security measures should be selected to provide the required level of protection in a cost-efficient manner. This is only feasible if specific characteristics of the information system are examined on a basis of a risk analysis methodology. This paper presents the results of a risk analysis, based on the CRAMM methodology, for a healthcare organization offering a patient home-monitoring service through the transmission of vital signs, focusing on the identified security needs and the proposed countermeasures. The architectural and functional models of this service were utilized for identifying and valuating the system assets, the associated threats and vulnerabilities, as well as for assessing the impact on the patients and on the service provider, should the security of any of these assets is affected. A set of adequate organizational, administrative and technical countermeasures is described for the remote vital signs monitoring service, thus providing the healthcare organization with a data protection framework that can be utilized for the development of its own security plan.",

The main goal of the paper is to study the chronicity of the stress level users experience, as depicted by OSN user generated content. In order to achieve that, we investigate whether collected data are able to facilitate the process of stress level detection. To this end, we perform unsupervised flat data classification of the user-generated content and formulate two working clusters which classify usage patterns that depict medium-to-low and medium-to-high stress levels respectively.

The use of anti-SPIT mechanisms, such as filters and audio CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computer and Humans Apart) can prevent unsolicited calls and lead to less unwanted traffic. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic model, in which the game is played between SPIT senders and internet telephony users. The game includes call filters and audio CAPTCHA, so as to classify incoming calls as legitimate or malicious. We show how the resulting model can be used to decide upon the trade-offs present in this problem and help us predict the SPIT sender\u2019s behavior. We also highlight the advantages in terms of SPIT call reduction of merely introducing CAPTCHA, and provide experimental verification of our results.",

            "Abstract": "Cyber threat information sharing is an imperative process towards achieving collaborative security, but it poses several challenges. One crucial challenge is the plethora of shared threat information. Therefore, there is a need to advance filtering of such information. While the state-of-the-art in filtering relies primarily on keyword- and domain-based searching, these approaches require sizable human involvement and rarely available domain expertise. Recent research revealed the need for harvesting of business information to fill the gap in filtering, albeit it resulted in providing coarse-grained filtering based on the utilization of such information. This paper presents a novel contextualized filtering approach that exploits standardized and multi-level contextual information of business processes. The contextual information describes the conditions under which a given threat information is actionable from an organization perspective. Therefore, it can automate filtering by measuring the equivalence between the context of the shared threat information and the context of the consuming organization. The paper directly contributes to filtering challenge and indirectly to automated customized threat information sharing. Moreover, the paper proposes the architecture of a cyber threat information sharing ecosystem that operates according to the proposed filtering approach and defines the characteristics that are advantageous to filtering approaches. Implementation of the proposed approach can support compliance with the Special Publication 800-150 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.",

In this work, we propose a practical method for applying steganography in these types of files. The proposed method consists of three distinct phases. The first one encrypts the hidden message, the second embeds it to the stego cover, while at the final step the stego cover is attached to a Matroska container. We tested our approach in various scenarios in order to evaluate the introduced overhead.

Current approaches assessing privacy risk lack user input, assuming that the value of each smartphone sub-asset (e.g. contact list, usage history) is perceived similarly across users. Thus, per user privacy risk assessment is not achievable. This paper refines our previous work on smartphone risk assessment by proposing an approach for assessing the privacy risk of Android users. Its cornerstone is impact valuation from users, as well as their usage profiles, which enables assessment of per user risk. Threat likelihood is assessed based on the presence of specific permission combinations, which we consider vulnerabilities that enable privacy threat scenarios. These permission combinations correspond to users\u2019 app profiles, i.e. to the app categories of Google Play that each user \u2026",

The proposed methodology dynamically assesses the evolution of cascading failures over time between assets involved in a business process of an infrastructure. This approach can be applied by a CI operator/owner to explore how a failure in a single component (asset) affects the other assets and relevant business processes. It could also be applied in an analysis that includes multiple CI operators in the same supply chain to explore the dependencies between their assets and explore how these affect the provision of key societal services. The paper presents a proof-of-concept tool, based on business-process risk assessment and graph modelling, and a realistic case example of a rail scheduling process.

A typical way to launch a SPIT attack is the use of an automated procedure (i.e., bot), which generates calls and produces unsolicited audio messages. A known way to protect against SPAM is a Reverse Turing Test, called CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computer and Humans Apart). In this paper, we evaluate existing audio CAPTCHA, as this type of format is more suitable for VoIP systems, to help them fight bots. To do so, we first suggest specific attributes-requirements that an audio CAPTCHA should meet in order to be effective. Then, we evaluate this set of popular audio CAPTCHA, and demonstrate that there is no existing implementation suitable enough for VoIP environments.

Even though the protection of such systems and services has been an international security priority, still, even after all those years, relevant research either focuses on individual ICS systems security (PLC, RTU and SCADA network protection and attacks), or uses high-level models to perform risk assessments, mostly from a system-of-systems scope that studies interdependencies. From an engineering perspective, current approaches address system resilience from an efficiency perspective (ie focusing on the availability of physical processes) while neglecting the security dimension of their components. Still, the availability and reliability requirements of such systems are directly affected by security incidents. To our knowledge, there is currently no process to integrate security-by-design in industrial critical infrastructure engineering. To this end, we present a method to integrate security risk assessment analysis into engineering design practices. We do this by modeling internal dependencies between physical components in critical industrial production processes to identify possible hotspots of system failures that are challenging to handle later in the development lifecycle, especially during operation. To validate our approach, we model and assess the present situation in a portion of an actual oil refining plant, thereby establishing a baseline model. Then we introduce risk mitigation measures by altering the design of the baseline model, resulting in a reduction of the overall cascade risk.",

In this paper, we propose an abstract model for describing SPIT attack strategies by incorporating the underlying threats and vulnerabilities of the VoIP technology regarding SPIT phenomenon. Our model is mainly focused on the signaling part of VoIP sessions (i.e. the SIP protocol), and it is based on the representation of attacks through attack graphs and attack trees. We also demonstrate how this model could be used for the development of a set of reusable attack scenarios (patterns), with an eye towards the development of a SPIT Detection System.",

As an example, we propose a new crypto-system, by mixing known robust techniques such as chain-block encryption and AES-like structures together with complex exponentiation to provide robust encryption of plaintext messages. The proposed method implements encryption by transforming complex numbers into position vectors in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system called the complex plane and utilizes the properties of the complex logarithm together with well-defined techniques from global standards (such as AES), in order to ensure robustness against cryptanalysis. This is made possible without implementing any computational costly algorithm. This has two important consequences: First, it may open up viable solutions to \u2026",

In VoIP, a new service in the role of Sphinx provides protection against SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony) by discriminating human callers from botnets. The VoIP Sphinx tool uses audio CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) that are controlled by an anti-SPIT policy mechanism. The design of the Sphinx service has been formally verified for the absence of side-effects in the VoIP services (robustness), as well as for its DoS-resistance. We describe the principles and innovations of Sphinx, together with experimental results from pilot use cases.",

E-voting should first comply with the existing legal and regulatory framework. Moreover, e-voting should be technically implemented in such a way that ensures adequate user requirements. As a result, the aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to identify the set of generic constitutional requirements, which should be met when designing an e-voting system for general elections. This set will lead to the specific (design) principles of a legally acceptable e-voting system. Second, to identify, using the Rational Unified Process, the requirements of an adequately secure e-voting system. These requirements stem from the design principles identified previously. The paper concludes that an e-voting capability should, for the time being, be considered only as a complementary means to \u2026",

Although transport sector and its network substructures are typically designed to withstand weather-related stressors, shifts in climate patterns will greatly increase potential risks. The area of climate adaptation planning is still relatively new, however a variety of processes and methodologies for assessing and reducing the vulnerability to climate change are currently being developed. These processes require and benefit from the use of geospatial analyses, software tools and web portals. In this research, we have focused on climate-related adaptation planning. We provide detailed classification of a set of tools that can facilitate adaptation assessment and risk planning.

Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand cascading effect of congestions and how to improve overall resilience in greater areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading failures using infrastructure dependency chains. In this paper, we propose a risk-based interdependency analysis methodology capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected junctions of the road network and provide mitigation solutions to increase traffic flow resilience. Dependency risk chains of junctions provide important information about which junctions \u2026",

More specifically, we explore if a security background affects the smartphone security awareness of the survey participants by splitting them in two groups, comprising of security savvy and non-security savvy users. The results of the statistical analysis indicate, inter alia, that the participants\u2019 security background has slight impact on their security awareness in the smartphone ecosystem.",

This SO provides capabilities, such as modeling of risk assessment knowledge, abstraction of security requirements, reusable security knowledge interoperability, aggregation and reasoning. The SO is based on the exploitation of security-related knowledge, derived from diverse sources. We demonstrate that the establishment of such a framework is feasible and, furthermore, that a SO can support critical security activities of an expert, e.g. security requirements identification, as well as selection of certain countermeasures. We also present and discuss an implementation of a specific SO. The implementation is accompanied by results regarding how a SO can be built and populated with security information.",

Its scope covers every election or decision-making process, which takes place through voting. Due mainly to the digital divide and to current technological limitation, electronic voting cannot be proposed as a universal means of voting but rather as an alternative option, supplemental to traditional voting means. An electronic voting process must be designed in such a way as to guarantee the general, free, equal and secret character of elections. In a democratic context an electronic voting system should respect and ensure attributes and properties such as transparency, verifiability, accountability, security and accuracy. Only then can it foster and promote the participation of the citizens, the legitimacy and the democratic transaction of the election process.",

Tools that automate code inspection mostly focus on the detection of a priori known defect patterns and security vulnerabilities. Automated detection of logical errors, due to a faulty implementation of applications\u2019 functionality is a relatively uncharted territory. Automation can be based on profiling the intended behavior behind the source code. In this paper, we present a code profiling method based on token classification. Our method combines an information flow analysis, the crosschecking of dynamic invariants with symbolic execution, and code classification heuristics with the use of a fuzzy logic system. Our goal is to detect logical errors and exploitable vulnerabilities. The theoretical underpinnings and the practical implementation of our approach are discussed. We test the APP_LogGIC tool that implements the proposed analysis on two real-world applications. The results show that profiling the intended program behavior is feasible in diverse applications. We discuss in detail the heuristics used to overcome the problem of state space explosion and that of the large data sets. Code metrics and test results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This paper extends the work that appears in an article currently submitted to an international conference with proceedings. In this adequately extended version of our method we present classification mechanisms that can take into account multiple user input and provide a detailed description of the \u2026",

In previous research, we have proposed a model for assessing the cumulative security risk of cascading threats due to high-order dependencies between infrastructures. However, recent empirical studies indicate that common-cause failures may result in extremely high impact situations, which may be comparable with or even more devastating than the cascading effects of high-order dependencies. This paper presents an extension to our model, which permits the assessment of the risk arising from complex situations involving multiple cascading failures triggered by major or concurrent common-cause events. The paper also discusses a realistic scenario that is used as a test case for the model extension.",

Voice over IP enables the transmission of telephone calls over the Internet, as opposed to plain old telephone service. Internet Telephony essentially means low-cost phone calls, i.e. a clear benefit for both consumers and businesses, which may also lead to cheap methods of mass advertising. Still, industry observers warn that VoIP's low-cost and openness makes it relatively easy for spammers to send unsolicited audio-commercials to VoIP voice-mail inboxes, in much the same way they currently bombard e-mail inboxes. In this paper we set the foundations of an adaptive approach that handles SPIT through an adaptive anti-SPIT policy-based framework (ASPF).

Still, contrary to previous research, the proposed approach: (i) provides increased bandwidth and allows us to exfiltrate large amounts of data with improved execution times while avoiding detection, and (ii) removes the administration privilege constraint that existed in previous implementations.

We exploit the notarization paradigm and propose a mechanism for cumulative data notarization that results in a successive trust transition towards new entities, modern technologies, and refreshed data. A future relying party will have to trust only the information provided by the last notary, in order to verify the validity of the initial signature, thus eliminating any dependency on ceased entities, obsolete data, and weak old technologies. The proposed framework uses recursive XML elements so that a notarization token structure encapsulates an identical data structure containing a previous notarization token.",

In the recent literature, methodologies have been proposed that can be used to identify organisation-wise security threats, or even first-order dependency risk (i.e., risk deriving from direct dependencies). However, there is a lack of work in the area of multi-order dependencies, i.e., assessing the cumulative effects of a single incident, on infrastructures that are connected indirectly. In this paper, we propose a method to identify and assess multi-order dependencies. Based on previous work, we utilise existing first-order dependency graphs, in order to assess the effect of a disruption to consequent infrastructures. In this way, it may be possible to identify and prevent security threats of very high impact from a macroscopic view, which would be hard to identify if we only examine first \u2026",

Increasing focus has also been put on how to properly regulate the technology. However, implications can also be significant in the international political economy sphere. Most scholars believe that if 3D printing will allow for the creation of not only prototypes but mass production, then the economies of scale advantage of manufacturing platforms like China or other states with a similar production profile will perhaps stand a lot to lose. However, even a maximal deployment of 3D printing will not completely make the Current Account imbalances recede. To the contrary, it will place the focus more on input materials, but also on intellectual property.

In this paper, we propose a set of good practices, which are essential for the establishment of a global identification scheme based on e-passports, together with an analysis of the security and privacy issues that may arise. We argue that an e-passport may also be exploited in other applications as a globally interoperable PKI-enabled \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Various commercial and open-source tools exist, developed both by the industry and academic groups, which are able to detect various types of security bugs in applications\u2019 source code. However, most of these tools are prone to non-negligible rates of false positives and false negatives, since they are designed to detect a priori specified types of bugs. Also, their analysis scalability to large programs is often an issue. To address these problems, we present a new source code analysis technique based on execution path classification. We develop a prototype tool to test our method\u2019s ability to detect different types of information-flow dependent bugs. Our approach is based on classifying the Risk of likely exploits inside source code execution paths using two measuring functions: Severity and Vulnerability. For an Application Under Test (AUT), we analyze every single pair of input vector and program sink in \u2026",
