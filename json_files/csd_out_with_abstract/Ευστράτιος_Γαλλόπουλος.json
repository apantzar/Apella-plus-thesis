            "Abstract": "Manycores like the Intel Xeon Phi and graphics processing units like the NVIDIA Tesla series are prime examples of systems for accelerating applications that run on current CPU multicores. It is therefore of interest to build fast, reliable linear system solvers targeting these architectures. Moreover, it is of interest to conduct cross comparisons between algorithmic implementations in order to organize the types of optimizations and transformations that are necessary when porting in order to succeed in obtaining performance portability. In this work we aim to present a detailed study of the adaptation and implementation of g-Spike for the Xeon Phi. g-Spike was originally developed to solve general tridiagonal systems on GPUs, on which it returns high performance while also solving systems for which other state-of-the-art general tridiagonal GPU solvers do not succeed. The solver is based on the Spike framework, using QR factorization without pivoting implemented via Givens rotations. We show the necessary adaptations on the Xeon Phi because of the significant differences in the programming models and the underlying architectures as well as the relative performance differences for data access and processing operations.",

            "Publication url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0606047",
            "Abstract": "There are several ideas being used today for Web information retrieval, and specifically in Web search engines. The PageRank algorithm is one of those that introduce a content-neutral ranking function over Web pages. This ranking is applied to the set of pages returned by the Google search engine in response to posting a search query. PageRank is based in part on two simple common sense concepts: (i)A page is important if many important pages include links to it. (ii)A page containing many links has reduced impact on the importance of the pages it links to. In this paper we focus on asynchronous iterative schemes to compute PageRank over large sets of Web pages. The elimination of the synchronizing phases is expected to be advantageous on heterogeneous platforms. The motivation for a possible move to such large scale distributed platforms lies in the size of matrices representing Web structure. In orders of magnitude:  pages with  nonzero elements and  bytes just to store a small percentage of the Web (the already crawled); distributed memory machines are necessary for such computations. The present research is part of our general objective, to explore the potential of asynchronous computational models as an underlying framework for very large scale computations over the Grid. The area of ``internet algorithmics'' appears to offer many occasions for computations of unprecedent dimensionality that would be good candidates for this framework.",

Multidamping is based on some new useful properties of Google type matrices. The approach can be generalized and could help in the exploration of new approximations for list-based ranking.

In this work we describe the design and implementation of an environment that integrates a suite of state-of-the-art algorithms running on a cluster of workstations to enable the matrix pseudospectrum become a practical tool for scientists and engineers.

Our approach is based on combining rank revealing methods with compositions of dense and sparse randomized dimensionality reduction transforms. We first develop a set of fast novel algorithms for rank estimation, column subset selection and least squares preconditioning. We then describe the design and implementation of leverage score estimators based on these primitives. These estimators are also effective for rank deficient input, which is frequently the case in data analytics applications. We provide detailed complexity analyses for all algorithms as well as meaningful approximation bounds and comparisons with the state-of-the-art.

The idea behind the method is to use points from an already existing pseudospectrum level curve \u2202\u039b\u03f5 to generate in parallel the points of a new level curve \u2202\u039b\u03b4 such that \u03b4<\u03f5. This process can be continued for several steps to approximate several pseudospectrum level curves lying inside the original curve. It is showed via theoretical analysis and experimental evidence that PsDM is embarrassingly parallel, like GRID, and that it adjusts to the geometric characteristics of the pseudospectrum; in particular it captures disconnected components. Results obtained on a parallel system using MPI validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate interesting load-balancing issues.",

These techniques are also extended to the case of PDDP(l), a multiway clustering algorithm generalizing PDDP. To handle data that do not lend themselves to linear separability, the algebraic framework is established for a kernel variant, KPDDP. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of the above methods and suggest that it is advantageous to steer PDDP using k-means. It is also shown that KPDDP can provide results \u2026",

In particular, we focus on linear systems appearing in the context of stochastic estimation of the diagonal of the matrix inverse in Uncertainty Quantification. pp-bcg is based on the block Conjugate Gradient algorithm combined with Galerkin projections to accelerate the convergence rate of the solution process of the linear systems. Numerical experiments on massively parallel architectures illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of efficiency and convergence rate, as well as its effectiveness relative to the (block) Conjugate Gradient and the Cholesky-based ScaLAPACK solver.

EIGENREC builds a low dimensional model of an inter-item proximity matrix that combines a traditional similarity component, with a scaling operator, designed to regulate the effects of the prior item popularity on the final recommendation list. A comprehensive set of experiments on the MovieLens and the Yahoo datasets, based on widely applied performance metrics suggest that EIGENREC outperforms several state of-the-art algorithms, in terms of Standard and Long-Tail recommendation accuracy, while exhibiting low susceptibility to the problems caused by Sparsity, even its most extreme manifestations - the Cold-start problems.",

It utilizes ideas from theoretical computer science, numerical linear algebra, highperformance computing, and machine learning and statistics to develop, analyze, implement, and apply novel matrix algorithms. These algorithms can then facilitate the manipulation and analysis of socalled big data in numerous areas. Many popular machine learning and data analysis computations can be formulated as problems in linear algebra, but the questions of interest in machine learning and data analysis applications are very different from those historically considered in numerical linear algebra.For instance, NPhard problems have made their way into numerical linear algebra, a significant paradigm shift for numerical analysts who have traditionally formulated their problems to be solvable in polynomial time. As an example, most formulations of the Column Subset Selection problem are intractable, as are most formulations of the so called Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem.

Recently, the first limitation was to a major degree overpassed with the new TOPological INVersion (TOPINV) algorithm which was used for inversion of systems with up to 18, or even more unknown variables. The novelty of this algorithm is that it is not based on the principle of the mean minimum misfit (cost function) between observations and model predictions, used by most inversion techniques. The new algorithm investigates for each gridpoint whether misfits of each observation are within specified uncertainty intervals, and stores clusters of \u2018successful\u2019 gridpoints in matrix form.

We advocate the asynchronous computation model [1] as a suitable framework for building such algorithms and propose Jylab [2] as an interactive multithreading workbench for comfortably exploring their behaviour. We demonstrate the flexibility of this environment in the asynchronous computation of PageRank and comment on some interesting properties of the computation itself. In this context a multicore machine naturally boosts the performance of an application consisting of asynchronously computing threads and Jylab facilitates such multithreaded designs. Ultimately concurrency at CPU level can drive decisions for alternative ways of organizing concurrency at Internet level but can also serve as the final execution platform. 3 4",

Interesting recent efforts focus on GPU implementations. Algorithms based on cyclic reduction, parallel cyclic reduction and recursive doubling and hybrids were studied in [4]; these depend on symmetric positive definiteness or diagonal dominance to proceed without breakdown. For very large tridiagonal and narrow banded matrices, a well known approach for obtaining parallelism and high performance is to use partitioning. As shown recently by Chang et al., the Spike partitioning framework ([2, 3]) combined with a special pivoting algorithm for the resulting subsystems can lead to a scalable, highly performing tridiagonal solver [1]. In this presentation we revisit a Spike approach combined with Givens rotations to solve the subsystems, as first proposed in [3], present its CUDA implementation and evaluate its performance and stability.",

Several research efforts have been attempting to make the problem tractable by means of better algorithms and utilization of all possible computational resources. One common goal is to bring to users the power to extract pseudospectrum information from their applications, on the computational environments they generally use, at a cost that is sufficiently low to render these computations routine. To this end, we investigate a scheme based on i) iterative methods for computing pseudospectra via approximations of the resolvent norm, with ii) a computational platform based on a cluster of PCs and iii) a programming environment based on MATLAB enhanced with MPI functionality and show \u2026",

The solver is based on the Spike framework, applying Givens rotations and QR factorization without pivoting. It also implements a low-rank modification strategy to compute the Spike DS decomposition even when the partitioning defines singular submatrices along the diagonal. The method is also used to solve the reduced system resulting from the Spike partitioning. Numerical experiments with problems of high order indicate that g-Spike is competitive in runtime with existing GPU methods, and can provide acceptable results when other methods cannot be applied or fail.",

TOPINV is based on repeated exhaustive grid searches and its merit is to identify n-D clusters of points that satisfy the observation system, taking into consideration the errors of the observations. Still, the main limitation is the excessive computational load for common CPU computers. Here we present results of the implementation of TOPINV in a GPU high performance platform in order to speed up calculations.",

This paper addresses the open question of the effectiveness of the transfer function scheme for the computation of the pseudospectrum of large matrices. It is shown that the scheme can be combined with certain Krylov type linear solvers, such as restarted fom, for the efficient solution of shifted linear systems of the form (A\u2212 zkI)\u2212 1b, for a large number of shifts zk. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the methods developed in this paper. Tools for the effective combination of the transfer function framework with path following methods are developed. A hybrid method is proposed that combines transfer functions with iterative solvers and path following and is shown to be a powerful and cost effective scheme for computing pseudospectra of very large matrices.",

            "Abstract": "We describe the development of a method for the efficient computation of the smallest singular values and corresponding vectors for large sparse matrices [4]. The method combines state-of-the-art techniques that make it a useful computational tool appropriate for large scale computations. The method relies upon Lanczos bidiagonalization (LBD) with partial reorthogonalization [6], enhanced with implicit restarts and harmonic Ritz values. We note that although LBD has been successfully used for the approximation of largest singular values [5], our target in this paper is the computation of the smallest singular values. Thus, in order to design a matrix free method by avoiding shift-and-invert techniques we rely on harmonic Ritz values.Using LBD for the approximation of the smallest singular values often causes the lengths of the Lanczos bases to become quite large in order to obtain accurate approximations. For that reason, we embed an implicit restarting mechanism in LBD [12], which maintains memory requirements constant at each restart. In order to avoid the explicit inversion of A, we employ a harmonic Ritz value shift strategy [10, 9]. Harmonic Ritz values and vectors have been reported (see eg [8]) to be",

A central feature of these techniques is an initial clustering phase on the columns of the term-document matrix, followed by partial svd on the columns constituting each cluster. The extracted information is used to build effective low rank approximations to the original matrix as well as for IR. The algorithms can be expressed by means of rank reduction formulas. Experiments indicate that these methods can achieve good overall performance for matrix approximation and IR and compete well with existing schemes.",

Most documents have an inherent hierarchical structure that renders desirable the use of flexible multidimensional representations such as those offered by tensor objects. We focus on the performance of special instances of a Tensor Model, in which documents are represented using second-order (matrices) and third-order tensors. We exploit the local-structure encapsulated by the proposed representation to approximate these tensors using high order singular value and nonnegative tensor decompositions and assemble the results to form the final term-document matrix. We analyze the spectral properties of this matrix and observe that topic identification is enhanced by deploying k-plane clustering. Our results provide evidence that tensor based models can be particularly effective for IR, offering an excellent alternative to traditional VSM and LSI especially for text collections of multi-topic documents.",

In particular, we are interested in expediting the stochastic estimation of the diagonal of the inverse covariance (precision) matrix that holds a wealth of information concerning the quality of data collections, especially when the matrices are symmetric positive definite and dense. Schemes built on direct methods incur a prohibitive cubic cost. Recently proposed iterative methods can remedy this but the overall cost is raised again as the convergence of stochastic estimators can be slow. The motivation behind our approach stems from the fact that the computational bottleneck in stochastic estimation is the application of the precision matrix on a set of appropriately selected vectors. The proposed method combines block conjugate gradient with a block-seed approach for multiple right-hand sides, taking advantage of the nature of the right \u2026",

In this presentation we suggest that the asynchronous computation model is an attractive paradigm for organizing concurrent computations spanning data on Web scale.

After an introduction on asynchronous computing in general and'page ranking'in particular, we present results from the asynchronous compution of PageRank using typical combinations of execution units (processes, threads) and communication mechanisms (message passing, shared memory). Sound convergence properties predicted by theory are numerically verified and interesting patterns of behavior are unveiled. Our experiments were performed on Jylab, an evolving environment enabling interactive multithreading and multiprocessing computations.

OkW combines techniques from computational geometry and numerical linear algebra and appears to be particularly effective when applied on difficult datasets of moderate dimensionality.",

The Poisson pressure correction equation and the structural part of the fluid-structure interaction are formulated and solved numerically in the continuous Galerkin framework.

In this paper, we describe Cobra, a domain-based method for the computation of pseudospectra that combines predictor corrector path following with a one-dimensional grid. The algorithm offers large and medium grain parallelism and becomes particularly attractive when we seek fine resolution of the pseudospectrum boundary. We implement Cobra using standard LAPACK components and show that it is more robust than the existing path following technique and faster than it and the traditional grid method. Cobra is also combined with a partial SVD algorithm to produce an effective parallel method for computing the matrix pseudospectrum.",

It captures the idea of reusing some of the best open source software projects' functionality within the context of a single, net-aware, interactive environment. The original implementation of this idea resulted in a system built around a portable interpreter supported by a carefully selected suite of libraries spanning a comprehensive set of applications including scripting, numerical linear algebra, distributed/Grid computing and Internet algorithmics. Because Jylab is a multicomponent PSE system, it is quite natural to base its implementation on a robust platform automating the management of complex stacks of software components, ie self-describing objects. The Eclipse Platform meets this basic prerequisite, additionally providing many other interesting integration facilities, an extensive set of ready-to-use plug-ins and is also \u2026",

NNDSVD can readily be combined with existing NMF algorithms. The basic algorithm contains no randomization and is based on two SVD processes, one approximating the data matrix, the other approximating positive sections of the resulting partial SVD factors utilizing an algebraic property of unit rank matrices. Simple practical variants for NMF with dense factors are described. NNDSVD is also well suited to initialize NMF algorithms with sparse factors. Many numerical examples suggest that NNDSVD leads to rapid reduction of the approximation error of many NMF algorithms.",

It is a special case of a family of link-based rankings, commonly referred to as functional rankings. Functional rankings are computed as power series of a stochastic matrix derived from the adjacency matrix of the graph. This general formulation of functional rankings enables their use in diverse applications, ranging from traditional search applications to identification of spam and outliers in networks. This paper presents a novel algorithmic (re)formulation of commonly used functional rankings, such as LinearRank, TotalRank and Generalized Hyperbolic Rank. These rankings can be approximated by finite series representations. We prove that polynomials of stochastic matrices can be expressed as products of Google matrices (matrices having the form used in Google's original PageRank formulation).

In fact, almost every computational task relies on recursive techniques and hence involves recurrence relations. Therefore, recurrence solvers are computational kernels and need to be implemented as efficient primitives on various architectures.

A common example of a function is the inverse of a large, sparse matrix, which is the focus of this paper. When the evaluation of the function is expensive, the task is computationally challenging because the standard approach is based on a Monte Carlo method which converges slowly. We present a different approach that exploits the pattern correlation, if present, between the diagonal of the inverse of the matrix and the diagonal of some approximate inverse that can be computed inexpensively. We leverage various sampling and fitting techniques to fit the diagonal of the approximation to the diagonal of the inverse. Depending on the quality of the approximate inverse, our method may serve as a standalone kernel for providing a fast trace estimate with a small number of samples. Furthermore, the \u2026",

The methodology is very flexible, providing the means for accelerating existing algorithms. It is also combined with kernel techniques to enable the analysis of data for which linear techniques are insufficient. Numerous classification examples indicate that the proposed technique is effective and efficient with an overall performance superior than existing linear and nonlinear LSI-based approaches.",
