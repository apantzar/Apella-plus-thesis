            "Abstract": "We introduce Planar Disjoint Paths Completion, a completion counterpart of the Disjoint Paths problem, and study its parameterized complexity. The problem can be stated as follows: given a, not necessarily connected, plane graph G,  k pairs of terminals, and a face F of G,  find a minimum-size set of edges, if one exists, to be added inside F so that the embedding remains planar and the pairs become connected by k disjoint paths in the augmented network. Our results are twofold: first, we give an upper bound on the number of necessary additional edges when a solution exists. This bound is a function of k, independent of the size of G. Second, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable, in particular, it can be solved in time .",

Lawler gave an FPTAS for it some twenty years ago. If the jobs have positive weights the problem of minimizing total weighted tardiness seems to be considerably more intricate. To our knowledge there are no approximability results for it. In this paper, we initiate the study of approximation algorithms for the problem. We examine first the weighted problem with a fixed number of due dates and we design a pseudopolynomial algorithm for it. We show how to transform the pseudopolynomial algorithm to an FPTAS for the case where the weights are polynomially bounded. For the general case with an arbitrary number of due dates, we provide a quasipolynomial randomized algorithm which produces a schedule whose expected value has an additive error \u2026",

The demand of each commodity must be routed along a single path so that the total flow through any edge is at most its capacity. Moreover the cost of the solution should not exceed a given budget. An important open question is whether a simultaneous (2, 1)-approximation can be achieved for minimizing congestion and cost, ie, the budget constraint should not be violated. In this note we show that this is possible for the case of 2-splittable flows, ie, flows where the demand of each commodity is routed along at most two paths. Our result holds under the \u201cno-bottleneck\u201d assumption, ie, the maximum demand does not exceed the minimum capacity.",

In the context of this problem, Robertson and Seymour introduced the celebrated irrelevant vertex technique that has since become standard in graph algorithms. The technique consists of detecting a vertex that is irrelevant in the sense that its removal creates an equivalent instance of the problem. That way, one may solve the problem in  steps, as the detection of an irrelevant vertex takes  time and at most  vertices may need to be removed. In this paper we study the Planar Disjoint Paths problem where the input graph is planar. We introduce an extension of the irrelevant vertex technique where all the irrelevant vertices are removed simultaneously so that an instance of the Planar Disjoint Paths problem can be transformed in a linear number of steps to an equivalent one that has bounded treewidth. As a consequence, the Planar Disjoint Paths problem can be solved in linear time for every fixed number of terminals.",

We study the traffic equilibria arising from selfish routing of individual users in networks with side constraints. For the problem without side constraints the classic Wardrop principle suggests that in equilibrium for each origin-destination pair the latency on all the used routes is equal or less to the latency on all unused routes. In this paper we use a natural extension of the Wardrop principle [13] in order to obtain results on selfish routing with side constraints. The extended Wardrop principle suggests that in equilibrium flow is routed along paths of minimal latency according to a modified function that essentially incorporates penalty terms for the side constraints. This approach provides a basis for the systematic application of relevant optimization theory to selfish routing problems.",

The corresponding literature is extensive. In this chapter we limit ourselves mostly to results on offline approximation algorithms for problems on general graphs as influenced from the network flow perspective. Surveys examining the underlying graph theory, combinatorial problems in VLSI, and disjoint paths on special graph classes can be found in [35, 36, 86, 88, 76, 83, 75, 51].An instance of disjoint paths consists of a (directed or undirected) graph G=(V, E) and a multiset T={(si, ti): si\u2208 V, ti\u2208 V, i= 1,..., k} of k source-sink pairs. Any source or sink is called a terminal. An element of T is also called a commodity. One seeks a set of edge-(or vertex-) disjoint paths P1, P2,..., Pk, where Pi is an si\u2212 ti path, i= 1,..., k. In the case of vertex-disjoint paths we are interested in paths that are internally disjoint, ie, a terminal may appear in more than one pair in T. We abbreviate the edge-disjoint paths problem by Edp. The notation introduced will be used throughout the chapter to refer to an input instance. We will also denote| V| by n and| E| by m for the corresponding graph. Based on whether G is directed or undirected and the edge-or vertex-disjointness condition one obtains 1",

One seeks to quantify the resulting price of anarchy, i.e., the ratio of the cost of the worst traffic equilibrium to the system optimum, as a function of \u03b1. It is well-known that for \u03b1=0 and linear latency functions the price of anarchy is at most 4/3 (J. ACM 49, 236\u2013259, 2002). If \u03b1 tends to 1, the price of anarchy should also tend to 1 for any reasonable algorithm used by the coordinator.  We analyze two such algorithms for Stackelberg routing, LLF and SCALE.

We generalize previous results of Cole, Dodis and Roughgarden that held for a single origin-destination pair to the multicommodity setting. Our approach, which could be of independent interest, is based on the formulation of traffic equilibria as a nonlinear complementarity problem by Aashtiani and Magnanti [1]. We extend this formulation so that each of its solutions will give us a set of taxes that forces the network users to conform, at equilibrium, to a certain prescribed routing. We use the special nature of the prescribed minimum-latency flow in order to reduce the difficult nonlinear complementarity formulation to a pair of primal-dual linear programs.

From an algorithmic perspective, the related questions concern whether there are compact formulations even for problems that are known to admit polynomial-time algorithms. We propose a framework for proving lower bounds on the size of extended formulations. We do so by introducing a specific type of extended relaxations that we call product relaxations and is motivated by the study of the Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy. Then we show that for every approximate relaxation of a polytope P, there is a product relaxation that has the same size and is at least as strong. We provide a methodology for proving lower bounds on the size of approximate product relaxations by lower bounding the chromatic number of an underlying hypergraph, whose vertices correspond to gap-inducing vectors. We extend the definition of product relaxations and our methodology to mixed integer sets. However in this case we are able to show that mixed product relaxations are at least as powerful as a special family of extended formulations. As an application of our method we show an exponential lower bound on the size of approximate mixed product formulations for the metric capacitated facility location problem, a problem which seems to be intractable for linear programming as far as constant-gap compact formulations are concerned.",

Two generalizations of UFL are capacitated facility location (CFL) and lower-bounded facility location (LBFL). In the former, every facility has a capacity which is the maximum demand that can be assigned to it, while in the latter, every open facility is required to serve a given minimum amount of demand. Both CFL and LBFL are approximable within a constant factor but their respective natural LP relaxations have an unbounded integrality gap. According to Shmoys and Williamson, the existence of a relaxation-based algorithm for CFL is one of the top 10 open problems in approximation algorithms. In this paper we give the first results on this problem. We provide substantial evidence against the existence of a good LP relaxation for CFL by showing unbounded integrality gaps for two families of strengthened formulations. The first family we consider is the hierarchy of LPs resulting from repeated applications of the lift-and-project Lov\\'{a}sz-Schrijver procedure starting from the standard relaxation. We show that the LP relaxation for CFL resulting after  rounds, where  is the number of facilities in the instance, has unbounded integrality gap. Note that the Lov\\'{a}sz-Schrijver procedure is known to yield an exact formulation for CFL in at most  rounds. We also introduce the family of proper relaxations which generalizes to its logical extreme the classic star relaxation, an equivalent form of the natural LP. We characterize the integrality gap of proper relaxations for both LBFL and CFL and show a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In a covering integer program (CIP), we seek an n-vector x of nonnegative integers, which minimizes c T\u00b7 x, subject to Ax\u2a7e b, where all entries of A, b, c are nonnegative. In their most general form, CIPs include also multiplicity constraints of the type x\u2a7d d, ie, arbitrarily large integers are not acceptable in the solution. The multiplicity constraints incur a dichotomy with respect to approximation between (0, 1)-CIPs whose matrix A contains only zeros and ones and the general case. Let m denote the number of rows of A. The well known O (log m) cost approximation with respect to the optimum of the linear relaxation is valid for general CIPs, but multiplicity constraints can be dealt with effectively only in the (0, 1) case. In the general case, existing algorithms that match the integrality gap for the cost objective violate the multiplicity constraints by a multiplicative O (log m) factor. We make progress by defining column \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the partially ordered knapsack problem (POK) we are given a set N of items and a partial order\u227a P on N. Each item has a size and an associated weight. The objective is to pack a set N\u2032\u2286 N of maximum weight in a knapsack of bounded size. N\u2032 should be precedence-closed, ie, be a valid prefix of\u227a P. POK is a natural generalization, for which very little is known, of the classical Knapsack problem. In this paper we present both positive and negative results. We give an FPTAS for the important case of a two-dimensional partial order, a class of partial orders which is a substantial generalization of the series-parallel class, and we identify the first non-trivial special case for which a polynomial-time algorithm exists. Our results have implications for approximation algorithms for scheduling precedence-constrained jobs on a single machine to minimize the sum of weighted completion times, a problem closely related \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A basic problem faced by designers of high-bandwidth switches and routers is to provide effective techniques for scheduling the routing of cells through crossbars. The problem is particularly important under heavy loads or when quality-of-service (QoS) is to be supported. Much previous work on scheduling has focused on maximum bipartite matching (MBM), maximum weight bipartite matching (MWBM), and heuristics to approximate MBM and MWBM solutions. In this paper, we introduce the shakeup technique: a randomized approach that can be used in conjunction with a number of existing heuristics to substantially improve solution quality. The shakeup approach is conceptually simple and is supported by both theoretical and experimental results. In addition, this paper provides for the first time a framework for experimental scheduler analysis. We give extensive head-to-head comparisons of stability ranges for a \u2026",
