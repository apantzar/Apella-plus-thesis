            "Abstract": "This paper describes a new paradigm to realize network virtualization and defines two novel concepts, network planes and parallel Internets, to achieve service differentiation. These concepts are packaged in a technology-agnostic and a multi-dimensional approach for the delivery of Internet protocol (IP) service differentiation, both intra- and inter-domain. The definition of the aforementioned concepts covers several dimensions, mainly routing, forwarding, and traffic management ones. Unlike some radical \u201cPost IP\u201d proposals, this paper advocates an evolutionary approach for enhancing the level of experienced connectivity services (including quality of service and robustness) and therefore to enhance the Internet of the future. Both the rationale and the merits of our approach are explained. In addition, this paper focuses on the critical problem of determining the network planes and parallel Internets to be \u2026",

As such it presents beneficial properties for multi-source and/or multicast communication. In this paper we investigate enhancing the efficiency of multi-source content delivery in the context of Content-Centric Networking (CCN) with the usage of fountain codes. In particular, we examine whether the combination of fountain coding with the in-network caching capabilities of CCN can further improve performance. We also present an enhancement of CCN's Interest forwarding mechanism that aims at minimizing duplicate transmissions that may occur in a multi-source transmission scenario, where all available content providers and caches with matching (cached) content transmit data packets \u2026",

Previous research on business\u2010oriented network and service optimization has mainly focused on optimizing individual business indicators, such as profit and revenue, in isolation without analyzing the effect on network configurations and the subsequent impact on other indicators. Given that different business objectives are usually incompatible, a single network configuration cannot optimize them simultaneously. Determining the configuration and the associated trade\u2010offs that satisfy multiple objectives is a complex task. This paper addresses this gap and presents a framework that derives policy configurations that optimize the business value of the network infrastructure \u2026",

In this paper we examine how current agreements between ISPs should be enhanced to propagate QoS information between domains, and, in the absence of any form of central control, how these agreements may be used together to guarantee end-to-end QoS levels across all involved domains of control/ownership. Armed with this capability, individual ISPs may build concrete relationships with their peers where responsibilities may be formally agreed in terms of \u2026",

Nevertheless, an increasing number of Low Latency Applications (LLAs) notably in the entertainment, IoT, and automative domains require response times much smaller than the supported ones by the typical \u201cclient-to-cloud\u201d network model. Cloudlets have been introduced as \u201cdata centres in a box\u201d, for bringing computing resources \u201ccloser\u201d to the end users. As a result, LLAs can take advantage of cloudlets to improve their Quality-of-Service (QoS) by reducing the underlying response times between their users and application instances' location. In this work, we study the emerging market of stateful LLAs' provisioning over geo-distributed third-party cloudlets.

Instead of focusing on the traditional Steiner tree based multicast routing optimisation, we consider plain IP based approaches in which routing is controlled through optimised multi-topology-aware IGP/BGP configurations. The benefit is that no dedicated MPLS tunnelling is required for multicast traffic delivery across multiple domains. In this paper we propose a set of heuristic algorithms for the formulated multi-objective optimisation problem considering both intra- and inter-domain operation. Through our simulation experiments, we show that the proposed schemes achieve significant improvement in the relevant performance compared to conventional approaches",

Given the open-group IP multicast service model, it is important to perform sender access control so as to prevent group members from receiving irrelevant data, and also protect the multicast tree from various Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In comparison to source based and unidirectional shared trees where the data source can be authorized or authenticated at the single root or rendezvous point, in bi-directional routing this is a much more difficult problem since hosts can send data to all group members directly from any point in the tree. In this paper we propose a dynamic sender access control mechanism for bi-directional multicast trees so that irrelevant data is policed and discarded as it reaches any on-tree router.

This shift from centralized to edge clouds has the potential to open new horizons for application development, supporting new low-latency services and, ultimately, creating new markets for storage and processing resources.

In CCNs, every router caches packets of content and reuses those that are still in the cache, when subsequently requested. It is this caching feature of CCNs that we model and evaluate in this paper.Our modelling proceeds both analytically and by simulation.

In location-based routing protocols, the control traffic is mainly due to location-updates, queries and responses. Our scheme employs a novel geographically-oriented clustering scheme in order to minimize control traffic without impairing performance. In our location management scheme, nodes are assigned home-zones, and are required to send their location-updates to their respective home-zones through a dominating-set. This strategy, unlike similar location-management approaches, minimizes inevitable superfluous flooding by every node, and prevents location updates and queries from traversing the entire network \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Part 3: Resource Allocation; International audience; There has long been a need for a robust and reliable system which distributes traffic across multiple paths. In particular such a system must rarely reorder packets, must not require per-flow state, must cope with different paths having different bandwidths and must be self-tuning in a variety of network contexts. PREFLEX, proposed herein, uses estimates of loss rate to balance congestion. This paper describes a method of automatically adjusting how PREFLEX will split traffic in order to balance loss across multiple paths in a variety of network conditions. Equations are derived for the automatic tuning of the time scale and traffic split at a decision point. The algorithms described allow the load balancer to self-tune to network conditions. The calculations are simple and do not place a large burden on a router which would implement the algorithm. The algorithm is \u2026",

The paper first introduces a holistic architecture that describes the key functions required to support inter-domain QoS, and then proceeds to present results from two major components of the architecture. A genetic algorithm for QoS-aware offline inter-domain traffic engineering is first presented, and it is shown through simulation studies how this can optimise the apportionment of QoS provisioning between adjacent domains. Secondly, QoS enhancements to BGP are proposed and the results of a testbed implementation are described, demonstrating how this QoS-enhanced BGP can deliver inter-domain QoS routing.",

As such, decentralized solutions that are flexible and adaptive to traffic and network dynamics are of paramount importance. To this end, we have been developing an in-network management approach in which an intelligent substrate allows the dynamic reconfiguration of resources according to network conditions. The set of nodes forming this logical structure are able to communicate with each other to coordinate their decisions. While in previous work we investigated the use of full-mesh and ring structures to connect the substrate nodes, we consider here a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of the other two. We describe algorithms that can be practically used to compute this hybrid structure \u2026",

We model collaborative media streaming for the case of the London Underground train network.

In this paper we shift away from this over-lay approach and address the bandwidth constrained IP multicast TE directly based on link state IGP routing protocols. The objective is that, through plain PIM-SM shortest path routing with optimized Multi-topology IS-IS (M-ISIS) link weights, the resulting multicast trees are geared towards minimal consump-tion of bandwidth resources. We apply Genetic Algorithms (GA) to the calculation of optimized M-ISIS link weights that specifically cater for engineered PIM-SM routing with bandwidth guarantees. Our evaluation results show that GA-based multicast traffic engineering consumes significantly less bandwidth resources in comparison with conventional IP approaches, while it also exhibits higher capability of eliminating/alleviating link congestion. The key contribu-tion is a methodology for engineering multicast flows in a pure IP environment, without MPLS explicit routing that potentially suffers from scalability problems in terms of LSP maintenance.",

These providers\u2019 interactions occur at the service layer that result in the establishment of QoS-aware service agreements between providers. This needs to be supported by appropriate service management and traffic engineering capabilities per provider domain as well as by BGP-based interactions at the IP layer. The concepts of how to build such agreements are discussed and models for inter-domain QoS peering are proposed. By taking into account the loosely coupled structure of the Internet, we adopt a hop-by-hop, cascaded model in which each provider establishes agreements with its directly attached peers. Once these agreements are in place and networks are provisioned and engineered, QoS-based services can be offered. Targeted value-added services are identified and the methods of supporting the bidirectionality for these services are also proposed.",

However, in addition to this normal congestion control, a number of other mechanisms limit TCP throughput. This paper analyses the extent to which network, host and application settings define flow throughput over time and across autonomous systems. Our study draws on data from a longitudinal study spanning five years of passive traces collected from a single transit link. Mechanisms for this include limiting by application, interference with the TCP window control mechanism and artificial limitations on maximum window sizes by the operating system.

This trend highlights the need for the efficient creation of distributed programs with multimedia data exchanges running on distributed processing environments. Therefore, it is necessary to support the object-oriented development of distributed multimedia applications in a flexible manner. This paper recognises Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) as a key potential technology in the area of service engineering and examines a structured approach to enhance it for the handling of continuous media streams through the design and implementation of a collection of suitable multimedia support services. The proposed approach focuses on the modelling of continuous media communications in DCOM and is validated through the design and implementation of a multimedia \u2026",

The lack of path diversity hinders the support for resilience, traffic engineering and QoS provisioning across the Internet. Some recently proposed multi-plane extensions to BGP offer a promising mechanism to enable diverse inter-domain routes towards destination prefixes. Based on these enhanced BGP protocols, we propose in this paper a novel technique to enable controlled fast egress router switching for handling network failures. In order to minimize the disruptions to real-time services caused by the failures, backup egress routers can be immediately activated through locally remarking affected traffic towards alternative routing planes without waiting for IGP routing re-convergence.

We propose a hybrid approach, employing a hierarchical and distributed organizational model for MANET management. We adopt a policy-based network management (PBNM) approach together with context awareness and we present our system architecture that is capable of effectively managing a MANET.

In addition, our solution provides two key advantages over previous proposals. First, it allows for a simple computation of the optimal cache placement. Second, it provides knobs for operators to fine-tune performance.

We discuss several of those techniques that have been developed during the last few years. Some techniques are focused on pure IP networks while others have been designed with emerging technologies for scalable Quality of Service (QoS) such as Differentiated Services and MPLS in mind. We first discuss traffic engineering techniques inside a single domain. We show that by using a non-linear programming formulation of the traffic engineering problem it is possible to meet the requirements of demanding customer traffic, while optimising the use of network resources, through the means of an automated provisioning system. We also extend the functionality of the traffic engineering system through policies. In the following, we discuss the techniques that can be used to control the flow of packets between domains. First, we briefly describe interdomain routing and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Second, we summarise the characteristics of interdomain traffic based on measurements with two different Internet Service Providers. We show by simulations the limitations of several BGP-based traffic engineering techniques that are currently used on the Internet. Then, we discuss the utilisation of BGP to exchange QoS information between domains by using the QOS-NLRI attribute to allow BGP to select more optimum paths. Finally, we consider the multi-homing problem and analyse the current proposed IPv6 multi-homing solutions are analysed along with their impact on communication quality.",

In this work, we address the question on how to optimally place resources among NFV-enabled nodes to support mobile multimedia applications with low latency requirement and when to adapt the current resource placements to address workload changes.

            "Abstract": "Policy-based management provides the ability to dynamically re-configure DiffServ networks such that desired Quality of Service (QoS) goals are achieved. This includes network provisioning decisions, performing admission control, and adapting bandwidth allocation dynamically. QoS management aims to satisfy the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) contracted by the provider and therefore QoS policies are derived from SLA specifications and the provider\u00b9s business goals. This policy refinement is usually performed manually with no means of verifying that the policies written are supported by the network devices and actually achieve the desired QoS goals. Tool support is lacking and policy refinement has rarely been addressed in the literature. This paper extends our previous approach to policy refinement and shows how to apply it to the domain of DiffServ QoS management. We make use of goal elaboration and abductive reasoning to derive strategies that will achieve a given high-level goal. By combining these strategies with events and constraints, we show how policies can be refined, and what tool support can be provided for the refinement process using examples from the QoS management domain. The approach presented here can be used in other application domains such as storage area networks or security management.",

Emerging technologies for scalable quality of service such as differentiated services (DiffServ) and MPLS can be used for premium quality traffic. We look at the problem of intra-domain provisioning in an automated manner from the point of view of an Internet service provider (ISP), i.e. we want to satisfy the contracts with our customers while optimizing the use of network resources. We also need to be able to guide the behavior of such an automated provisioning system dynamically in order to be able to meet the high-level business objectives. The emerging policy-based management paradigm is the means to achieve this requirement. We devise first a nonlinear programming formulation of \u2026",

In this article we propose a model and architectural framework for supporting DiffServ-based end-to-end QoS in the Internet, assuming underlying MPLS-based explicit routed paths. The proposed integrated management and control architecture will allow providers to offer both quantitative and qualitative services while optimizing the use of underlying network resources.",

Based on the Service Level Specification (SLS) between customers and the ISP, traffic forecast mechanism is able to predict traffic demands between ingress-egress routers, and hence bandwidth guaranteed LSPs can be set up accordingly through the DiffServ domain. In this paper, we address the problem of computing multiple LSPs with heterogeneous bandwidth requirements, while the overall network link cost is optimized. We first prove that finding a set of feasible LSPs with bandwidth constrained is NP-complete, and then propose an efficient heuristic with global network resource coordination over individual traffic aggregates. By simulation we show that the proposed coordinated path section (CPS) scheme obtains better overall LSP cost and lower bandwidth consumption compared with existing bandwidth constrained routing algorithms.",

At the dawn of the new millennium, the ubiquitous explosion of the Internet and the fast proliferation of networked devices create a unique challenge. Innovative solutions are required and new ways of strategic thinking must be incorporated into future management products and services. Management in this new information era should support the integration of data and telecommunication networks, from narrowband to broadband, terrestrial to satellite, fixed to mobile and uni-media to multimedia.The IM 2001 Technical Program Committee (TPC) followed through on this theme by assembling a technical program covering key aspects of integrated management in the new networked era. There have been sessions to cover emerging areas of interest such as IP management, cellular network management, active and programmable network management, mobile code, and pricing. At the same time, the program accommodated continuing strong interest in popular areas with sessions on event and fault management, service and SLA management, virtual private network management, SNMP, CORBA, etc. In addition, for the first time there has been a session on open source management software to accommodate the voice of community that had not previously participated explicitly in the technical program.",

Furthermore, it allows nodes to indicate their preference for clients/sellers without needing to submit bids by using stable matching algorithms. We decouple the price discovery and outsource this function to a smart contract on the blockchain.Additionally, another smart contract is used to orchestrate the allocation and take care of service discovery, while trusted execution environments securely compute allocation solutions, and off-chain payment \u2026",

This paper analyzes the extent to which network, host and application settings define flow throughput over time and across autonomous systems. Drawing from a longitudinal study spanning five years of passive traces collected from a single transit link, our results show that continuing OS upgrades have reduced the influence of host limitations owing both to windowscale deployment, which by 2011 covered 80% of inbound traffic, and increased socket buffer sizes. On the other hand, we show that for this data set, approximately half of all inbound traffic remains throttled by constraints beyond network capacity, challenging the traditional model of congestion control in TCP traffic as governed primarily by loss and delay.",

On top of this scheme, an intelligent IP crank-back operation is also introduced for further enhancement of network protection capability against failures. Our simulations based on both real operational network topologies and synthetically generated ones suggest that, through our proposed optimized backup egress point selection algorithm, as few as two routing planes are able to achieve high degree of path diversity for fast recovery in any single link failure scenario.",

First of all, the network is dimensioned through offline link weight optimization using Multi-Topology IGPs for achieving maximum path diversity across multiple routing topologies. Based on this optimized MT-IGP configuration, an adaptive traffic engineering algorithm performs dynamic traffic splitting adjustment for balancing the load across multiple routing topologies in reaction to the monitored traffic dynamics. Such an approach is able to efficiently minimize the occurrence of network congestion without the necessity of frequently changing IGP link weights that may cause transient forwarding loops and routing instability.

In the context of the medium voltage (MV) grid, this has motivated the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs), that offer high-precision synchronized grid monitoring, enabling mission-critical applications such as fault detection/location. However, PMU-based applications present stringent delay requirements, raising a significant challenge to the communication infrastructure. In contrast to the high voltage domain, there is no clear vision for the communication and network topologies for the MV grid; a full-fledged optical fiber-based communication infrastructure is a costly approach due to the density of PMUs required.

However, these mechanisms do not consider network performance after affected traffic is rerouted onto repair paths. As a result, QoS deterioration may still happen due to post-failure traffic congestion in the network, which nullifies the effectiveness of IP FRR. In this paper, by considering IP tunneling as the underlying IP FRR mechanism, we proposed an efficient algorithm to judiciously select tunnel endpoints such that the network performance is optimized after the repair paths are activated for rerouting. According to the simulation results using real operational network topologies and traffic matrices, the algorithm achieves significant improvement on post-failure load balancing compared to the traditional IGP re-convergence and plain tunnel endpoint selection without such consideration.",

To cope with the requirements of large-scale networks (i.e. large number of geographically dispersed devices), a distributed monitoring approach is required. This PhD aims at investigating decentralized solutions for resource monitoring in SDN. The research will focus on the design of monitoring entities for the collection and processing of information at different network locations and will investigate how these can efficiently share their knowledge in a distributed management environment.",

In this context, destinations for inter-domain traffic may be reachable through multiple egress routers within a domain. In this paper, we formulate a bandwidth guaranteed egress router selection problem. The objective is to, for each aggregated inter-domain traffic flow, select an egress router that satisfies the end-to-end bandwidth requirement while optimizing the network resource utilization by which we consider three objective functions: minimizing the total bandwidth consumption, improving intra-domain and inter-domain load balancing in the network. We propose a heuristic algorithm with five egress router selection policies to solve this problem.

Based on the Service Level Agreement, both the content provider and group members should select a specific QoS channel available from the network for data transmission, and in this case arbitrarily quantitative QoS states are eliminated.

This model is highly scalable and simple to adopt in MANETs because it does not require explicit admission control or maintenance of state information in any intermediate node. It relies instead on localized scheduling and buffer management to achieve a desired global objective. Motivated by this aspect of the PSD model, we propose to combine it with a location-based forwarding strategy as a way to facilitate cross-layer optimization. This association is performed with a view to improve end-to-end service differentiation, although no other explicit mechanisms are used to achieve end-to-end guarantees.

Based on these diverse paths, adaptive traffic control performs intelligent traffic splitting across individual routing topologies in reaction to the monitored network dynamics at short timescale.

In this work, we look at hash-routing from a different angle and apply the technique to Information-Centric Networking (ICN) environments, where in-network content caches serve as temporary storage for content. In particular, edge-domain routers re-direct requests to in-network caches, more often than not off the shortest path, according to the hash-assignment function. Although the benefits of this off-path in-network caching scheme are significant (e.g., high cache hit rate with minimal co-ordination overhead), the basic scheme comes with disadvantages. That is, in case of very large domains the off-path detour of requests might increase latency to prohibitive levels.

NDN has its roots in an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN), which Van Jacobson first publicly presented in 2006. The NDN project investigates Jacobson's proposed evolution from today's host-centric network architecture (IP) to a data-centric network architecture (NDN). This conceptually simple shift has far-reaching implications for how we design, develop, deploy, and use networks and applications. We describe the motivation and vision of this new architecture, and its basic components and operations. We also provide a snapshot of its current design, development status, and research challenges. More information about the project, including prototype implementations, publications, and annual reports, is available on named-data.net.",

Customers require quality of service (QoS) guarantees with not only guaranteed bandwidth and delay but also with high availability. Our objective is for each estimated traffic flow to find a primary path with improved availability and minimum failure impact while satisfying bandwidth constraints and also minimizing network resource consumption. We devise a heuristic algorithm with four different cost functions to achieve our objective. Our approach can enhance availability of primary paths, reduce the effect of failure and also reduce the total resource consumption for both primary and backup paths.",

These systems routinely face the challenges of limited bandwidth capacities and network server failures, which degrade caching performance. In this paper, we study the problem of optimally allocating content over a resilient caching network, in which each cache may fail under some situations. Given content request rates and multiple routing paths, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the expected caching gain, i.e., the reduction of latency due to intermediate caching. The offline version of this problem is NP-hard. We first propose a centralized, offline algorithm and show that a solution with (1-1/e) approximation ratio to the optimal can be constructed. We then propose a distributed ascent algorithm based on \u2026",

            "Abstract": "As a scalable paradigm for content distribution at Internet-wide scale, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies have enabled a variety of networked services, such as distributed file-sharing and live video streaming. Most existing P2P systems employ non-intelligent peer selection algorithms for content swarming which greedily consume Internet bandwidth resources. As a result, Internet service providers (ISPs) need some efficient solutions for managing P2P traffic within their own networks. A common practice today is to block or shape P2P traffic in order to conserve bandwidth resources for carrying standard traffic from which revenue can be generated. In this paper, instead of looking at simple time-driven blocking/limiting approaches, we investigate how such types of limiting behaviors can be more gracefully performed by the ISP by taking into account the dynamics of both P2P traffic and of standard Internet traffic \u2026",

As such, they should be able to respond, in real-time, to a number of queries on events ranging from performance impairments to attacks. While existing measurement techniques can swiftly collect all the relevant data from high-speed traffic streams, significant processing costs are faced when aggregating and evaluating such data to generate elaborate query responses. This paper explores the use of machine-learning approaches for reducing the run-time processing cost of monitoring queries. A novel processing workflow is introduced, which entails classifiers trained over recent traffic, automatically tuned to match accuracy requirements of query responses, and applied to sampled subsets of raw measurement data. Experiments with representative monitoring queries on recent CAIDA traffic traces demonstrate promising improvements on the query processing capability, by up to 3x, while maintaining accuracy levels above 98%.",

Given that storage is cheaper and scales easier than wires, we argue for enhancing network connectivity with local storage services (eg, in WiFi Access Points, or similar) at the edge of the network. Such local storage services can be used to temporarily store IoT and user-generated data at the edge, prior to data-cloud synchronization.",

To cope with the limitations of these off-line configurations new traffic engineering (TE) schemes that can adapt to network and traffic dynamics are required. In this paper, we propose an intra-domain dynamic TE system for IP networks. Our approach uses multi-topology routing as the underlying routing protocol to provide path diversity and supports adaptive resource management operations that dynamically adjust the volume of traffic sent across each topology. Re-configuration actions are performed in a coordinated fashion based on an in-network overlay of network entities without relying on a centralized management system. We analyze the performance of our approach using a realistic network topology, and our results show that the proposed \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a new networking paradigm proposing a shift of the main network abstraction from host identifiers to location-agnostic content identifiers. So far, several architectures have been proposed implementing this paradigm shift.  A key feature, common to all proposed architectures, is the in-network caching capability, enabled by the location-agnostic, explicit naming of contents. This aspect, in particular, has recently received considerable attention by the research community.  However, despite this wide interest, there is a shortage of publicly-available tools suitable for evaluating the performance of caching systems effectively. In fact, all available simulators or emulators are either bound to a specific architecture or cannot execute simulations at the scale required and within a reasonable time-frame.  To address these issues, we present Icarus, a Python-based caching simulator for ICN. Icarus allows users to evaluate caching strategies for any ICN implementation and also provides modelling tools useful for caching research.",

Then we elaborate on an alternative scenario in which service management is achieved outside of the Network Operator, relying on an increased level of network openness not yet available today.",

As a result, the overall network performance may not be truly robust to link failures if the interactions are neglected. This paper proposes a joint robust TE approach that takes the interactions into account for achieving good network performance under both normal state and any single intra- or inter-AS link failure.

By tailoring network operations around named information objects instead of end hosts, ICN yields a series of desirable features such as the spatiotemporal decoupling of communicating entities and the support of in-network caching. In this article, we advocate the introduction of such ICN features in a new, rapidly transforming communication domain: the smart grid. With the rapid introduction of multiple new actors, such as distributed (renewable) energy resources and electric vehicles, smart grids present a new networking landscape where a diverse set of multi-party machine-to-machine applications are required to enhance the observability of the power grid, often in real time and on top of a diverse set of communication infrastructures.

Next generation IP-based networks will offer quality of service (QoS) guarantees by deploying technologies such as differentiated services (DiffServ) and multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) for traffic engineering and network-wide resource management. Despite the progress already made, a number of issues still exist regarding edge-to-edge intra-domain and inter-domain QoS provisioning and management. This tutorial will start by providing background on technologies such as DiffServ, MPLS and their potential combination for QoS support. It will subsequently introduce trends in service level agreements (SLAs) and service level specifications (SLSs) for the subscription to QoS-based services It will then move to examine architectures and frameworks for the management and control of QoS-enabled networks, including the following aspects: approaches and algorithms for off-line \u2026",

They can also support communication and content exchange when the cellular infrastructure is under severe stress and when the network is down or inaccessible. Fountain coding has been considered as especially suitable for lossy networks, providing reliable multicast transport without requiring feedback from receivers. It is also ideal for multi-path and multi-source communication that fits exceptionally well with opportunistic networks. In this paper, we propose a content-centric approach for disseminating content in opportunistic networks efficiently and reliably. Our approach is based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) and employs fountain coding. When tied together, ICN and fountain coding provide a comprehensive solution \u2026",

Broadband satellite networks as an integral part of the broadband network infrastructure are moving towards the same goal of providing service differentiation. Two of the more notable quality of service (QoS) frameworks are Integrated Services (IntServ) 1 and Differentiated Services (DiffServ) 2. They define two very different approaches to achieve service differentiation. On one end, IntServ utilizes resource reservation paradigm to provide hard guarantees of quality levels to individual flows while DiffServ chooses to aggregate traffic into finite number of classes and provides them with softer QoS guarantees. Variants of these QoS frameworks emerged over the past years with the proportional differentiated service (PDS) 3 being one of the most well-received.

Given the open-group IP multicast service model, it is important to support sender access control in order to prevent group members from receiving irrelevant data, and also to protect the multicast tree from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Compared with source specific and uni-directional shared trees, where information sources can be authorized or authenticated at the single root or rendezvous point (RP), in bi-directional trees this problem is more pronounced since hosts can send data to the shared tree from any point in the network. In this paper we propose a scalable sender access control policy mechanism for bi-directional shared trees so that irrelevant data is policed and discarded once it arrives at an on-tree router.

We evaluate our approach using an ISP topology for various system parameters. We propose two new forwarding strategies built on top of our approach. Our results indicate that the opportunistic discovery mechanism can significantly increase cache hit rate compared to NDN's default forwarding strategy, while limiting the overhead at acceptable levels.",

To this end, we define a negotiation framework with alternating offers. We devise a negotiation strategy for the AMSs which takes into account their own patience and attitude to risk for the case where they are completely ignorant of the character of their counterparts.

In one of the key relevant proposals known as Content-Centric Networking (CCN), the premise is that leveraging in-network caching to store content in every node along the delivery path can enhance content delivery. We question such an indiscriminate universal caching strategy and investigate whether caching less can actually achieve more. More specifically, we study the problem of en route caching and investigate if caching in only a subset of nodes along the delivery path can achieve better performance in terms of cache and server hit rates. We first study the behavior of CCN\u2019s ubiquitous caching and observe that even na\u00efve random caching at a single intermediate node along the delivery path can achieve similar and, under certain conditions, even \u2026",

For this purpose, we introduce the notion of Meta-QoS-Class and demonstrate its relevance for building QoS-enabled services across multiple domains. We then show how a QoS-enhanced Border Gateway Protocol (q-BGP) can be used together with Meta-QoS-Classes, for building a set of parallel Internet planes with different QoS capabilities.

The objective is that, through plain PIM-SM shortest path routing with optimized Multi-topology IS-IS (M-ISIS) link weights, the resulting multicast trees are geared towards minimal consumption of bandwidth resources. We apply Genetic Algorithms (GA) to the calculation of optimized M-ISIS link weights that specifically cater for engineered PIM-SM routing with bandwidth guarantees. Our evaluation results show that GA-based multicast traffic engineering consumes significantly less bandwidth resources in comparison with conventional IP approaches, while it also exhibits higher capability of eliminating/alleviating link congestion.

As TCP/IP applications are unable to specify the QoS parameters needed for most Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, they tend to use the unspecified bit rate (UBR) service category when running across ATM networks. The UBR service utilizes any bandwidth that is left unused by the rest of the ATM services. This has led the ATM Forum's Traffic Management Group to define a new service category called guaranteed frame rate (GFR). GFR is intended to provide minimum cell rate guarantees and fair access to excess bandwidth left over from higher-priority services. This article first presents a tutorial overview of GFR and then presents a survey of the research work that has been carried out toward the design and implementation of associated ATM switch mechanisms.",

In a network, where nodes and links may be spontaneously created and destroyed (perhaps rapidly) there is a need for stable and responsive management and monitoring, which does not create a large load (in terms of traffic or processing) for the system. A subset of nodes has to be chosen for management/monitoring, each of which will manage a subset of the nodes in the network. A new, simple, and locally optimal greedy algorithm called Pressure is provided for choice of node position to minimize traffic. This algorithm is combined with a system for predicting the lifespan of nodes, and a tunable parameter is also given so that a system operator could express a preference for elected nodes to be chosen to reduce traffic, to be \u201cstable,\u201d or some compromise \u2026",

Such a situation could be more severe in operational networks with highly dynamic traffic patterns. In this paper we propose a distributed technique that enables adaptive control of FRR protection paths against dynamic traffic conditions, resulting in self-optimisation in addition to the self-healing capability.

The estimated traffic demand is fundamental input to this problem and its accuracy is essential for the target performance to be achieved.

We argue that it is often inappropriate to optimize the performance for only a particular set of traffic demands that is assumed accurate. In this paper, we propose a scenario-based robust optimization approach to address the replica server placement problem under traffic demand uncertainty.

We present a novel approach exploiting this rosette geometry, by use of control of handover and management of satellite diversity, to determine which surface a ground terminal will select for communication. This effectively provides a form of network ingress control. By allocating traffic separate paths through the network with different degrees of delay, different levels of service become available between ground terminals. This allows us to exploit the topology of the rosette constellation network to provide varying classes of service, and thus support for quality of service (QoS).",

In this paper, we explore the potential of a user-operated, smartphone-centric content distribution model for smartphone applications. In particular, we assume source nodes that are updated directly from the content provider (e.g., BBC, CNN), whenever updates are available; destination nodes are then directly updated by source nodes in a D2D manner.

The objective is to keep the inter-domain link utilization balanced under any of these changes while reducing service disruptions and reconfiguration overheads.

In order to be able to populate this infrastructure with a variety of new (sophisticated) telecommunications services, it is necessary to assist and constrain service designers during the complex process of service creation. Therefore, in this paper, after considering briefly a number of service modelling issues, a TINA-C conformant service creation methodology, based on the exploitation of the flexible Unified Modelling Language (UML) notation, is proposed. This methodology is then presented focusing on the role and purpose of essential artifacts, examining their dependencies and \u2026",

Extracting information out of large-scale, dynamic networked systems is becoming increasingly difficult. Distributed monitoring systems based on static object technologies such as CORBA and Java-RMI can cope with scalability problems only to a limited extent. They are not well suited to monitoring systems that are both very large and highly dynamic because the monitoring logic, although distributed, is statically pre-determined at design time. The paper presents an active distributed monitoring system based on mobile agents. Agents act as area managers which are not bound to any particular network node and can sense the network, estimate better locations, and migrate in order to pursue location optimality.

At the same time, an increasing number of computing resources, deployed closer to users, as well as network equipment are now capable of performing general-purpose computation for NFV. However, NFV management in the presence of Service Function Chaining (SFC) for arbitrary topologies is a challenging task. In this work we argue for the necessity of an algorithmic resource managementframework that captures the involved tradeoffs of NFls minimum workload, load balancing, and flow path stretch. We introduce DRENCH as a low complexity NFV and flow steering management framework. In DRENCH an NFV market is considered where a centralised SDN controller acts \u2026",

The main goal of our scheme, which employs hierarchical principles, is to minimize the control traffic associated with location-management. In location-based routing protocols, the control traffic is mainly due to location-updates, queries and responses. Our scheme employs a novel geographically-oriented clustering scheme in order to minimize control traffic without impairing performance. In our location management scheme, nodes are assigned home-zones, and are required to send their location-updates to their respective home-zones through a dominating-set. This strategy, unlike similar location-management approaches, minimizes inevitable superfluous flooding by every node, and prevents location updates and queries from traversing the entire network unnecessarily \u2026",

By decoupling NFs from physical devices, network function virtualization enables virtual network functions (VNF) to run in virtual machines (VMs). However, VNFs are vulnerable to various faults such as software and hardware failures. To enhance VNF fault tolerance, the deployment of backup VNFs in stand-by VM instances is necessary. In case of stateful VNFs, stand-by instances require constant state updates from active instances during its operation. This will guarantee a correct and seamless handover from failed instances to stand-by instances after failures. Nevertheless, such state updates to stand-by instances could consume significant network bandwidth resources and lead to potential admission failures for VNF requests. In this paper, we study the fault-tolerant VNF placement problem with the optimization \u2026",

The role of the infection transmission medium is often neglected. In real-world networks, however, the infectious agent as the physical contagion medium usually flows from one node to another via specific directed routes (path-based infection). Here, we use continuous-time Markov chain analysis to model the influence of the infectious agent and routing paths on the spreading behavior by taking into account the state transitions of each node individually, rather than the mean aggregated behavior of all nodes. By applying a mean field approximation, the analysis complexity of the path-based infection mechanics is reduced from exponential to polynomial.

This both duplicates functionality across layers, eroding efficiency, and leads to protracted recovery cycles, affecting responsiveness. Such misalignment is particularly at odds with the unprecedented concentration of traffic in data-centers, in which network and hosts are managed in unison. This paper advocates instead a cross-layer approach to traffic resilience. The proposed architecture, INFLEX, builds on the abstractions provided by software-defined networking (SDN) to maintain multiple virtual forwarding planes which the network assigns to flows. In case of path failure, transport protocols pro-actively request to switch plane in a manner which is unilaterally deployable by an edge domain, providing scalable end-to-end forwarding path resilience.",

In addition, we propose that area monitoring stations are mobile agents, cloning and optimally placing themselves by executing the proposed algorithm.

The heuristic that is used in the clustering process ensures a more dynamic, distributed and adaptive operation of our protocol. Furthermore, this heuristic considers mobility of nodes as the main criterion in the cluster head election process, and hence results in stable cluster formation. The heuristic used in our CH election process ensures that the responsibility of acting as cluster heads is evenly distributed among all the nodes, and hence it is fair. Simulation results \u2026",

Instead, we consider the other extreme; that is, On-Demand Routing (ODR) computation for content name prefixes as interests arrive. ODR makes use of domain-level, per-prefix routing instructions usable by all the forwarders in a domain, named Routing Information Objects (RIO). Forwarders discover and retrieve RIOs in a similar way as content and can be cached in a new data structure called Route Information Store (RIS). RIOs are handed to a routing \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Given the emergence of IP networks and the Internet as the multi-service network of the future, it is plausible to consider its use for transporting demanding traffic with high bandwidth and low delay and packet loss requirements. Emerging technologies for scalable quality of service such as Differentiated Services and MPLS can be used for premium quality traffic. We are looking at the problem of intra-domain provisioning in an automated manner from an Internet Service Provider's (ISPs) point of view, ie we want to satisfy the contracts with our customers while optimising the use of the network resources.We need to be able to dynamically guide the behaviour of such an automated provisioning system in order to be able to meet the high-level business objectives. The emerging policy-based management paradigm is the means to achieve this requirement. In this paper we devise first a non-linear programming formulation of the traffic engineering problem and show that we can achieve the objectives and meet the requirements of demanding customer traffic through the means of an automated provisioning system. We extend the func-tionality of the automated system through policies. We define resource provi-sioning policies, and we present example scenarios of their enforcement.",

In such an environment it is difficult to dynamically deploy services and protocols without a common understanding among the participating nodes and their capabilities. A deployment/provisioning framework must cope with the high-level of device heterogeneity, degree of mobility, and should also take into account the potentially limited device resources. This paper presents a context-based programmable framework for dynamic service/protocol deployment that allows the nodes of a mobile ad hoc network to download and safely activate required service/protocol software dynamically. Downloading and activation can be triggered through preconditions evaluated according to available contextual information \u2026",

We propose a tabu search heuristic to solve the problem and compare the performance to three alternative approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that the tabu search heuristic achieves the best performance in terms of our optimization objectives and also keeps traffic disruption to a minimum.",

The ICN focus on information, rather than hosts, raises significant concerns regarding the scalability of the required Name Resolution System (NRS), especially when considering global scale, inter-domain deployments. In the route-by-name approach to NRS construction, name resolution and the corresponding state follow the routing infrastructure of the underlying inter-domain network. The scalability of the resulting NRS is therefore strongly related to the topological and routing characteristics of the network. However, past work has largely neglected this aspect. In this paper, we present a detailed investigation and comparison of the scalability properties of two route-by-name inter-domain NRS designs, namely, DONA \u2026",

In practice, changing network conditions such as inter-AS traffic demand variation, link failures and inter-AS routing changes occur dynamically. These changes can make fixed outbound TE solutions inadequate and may subsequently cause inter-AS links to become congested. In order to overcome this problem, we propose the deployment of a closed-loop control traffic engineering system that makes outbound traffic robust to inter-AS link failures and adaptive to changing network conditions. The objective is to keep the inter-AS link utilization balanced under unexpected events while reducing service disruptions and reconfiguration \u2026",

To date, much effort has concentrated on experiments using different methods for mapping TCP and UDP flows of the same AF class to the three possible drop precedences of the AF specification. Although this approach may protect responsive from unresponsive flows, it has not been shown to provide adequate fairness. We present a traffic conditioner able to provide fairness between responsive and unresponsive flows originating from the same customer network, using a fair two-rate three-color marker.

Furthermore, virtualization of storage and networking resources can open up new business models by enabling the ISP to simultaneously lease its Telco CDN infrastructure to multiple third parties.

In this paper we highlight certain issues with respect to bandwidth allocation and admission control for supporting real-time traffic in class-based IP networks. We investigate the implications of topological placement of both bandwidth allocation and admission control schemes. We show that their performance depends highly on the location of the employed procedures with respect to the end-users and the various network boundaries. We conclude that the strategies for applying these schemes should be location-aware, because their performance at different points in a class-based IP network can be different and can \u2026",

In this paper we propose a new scheme named Differentiated QoS Multicast (DQM) based on the Source Specific Multicast (SSM) model in order to provision limited qualitative QoS channels for supporting heterogeneous end users. In a similar fashion to the Differentiated Services paradigm, in DQM the network is configured to provide unified QoS classes to both content provider and receivers. Based on Service Level Agreements, both sources and group members should select a specific QoS channel available from the network for group data transmission, and hence arbitrarily quantitative QoS states are eliminated. Moreover, we use the group address G contained in the (S,G) tuple in the SSM service model to encode QoS channels, and data packets belonging to the same QoS channel identified by a \u2026",

The inter-AS traffic matrix is fundamental input for outbound TE and its accuracy is essential for the target performance to be achieved. However, deriving an accurate traffic matrix is far from trivial. This paper proposes a robust approach for outbound TE to manage traffic demand uncertainty through Scenario-based Robust Optimization. The objective of this robust outbound TE is to minimize the worst-case maximum inter-AS link utilization across a set of inter-AS traffic matrices while minimizing the performance deviation from the optimal solutions. Simulation results reveal that the robust outbound TE is capable of achieving reasonably good performance under all the given traffic matrices while non-robust approaches are not.",

Likewise, web browsing represents only a small fraction of the overall mobile traffic. In this paper, we take a first step towards filling this gap by exploring how CPA can be performed for generic mobile applications. We propose Mobile Critical Path Analysis (MCPA), a methodology based on passive and active network measurements that is applicable to a broad set of apps to expose a fine-grained view of their traffic dynamics. We validate MCPA on popular apps across different categories and usage scenarios. We show that MCPA can identify user interactions with mobile apps only \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The current Internet consists of more than 26,000 Autonomous Systems (ASes) or domains, each being a network or group of networks managed by a single authority commonly known as Internet Network Provider (INP). With wide deployment of real-time multimedia applications in recent years, the emerging future-generation Internet is expected to provide end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees across multiple ASes. In situations where stringent end-to-end QoS is required, ensuring that an adequate bandwidth is guaranteed by each AS along as the entire route in the Internet backbone is essential to achieve relevant performance targets (Zhang et al., 2004). Yet in practice, an AS is only capable of provisioning bandwidth guarantees within its own network. Hence, extending bandwidth guarantees beyond its boundary requires the AS to agree the supply of sufficient bandwidth from other ASes. This bandwidth supply is likely to be associated with a financial cost and therefore there is an economic incentive for an AS to carefully select its downstream provider ASes so as to minimize the cost of using that bandwidth. Having purchased access to sufficient bandwidth from downstream ASes, the AS needs to utilize both this purchased bandwidth and its own network capacity in the most effective way in order to provide bandwidth guarantees for customer traffic. INPs thus need to optimize the utilization of these resources. Traffic Engineering (TE) is an effective technique to optimize IP operational network performance and subsequently improve network QoS capabilities (Awduche et al., 2002). INPs can thus use TE as an effective means for \u2026",

In this paper, we introduce a multi-tenant cache management approach that significantly reduces the bandwidth utilization of ISPs networks by pro-actively allocating caching space, leased by content producers and/or CDNs, and intelligently routing content to the end users. Using real content request traces, we show that the optimal solution to this problem can increase the cache hit ratio by 70.64% while reducing the bandwidth usage by 57.17% on average, compared \u2026",

The algorithms rely on a set of input parameters which can be tuned to take into account the requirements of both the network infrastructure and the management applications to execute in the network.

Given the open-group IP multicast service model, it is important to perform sender access control so as to prevent group members from receiving irrelevant data, and also protect the multicast tree from various Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Compared with source specific trees and uni-directional shared trees where information sources can be authorized or authenticated at the single root or Rendezvous Point (RP), in bi-directional trees this problem becomes challengeable since hosts can send data to the shared tree from any network point. In this paper we propose a scalable sender access policy mechanism for bi-directional shared trees so that irrelevant data is policed and discarded once it hits any on-tree router.

As such, decentralized solutions that are flexible and adaptive to traffic and network dynamics are of paramount importance. To this end, an in-network management approach in which an intelligent substrate allows the dynamic reconfiguration of resources according to network conditions has been developed. The set of nodes forming this logical structure are able to communicate with each other to coordinate their decisions. This paper investigates the use of three different topology models to organize the nodes in the substrate. Algorithms to compute the proposed structures that are described take into account important criteria such as minimizing the latency and the communication overhead among the substrate nodes. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the different structures in terms of cost and complexity is performed based on real network topologies.",

Based on the Service Level Agreement, both the content provider and group members should select a specific QoS channel available from the network for data transmission, and in this case arbitrarily quantitative QoS states are eliminated. Moreover, we use the group address G contained in the (S, G) tuple in SSM service model to encode QoS channels, and data packets that belong to the same QoS channel identified by a common class D address can be treated aggregately, and this can be regarded as an overlay solution to \u2026",

This dynamic & fully distributed clustering approach is based on intelligent mobility prediction and enables MNs of a dynamic MANET to have a consistent view of the network at any time. QoS requirements of multimedia traffic necessitate this kind of consistency, which is achieved with an introduction of virtual cluster that is geographically oriented to a particular region. Making intelligent decisions regarding mobility and usage of location information [09] are highly desirable and, in fact, inevitable in MANETs, as the channel bandwidth and transmission power are scarce.

The problem of giving structure to large-scale, dynamic systems through clustering and of electing centrally located nodes (cluster heads) is nontrivial. This is in fact an NP-complete problem when striving for optimality. We propose an innovative strategy based on code mobility that dynamically computes near-optimal clusters in linear time. Our approach is autonomic, does not require any user intervention, is self-configuring, self-optimal, and self-healing. We demonstrate these features through an extensive set of simulations, discussing the viability of the algorithm based on state-of-the art technologies, and elaborating on its applicability to distributed monitoring, peer-to-peer systems, application-level multicast, and content adaptation \u2026",

Deployment of QoS-based value-added services in IP networks necessitates the employment of resource management techniques and specifically the use of traffic engineering.

The variety of data to be collected and analyzed using different measurement methods and tools, and the extent of monitoring information to use demand a proper QoS monitoring infrastructure. A monitoring system should be scalable in terms of network size, speed, and number of customers subscribed to value-added services.

            "Abstract": "Network and service management have attracted a lot of attention in terms of research and standardisation in recent years. Architectural frameworks such as the TMN try to address the management needs of broadband networks and services, catering for multi-domain, multi-operator environments while also allowing for electronic customer access to management services. Similar services will be offered by Internet ISPs in the future, addressing the next generation IP networks with QoS guarantees. These management services are fixed though in the sense that new features can only be added after a full research-standardisation-deployment cycle and are static as far as their use is concerned: they execute according to their in-built logic and clients may customise their operation only through tuning standardised operational parameters before their execution. The advent of mobile agent technologies opens new possibilities, allowing dynamic and customisable services to be offered to customers, who can control their remote execution in provider domains. In this paper we explain how mobile agents can enhance traditional connectivity management services, presenting the relevant architecture, design and experience of a customisable management system based on mobile agents.",

According to this paradigm, users can share the applications that they have on their mobile devices with nearby users that want access to processed information, which their own applications cannot provide.

This novel protocol is based on the legacy IEEE 802.11, and thus can be relatively easily integrated into existing systems. It is adaptive and network-aware depending on the type and intensity of traffic, and relative mobility patterns of nodes. In addition, it makes use of the point-coordination-function (PCF) of IEEE 802.11 in a distributed fashion for the first time in multihop MANETs. Our strategy enables two-way admission control for improved performance, whereby the forwarder-node selection algorithm allows previous hop nodes to perform implicit admission control using locally available information, while a selected forwarder-node performs explicit admission \u2026",

In this paper we present such a hybrid approach, illustrated through a prototype network performance monitoring system based on an integration of Mobile Agents and CORBA. Our assessment of this system based on our practical experiences and experimental evaluation shows that such a hybrid approach can provide an easy and favorable solution for enhancing existing CORBA-based network management systems.",

            "Abstract": "Mobile devices are often presented with multiple connectivity options, usually making a selection either randomly or based on the wireless medium's conditions, as is the case for current offloading schemes. In this article we propose that link-layer connectivity can be associated with information availability and in this respect connectivity decisions should be information-aware. To achieve information awareness at the link layer, we leverage on the information-centric networking paradigm and introduce the concept of information-centric connectivity (ICCON). We elaborate on different types of information availability and connectivity decisions in the context of ICCON, present specific use cases, and discuss emerging opportunities, challenges, and technical approaches. We illustrate the potential benefits of ICCON through preliminary simulation and numerical results in an example use case.",

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes the use of congestion pricing for achieving relative service differentiation in satellite IP networks. The idea is to use congestion pricing as an effective approach to control traffic rate for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) flows, with Explicit Congestion Notification as a congestion feedback mechanism, by taking into account network users\u2019 willingness-to-pay. With multitude of competing TCP flows, congestion pricing ensures that the higher the user\u2019s willingness-to-pay, the higher the traffic throughput. We implement the congestion pricing approach on the ns-2 simulator and evaluate its performance on both geostationary and non-geostationary satellite IP networks. Simulation results show that congestion pricing can be adopted as an effective approach for service differentiation in satellite IP networks and achieves fair relative service differentiation.",

            "Publication url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1687560/",
            "Abstract": "Policy-based dynamic resource management may involve interaction between independent decision-making components which can lead to conflicts. For example, conflicts can occur between the policies for allocating resources and those setting quotas for users or classes of service. These policy conflicts cannot be detected by static analysis of the policies at specification-time as the conflicts arise from the current state of the resources within the system and so can only be detected at run-time. In this paper we use policies related to quality of service (QoS) provisioning for configuring differentiated services (DiffServ) networks to illustrate techniques for the dynamic detection and resolution of conflicts. Configuration includes implementing network provisioning decisions, performing admission control, and adapting bandwidth allocation dynamically according to emerging traffic demands. We identify possible conflicts \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The introduction of context-aware services through service frameworks such as Open Service Access gateways in 3rd Generation networks has coincided with the increasing popularity of Business to Business (B2B) solutions such as Web Services. It is envisioned that B2B characteristics, such as service aggregation will play a part in deploying location-aware services in 3G networks. This paper examines and explores the suitability of service integration models, possible business models, the technical requirements, and suggests a framework for the aggregation and deployment of aggregated composite location-aware services. A prototype of the framework was developed and experiments involving J2EE based and Web Services/SOAP based composite services were conducted and elaborated in the paper. An analysis of the experimental results is presented at the end of the paper.",

            "Publication url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05589",
            "Abstract": "We identify the obstacles hindering the deployment of Information Centric Networking (ICN) and the shift from the current IP architecture. In particular, we argue that scalability of name resolution and the lack of control of content access from content providers are two important barriers that keep ICN away from deployment. We design solutions to incentivise ICN deployment and present a new network architecture that incorporates an extra layer in the protocol stack (the Location Independent Routing Layer, LIRA) to integrate location-independent content delivery. According to our design, content names need not (and should not) be permanent, but rather should be ephemeral. Resolution of non-permanent names requires the involvement of content providers, enabling desirable features such as request logging and cache purging, while avoiding the need for the deployment of a new name resolution infrastructure. Our results show that with half of the network's nodes operating under the LIRA framework, we can get the full gain of the ICN mode of operation.",
