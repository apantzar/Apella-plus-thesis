We propose a new shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) technique that optimizes the performance of traditional SBR methods in terms of running time, for the same accuracy requirements. This is accomplished via shooting rays towards the quadrangularly arranged locations of interest and performing the calculations at specific distance-intervals. The proposed method is straightforward and can be easily implemented in a ray tracing propagation prediction tool. The main computational advantage, compared to the traditional approaches, results from not performing the reception-sphere tests. The proposed SBR technique is thoroughly explained and the corresponding advantages are demonstrated.",

Such measures are commonly used to assess the performance of different algorithm that are designed to perform a specific image processing task. In this paper we propose two novel indices for image quality assessment based on the notion of discrimination information between two fuzzy sets. Two different definitions for the discrimination information have been used. In order to calculate the proposed quality indices two approaches were evaluated, one with application of the indices directly to the pixels of the image and the other using the fuzzy set corresponding to the normalized histogram of the image. A comparative study of the proposed indices is performed by investigating their behavior using images with different types of distortions, such as impulsive \u201csalt & pepper\u201d noise, additive white Gaussian noise, multiplicative speckle noise, blurring, gamma distortion, and JPEG compression.",

The proposed criterion allows different priorities to be set in different regions of the study area.

Because it allows for a higher energy coupling within an ultra-short time, it can achieve higher resolutions and higher signal to noise ratio, compared to traditional thermoacoustic tomography based on radiating sources at single frequencies. As for traditional thermoacoustic imaging the contrast comes from the conductivity and the dielectric properties of the tissues, while the resolution depends on the measured acoustic waves. Since NRTI depends on the efficient generation of high energy short impulses, the ability to control their time width and pulse shape is of high importance. We present here a methodology for generating such impulses based on transmission lines. The ability of such generators to generate impulses in the \u2026",

However, the large amount of images produced by WCE requires a highly trained physician to manually inspect them; a procedure that is time consuming and prone to human error. This was the rationale to propose a novel strategy for automatic detection of WCE images related to ulcer, one of the most common findings of the digestive tract. This paper introduces a new texture extraction method based on the Discrete Curvelet Transform (DCT), a recent multi-resolution analysis tool. Textural information is acquired by calculating the lacunarity index of DCT subbands of the WCE images. The classification step is performed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM \u2026",

This concentration peaks, especially during the opening and closing ceremonies, at very high numbers, seldom encountered on any other occasion globally. Most national cellular infrastructures now serve practically the whole of the country, and mobile telephones have penetrated to a considerable extent into the general population, usually outperforming fixed telephones, but past Olympic Games, and other equally important world-wide sports venues, suffered from shorter or longer blocking of the cellular services. An exception to this rule is the Olympic Games of Athens, where high-quality cellular communications were offered.

In this paper, this framework is applied for the road network of the prefecture of Western Macedonia in Greece. Refined data concerning real traffic conditions and network topology were collected and a detailed network mapping was performed in GIS. Utilizing an ad-hoc developed software for implementing the holistic methodology, the as-built road network was assessed and the network components with the highest vulnerability and consequence were identified. To improve the loss assessment reliability, bridge-specific fragility curves were employed based on the refined FE modeling. Structural and traffic cost due to earthquake scenarios of different return period were then predicted. To identify effective loss mitigation measures, the whole process was repeated assuming two different pre-earthquake risk management strategies. The first one concerns a retrofit program tailored to selected (ie, the most critical) network components, while the second one focuses on the beneficial effect of a better recovery planning. Results indicate the significant contribution of an effective risk management to the loss mitigation and network resilience improvement. Moreover, a sustainable health monitoring system was installed on Polymylos bridge to ensure satellite data transmission during an earthquake event to update the postearthquake recovery model, nearly in real time, with the measured spectral acceleration of the superstructure. The results indicate that the road network is adequately resilient \u2026",

Then, using the measured phase-difference from each antenna-pair, a hyperbola\u2019s branch on which the tag must be located is calculated. We evaluate the distance of each trajectory from the hyperbolas. Finally, we select the trajectory that minimizes the distance.

It is shown that multiple, time-varying motions estimation is equivalent to the instantaneous frequency estimation of superpoliteness FM sinusoids. Therefore, we apply established signal processing tools, such as time-frequency representations to show that for each time instant, the energy is concentrated along planes in the 3-D space: spatial frequencies - instantaneous frequency. Using fuzzy C-planes, we estimate indirectly the instantaneous velocities. Furthermore, adapting existing approaches to our problem, we attain the identification of the moving objects. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our methodology.",

Analytical models are presented for analyzing/synthesizing the images to and from their intuitionistic fuzzy components, based on different notions of intuitionistic fuzzy entropy and intuitionistic defuzzification schemes. Moreover, extensions of fuzzy approaches for contrast enhancement in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting demonstrate the efficiency of the IFIP framework. Finally, experimental results are assessed by objective enhancement evaluation measures that further verify the potential of using intuitionistic fuzzy sets for mammographic image processing.",

            "Abstract": "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a hybrid imaging technique that can provide both structural and functional information of biological tissues. Due to limited permissible laser energy deposited on tissues, highly sensitive PA imaging is required. Here, we developed a 20 MHz lead zirconium titanate (PZT) transducer (1.5 mm\u00d7 3 mm) with front-end amplifier circuits for local signal processing to achieve sensitivity enhanced PA imaging. The electrical and acoustic performance was characterized. Experiments on phantoms and chicken breast tissue were conducted to validate the imaging performance. The fabricated prototype shows a bandwidth of 63% and achieves a noise equivalent pressure (NEP) of 0.24 mPa/\u221a Hz and a receiving sensitivity of 62.1 \u03bcV/Pa at 20 MHz without degradation of the bandwidth. PA imaging of wire phantoms demonstrates that the prototype is capable of improving the detection sensitivity by 10 dB compared with the traditional transducer without integrated amplifier. In addition, in vitro experiments on chicken breast tissue show that structures could be imaged with enhanced contrast using the prototype and the imaging depth range was improved by 1 mm. These results demonstrate that the transducer with an integrated front-end amplifier enables highly sensitive PA imaging with improved penetration depth. The proposed method holds the potential for visualization of deep tissue structures and enhanced detection of weak physiological changes. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "The five senses constitute some of the most substantial elements of the human nature. Beyond their importance in daily life and perception of the world, they play crucial role in knowledge acquisition as well. For instance, medicine was one of the first domains where the conceptual tools of rationality and empiricism were combined with techniques of investigation to make the human body an object of knowledge (Foucault, 1973). In this context, the techniques mentioned above are based on the application of senses in order to acquire medical knowledge. More precisely, vision and hearing became specific objects of knowledge over the course of the 19th century, supplemented through technique and technology. Thus, seeing and hearing are to be understood as fundamentally and absolutely different modes of not only knowing the world, but also reaching a medical diagnosis.A branch of medicine closely associated with one of these techniques, namely visual inspection, is gastroenterology. In the field of gastroenterology, vision is widely understood as the fundamental mode of knowing the state of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The advent of medical imaging technologies, such as radiography (in the wider sense), tomography and especially endoscopy, promoted this thesis (Lorenz et al., 1993; Rutgeerts et al., 1980) by enabling the visual examination without demanding to gain physical access. In case of visual inspection, as in case of auscultation, there are specific properties observed in order to assess the image content, no matter how simple or sophisticated the imaging technology is.

The modification of the membership values of image pixels in the fuzzy plane is performed by finding the optimal S-function, which maximizes the parametric index of fuzziness (PIF). The first-order fuzzy moment of the image is used for tuning the PIF.

Thus, the modulation of the M/sub 2/ magnetization component expands all over the imaging plane. It has been proposed that the use of selective excitation pulses may limit the modulation only to regions of interest, thus preserving anatomical data in the rest of the image. In this paper, we intend to expand the tagging k-space concept in order to account for pulse selectivity, and offer a prediction and design tool for localized MR tagging sequences.",

In this work we introduce the concepts of discrimination information and cross-entropy in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting and we derive an extension of the De Luca\u2013Termini nonprobabilistic entropy for IFSs. Based on this entropy, we reveal an intuitive and mathematical connection between the notions of entropy for fuzzy sets (FSs) and IFSs in terms of fuzziness and intuitionism.

In order to carry out this task, we have to find intuitive ways to interpret and describe the inherent ambiguity and vagueness carried by the image itself in terms of the elements of intuitionistic fuzzy sets theory. We consider the problem of constructing the intuitionistic fuzzy set corresponding to a digital image, by exploiting the inherent imprecision or/and imperfection of information originating out of the imaging and acquisition chain. This action involves the definition of suitable membership and non-membership functions, by treating the term \"brightness\" of a gray level in a \"qualitative\" rather than a \"quantitative\" way. To model the hesitancy present in digital images, the notion of fuzzy histogram is used based on fuzzy numbers.

In this study, we examine the effect of selective excitation pulses on a L-SPAMM 1\u20131 sequence, showing that in the case of two identical pulses the phase component is canceled out, and thus preemphasis and refocus gradients are not needed, allowing us to take advantage of a constant gradient throughout the tagging sequence, and also that one might choose nonrefocusable maximum and minimum phase pulses.",

By suitable tuning its parameter, the local edge information measure is capable of preserving edge information while exhibiting high immunity to noise. The proposed fuzzy system is able to successfully detect edges in images corrupted by noise.

It is shown that accelerated motion results in energy concentration along planes in the 4-D space: spatial frequencies-temporal frequency-chirp rate.

In the first stage of the algorithm the image is transferred into the fuzzy domain and a set of optimal transformation parameters, based on Yager class of involutive membership functions, is calculated in accordance with maximum entropy principle.
