            "Abstract": "The past five decades, in particular, have seen a continually growing interest in so-called two-dimensional (2D) or, more generally, multidimensional (nD) systems. This is clearly related to the wide variety of applications of both practical and/or theoretical interest. The key unique feature of an nD system is that the plant or process dynamics (input, output and state variables) depend on more than one indeterminate and hence information is propagated in several independent directions. Many physical processes have a clear nD structure. Also, the nD approach is frequently used as an analysis tool to assist, or in some cases enable, the solution of a wide variety of problems. A key point is that the applications areas for nD systems theory/engineering can be found within the general areas of Circuits, Control (with particular emphasis for Repetitive Processes and Iterative Learning Control) and Signal Processing (and \u2026",

The second interpolation algorithm is using discrete fourier transforms (DFT) techniques or better fast fourier transforms which are very efficient algorithms available both in software and hardware and that they are greatly benefitted by the existence of a parallel environment (through symmetric multiprocessing or other techniques). The complexity of both algorithms is discussed and illustrated examples are given.

Since discrete time descriptor systems are subject to certain consistency conditions in order for a solution to exist, we consider the problem of constructing an admissible input that can drive the system in any reachable state (or the origin) and that also satisfies the consistency conditions. This is done by first decomposing the system into its two subsystems, via the Weierstrass decomposition. Furthermore, algebraic criteria regarding the reachability and controllability of a descriptor system that involve its causal and non-causal subsystems are formulated.",

The concept of an irreducible at infinity generalized state space realization of a polynomial matrix is defined and the mechanism of the \u201ccancellations\u201d of \u201cdecoupling zeros at infinity\u201d is closely examined. The difference between the concepts of irreducibility and minimality of generalized state space realizations of polynomial (transfer function) matrices is pointed out and the associated concepts of dynamic and non dynamic variables appearing in generalized state space realizations are also examined. Finally the isomorphism between the zeros at infinity of the \u201cinfinite pole pencil\u201d and the Rosenbrock system matrix of an irreducible at infinity generalized state space realization of a polynomial matrix and the pole and zero structure at infinity of such a polynomial matrix is examined.",

This system is transformed into its causal and noncausal subsystems and observability criteria are given in terms of the subsystem's matrices, and the fundamental matrix sequence of the matrix pencil (\u03c3E \u2212 A). Afterwards, the higher order system is studied. By transforming it into a first-order descriptor system of the above form, an observability criterion is provided for the higher order system in terms of the Laurent expansion at infinity of the system's polynomial matrix. In addition, observability is connected with the coprimeness of the polynomial matrices of the higher order system and the coprimeness of the matrix pencils of the descriptor system.",

The solution space of such systems consists of forward and backward propagating solutions, over a finite time horizon. This solution space can be constructed from knowledge of the finite and infinite elementary divisor structure of A (\u03c3). This work deals with the inverse problem of constructing a family of polynomial matrices A (\u03c3) such that the system A (\u03c3) \u03b2 (k)= 0 satisfies some given forward and backward behavior. Initially, the connection between the backward behavior of an AR representation and the forward behavior of its dual system is showcased. This result is used to construct a system satisfying a certain backward behavior. By combining this result with the method provided by Gohberg et al.(2009) for constructing a system with a forward behavior, an algorithm is proposed for computing a system satisfying the prescribed forward and backward behavior.",

            "Abstract": "An interesting problem of algebraic computation is the computation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of polynomials. The GCD is usually linked with the characterisation of zeros of a polynomial matrix description of a system. The problem of finding the GCD of a set of n polynomials on R [x] of a maximal degree q is a classical problem that has been considered before (Karcanias et al., 2004). Numerical methods for the GCD (Karcanias et al., 1994; Mitrouli el al., 1993) were also developed. Due to the difficulty in finding the exact GCD of a set of polynomials, approximate algorithms were also developed (Noda et al., 1991). A comparison of algorithms for the calculation of the GCD of polynomials is given in (Pace et al., 1973).The main disadvantage of many algorithms is their complexity. In order to overcome these difficulties, we may use other techniques such as interpolation methods. For example, Schuster et al.(1992) used interpolation techniques in order to find the inverse of a polynomial matrix. The speed of interpolation algorithms can be increased by using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) techniques or, better, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques. Some of the advantages of DFT based algorithms are that there are very efficient algorithms available in both software and hardware and that they are well suited for parallel environments (through symmetric multiprocessing",

In all cases it uses the least interpolation points with further consequences to the complexity of the algorithms that we use.",

We attempt a review of the most significant types of system equivalence having as a starting point matrix transformations preserving certain types of their spectral structure. From a system theoretic point of view, the need for a variety of forms of polynomial matrix equivalences, arises from the fact that different types of spectral invariants give rise to different types of dynamics of the underlying linear system. A historical perspective of the key results and their contributors is also given.",

The proposed method exploits these vectors forming the chains corresponding to the finite and infinite eigenvalues and to the right minimal indices of the pencil. This leads to the computation of two transformation matrices for obtaining under strict equivalence the KCF of the pencil.
