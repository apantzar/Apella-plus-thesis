For the benefits of large\u2010scale reuse, software product lines (SPL) have been adopted in critical systems industry. However, the integration of safety analysis in the SPL development process is nontrivial. Also, the different usage contexts of safety\u2010critical systems complicates component fault modeling tasks and the identification of potential hazards. In this light, better methods become necessary to estimate the impact of dependability properties during Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment. Existing methods incorporating the analysis of safety properties in SPL are limited as they do not include hazard analysis and component fault modeling.

To overcome this problem, we have developed a new technique that uses a penalty-based genetic algorithm to efficiently explore the search space and identify optimum assignments of ASILs to the system components.

Modularisation techniques have been developed to address these issues by identifying and quantifying static and dynamic modules of the fault tree separately by using binary decision diagrams and Markov models. Although these approaches appear effective in reducing computational effort and avoiding state-space explosion, the reliance of the Markov chain on exponentially distributed data of system components can limit their widespread industrial applications.

A language for the description of such patterns is specified, useful patterns are presented and the use of such patterns is demonstrated on an example of a Time-Triggered system.

In this paper, we propose an improved approach to reliability analysis of dynamic systems, allowing for uncertain failure data and statistical and stochastic dependencies among events. In the proposed framework, DFTs are used for dynamic failure modeling. Quantitative evaluation of DFTs is performed by converting them into generalized stochastic Petri nets.

Each time a component of the system is maintained its effective age is reduced; the extent of this age reduction depends on the effectiveness of the PM known as the improvement factor. While some components may need to be maintained every PM interval T, typically most components will possess a PM interval which is a multiple of T (\u03b1T), where \u03b1 is the coefficient of maintenance interval (CoMI). Where PM completely rejuvenates the component being maintained, it is termed perfect preventive maintenance (PPM).

Such models, Matlab-Simulink models for example, are currently used for simulation, fault injection and source code generation. In our work, the utility of such models is pushed further into a hitherto unexplored area that of safety and reliability analysis. We propose a design process in which techniques for semi-automatic safety and reliability analysis of such models are combined with multi-criteria optimisation techniques to assist the gradual development of designs that can meet set reliability and safety targets within pragmatic cost constraints. The proposed process relies on tools to automate some aspects of the design that we believe could be automated \u2026",

In recent years, Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) has been proposed to achieve more-robust and effective safety assessment techniques through automation of the synthesis and analysis of predictive models. Two prominent paradigms of MBSA are Compositional Safety Analysis (CSA) and Behavioural Safety Analysis (BSA). These techniques have emerged with little integration. In this chapter, we present a technique which systematically integrates the application of CSA and BSA. The process starts from CSA and utilizes its analysis results to provide a systematic construction and refinement of state machines, which can be subsequently analyzed through BSA.

Therefore, to capture the full system failure behaviour, it is not enough to simply determine the consequences of different combinations of failure events: it is also necessary to understand the order in which they fail. Pandora temporal fault trees (TFTs) increase the expressive power of fault trees and allow modelling of sequence-dependent failure behaviour of systems. However, like classical fault tree analysis, TFT analysis requires a lot of manual effort, which makes it time consuming and expensive. This in turn makes it less viable for use in modern, iterated system design processes, which requires a quicker turnaround and consistency across evolutions.

Second, the analysis can be unmanageable due to a considerable number of failure events, which increases with the number of components involved. To remedy this problem, in this paper we outline an analysis approach that converts failure behavioural models (state machines) to temporal fault trees (TFTs), which can then be analysed using Pandora -- a recent technique for introducing temporal logic to fault trees. The approach is compositional and potentially more scalable, as it relies on the synthesis of large system TFTs from smaller component TFTs.

Treating flare gas was made possible by the introduction of flare gas recovery systems that have become increasingly obligatory. Most solutions add a flare gas recovery system to an existing flare system. In a typical scenario, after analyzing the existing facility and collecting the necessary data, alternative designs are proposed and criteria are determined to make a choice between the proposed alternatives.

These rules are largely based on historical data and experience with their application. While they work well for designs that follow established design principles, innovative design proposals call for new approaches to ensure system safety and integrity. It is argued that where first principles are applied in the design process, first principles should also be used in assessing the safety of these designs. To address this issue, this paper describes a method that combines system analysis in the design process with safety analysis, drawing on techniques such as hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) and fault tree analysis (FTA). In this method, the analysis is performed on a structural model of the system upon which computerized algorithms are applied to automate the synthesis of system fault trees. This process is largely automated and can make use of system models from the early stages of the design, thus reducing the effort required to examine system safety and to study the effect of design modifications. In this paper, we describe the process and give an example to illustrate application on a typical system.",

            "Abstract": "Model-based engineering has become increasingly important in managing the ongoing advances in functionality and complexity of modern safety-critical embedded systems. There is a growing development in domain-specific modelling languages to support the design lifecycle from the early requirements stage up to the detailed hardware and software designs. Such languages aim to address the challenges arising from the management of nominal system design, design refinement and evolution, as well as the safety requirements and error behaviours.EAST-ADL (EAST-ADL, 2014) is an Architecture Description Language (ADL) which provides an integrated and systematic support for modelling of automotive systems. EAST-ADL facilitates multi-level abstractions which allow design and engineering concerns to be better managed. The specification of the EAST-ADL includes an error model which describes potential failures of the design elements. Specifications using the error model can be used to assess of the effects and propagations of these failures through the system. To perform this assessment, however, a connection between the modelling language and a model-based safety analysis tool needs to be established. Consideration for safety and reliability has been crucial throughout the development of safety critical systems. Various model-based safety analysis techniques (Joshi et al., 2006; Sharvia & Papadopoulos, 2011) have been proposed and developed throughout recent years. These techniques can be based on architectural decomposition of the system, eg the HiP-HOPS technique (Papadopoulos, et al., 2001), or they may be \u2026",

The aim is to automatically evolve initial designs that do not necessarily meet dependability requirements to designs that fulfil such requirements with minimal costs. The approach departs from earlier work in that the safety and reliability model (i.e. a set of system fault trees) is automatically synthesised from an engineering model of the system. It also moves beyond the classical \"success-failure\" model by introducing a failure scheme in which components can exhibit more that one failure modes which include the loss but also the commission of functions as well as value and timing failures. We discuss the approach, and compare the performance of two implementations, based on two different \u2026",

In this paper, we propose temporal extensions to the fault tree notation that can elevate HiP-HOPS, and potentially other FTA techniques, above the classical combinatorial model of FTA. We develop the formal foundations of a new logic to represent event sequences in fault trees using Priority-AND, Simultaneous-AND, and Priority-OR gates, and present a set of temporal laws to identify logical contradictions and remove redundancies in temporal fault trees.

Such approaches are typically resource-intensive, scale poorly and introduce additional risk due to human error. In this paper, a model-based approach for Security Attack Tree (SAT) analysis using the HiP-HOPS dependability analysis tool is presented.

Pandora can be easily integrated in model-based design and analysis techniques. It is, therefore, useful to explore the possible avenues for quantitative analysis of Pandora temporal fault trees, and we identify Bayesian Networks as a possible framework for such analysis.

A cost effective way of restoring failed functions is to use heterogeneous redundancies: components that, besides performing their primary intended design function, can also restore compatible functions of other components. In this paper, we apply a novel design methodology called D3H2 (aDaptive Dependable Design for systems with Homogeneous and Heterogeneous redundancies) to assist in the systematic identification of heterogeneous redundancies, the design of hardware/software architectures including fault detection and reconfiguration, and the systematic dependability and cost assessments of the system. D3H2 integrates parameter uncertainty and criticality analyses to model inexact failure data in dependability assessment. The application to a railway case study is presented with a focus on analysing different reconfiguration strategies as well as types and levels of redundancies. View Full-Text",

In this paper, we propose a Distributed On-line Safety Monitor (DOSM) that can achieve a range of real-time safety monitoring tasks: fault detection and diagnosis, alarm annunciation and control of hazardous failures. The monitor consists of a Multi-agent Monitoring System (MaMS) operating on a Distributed Monitoring Model (DMM) that contains reference knowledge derived from offline safety assessments, and a number of Distributed Data Structures (DDSs) that provide up-to-date sensory measurements. Guided by the knowledge contained in the DMM and real-time observations of the system provided by the DSSs, agents are hierarchically deployed and work collaboratively to integrate and deliver safety monitoring tasks, both locally at the sub-system levels and globally overseeing the overall behaviour of the system.",

            "Abstract": "A clinical workflow considers the information and processes that are involved in providing a clinical service. They are safety critical since even minor faults have the potential to propagate and consequently cause harm to a patient, or even for a patient's life to be lost. Experiencing these kinds of failures has a destructive impact on all the involved parties. Due to the large number of processes and tasks included in the delivery of a clinical service, it can be difficult to determine the individuals or the processes that are responsible for adverse events, since such an analysis is typically complex and slow to do manually. Using automated tools to carry out an analysis can help in determining the root causes of potential adverse events and consequently help in avoiding preventable errors through either the alteration of existing workflows, or the design of a new workflow. This paper describes a technical approach to safety analysis of clinical workflows, utilising a safety analysis tool (Hierarchically-Performed Hazard Origin and Propagation Studies (HiP-HOPS)) that is already in use in the field of mechanical systems. The paper then demonstrates the applicability of the approach to clinical workflows by applying it to analyse the workflow in a radiology department. We conclude that the approach is applicable to this area of healthcare and provides a mechanism both for the systematic identification of adverse events and for the introduction of possible safeguards in clinical workflows.",

            "Abstract": "Technological systems are not merely designed with a narrow function in mind. Good designs typically aim at reducing operational costs, e.g. through achieving high energy efficiency and improved dependability (i.e. reliability, availability and maintainability). When there is a choice of alternative design options that perform the same function, it makes sense to compare alternatives so that the variant that minimises operational costs can be selected. In this paper, we examine this issue in the context of the design of Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS) for main engines of large commercial freight vessels. We propose a method that can predict the operational cost of a WHRS via thermodynamic analysis which shows costs related to energy utilisation, and dependability analysis which shows costs related to system unavailability and repair. Our approach builds on recent advances in thermodynamic simulation and \u2026",

Although current safety monitoring schemes deliver this task to some extent, the problem of effective and timely safety monitoring is still largely unresolved. In this paper, we address the safety monitoring problem through an intelligent distributed safety monitor. This monitor is based on a Multi-agent system (MAS) and uses knowledge about normal and failure operational behaviour that is derived from a systematic safety analysis process. By exploiting this knowledge and real-time observations of the target system, agents deliver a wide range of monitoring tasks which include detection, diagnosis and correction of failures, both locally and globally via MAS collaboration.",

The analysis in the proposed method is performed using an algorithm for the automatic synthesis of fault trees that can be applied on the system at different stages of its design. At the early stages of the design, the algorithm can generate fault trees on the basis of abstract functional specifications of the system. Mechanical analysis of those fault trees, cut-set analysis for example, can help to identify conceptual design flaws and refine the initial design. This process can then be repeated down to low levels of the hardware and software implementation. By partly mechanising the safety analysis process, the proposed method could help, we believe, in managing the increasing complexity that the automotive sector is likely to experience in safety assessments with the introduction of safety-related integrated driver assistance systems in the future.",

In this case study, FMR covers the analysis of SIS inputs while HiP-HOPS/CFT models the faults of logic solver and final elements. The SIS program is analyzed by FMR and the results are exported to HiP-HOPS/CFT via automated interfaces. The final outcome is the collective list of SIS failure modes along with their reliability measures. We present and review the results from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.  ",

Although FTA is considered a well established safety analysis technique, paradoxically classical Fault Trees include only random faults. However, in modern automated systems, undesirable events arise not only from random hardware faults but also from defects in the logic of software controllers that control the physical system. Faults generated by these software controllers are systematic faults caused by coding errors or misinterpretations of control requirements. This paper proposes an extension to the basic Fault Trees construction process which takes into account this category of faults and advocates the use of dynamic and temporal gates to model it.",

Especially the interaction between safety and security is a central challenge, as security violations can lead to compromised safety. The contribution of this paper to addressing both safety and security within a single concept of protection applicable during the operation of ML systems is active monitoring of the behavior and the operational context of the data-driven system based on distance measures of the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF).

Manual approaches of applying this process in practice are ineffective due to the scale and complexity of modern electronic systems. In the work presented here, we aim to address this issue by presenting an extension to the dependability analysis and optimisation tool, HiP-HOPS, which allows automatic allocation of such requirements. We focus on aerospace requirements expressed as Development Assurance Levels (DALs); however, the proposed process and algorithms can be applied to other common forms of expression of safety requirements such as Safety Integrity Levels. We illustrate application to a model of an aircraft wheel braking system.",

            "Abstract": "The ISO/DIS 26262 standard on functional safety for road vehicles has a wide implication on the need for information exchange among partners in the automotive domain. As most development today is distributed among several companies and departments, it is important that all information exchange is precise enough to enable the OEM to take full responsibility of the entire functional safety. Still, there is also a need to protect Intellectual Property, because giving away detailed design information may jeopardize the commercial advantage for a company. The solution to this dilemma is a dedicated language for exchanging exactly the needed information in an unambiguous way. In ISO/DIS 26262 there is a standardized reference life cycle in which information should be generated and communicated in each phase. In this paper we show how dedicated language support can facilitate this in the distributed automotive industry structure of today. All phases are covered, but this paper has a special focus on the needs for the concept phase. The dedicated language support is a part of the EAST-ADL2 language. EASTADL2 is an AUTOSAR compliant architectural language covering the more abstract views of an automotive E/E system. It is an extendable modular language giving the possibility to add dedicated packages for special purposes. This paper describes the module of EAST-ADL2 dedicated for ISO/DIS 26262 support",

With increasing availability of online data, there is room to improve traditional dependability assessment techniques. Namely, prognostics is an emerging field, which provides asset-specific failure information that can be reused to improve the system-level failure estimation. This paper presents a framework for prognostics-updated dynamic dependability assessment. The dynamic behavior comes from runtime updated information, asset interdependencies, and time-dependent system behavior. A case study from the power generation industry is analyzed, and results confirm the validity of the approach for improved near real-time unavailability estimations.",

Over the years, several methodologies have been developed for the analysis of failure behavior of systems. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is one of the well-established and widely used methods for safety and reliability engineering of systems. Fault tree, in its classical static form, is inadequate for modeling dynamic interactions between components and is unable to include temporal and statistical dependencies in the model. Several attempts have been made to alleviate the aforementioned limitations of static fault trees (SFT). Dynamic fault trees (DFT) were introduced to enhance the modeling power of its static counterpart. In DFT, the expressiveness of fault tree was improved by introducing new dynamic gates.

This model possesses a state-event semantics and strong encapsulation, which is especially useful for the evaluation of component-based software systems.

In this thesis, we argue that this knowledge could be usefully exploited in the context of an appropriate on-line safety monitoring scheme. As a practical application of our approach, we propose a safety monitor that operates on safety cases to support the on-line detection and control of hazardous failures in safety critical systems. Firstly, we identify a number of problems encountered in the development of safety cases using classical safety analysis techniques, and propose a new safety analysis method which can guarantee the consistency and improve, to some extent, the completeness and correctness of the safety case. The new method enables the assessment of hierarchically described complex systems that may exhibit either static or dynamic behaviour or structure. The assessment process in the proposed method revolves around a hierarchical structural and behavioural model of the system under examination. The result of the assessment is a semi-mechanically synthesised, well-formed, layered, safety case, which is composed of a collection of inter-related design models and safety analyses, and which enables automated checks that confirm the consistent integration of those models and analyses. We show that such a safety case can be mechanically transformed into an executable specification, upon which an automated monitor could operate in real-time.In the \u2026",

Therefore, the allocation of safety requirements is not a simple problem of applying an allocation \"algebra\" as treated by most standards; it is a complex optimisation problem, one of finding a strategy that minimises cost whilst meeting safety requirements. One difficulty is the lack of a commonly agreed heuristic for how costs increase between SILs. In this paper, we define this important problem; then we take the example of an automotive system and using an automated approach show that different cost heuristics lead to different optimal SIL allocations.

Pandora, one such extension, introduces temporal gates and temporal laws to allow dynamic analysis of temporal fault trees (TFTs). It can be easily integrated in model-based design and analysis techniques. The quantitative evaluation of failure probability in Pandora TFTs is performed using exact probabilistic data about component failures. However, exact data can often be difficult to obtain.

This paper is focused on the presentation of a new concept and tool extension for model-based synthesis of fault trees and FMEAs in which these failure analyses are automatically constructed from engineering design models, e.g. simulation models that have been augmented with information about the local propagation of failures. The simulation model is developed in the commercial system modelling tool SimulationX. The proposed \u2026",

The Handbook recognises that classical combinatorial fault trees employing only Boolean gates cannot capture the potentially critical significance of the temporal ordering of failure events in a system. Although the Handbook proposes two dynamic gates that could remedy this, a Priority-AND and an Exclusive-OR gate, these gates were never accurately defined. This paper proposes extensions to the logical foundation of fault trees that enable use of these dynamic gates in an extended and more powerful FTA. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated on a generic triple-module standby redundant system exhibiting dynamic behaviour.",

            "Abstract": "This paper develops Penguin search Optimisation Algorithm (PeSOA), a new metaheuristic algorithm which is inspired by the foraging behaviours of penguins. A population of penguins located in the solution space of the given search and optimisation problem is divided into groups and tasked with finding optimal solutions. The penguins of a group perform simultaneous dives and work as a team to collaboratively feed on fish the energy content of which corresponds to the fitness of candidate solutions. Fish stocks have higher fitness and concentration near areas of solution optima and thus drive the search. Penguins can migrate to other places if their original habitat lacks food. We identify two forms of penguin communication both intra-group and inter-group which are useful in designing intensification and diversification strategies. An efficient intensification strategy allows fast convergence to a local optimum, whereas an effective diversification strategy avoids cyclic behaviour around local optima and explores more effectively the space of potential solutions. The proposed PeSOA algorithm has been validated on a well-known set of benchmark functions. Comparative performances with six other nature-inspired metaheuristics show that the PeSOA performs favourably in these tests. A run-time analysis shows that the performance obtained by the PeSOA is very stable at any time of the evolution horizon, making the PeSOA a viable approach for real world applications.",

Model-based safety analysis (MBSA) techniques such as Hierarchically Performed Hazard Origin and Propagation Studies (HiP-HOPS) have made the reliability analysis process less expensive in terms of effort and time required. HiP-HOPS uses an analytical modelling approach for Fault tree analysis to automate the reliability analysis process, where each system component is associated with its failure rate or failure probability. However, such non-state-space analysis models are not capable of modelling more complex failure behaviour of component like failure/repair dependencies, e.g., spares, shared repair, imperfect coverage, etc. State-space based paradigms like Markov chain can model complex failure behaviour, but their use can lead to state-space explosion, thus \u2026",

Although FMEA has been shown to be useful, the analysis is typically restricted to the effects of single component failures; even partial analysis of combinations or sequences of multiple failures is in practice considered too complex, laborious and costly to perform. In this paper, we describe a new technique in which FMEAs are semi-automatically built from the topology of a system and component-level specifications of failure data. The proposed technique allows an extended form of \u201ccombinatorial & sequential FMEA\u201d in which assessment of the effects of combinations and sequences of failures becomes feasible and cost effective.

Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) processes are comprehensive, structured and logical methods widely used for this purpose. PRA approaches include, but not limited to Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Event Tree Analysis (ETA). In conventional PRA, failure data about components is required for the purposes of quantitative analysis. In practice, it is not always possible to fully obtain this data due to unavailability of primary observations and consequent scarcity of statistical data about the failure of components. To handle such situations, fuzzy set theory has been successfully used in novel PRA approaches for safety and reliability evaluation under conditions of uncertainty.

One attribute that can be analysed during the infancy of design is scheduled preventive maintenance (PM) through optimisation. PM is normally optimised in isolation to other system design improvement mechanisms. It is however helpful if PM could be optimised in combination with other mechanisms such improving the system's architecture. By combining these optimization objectives more design possibilities can be simultaneously explored, therefore helping to make better design decisions. In this paper we explore this type of optimization by using HiP-HOPS a scalable dependability analysis and optimisation tool.",

However, these benefits will only be unlocked if the safety of these systems can be assured with a sufficient level of confidence. Traditional safety engineering and assurance approaches alone cannot address the CPS-inherent uncertainties and unknowns induced by openness and adaptivity. Runtime safety assurance approaches such as Conditional Safety Certificates (ConSerts) represent novel means to cope with CPS assurance challenges by introducing modular and formalized safety arguments with variant support, thereby shifting the final safety certification step to runtime. However, the systematic engineering of ConSerts at design-time is a complex task which, up to now, has not been sufficiently addressed. Without systematic safety assurance at both design-time and runtime, CPS will hardly be assurable with acceptable confidence given the uncertainties and unknowns. In this paper, we present an engineering method for synthesizing ConSerts based on Digital Dependability Identities (DDI). The approach is demonstrated for a cooperative vehicle platooning function (CACC) from an industrial case study.",

In the process of an FMEA, analysts compile lists of component failure modes and try to infer the effects of those failure modes on the system. System models, typically simple engineering diagrams, assist analysts in understanding how the local effects of component failures propagate through complex architectures and ultimately cause hazardous effects at system level. Although there is software available that assists engineers in performing clerical tasks, such as forming tables and filling in data, the intelligent part of an FMEA process remains a manual and laborious process. Thus, one of the main criticisms of FMEA is that the time taken to perform the analysis can often exceed the period of the design and development phases and \u2026",

Through ASIL decomposition, designers can divide a function's safety requirements among multiple components. However, in practice, manual ASIL decomposition is difficult and produces varying results. To overcome this problem, a new tool automates ASIL allocation and decomposition. It supports the system and software engineering life cycle by enabling users to efficiently allocate safety requirements regarding systematic failures in the design of critical embedded computer systems. The tool is applicable to industries with a similar concept of safety integrity levels.",

Standards use the concept of Safety Integrity Levels (SILs) to drive the assignment of system safety requirements to components of a system under design.

Variation in design can indeed change the possible hazards incurred in each product, their causes, and can alter the safety requirements placed on individual components in different SPL products. Establishing common SILs for components of a large scale SPL by considering all possible usage scenarios, is desirable for economies of scale, but it also poses challenges to the safety engineering process. In this paper, we propose a method for automatic allocation of SILs to components of a product line. The approach is applied \u2026",

Pandora introduces temporal gates and temporal laws to fault trees to allow sequence-dependent dynamic analysis of events. Pandora can be easily integrated in model-based design and analysis techniques; however, the combinatorial quantification techniques used to solve classical fault trees cannot be applied to temporal fault trees. Temporal fault trees capture state and therefore require a state space solution for quantification of probability. In this paper, we identify Petri Nets as a possible framework for quantifying temporal trees. We describe how Pandora fault trees can be mapped to Petri Nets for dynamic dependability analysis and demonstrate the process on a fault tolerant fuel distribution system model.",

The method, though, cannot ensure that the assumptions about the behaviour of the system that underlie those studies are correct. Our second aim in this paper is, precisely, to show an approach to validating those assumptions using system modelling and simulation.
