            "Abstract": "Haptic rendering has been long considered as the process of estimating the force that stems from the interaction of a user and an object. It can be thus seen as a closed loop system, where the user's actions drive the \u201csimulation\u201d that feeds back to the user the respective forces. Even if this approach follows the principles of natural haptic interaction, it places severe limitations in processing haptic media and does not follow the paradigm of audiovisual media that allow for open loop processing and rendering. This paper provides an information theoretic perspective of haptic rendering. Following the principles of information theory, two novel haptic information rendering pipelines are provided. Moreover, several quantities like entropy, mutual information and filters are defined and instantiated for the case of haptic rendering, while explicit examples of their potential use are analyzed. The paper concludes with examples \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present a context learning algorithm for inpainting missing regions using visual features. This encoder learns physical structure and semantic information from the image and this representation differentiates it from simple auto encoders. Such properties are crucial for tasks like image in-painting, classification and detection. Training was performed by patch-wise reconstruction loss using Structural Similarity (SSIM) jointly with an adversarial loss. The reconstruction loss is also augmented using spatially varying saliency maps that increase the error penalty on distinctive regions and thus promote image sharpness. Furthermore, in order to improve image continuity on the boundary of the missing region, distance functions with increasing importance towards the center of the inpainting region are also used either independently or in conjunction with the saliency maps. We also show that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, real-time 3D scanning and reconstruction becomes a requirement for a variety of interactive applications in various fields, including heritage science, gaming, engineering, landscape topography, and medicine. From the introduction of 3D scanning, which allowed the representation of real world or synthetic objects into the virtual world, hardware and software advances have seen tremendous progress. However, despite the continuous improvement of the new generation image sensors and acquisition techniques, the acquired data are often corrupted by the low-frequency noise, outliers, misalignment, missing data, and variations in point density. These effects are amplified if the low-cost sensors and hardware are being used (e.g., mobile devices); thus, the acquisition and communication cost per datum is driven to a minimum.

            "Abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to support fast and efficient completion of arbitrary animation sequences, ideally suited for real-time scenarios, such as immersive tele-presence systems and gaming. In most of these applications, the reconstruction of 3D animations is based on dynamic meshes which are highly incomplete, stressing the need of completion approaches with low computational requirements. In this paper, we present a new online approach for fast and effective completion of 3D animated models that estimates the position of the unknown vertices of the current frame by exploiting the connectivity information and the current motion vectors of the known vertices. Extensive evaluation studies carried out using a collection of different incomplete animated models, verify that the proposed technique achieves plausible reconstruction output despite the constraints posed by arbitrarily complex and motion scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "Cyber Physical Systems have been going into a transition phase from individual systems to a collecttives of systems that collaborate in order to achieve a highly complex cause, realizing a system of systems approach. The automotive domain has been making a transition to the system of system approach aiming to provide a series of emergent functionality like traffic management, collaborative car fleet management or large-scale automotive adaptation to physical environment thus providing significant environmental benefits (e.g air pollution reduction) and achieving significant societal impact. Similarly, large infrastructure domains, are evolving into global, highly integrated cyber-physical systems of systems covering all parts of the value chain. In practice, there are significant challenges in CPSoS applicability and usability to be addressed, i.e. even a small CPSoS such as a car consists several subsystems Decentralization of CPSoS appoints tasks to individual CPSs within the System of Systems. CPSoSs are heterogenous systems. They comprise of various, autonomous, CPSs, each one of them having unique performance capabilities, criticality level, priorities and pursued goals. all CPSs must also harmonically pursue system-based achievements and collaborate in order to make system-of-system based decisions and implement the CPSoS functionality. This survey will provide a comprehensive review on current best practices in connected cyberphysical systems. The basis of our investigation is a dual layer architecture encompassing a perception layer and a behavioral layer. Perception algorithms with respect to scene understanding \u2026",

Therefore, early retirement or exit from the labour market, due to health-related issues, poses a significant problem. Nowadays, thanks to technological advances and various data from different populations, the risk factors investigation and health issues screening are moving towards automation. In the context of this work, a worker-centric, IoT enabled unobtrusive users health, well-being and functional ability monitoring framework, empowered with AI tools, is proposed. Diabetes is a high-prevalence chronic condition with harmful consequences for the quality of life and high mortality rate for people worldwide, in both developed and developing countries.

            "Abstract": "Effective management of chronic constrictive pulmonary conditions lies in proper and timely administration of medication. As a series of studies indicates, medication adherence can effectively be monitored by successfully identifying actions performed by patients during inhaler usage. This study focuses on the recognition of inhaler audio events during usage of pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI). Aiming at real-time performance, we investigate deep sparse coding techniques including convolutional filter pruning, scalar pruning and vector quantization, for different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The recognition performance has been assessed on three healthy subjects following both within and across subjects modeling strategies. The selected CNN architecture classified drug actuation, inhalation and exhalation events, with 100%, 92.6% and 97.9% accuracy, respectively, when assessed in a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation setting. Moreover, sparse coding of the same architecture with an increasing compression rate from 1 to 7 resulted in only a small decrease in classification accuracy (from 95.7% to 94.5%), obtained by random (subject-agnostic) cross-validation. A more thorough assessment on a larger dataset, including recordings of subjects with multiple respiratory disease manifestations, is still required in order to better evaluate the method\u2019s generalization ability and robustness.

The gait sequence is captured by a stereoscopic camera and the resulting 2.5D data are processed to generate a 3D hull of the captured silhouette. The 3D Protrusion Transform is then proposed that generates a silhouette image containing protrusion information. Finally, the descriptor vector of the extended silhouette is calculated using the Krawtchouk moments. Experimental evaluation illustrates that the proposed scheme is highly efficient in identifying gait sequences when compared to state of the art approaches.",

In this study 4 machine learning algorithms are assessed with respect to their accuracy in predicting severe asthma exacerbations using various parameters. The approach proposed for personalized decision support and patient guidance considers two classification tasks: a 2-class prediction task, which allows for estimation of risk of exacerbation 7 days ahead, and a 4-class prediction task, which allows for monitoring the on-going exacerbation events with respect to their duration.

The accurate identification of the features is achieved by exploiting the low rank property of the captured geometry and the sparsity of the features in the Laplacian domain, permeating benefits from robust principal component analysis. Due to the visual importance of the identified geometric features, the geometry coding process, is optimized for preserving the geometric features at extremely low bit rates. Extensive evaluation studies, carried out using a collection of scanned and synthetic 3D models, show that the proposed feature aware high pass quantization method achieves extremely high compression ratios, offering at the same time meaningful approximations of the given surfaces.

We propose a method, based on already published methods from different fields, that can successfully create the mechanical model of a cloth, based only on a single monocular video source of a cloth been held and moved in the air by two hands. We propose the use of a moving graph generation method using Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT). Having the moving graph of the real cloth as the goal, a method based on genetic algorithms was designed to produce the mechanical properties of the cloth's mechanical model. This way a simulated cloth with similar mechanical properties will be created. For our experiments a mechanical model based on Provot's mass-spring-damper (MSD) cloth model with adjustable springs and dampers was used. However, we present a method that can be easily adjusted to any particlebased cloth model. The method presented was designed to be easily applicable so as to enable the broader use of cloth models in robotized cloth manipulation tasks. The use of a cloth's digital twin, enables the major part of tuning of a robot controller to be made offline. This will significantly accelerate the tuning process, enabling the broader use of robots in more delicate cloth manipulation tasks. Finally, to prove the validity of our method we provide the results of experiments with cloths of different patterns and physical parameters.",

Such alternate modalities can be auditory, haptic, or a combination of both. There is thus the need for modality conversion, from the visual modality to another one; this is where image and video processing plays a crucial role. The possible alternate sensory channels are examined with the purpose of using them to present visual information to totally blind persons. Aids that are either already existing or still under development are then presented, where a distinction is made according to the final output channel. Haptic encoding is the most often used by means of either tactile or combined tactile/kinesthetic encoding of the visual data \u2026",

In recent years, much scientific attention was attracted to pre-clinical optimization of customized total knee replacement operations through computational modeling to minimize post- operational adverse effects. However, the time-consuming and laborious process of developing a subject-specific finite element model poses an obstacle to the latter. One of this work\u2019s main goals is to automate the finite element model development process, which speeds up the proposed framework and makes it viable for practical applications. This pipeline\u2019s reliability was ratified by developing and validating a subject-specific total knee replacement model based on the 6th SimTK Grand Challenge data set. The model was validated by analyzing contact pressures on the tibial insert in relation to the patient\u2019s gait and analysis of tibial contact forces, which were found to be in accordance with the ones provided by the Grand Challenge data set. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the influence of modeling choices on tibial insert\u2019s contact pressures and determine possible uncertainties on the models produced by the framework. Parameters such as the position of ligament origin points, ligament stiffness, reference strain, and implant-bone alignment were used for the sensitivity study.

The\u201d MASTER-PIECE\u201d(Multimodal Assembly with SIMILAR Technologies from European Research utilizing a Personal Interface in an Enhanced Collaborative Environment) project aims at the generation of a multimodal interface using gesture and speech in order to manipulate a virtual assembly application. Besides assembling mechanical objects, the user is capable to perform 3D model content based search in a database of 3D objects using as query model a scene object. Finally, to deal with cases where no query model is available, a sketch based approach is proposed which results in the manual approximate generation of the query model. More specifically, the user can draw a specific number of primitive objects by moving his/her hands and then process-combine them so as to build more complex shapes, which are finally used as query models. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed scheme enhances significantly the realism of the interaction, while using the sketch-based approach the user can search for 3D objects in the database without the need of an initial query object, which is the case in most state of the art approaches.",

However, the real-time streaming of such models introduces increasing challenges related to low cost, low-latency and scalable coding of the acquired information. In view of this, this article proposes an efficient scalable coding mechanism, that decomposes a mesh sequence into spatial and temporal layers that remove a single vertex at each layer. The removed vertices are predicted by performing Laplacian interpolation of the motion vectors. The artifacts that are introduced in low-resolution representations are mitigated using a subspace based normal-vector denoising procedure, that is optimized to \u2026",

The framework was designed to operate with marker-based and inertial measurement units enabling extensions far beyond dedicated motion capture laboratories. We present the technical details for calculating the kinematics, generalized forces, muscle forces, joint reaction loads, and predicting ground reaction wrenches during walking. Emphasis was given to reduce computational latency while maintaining accuracy as compared to the offline counterpart. Notably, we highlight the influence of adequate filtering and differentiation under noisy conditions and its importance for consequent dynamic calculations. Real-time estimates of the joint moments, muscle forces, and reaction loads closely resemble OpenSim\u2019s offline analyses. Model-based estimation of ground reaction wrenches demonstrates that even a small error can negatively affect other estimated quantities. An application of the developed system is demonstrated in the context of rehabilitation and gait retraining. We expect that such a system will find numerous applications in laboratory settings and outdoor conditions with the advent of predicting or sensing environment interactions. Therefore, we hope that this open-source framework will be a significant milestone for solving this grand challenge. View Full-Text",

The presented method exploits temporal coherence by altering the principal component analysis (PCA) procedure from a batch- to an adaptive-basis aiming to simultaneously support three important objectives: fast compression times, reduced memory requirements and high-quality reproduction results. A dynamic compression pipeline is presented that can efficiently approximate the k-largest PCA bases based on the previous iteration (frame block) at a significantly lower complexity than directly computing the singular value decomposition. To avoid errors when a fixed number of basis vectors are used for all frame blocks, a flexible solution \u2026",

In this paper, we focus on the problems of partial-deformed or partial-observed 3D meshes, presenting a very fast and efficient method for surface inpainting of dense 3D meshes. In order to achieve this, we use a matrix completion approach taking advantage of the low-rank property attributed to spatial coherence. Two different scenarios are studied and presented: (i) the repairing of partial-observed 3D meshes consisting of incomplete surfaces, (ii) the recovery of 3D objects with holes which are created by the intentional removal of deformed areas. We demonstrate the performance of our approach providing \u2026",

We present a hybrid method utilizing ray tracing and rasterization which enables water caustic coverage to vast view distance in real-time. Inspired by photon mapping, we optimize the generation of photons using cascaded caustic maps to avoid tracing the first bounce of a ray from a light, replacing that step with rasterization. We introduce cascades as a set of caustic maps with varying resolution based on the distance from the viewer. In addition, since we adopt a splatting approach where each photon is rasterized into the image based on the extent of its contribution, we trace photon differentials in order to determine the size, shape and intensity of the splats so as to achieve adaptive anisotropic flux density estimation. Finally, to mitigate undersampled regions where lack of photons leads to noise, we propose \u2026",

To overcome these significantly challenging imperfections without any additional information, first we introduce a novel reconstruction technique based on rank minimization theory, which can result in a unique solution to the otherwise ill-posed problem. This technique is further extended to exploit the spatial coherence, which usually characterizes the soft-body animations.

At the same time there is a trend to develop low cost high-quality AR systems where computing poweris in demand. Feature points are extensively used in these real-time frame-rate and 3D applications, thereforeefficient high-speed feature detectors are necessary. Corners are such special features and often are used as thefirst step in the marker alignment in Augmented Reality (AR). Corners are also used in image registration andrecognition, tracking, SLAM, robot path finding and 2D or 3D object detection and retrieval. Therefore thereis a large number of corner detection algorithms but most of them are too computationally intensive for use inreal-time applications of any complexity. Many times the border of the image is a convex polygon. For thisspecial, but quite common case, we have developed a specific algorithm, cMinMax. The proposed algorithmis faster, approximately by a factor of 5 compared to the widely used Harris Corner Detection algorithm. Inaddition is highly parallelizable. The algorithm is suitable for the fast registration of markers in augmentedreality systems and in applications where a computationally efficient real time feature detector is necessary.The algorithm can also be extended to N-dimensional polyhedrons.",

However, the process of experiential learning in a virtual world without biophysical constraints might contribute to muscle strain and discomfort, if ergonomic risk factors are not considered in advance. Under this scope, we have developed a digital platform which employs extended reality (XR) technologies for the creation and delivery of industrial training programs, by taking into account the users and workplace specificities through the adaptation of the 3D virtual world to the real environment. Our conceptual framework is composed of several inter-related modules: (i) the XR tutorial creation module, for automatic recognition of the sequence of actions composing a complex scenario while this is demonstrated by the educator in VR, (ii) the XR tutorial execution module, for the delivery of visually guided and personalized XR training experiences, (iii) the digital human model (DHM) based simulation module for creation and demonstration of job task simulations avoiding the need of an actual user and (iv) the biophysics assessment module for ergonomics analysis given the input received from the other modules. Three-dimensional reconstruction and aligned projection of the objects situated in the real scene facilitated the imposition of inherent physical constraints, thereby allowed to seamlessly blend the virtual with the real world without losing the sense of presence.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, robots are able to carry out a complex series of actions, to take decisions, to interact with their environment and generally to perform plausible reactions. Robots\u2019 visual ability plays an important role to their behavior, helping them to efficiently manage the received information. In this paper, we present a real time method for removing outliers and noise of 3D point clouds which are captured by the optical system of robots having depth camera at their disposal. Using our method, the final result of the created 3D object is smoothed providing an ideal form for using it in further processing techniques; namely navigation, object recognition and segmentation. In our experiments, we investigate real scenarios where the robot moves while it acquires the point cloud in natural light environment, so that unpleasant noise and outliers become apparent.",

            "Abstract": "Through the years, several works have demonstrated high-quality 3D mesh denoising. Despite the high reconstruction quality, there are still challenges that need to be addressed ranging from variations in configuration parameters to high computational complexity. These drawbacks are crucial especially if the reconstructed models have to be used for quality check, inspection or repair in manufacturing environments where we have to deal with large objects resulting in very dense 3D meshes. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown that are able to automatically learn and find more accurate and reliable results, without the need for setting manually parameters. In this work, motivated by the aforementioned requirements, we propose a fast and reliable denoising method that can be effectively applied for reconstructing very dense noisy 3D models. The proposed method applies conditional variational \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel interactive framework for 3D content-based search and retrieval using as query model an object that is dynamically sketched by the user. In particular, two approaches are presented for generating the query model. The first approach uses 2D sketching and symbolic representation of the resulting gestures. The second utilizes non-linear least squares minimization to model the 3D point cloud that is generated by the 3D tracking of the user\u2019s hands, using superquadrics. In the context of the proposed framework, three interfaces were integrated to the sketch-based 3D search system including (a) an unobtrusive interface that utilizes pointing gesture recognition to allow the user manipulate objects in 3D, (b) a haptic\u2013VR interface composed by 3D data gloves and a force feedback device, and (c) a simple air\u2013mouse. These interfaces were tested and comparative results were \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present a context learning algorithm for inpainting missing regions using visual features. This encoder learns physical structure and semantic information from the image and this representation differentiates it from simple auto encoders. Such properties are crucial for tasks like image in-painting, classification and detection. Training was performed by patch-wise reconstruction loss using Structural Similarity (SSIM) jointly with an adversarial loss. The reconstruction loss is also augmented using spatially varying saliency maps that increase the error penalty on distinctive regions and thus promote image sharpness. Furthermore, in order to improve image continuity on the boundary of the missing region, distance functions with increasing importance towards the center of the inpainting region are also used either independently or in conjunction with the saliency maps. We also show that our choice of reconstruction loss outperforms conventional criteria such as the L2 norm. This means giving more weight to pixels closer to the border of the missing image parts and also giving more important to salience parts of the image to guide the reconstruction, thus producing more realistic images.",

Office workers in particular are at an increased risk due to their extensive amounts of occupational sedentary behavior. There are currently several large data sets available which can be used to create long-term health risk prediction models. However, in many cases, the relation between physical activity and SB in work environment, is missing.

            "Abstract": "Recently, there has been increasing interest in the processing of dynamic scenes as captured by 3D scanners, ideally suited for challenging applications such as immersive tele-presence systems and gaming. Despite the fact that the resolution and accuracy of the modern 3D scanners are constantly improving, the captured 3D point clouds are usually noisy with a perceptive percentage of outliers, stressing the need of an approach with low computational requirements which will be able to automatically remove the outliers and create a consolidated point cloud. In this paper, we introduce a novel method which first recognizes and removes outliers from a dynamic point cloud sequence (DPCS) using a very fast Robust PCA (RPCA) approach and then we use a novel weighted Laplacian interpolation approach to achieve a fast and effective consolidation of a DPCS.

            "Abstract": "There are several works performing accurate skeleton extraction, however, their main drawback is the extensive computational requirements and the lack of solutions that can be executed in multi-core computing systems. These challenges, become more demanding when we are dealing with dense 3D models. To cope with this scarcity we propose a novel method that extends a well known contraction-based skeletonization method, enabling its decentralization resulting in significant improvement in skeleton extraction times.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we present a new approach in producing realistic saccade eye movement animations by incorporating anatomical details of the oculomotor system into the dynamics of the eye model. Unlike abstract models of the eye motor behaviour, we make use of a biomedical framework to effectively model the eye globe along with the three extraocular muscle pairs in efficient detail, that the application of the corresponding muscle activation signals, naturally results in realistic motions. That way, we avoid the need of explicitly providing trajectory information, and therefore simplify the process of eye animation. Regarding the calculations of the muscle activation signals needed to drive the animation in a way that imitates a real human eye, we are based on existing knowledge about the way that the nervous system utilizes the extraocular muscles during saccades.",

However, the analysis of the output data is a challenging task, especially in the field of 3D point cloud change detection. In this Shape Retrieval Challenge (SHREC) track, we provide a street-scene dataset for 3D point cloud change detection. The dataset consists of 866 3D object pairs in year 2016 and 2020 from 78 large-scale street scene 3D point clouds. Our goal is to detect the changes from multi-temporal point clouds in a complex street environment.We compare three methods on this benchmark, with one handcrafted (PoChaDeHH) and the other two learning-based (HGI-CD and SiamGCN). The results show that the handcrafted algorithm has balanced performance over all classes, while learning-based methods achieve overwhelming performance but suffer from the class-imbalanced problem and may fail \u2026",

However, history teaches us that no matter how rich the content is from these applications, it remains out of reach for users without a physical way to interact with it. Multimodal interfaces give users a way to interact with the virtual environment (VE) using more than one complementary modality. Masterpiece (which is short for multimodal authoring tool with similar technologies from European research utilizing a physical interface in an enhanced collaborative environment) is a platform for a multimodal natural interface. We integrated Masterpiece into a new authoring tool for designers and engineers that uses 3D search capabilities to access original database content, supporting natural human-computer interaction",

The proposed application integrates haptics, audio and visual output, computer vision, sign language analysis and synthesis, speech recognition and synthesis to provide an interactive environment where the blind and deaf-and-mute users can collaborate. All the involved technologies are integrated into a treasure hunting game application that is jointly played by the blind and deaf-and-mute user. The integration of the multimodal interfaces into a game application serves both as an entertainment and a pleasant education tool to the users.",

            "Abstract": "This letter presents a novel probabilistic framework for augmenting the recognition performance of biometric systems with information from continuous soft biometric (SB) traits. In particular, by modelling the systematic error induced by the estimation of the SB traits, a modified efficient recognition probability can be extracted including information related both to the hard and SB traits. The proposed approach is applied without loss of generality in the case of gait recognition, where two state-of-the-art gait recognition systems are considered as hard biometrics and the height and stride length of the individuals are considered as SBs. Experimental validation on two known, large datasets illustrates significant advances in the recognition performance with respect to both identification and authentication rates.",

This work is based on the use of convolutional neural networks to extract saliency maps for large and dense 3D scanned models. The network is trained with saliency maps extracted by fusing local and global spectral characteristics. Extensive evaluation studies carried out using various 3D models, include visual perception evaluation in simplification and compression use cases. As a result, they verify the superiority of our approach as compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, these studies indicate that CNN-based saliency extraction method is much faster in large and dense geometries, allowing the application of saliency aware compression and simplification schemes in low-latency and energy \u2026",

A crucial step towards effective self-management is the adherence of the patients to their medication. Accurate detection of pressurised metered dose inhaler audio events can significantly improve medication adherence facilitating more meaningful interventions by medical personnel. Towards this direction, this work presents a data-driven approach for monitoring pressurised metered dose inhaler medication adherence employing recurrent neural networks with long short term memory (LSTM) units with spectrogram features. Evaluation studies took place with intra-subject and inter-subject settings, demonstrating that our LSTM-based approach yields higher accuracy compared to classical machine learning methods reaching a prediction accuracy ranging from 92% to 94% taking into account also \u2026",

The motivation behind the proposed approach derives from activity-related biometrics and is mainly focusing on everyday activities. The activity sequence is captured by a stereoscopic camera and the resulting 2.5D data are processed to extract valuable unobtrusive activity-related features. The novel contribution of the current work lies in the warping of the extracted movements trajectories, so as to compensate for different environmental settings. Au- thentication is performed utilizing both HMM and GMMs. The authentication results performed on a database with 32 subjects show that the current work outperforms existing approaches especially in the case of non-interaction restricting scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "During the last years, the emerging field of Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR-VR) has seen tremendous growth. An interface that has also become very popular for the AR systems is the tangible interface or passive-haptic interface. Specifically, an interface where users can manipulate digital information with input devices that are physical objects. This work presents a low cost Augmented Reality system with a tangible interface that offers interaction between the real and the virtual world. The system estimates in real-time the 3D position of a small colored ball (input device), it maps it to the 3D virtual world and then uses it to control the AR application that runs in a mobile device. Using the 3D position of our \"input\" device, it allows us to implement more complicated interactivity compared to a 2D input device. Finally, we present a simple, fast and robust algorithm that can estimate the corners of a convex quadrangle. The proposed algorithm is suitable for the fast registration of markers and significantly improves performance compared to the state of the art.",

Thus, they demand very high-bandwidth and ultra-low latency from network specifications. The next-generation wireless networks will employ promising technologies to significantly improve the communication data rates. However, due to implementation complexity and thus increased energy consumption of these technologies, a trade-off between the quality-of-user-experience (QoE) and the hardware specifications is necessary. To overcome these limitations low-resolution quantizers have been of interest, which provide a trade-off between quality and complexity. In this paper, we propose a complexity-aware perceptual coding scheme that minimizes the reconstruction losses of the 3D models. Extensive simulations assuming different 3D models show that the proposed scheme achieves \u2026",

The proposed scheme provides a feasibility study on how VPH simulations can be used in a pre-surgical step for optimal planning of several parameters related to the surgical procedure (eg physical vs. synthetic reconstruction, positioning, etc.). The effect of the choice of these parameters on the motor behaviour of the knee can be estimated through the proposed simulation scheme, thus leading to a powerful clinical decision support system.

            "Abstract": "The present paper proposes a novel framework for the classification of 3D objects into specific categories using semantic information combined with geometrical characteristics. During the modeling phase an ontology is constructed with instances for each class of objects (animals, humans etc.), which contain semantic information about the parts constituting them. Geometric descriptors are then assigned to each part. During the recognition phase, the objects are segmented and geometrical descriptors are extracted for each segment. Finally, these geometric descriptors are compared to the descriptors of each of the instance parts, dissimilarity metrics are calculated and the object is classified to the class, which minimizes this metric. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach overcomes major problems that arise when objects are treated as a whole and when only geometric characteristics \u2026",

However, the process of experiential learning in a virtual world without biophysical constraints might contribute to muscle strain and discomfort, if ergonomic risk factors are not considered in advance. Under this scope, we have developed a digital platform which employs extended reality (XR) technologies for the creation and delivery of industrial training programs, by taking into account the users and workplace specificities through the adaptation of the 3D virtual world to the real environment. Our conceptual framework is composed of several inter-related modules: 1) the XR tutorial creation module, for automatic recognition of the sequence of actions composing a complex scenario while this is demonstrated by the educator in VR, 2) the XR tutorial execution module, for the delivery of visually guided and personalized XR training experiences, 3) the digital human model (DHM) based simulation module for creation and demonstration of job task simulations avoiding the need of an actual user and 4) the biophysics assessment module for ergonomics analysis given the input received from the other modules. Three-dimensional reconstruction and aligned projection of the objects situated in the real scene facilitated the imposition of inherent physical constraints, thereby allowed to seamlessly blend the virtual with the real world without losing the sense of presence.",

            "Abstract": "Physics-based modeling and dynamic simulation of human eye movements has significant implications for improving our understanding of the oculomotor system and treating various visuomotor disorders. We introduce an open-source biomechanical model of the human eye that can be used for kinematics and dynamics analysis. This model is based on the passive pulley hypothesis, constructed based on the data reported in literature regarding physiological measurements of the human eye and made publicly available. The model is implemented in OpenSim, which is an open-source framework for modeling and simulation of musculoskeletal systems. The model incorporates an eye globe, orbital suspension tissues and six extraocular muscles. The excitation and activation patterns for a variety of targets can be calculated using the proposed closed-loop fixation controller that drives the model to perform saccadic movements in a forward dynamics manner. The controller minimizes the error between the desired saccadic trajectory and the predicted movement. Consequently, this model enables the investigation muscle activation patterns during static fixation and analyze the dynamics of eye movements.",

Among the actions individuals can take to reduce their green-house gases associated with personal transportation, there is to operate their current vehicles more efficiently.

Gamification has been positioned as a powerful approach, tool, or set of techniques that guides targeted behavior change and improves the way that various activities are undertaken so that those involved begin to take the desired actions while they experience more fun, enjoyment, and pleasure in their tasks.

Virtual reality applications aim to immerse the user into a virtual environment by providing artificial input to its interaction sensors (ie, eyes, ears, hands). The visual and aural inputs are the most important factors in human-computer interaction (HCI). However, virtual reality applications will remain far from being realistic without providing to the user the sense of touch. The use of haptics augments the standard audio-visual HCI by offering to the user an alternative way of interaction with the VE. One of the major application branches of haptic-enabled virtual environments is medicine. In the following, the most important medical application areas are briefly presented and described.1. Echography examination is a nonintrusive technique in which the observation and examination of the organs such as the heart, liver, and spleen are achieved permitting the evaluation of the fetus for normal development as well as the blood flow through specific vessels. In many places, such as small hospitals and health centers, it is possible that echography-related equipment exists, but there are no experts able to perform the examinations.

The motivation behind the proposed features derives from activity-related biometrics and the extension of them to activities involving objects. The proposed approach exploits methods from different scientific fields, such as virtual reality, collision detection and pattern classification and is applicable to user authentication systems. Experimental results in a data-set of 20 subjects show that the introduced features comprise a very efficient and interesting approach in the research of biometric features.",

This formulation is a non-physical extension of the well known St Venant Kirchhoff force, but focuses more on practical considerations about the behavior and the control over the model. The proposed method can be employed by virtually any dynamic model that is based on particle systems, facilitating their simplicity and the respective performance benefits, while it also demonstrates resistance and robustness to high compression. In addition, the presented force model can be easily parameterized for different application scenarios due to its intuitive nature and its direct relation to spring models.

            "Abstract": "The coordination of the human musculoskeletal system is deeply influenced by its redundant structure, in both kinematic and dynamic terms. Noticing a lack of a relevant, thorough treatment in the literature, we formally address the issue in order to understand and quantify factors affecting the motor coordination. We employed well-established techniques from linear algebra and projection operators to extend the underlying kinematic and dynamic relations by modeling the redundancy effects in null space. We distinguish three types of operational spaces, namely task, joint and muscle space, which are directly associated with the physiological factors of the system. A method for consistently quantifying the redundancy on multiple levels in the entire space of feasible solutions is also presented. We evaluate the proposed muscle space projection on segmental level reflexes and the computation of the feasible muscle forces for arbitrary movements. The former proves to be a convenient representation for interfacing with segmental level models or implementing controllers for tendon driven robots, while the latter enables the identification of force variability and correlations between muscle groups, attributed to the system\u2019s redundancy. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated in the context of estimating the bounds of the joint reaction loads, where we show that misinterpretation of the results is possible if the null space forces are ignored. This work presents a theoretical analysis of the redundancy problem, facilitating application in a broad range of fields related to motor coordination, as it provides the groundwork for null \u2026",

In particular, the lifestyle of office workers is characterized by prolonged sitting and overall sedentary life, which alone is a high risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases, obesity and other related chronic diseases. The SmartWork unobtrusive monitoring system allows for continuous monitoring of various lifestyle, health, behavioural and work related parameters of office workers targeting to empower work ability sustainability. The large amounts of collected data in such systems are often characterized by the presence of missing entries.

            "Abstract": "Recently, spectral methods have been extensively used in the processing of 3D meshes. They usually take advantage of some unique properties that the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the decomposed Laplacian matrix have. However, despite their superior behavior and performance, they suffer from computational complexity, especially while the number of vertices of the model increases. In this work, we suggest the use of a fast and efficient spectral processing approach applied to dense static and dynamic 3D meshes, which can be ideally suited for real-time denoising and compression applications. To increase the computational efficiency of the method, we exploit potential spectral coherence between adjacent parts of a mesh and then we apply an orthogonal iteration approach for the tracking of the graph Laplacian eigenspaces. Additionally, we present a dynamic version that automatically identifies the optimal subspace size that satisfies a given reconstruction quality threshold. In this way, we overcome the problem of the perceptual distortions, due to the fixed number of subspace sizes that is used for all the separated parts individually. Extensive simulations carried out using different 3D models in different use cases (ie, compression and denoising), showed that the proposed approach is very fast, especially in comparison with the SVD based spectral processing approaches, while at the same time the quality of the reconstructed models is of similar or even better reconstruction quality. The experimental analysis also showed that the proposed approach could also be used by other denoising methods as a preprocessing step, in order \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in ageing population that carries an increased risk for adverse health outcomes including falls, hospitalization, disability, and mortality. As these outcomes affect the health and social care planning, during the last years there is a tendency of investing in monitoring and preventing strategies. Although a number of electronic health record (EHR) systems have been developed, including personalized virtual patient models, there are limited ageing population oriented systems. We exploit the openEHR framework for the representation of frailty in ageing population in order to attain semantic interoperability, and we present the methodology for adoption or development of archetypes. We also propose a framework for a one-to-one mapping between openEHR archetypes and a column-family NoSQL database (HBase) aiming at the integration of existing and newly developed archetypes into it. The requirement analysis of our study resulted in the definition of 22 coherent and clinically meaningful parameters for the description of frailty in older adults. The implemented openEHR methodology led to the direct use of 22 archetypes, the modification and reuse of two archetypes, and the development of 28 new archetypes. Additionally, the mapping procedure led to two different HBase tables for the storage of the data. In this work, an openEHR-based virtual patient model has been designed and integrated into an HBase storage system, exploiting the advantages of the underlying technologies. This framework can serve as a base for the development of a decision support system using the openEHR\u2019s Guideline \u2026",

The motion based, activity related, biometric features that correspond to the dynamic interaction with objects that exist in the surrounding environment are extracted in the enrollment phase and are used to train an HMM. The authentication potential of the proposed biometric features has been seen to be very high in the performed experiments. Moreover, the combination of the results of these two activities further increases the authentication rate. Extensive experiments carried out on the proprietary ACTIBIO-database verify this potential of activity related authentication within the proposed scheme.",

The effective control of these diseases is achieved through the use of pressurized meter dose inhaler (pMDI). However, their management has been considered suboptimal, mainly due to the improper use of the inhaler device. Towards this direction, this work presents the use of deep sparse Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a classifier to provide a real-time assessment of medication adherence. The classification process is based only on recordings of inhaler use, achieving at the same time significantly lower computational complexity as compared to recent and relevant approaches, since no data transformation is needed. The proposed scheme reaches 95% classification accuracy, demonstrating that this method can also be executed on an embedded system \u2026",

In this context, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations accompanied by fluid particle tracing (FPT) analysis of the inhaled ambient particles are deemed critical for lung function assessment.

            "Abstract": "Spectral methods are widely used in geometry processing of 3D models. They rely on the projection of the mesh geometry on the basis defined by the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian operator, becoming computationally prohibitive as the density of the models increases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for supporting fast and efficient spectral processing of dense 3D meshes, ideally suited for real time compression and denoising scenarios. To achieve that, we apply the problem of tracking graph Laplacian eigenspaces via orthogonal iterations, exploiting potential spectral coherences between adjacent parts. To avoid perceptual distortions when a fixed number of eigenvectors is used for all the individual parts, we propose a flexible solution that automatically identifies the optimal subspace size for satisfying a given reconstruction quality constraint. Extensive simulations carried out with different 3D meshes in compression and denoising setups, showed that the proposed schemes are very fast alternatives of SVD based spectral processing while achieving at the same time similar or even better reconstruction quality. More importantly, the proposed approach can be employed by several other state of the art denoising methods as a preprocessing step, optimizing both their reconstruction quality and their computational complexity.",

The patient-specific representation of the bronchial tree structure is extended beyond the visible airway generation depth using a knowledge-based technique built from morphometric studies. Additional functionalities of AVATREE include visualization of spatial probability maps for the airway generations projected on the CT imaging data, and visualization of the airway tree based on local structure properties. Furthermore, the proposed toolbox supports the simulation of broncho-constriction apparent in pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. AVATREE is provided as an open-source toolbox in C++ and is supported by a graphical user interface integrating the modelling functionalities.

However, without the cooperation and optimal skills pairing among the employees, the success of a project may be negatively impacted. To take full advantage of the potential of each employee, project managers must learn how they can most effectively combine humans skills to benefit from their value. The current research work will assist businesses to make the power of intelligent collaborative matching part of the business core. The elaborated optimal team pairing framework, an integral part of the conceptual architecture of the SmartWork project, aims to combine numerous data sources and novel modelling processes from Machine Learning to provide the employers and project managers with a powerful tool in team pairing of elder office employees \u2026",

Finally, occlusions are dealt with a novel Bayesian framework, which exploits future information to correctly reconstruct occluded areas. Experimental evaluation shows that the layered object scene representation, combined with the proposed methods for object tracking throughout the sequence and occlusion handling, yields very accurate results.",

The knowledge and understanding of the pathophysiology behind these diseases could lead to improved diagnosis and assessment, through the development of computational models that take into account details related to lung geometry, lung mechanical features and the dynamics of the fluid motion inside the lungs. Although there are several works that considers some of the aforementioned characteristics, none of them provides a fully integrated solution. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a software tool that combines geometry processing methods with 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD), allowing us to simulate in a realistic way the effects of bronchoconstriction in the dynamics of the air flow \u2026",

These systems require reliable personal recognition schemes to either confirm or determine the identity of an individual requesting their services. The biometric methods, that are usually incorporated in such systems, can be categorized to physiological and behavioral (Jain et al.(2004)), depending on the type of used features. The most popular physiological biometric traits are the fingerprint (Maltoni et al.(2009)) that is widely used in law enforcement for identifying criminals, the face (Chang et al.(2005)) and the iris (Sun & Tan (2009)). However, despite their high recognition performance, static biometrics have been recently overwhelmed by the new generation of biometrics, which tend to cast light on more natural ways for recognizing people by analyzing behavioural traits. Specifically, behavioural biometrics are related to specific actions and the way that each person executes them. In other words, they aim at recognizing livingness, as it is expressed by dynamic traits. The most indicative cases of behavioural biometric recognition is gait (Goffredo et al.(2009b)), facial expressions (Liu & Chen (2003)) or other activity related, habitual traits (Drosou, Ioannidis, Moustakas & Tzovaras (2010)). As a result behavioural biometrics have become much more attractive to researchers due to their significant recognition potential and their unobtrusive nature. They can potentially allow the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "To date, realistic models of how the central nervous system governs behaviour have been restricted in scope to the brain, brainstem or spinal column, as if these existed as disembodied organs. Further, the model is often exercised in relation to an in vivo physiological experiment with input comprising an impulse, a periodic signal or constant activation, and output as a pattern of neural activity in one or more neural populations. Any link to behaviour is inferred only indirectly via these activity patterns. We argue that to discover the principles of operation of neural systems, it is necessary to express their behaviour in terms of physical movements of a realistic motor system, and to supply inputs that mimic sensory experience. To do this with confidence, we must connect our brain models to neuro-muscular models and provide relevant visual and proprioceptive feedback signals, thereby closing the loop of the simulation. This paper describes an effort to develop just such an integrated brain and biomechanical system using a number of pre-existing models. It describes a model of the saccadic oculomotor system incorporating a neuromuscular model of the eye and its six extraocular muscles. The position of the eye determines how illumination of a retinotopic input population projects information about the location of a saccade target into the system. A pre-existing saccadic burst generator model was incorporated into the system, which generated motoneuron activity patterns suitable for driving the biomechanical eye. The model was demonstrated to make accurate saccades to a target luminance under a set of environmental constraints. Challenges \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Feature extraction from 3D triangle meshes is a very popular and important task that could contribute to many scientific fields such as computer vision, pattern recognition, medical 3D modeling, etc. However, the main challenge is not just finding corners and edges of 3D models but to automatically extract connected clusters of vertices that jointly represent a feature curve. This paper presents an approach for feature curve extraction and similarity evaluation among feature curves of the same or other models robust to differences in scale, resolution quality, pose, or partial observation. The proposed approach could be used, as a pre-processing step, in many other applications like registration, partial matching, tracking, object recognition, etc. Extensive evaluation studies and experiments carried out using a variety of different models and use cases, verify that the proposed approach achieves accurate feature curve \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents BGPViewer, a scheme for visualizing and exploring BGP routing changes. BGPViewer provides two graph based views of the routing changes: AS-view and Country-View. The AS-view utilizes a graph representation of the Internet on per Autonomous System (AS) level, where each node of the graph represents an AS, while the existence of an edge illustrates connectivity between two ASes. By analyzing the BGP announcements from one monitoring point, BGPViewer is able to calculate the amount of traffic change that occurred on a specific, user defined time window. The calculated traffic change refers to the change in each AS prefix ownership, and the change in the number of prefixes used by each link of the graph. Afterwards this information is mapped onto the size of the nodes and the width of the edges of the graph. Furthermore, color is used to illustrate the sign of the traffic change \u2026",

An efficient algorithm is initially proposed for decomposing the complex objects into subobjects suitable for superquadric modeling, based on visual salience and curvature constraints. The distance between the superquadrics and the mesh is then projected onto the superquadric surface, thus generating a distance map (SQ-Map). Approximate collision detection is then performed by computing the analytical equations and distance maps instead of triangle per triangle intersection tests. Collision response is then calculated directly from the superquadric models and realistic smooth force feedback is obtained using analytical formulae and local smoothing on the distance map. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SQ-Map reduces \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Conventional biomechanical modelling approaches involve the solution of large systems of equations that encode the complex mathematical representation of human motion and skeletal structure. To improve stability and computational speed, being a common bottleneck in current approaches, we apply machine learning to train surrogate models and to predict in near real-time, previously calculated medial and lateral knee contact forces (KCFs) of 54 young and elderly participants during treadmill walking in a speed range of 3 to 7 km/h. Predictions are obtained by fusing optical motion capture and musculoskeletal modeling-derived kinematic and force variables, into regression models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR). Training schemes included either data from all subjects (LeaveTrialsOut) or only from a portion of them (LeaveSubjectsOut), in combination with inclusion of ground reaction forces (GRFs) in the dataset or not. Results identify ANNs as the best-performing predictor of KCFs, both in terms of Pearson R (0.89\u20130.98 for LeaveTrialsOut and 0.45\u20130.85 for LeaveSubjectsOut) and percentage normalized root mean square error (0.67\u20132.35 for LeaveTrialsOut and 1.6\u20135.39 for LeaveSubjectsOut). When GRFs were omitted from the dataset, no substantial decrease in prediction power of both models was observed. Our findings showcase the strength of ANNs to predict simultaneously multi-component KCF during walking at different speeds\u2014even in the absence of GRFs\u2014particularly applicable in real-time applications that make use of knee loading conditions to guide and treat patients.

The present study summarizes, for the first time, the current advancement in ACLR in both clinical and computational level. It also emphasizes on the material modeling and properties of the most popular grafts as well as modeling of different surgery techniques. It can be concluded that more effort is needed to be put toward more realistic simulation of the surgery, including also the use of two bundles for graft representation, graft pretension and artificial grafts.

Musculoskeletal redundancy poses significant challenges in obtaining accurate stiffness results without introducing critical modeling assumptions.

The proposed approach is a non-physical extension of the well known St Venant Kirchhoff force, focusing on practical considerations about the behavior of the deformable model. Therefore it is very useful for simulating and controlling non-linear stretching and compressing properties of deformable models in applications where the computation time comprises a major constraint. The presented force model can be easily implemented by the widely used particle systems and can be parameterized based on a direct relation to spring models. We show that the non linear stretching behavior of the proposed model is required for simulations where the external forces which interact with the models are large in scale, while the performance of the presented method is comparable to simple mass-spring systems.",

Without a doubt, the most compelling problem in this domain is the removal of outliers. To effectively address the aforementioned issue, we present a novel method, that detects accurately and efficiently the outliers by exploiting the spatial coherence in the object geometry and the sparsity of the outliers in the spatial domain. This is achieved by solving a convenient convex method called Robust PCA (RPCA). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we evaluate it by using real scanned point clouds which are extremely dense consisting of millions of points.",

As a result, using the proposed information-theoretic approach, the haptic signal can be precomputed as a force field, stored and then filtered by taking into account device and perceptual capabilities of the receiver in order to lower the required bandwidth of the resulting stream, thus opening new possibilities for the representation and processing of haptic media.",

The ACL reconstruction surgery aims to restore healthy knee function by replacing the injured ligament with a graft. Proper selection of the optimal surgery parameters is a complex task. To this end, we developed an automated modeling framework that accepts subject-specific geometries and produces finite element knee models incorporating different surgical techniques. Initially, we developed a reference model of the intact knee, validated with data provided by the OpenKnee project. This helped us evaluate the effectiveness of estimating ligament stiffness directly from MRI. Next, we performed a plethora of \u201cwhat-if\u201d simulations, comparing responses with the reference model. We found that a) increasing graft pretension and radius reduces relative knee displacement, b) the correlation of graft radius and tension should not be neglected, c) graft fixation angle of 20 degrees can reduce knee laxity, and d) singleversus double-bundle techniques demonstrate comparable performance in restraining knee translation. In most cases, these findings confirm reported values from comparative clinical studies. The numerical models are made publicly available, allowing for experimental reuse and lowering the barriers for meta-studies. The modeling approach proposed here can complement orthopedic surgeons in their decision-making.",

Then, and after the collision queries are resolved, the surface of the 3D object can be directly reconstructed in constant time, using the equations of the support planes and the discrete distance map that encodes the distance of the object surface from the support plane. As a result analytical formulae can be extracted that provide the force feedback only as a function of the 3D object spatial transformation and position of the haptic probe. Experimental evaluation and computational complexity analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can reduce significantly the computational cost when compared to existing collision detection and haptic rendering methods",

These systems require reliable personal recognition schemes to either confirm or determine the identity of an individual requesting their services. The biometric methods, that are usually incorporated in such systems, can be categorized to physiological and behavioral (Jain et al.(2004)), depending on the type of used features. The most popular physiological biometric traits are the fingerprint (Maltoni et al.(2009)) that is widely used in law enforcement for identifying criminals, the face (Chang et al.(2005)) and the iris (Sun & Tan (2009)). However, despite their high recognition performance, static biometrics have been recently overwhelmed by the new generation of biometrics, which tend to cast light on more natural ways for recognizing people by analyzing behavioural traits. Specifically, behavioural biometrics are related to specific actions and the way that each person executes them. In other words, they aim at recognizing livingness, as it is expressed by dynamic traits. The most indicative cases of behavioural biometric recognition is gait (Goffredo et al.(2009b)), facial expressions (Liu & Chen (2003)) or other activity related, habitual traits (Drosou, Ioannidis, Moustakas & Tzovaras (2010)).

            "Abstract": "We propose a treemap based interface for presentation of search results according to multiple search criteria. Different colors are used to represent the relevance of each item in the database according to the different search criteria, while at the same time the treemap based representation allows the user to visually identify relevant groups of data, exploiting the hierarchical organization of the items in the database. Items are ranked according to each criterion and an aggregate ranking is computed using the Borda algorithm. Furthermore, appropriate interaction mechanisms are provided in order to assist the user in refining the presentation of the returned items and weigh the contribution of different criteria for retrieving combined search results. The Princeton benchmark 3D object database is used for this study, nevertheless the technique presented is appropriate for any multicriterial search application and in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Driving style is seen not only to become a significant cause of greenhouse gas (GHG) and other air pollutant emissions but also a critical parameter regarding road safety, with huge social & financial adverse effects. In this work we provide a conceptual architecture of a highly innovative and interactive Serious Games platform that will empower and guide users to adopt an eco-friendly driving style. This will be achieved, without distracting users from safe driving, through a multidisciplinary approach aiming at the development of a user friendly, unobtrusive multi-player gaming environment, where the users will not only play collaboratively/competitively using their mobile device but also using the car itself and their own bodies, thus turning eco-driving into an immersive and highly motivating experience. The sensing infrastructure of the proposed system will not only acquire data related to driving from an OBD sensor that will capture a complex set of parameters related to eco-driving, but will also sense environmental and physiological parameters of the driver, so as to better position the state of the system (car) in context (environment, user). The use of virtual user models and cognitive modeling of the users, will further boost personalization and adaptation of the game itself with respect to the needs of the individual driver. The impact of such a holistic and innovative approach is huge and the foundations laid here are expected to result in a widespread adoption of sensor-based gamification platforms in areas going far beyond eco-driving",

            "Abstract": "The wave of digital health is continuously growing and promises to transform the experience of patients, redefining their role as empowered actors of the healthcare processes rather than passive receivers of medical help. Mobile technologies are a fundamental component of this transformation since they have provided a platform for the development of novel solutions, allowing a gradual shift of healthcare closer to the patients' daily living and away from the traditional clinical environment. Chronic diseases are in the center of these developments as they require the continuous and active involvement of not only healthcare professionals but also patients both of who can be empowered through the use of specialized mobile applications and the analysis of data from modern miniaturized and wearable sensing devices. Furthermore, the communication channels introduced by mobile technologies can significantly \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel pyramidal representation scheme for deformable object modelling, which uses a hierarchical approach to optimize the system's performance by executing the simulation in every level of a pyramid. The simulation results of each level are used to predict the lower level's state. The prediction is used as initial guess for the simulation of the lower level. The above procedure is repeated until the final level is reached. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme is able to reduce significantly the computational cost, especially when the simulation involves procedures, which need large numerical computation like the conjugate gradient in implicit integration schemes.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we propose an algorithm for multiple object tracking, a heavily researched but still challenging problem of computer vision. We follow the tracking by detection paradigm in an online fashion and formulate tracking as a typical assignment problem between detections and existing tracks that is solved by a modification of the Hungarian algorithm. Contrary to other methods that use a multitude of features based on appearance, optical flow and prior knowledge gained through training, we solely use clusters of point trajectories to link detections and tracks. Point trajectories are robust under partial occlusions and allow the expansion of a track even in the absence of a detection. At the core of our algorithm lies a motion segmentation method that extracts coherent clusters from triangulated point trajectories. Our algorithm achieves competitive results on the 2D MOT 2015 benchmark showcasing its potential.",
