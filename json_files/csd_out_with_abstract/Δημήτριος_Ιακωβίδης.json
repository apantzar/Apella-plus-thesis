In this paper we propose a novel method for computer-aided detection of thyroid nodules in ultrasound (US) images. The proposed method is based on a level-set image segmentation approach that takes into account the inhomogeneity of the US images. This novel method was experimentally evaluated using US images acquired from 35 patients. The results show that the proposed method achieves more accurate delineation of the thyroid nodules in the US images and faster convergence than other relevant methods.",

In the context of image annotation a variety of ontology-based tools has been proposed. Most of them enable manual annotation of the images with higher level concepts whereas many of them are capable of formally representing low-level features as well. However, they either consider specific, usually quantitative, representations of the low-level features, or spatial semantics limited to 2D/3D image spaces. In this paper we propose a novel ontology-based methodology for automatic image annotation that exploits generalized qualitative spatial relations between objects, given an image domain. To represent knowledge for the spatial arrangements, we have implemented an ontology that models spatial relations in multi-dimensional vector spaces.

One of the popular coarse grained parallelization tools offered by many standards is wavefront parallelism. Under the scheme, each row of blocks is assigned to a separate thread for processing. A thread might commence encoding a particular block once certain precedence constraints are met, namely, it is required that the left block of the same row and the top and top-right block of the previous row have finished compression. Clearly, the imposed constraints result in processing delays. Therefore, in order to optimize performance, it is of paramount importance to properly identify potential bottlenecks before the compression of a frame starts, in order to alleviate them through better resource allocation.

Physicians diagnose pathologies in images derived from Capsule Endoscopy (CE) using specific gaze patterns to observe pathologically related visual cues. Lately, deep learning has advanced in the domain of human eye-fixation estimation in natural images. However, the potentials of predicting the eye related patterns, such as eye fixations, in medical images has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we propose a CNN auto-encoder model, that is capable of predicting saliency maps estimating the gaze-patterns, in terms of eye-fixations, of physicians in CE images. The proposed model outperforms other approaches for visual saliency estimation based on physicians' eye fixation by providing an AUC-J of 0.726 among CE images depicting various pathological and normal cases.",

This can drastically reduce the required annotation effort. Its advantage over the few state-of-the-art weakly-supervised CNN architectures is its simplicity.

These active contours combine the advantages of both the LBP texture representation and the vector-valued active contour without edges model, and result in high quality texture segmentation. s-LAC avoids the iterative calculation of active contour equation terms derived from textural feature vectors and enables efficient, high quality texture segmentation. v-LAC evolves utilizing regional information encoded by means of LBP feature vectors.

Moreover, comparing a patient case with other cases having a similar progress in time can prove valuable for medical decision making.

In this work, a computational framework is proposed for the comparison of multimodal temporal clinical data obtained from different patients. The purpose of the proposed framework is to use a patient's temporal evolution so as to retrieve the most similar profiles from large repositories which can be used to compare treatments, diagnosis, test results and other information.

            "Abstract": "The Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (sTSP) is an intensively studied NP-hard problem. It has many important real-life applications such as logistics, planning, manufacturing of microchips and DNA sequencing. In this paper we propose a cluster level incremental tour construction method called Intra-cluster Refinement Heuristic (IntraClusTSP). The proposed method can be used both to extend the tour with a new node and to improve the existing tour. The refinement step generates a local optimal tour for a cluster of neighbouring nodes and this local optimal tour is then merged into the global optimal tour. Based on the performed evaluation tests the proposed IntraClusTSP method provides an efficient incremental tour generation and it can improve the tour efficiency for every tested state-of-the-art methods including the most efficient Chained Lin-Kernighan refinement algorithm. As an application example, we apply IntraClusTSP to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters in a cluster analysis problem. The standard methods like Silhouette index, Elbow method or Gap statistic method, to estimate the number of clusters support only partitional (single level) clustering, while in many application areas, the hierarchical (multi-level) clustering provides a better clustering model. Our proposed method can discover hierarchical clustering structure and provides an outstanding performance both in accuracy and execution time. View Full-Text",

The generalized piecewise linear approximation approach allows the utilization of a very large number of linear segments for the approximation of the logarithm function, whereas state of the art architectures are limited to a maximum of six segments. In the proposed implementation, up to 1024 linear segments are employed. The exploitation of the capabilities of modern FPGAs, such as large BlockRAMs and fast multipliers allow a high frequency potential combined with low resource requirements, resulting in a pipelined implementation that only requires up to 329 slices, one BlockRAM and one multiplier. The selected number of segments affects the approximation error, which is lower than the comparable architectures by up to five orders of magnitude. The properties of the proposed architecture render it suitable for use as a generic component in systems that require fast, accurate and resource-efficient logarithm calculation.",

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel methodology for automatic detection and localization of gastrointestinal (GI) anomalies in endoscopic video frame sequences. Training is performed with weakly annotated images, using only image-level, semantic labels instead of detailed, and pixel-level annotations. This makes it a cost-effective approach for the analysis of large videoendoscopy repositories. Other advantages of the proposed methodology include its capability to suggest possible locations of GI anomalies within the video frames, and its generality, in the sense that abnormal frame detection is based on automatically derived image features. It is implemented in three phases: 1) it classifies the video frames into abnormal or normal using a weakly supervised convolutional neural network (WCNN) architecture; 2) detects salient points from deeper WCNN layers, using a deep saliency detection algorithm; and 3) localizes \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Salient object detection (SOD) can directly improve the performance of tasks like obstacle detection, semantic segmentation and object recognition. Such tasks are important for robotic and other autonomous navigation systems. State-of-the-art SOD methodologies, provide improved performance by incorporating depth information, usually acquired using additional specialized sensors, e.g., RGB-D cameras. This introduces an overhead to the overall cost and flexibility of such systems. Nevertheless, the recent advances of machine learning, have provided models, capable of generating depth map approximations, given a single RGB image. In this work, we propose a novel monocular SOD (MonoSOD) methodology, based on a two-branch CNN autoencoder architecture capable of predicting depth maps and estimating saliency through a trainable refinement scheme.

The symmetry and sparseness of the co-occurrence matrices are exploited to achieve improved processing times, and smaller, flexible area utilization as compared with the state of the art. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated using input images of various dimensions, in comparison with an optimized software implementation running on a conventional general purpose processor. Simulations of the architecture on contemporary FPGA devices show that it can deliver a speedup of two orders of magnitude over software.",

The scanning subsystem consists of two micro-electro-mechanical mirrors suitable for mass production. The endoscope head can be assembled fast and at low cost. A resolution of the order of 16 lines per mm is achieved for a working distance common in endoscopy. Considerations of the system design include the operation of the mico mirrors, the filtering of reflected light by using polarization effects and a strategy to cope with color metamery.

The proposed LBP scheme has been formulated in order to capture regional information extracted from distributions of LBP values, characterizing a neighborhood around each pixel, instead of using a single LBP value to characterize each pixel. The log-likelihood statistic is employed as a similarity measure between the LBP distributions, resulting to more detailed and accurate segmentation of texture images.",

Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are computationally simple yet effective structures to approximately model and simulate such processes. A limitation of current FCMs is that they are unable to model the hesitancy introduced into a complex system due to imperfect facts, missing information, and indecision. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel extension of the FCM model which is based on the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. This intuitionistic FCM (iFCM) model, which is denoted as iFCM-II, inherently exploits the mathematical framework of intuitionistic fuzzy sets for the definition of the concepts constituting the cognitive map and their interrelations, as well as for reasoning. Furthermore, unlike the previous iFCM model, which is denoted as iFCM-I, it enables an intuitionistic estimation of hesitancy at the output concepts, thus \u2026",

The classification task is realized by Support Vector Machines. Experiments are performed on two standard datasets comprising of 54 and 68 textures from the Vistex and the Outex databases respectively. The results show that in most cases color enhances texture classification. Both spatial and wavelet features can lead to an accurate representation of color-textures. The appropriateness of a color-texture feature extraction method has to be determined by considering the trade-off between the accuracy and the feature space dimensionality needs, as these are imposed by a prospective application.",

However current approaches to this direction usually require a long learning curve, and their development lacks standardization. This results in software components that are difficult to reuse, and hard to maintain or extend. In order to overcome such issues, we propose a novel object-oriented framework for efficient development of software systems for video analysis. It consists of a set of four abstract components, suitable for the implementation of independent plug-in modules for video acquisition, preprocessing, analysis and output handling. The extensibility of each module can be facilitated by sub-modules specifying additional functionalities. This architecture enables quick responses to changes and re-configurability; thus conforming to the requirements of agile software development practices. Considering the need for platform independency, the proposed Java Video Analysis (JVA) framework is implemented in Java. It is publicly available through the web as open-access software, supported by a growing collection of implemented modules. Its efficiency is empirically validated for the development of a representative video analysis system.",

            "Abstract": "The most common radiographic manifestation of bacterial pulmonary infections are foci of consolidation which are visible as bright shadows interfering with the interior lung intensity. In critically-ill patients this interference can be severe leading to vague or invisible lung field boundaries which are difficultly distinguished even by experienced physicians. This problem is amplified if the radiographs are of low quality as obtained with a portable x-ray device, routinely used in intensive care units. This paper proposes a pioneering methodology that copes with lung field detection in both stationary and portable chest radiographs by combining statistical grey-level intensity information and directional edge maps. The boundaries of the lung fields are approximated by consecutive intuitively manipulated parametric curves. Conventional and state of the art lung field detection approaches address only stationary radiography \u2026",

These problems are usually formulated with mathematical programming and can be described as NP hard problems. Moreover, the state-of-the-art (SOA) path search algorithms do not perform efficiently in solving multi-objective optimization (MO) problems making them inappropriate for real-time processing. To address the above limitations and the need for online processing, a swarm intelligence graph-based pathfinding algorithm (SIGPA) for MO route planning was developed. SIGPA generates a population whose individuals move in a greedy approach based on A\u2217 algorithm to search the solution space from different directions. It can be used to find an optimal path for every graph-based problem under various objectives. To test SIGPA, a generic \u2026",

The distributions are aggregated within the functional through new log-likelihood goodness-of-fit terms. The JET model requires only a rough region of interest within the thyroid gland as input and automatically proceeds with precise delineation of the nodules, revealing their shape and size.

Image-based methods proposed for in-vivo-size measurements, rely on reference objects such as the endoscopic biopsy forceps. The aforementioned problem becomes more challenging in the field of capsule endoscopy, as capsules lack navigation and/or biopsy capabilities. To cope with this problem, we propose a methodology that requires only an endoscopic image\u2014without any need for a reference object\u2014in order to estimate the size of an object of interest in it.

The comparative advantage of this method over the state-of-the-art ones is that its performance is comparable without requiring any special equipment, such as NIR cameras, while it is simpler.

It consists in a swallowable color camera that enables the visual detection and assessment of abnormalities, without patient discomfort. The localization of the capsule is currently performed in the 3D abdominal space using radiofrequency (RF) triangulation. However, this approach does not provide sufficient information for the localization of the capsule, and therefore for the localization of the detected abnormalities, within the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen. To cope with this problem, we have recently proposed a method for visual tracking of the capsule endoscope (CE). It is based solely on visual features extracted from the captured images during the journey of the CE in the GI tract, enabling therefore visual odometry.

The use of the linear K-L (Karhunen-Loeve) transformation of the RGB color space for the extraction of the CWC features resulted in a performance that was comparable to the one achieved with more complex non-linear color transformations. The recognition accuracy tested with texture mosaics reached an average of 86%.

In this paper we propose a novel approach to improving the robustness of the original ASM against weak lung field boundaries, which can cause leaking of the shape's contour into the lung fields. The ASM is shielded against leaking by the prior application of a grey-level selective thresholding scheme that subtracts irrelevant anatomic structures from the radiograph. The proposed approach copes with affine lung field projections and features resistance to the presence of dense external objects used for patient's monitoring and support. Its advantageous performance is demonstrated on a challenging set of chest radiographs obtained from patients with bacterial pulmonary infections.",

Methods: Automatic detection of points of interest (POI) in WCE video frames, matching of the detected POI between consecutive frames, and determination of actual correspondences between subsets of these POI based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm was performed. Instead of the speeded up feature extraction (SURF) algorithm, a maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) algorithm, was used. Based on the scaling & the rotation of the content of the consecutive WCE frames, it is possible to estimate the displacement & the rotation of the capsule within the GI tract. For the ex-vivo experiment; a standard simulated intestinal environment was created. Markers were sewn onto the luminal surface of porcine small-bowel through which a capsule endoscope (MiroCam\u00ae, IntroMedic Co Ltd, Seoul, Korea) was propelled. RESULTS: Comparative experiments using both SURF and MSER features, which indicated the superiority of the former over the latter, we conducted. We worked on a corpus of 1070 WCE frames (634 indicating forward motion, 436 indicating backward motion). The accuracy using SURF features was 81.5%(87.2% on forward motion, 73.2% on backward motion), while using MSER was 67.2%(79.8% on forward motion, and 48.9% backward motion). Noteworthy, the proposed algorithm often fails when using MSER (6.7% of frames while< 0.1% when using SURF) and a transform is not estimated due to the lack of adequate correspondences between POI.CONCLUSION: Visual odometry is a promising technique and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The early detection of Heart Disease (HD) and the prediction of Heart Failure (HF) via telemonitoring and can contribute to the reduction of patients\u2019 mortality and morbidity as well as to the reduction of respective treatment costs. In this study we propose a novel classification model based on fuzzy logic applied in the context of HD detection and HF prediction. The proposed model considers that data can be represented by fuzzy phrases constructed from fuzzy words, which are fuzzy sets derived from data. Advantages of this approach include the robustness of data classification, as well as an intuitive way for feature selection. The accuracy of the proposed model is investigated on real home telemonitoring data and a publicly available dataset from UCI.",

            "Abstract": "Medical ultrasound (US) images are characterized by inherent noise perturbations which introduce uncertainty in their interpretation even by experienced radiologists. In this paper we propose a novel deformable model for medical US image segmentation, which incorporates a combination of domain and boundary integrals for the alleviation of the noise effects. It can be applied as a diagnostic aid for the delineation of hypo-echoic regions, which in many cases are associated with pathological findings. The proposed model was experimentally evaluated using various types of medical US images. The results show that it leads to more accurate segmentation results whereas it converges faster than other relevant models.",

            "Abstract": "The interpretation of medical images depends on physicians' experience. Over time, physicians develop their ability to examine the images, and this is usually reflected on gaze patterns they follow to observe visual cues, which lead them to diagnostic decisions. In the context of gaze prediction, graph and machine learning methods have been proposed for the visual saliency estimation on generic images. In this work we preset a novel and robust gaze estimation methodology based on physicians' eye fixations, using convolutional neural networks combined with regularization methods, on medical images taken during Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE). Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of physicians' eye fixation patterns which was used for the training of the neural network model.

The interest of the research community in the LBP texture representation gave rise to plenty of LBP and other binary pattern (BP)-based variations. However, noise sensitivity is still a major concern to their applicability on the analysis of real world images. To cope with this problem we propose a generic, uncertainty-aware methodology for the derivation of Fuzzy BP (FBP) texture models. The proposed methodology assumes that a local neighbourhood can be partially characterized by more than one binary patterns due to noise-originated uncertainty in the pixel values. The texture discrimination capability of four representative FBP-based approaches has been evaluated on the basis of comprehensive classification experiments on three reference datasets of natural textures under various types and levels of additive noise. The results reveal that the FBP-based approaches lead to consistent improvement in texture classification as compared with the original BP-based approaches for various degrees of uncertainty. This improved performance is also validated by illustrative unsupervised segmentation experiments on natural scenes.",

This approach involves three main steps: a) wavelet-based noise reduction, b) segmentation of the input images into regions around the local maxima of the image intensities, c) detection and model-based quantification of the spots within each region using a genetic algorithm. This algorithm searches within a multidimensional parameter space to determine, in parallel, the parameters of multiple diffusion models that optimally fit the characteristics of possible spots. The detection and quantification of the spots is achieved by superposition of diffusion functions modeling adjacent spots. Experiments with 16-bit 2D-PAGE images show that the proposed method is effective and results in low spurious spot detection rate.",

It is based solely on colour features of CE lesions.The lesion images are available online from KID database (Dataset 1).1 Size reference standards were made by manual annotation. The proposed algorithm uses the CIE-Lab colour representation instead of the standard RGB used in CE.1 The components of this space represent lightness (L), the quantity of red (a > 0) or the quantity of green (-a >0), the quantity of yellow (b > 0) or the quantity of blue (-b >0) of a pixel. Initially, the user specifies a point on the lesion of interest (with a single click). Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) is applied to group the pixels of similar colour into contiguous regions, called superpixels.2 Subsequently the superpixels are clustered using the k-means approach into three clusters using \u2026",

The methodology is based on a hierarchical scheme of partitional clusterings fusing information represented by non-negative intensity and textural image features. Partitional clustering is realized by factorization of the feature matrices under non-negativity constraints. In order to enhance its clustering performance a dyadic cluster merging approach has been devised. The spatial distribution of the mined radiographic patterns comprises a cue for the assessment of the extent of an infection. The results of the comprehensive experimentation performed show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 94.1%, outperforming both representative unsupervised and supervised mining approaches.",

The objective of this study is the automatic detection of fractures in bone x-ray images using an image classification method. The dataset that was used in this study consists of 300 x-ray bone images of upper and lower extremity. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction and classification methodology for the detection of bone fractures, named Wavelet Fuzzy Phrases (WFP).

More specifically, a novel methodology is investigated for discriminating defects by applying a supervised neural classification technique, employing a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) trained with the conjugate gradients algorithm, to innovative multidimensional wavelet based feature vectors. These vectors are extracted from the K-Level 2-D DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) transformed original image using Vector Quantization techniques and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to these wavelet domain quantization vectors. The results of the proposed methodology are illustrated in defective textile images where the defective areas are recognized with higher accuracy than the one obtained by applying two rival feature extraction methodologies. The first one of them uses all the wavelet coefficients derived from the k-Level 2-D DWT, while the second one uses only image intensities characteristics. Both rival methods involve the same classification stage as the proposed feature extraction approach. The promising results herein obtained outline the importance of judicious selection and processing of 2-D DWT wavelet coefficients for industrial pattern recognition applications",

In this paper we propose a method for capsule orientation estimation based only on image features, without the requirement of any external equipment. The proposed method involves two steps: a) salient point detection and extraction of image features from these points, and b) detection of feature correspondences between consecutive frames and homography estimation. The capsule orientation is estimated by decomposition of the homography matrix into rotation and translation components. The results obtained by the application of this method on WCE video frames indicate its effectiveness and improved \u2026",

Such endoscopes are equipped with a usually low-frame-rate color camera which enables the visualization of the GI lumen and the detection of pathologies. The localization of the commercially available CEs is performed in the 3D abdominal space using radio-frequency (RF) triangulation from external sensor arrays, in combination with transit time estimation. State-of-the-art approaches, such as magnetic localization, which have been experimentally proved more accurate than the RF approach, are still at an early stage.

It is performed by a wireless swallowable endoscopic capsule capable of transmitting thousands of video frames per examination. The visual inspection of the vast amount of images acquired during such an examination is a subjective and highly time consuming task even for experienced gastroenterologists. In this paper we propose a novel approach to the reduction of the number of the video frames to be inspected so as to enable faster inspection of the endoscopic video. It is based on symmetric non-negative matrix factorisation initialised by the fuzzy c-means algorithm and it is supported by non-negative Lagrangian relaxation to extract a subset of video frames containing the most representative scenes from a whole endoscopic examination.

One such modality is Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE), a noninvasive technique which consists of a swallowable color camera that enables the detection of GI pathology with only minimal patient discomfort. Currently, tracking of the capsule position is estimated in the 3D abdominal space, using radio-frequency (RF) triangulation. The RF triangulation technique, however, does not provide sufficient information about the location of the capsule along the GI lumen, and consequently, the localization of any possible abnormality. Recently, we proposed a geometric visual odometry (VO) method for the localization of the capsule in the GI lumen.

            "Abstract": "Every day, visually challenged people (VCP) face mobility restrictions and accessibility limitations. A short walk to a nearby destination, which for other individuals is taken for granted, becomes a challenge. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel visual perception system for outdoor navigation that can be evolved into an everyday visual aid for VCP. The proposed methodology is integrated in a wearable visual perception system (VPS). The proposed approach efficiently incorporates deep learning, object recognition models, along with an obstacle detection methodology based on human eye fixation prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks. An uncertainty-aware modeling of the obstacle risk assessment and spatial localization has been employed, following a fuzzy logic approach, for robust obstacle detection. The above combination can translate the position and the type of detected obstacles into descriptive linguistic expressions, allowing the users to easily understand their location in the environment and avoid them. The performance and capabilities of the proposed method are investigated in the context of safe navigation of VCP in outdoor environments of cultural interest through obstacle recognition and detection. Additionally, a comparison between the proposed system and relevant state-of-the-art systems for the safe navigation of VCP, focused on design and user-requirements satisfaction, is performed.

These spectral techniques are based on the principle that every material has a different response (reflection and absorption) to different wavelengths. Thereby, this technology facilitates the discrimination between different materials. HSI has demonstrated good discrimination capabilities for materials in fields, for instance, remote sensing, pollution monitoring, field surveillance, food quality, agriculture, astronomy, geological mapping, and currently, also in medicine. HSI technology allows tissue observation beyond the limitations of the human eye. Moreover, many researchers are using HSI as a new diagnosis tool to analyze optical properties of tissue. Recently, HSI has shown good performance in identifying human diseases in a non-invasive manner. In this paper, we show the potential use of these technologies in the medical domain, with emphasis in the current advances in gastroenterology. The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of contemporary concepts regarding HSI technology together with state-of-art systems and applications in gastroenterology. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and upcoming trends of HSI in gastroenterology. View Full-Text",

The achieved approximation accuracy depends on the number of segments used, which also affects the size of a ROM used for storing the parameters that control the computation. The implementation of the ROM using an FPGA BlockRAM allows the parameters to be updated without reconfiguration of the FPGA core.

            "Abstract": "Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is a noninvasive diagnostic technique enabling the inspection of the whole gastrointestinal (GI) tract by capturing and wirelessly transmitting thousands of color images. Proprietary software \u201cstitches\u201d the images into videos for examination by accredited readers. However, the videos produced are of large length and consequently the reading task becomes harder and more prone to human errors. Automating the WCE reading process could contribute in both the reduction of the examination time and the improvement of its diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel feature extraction methodology for automated WCE image analysis. It aims at discriminating various kinds of abnormalities from the normal contents of WCE images, in a machine learning-based classification framework. The extraction of the proposed features involves an unsupervised color-based saliency detection scheme which, unlike current approaches, combines both point and region-level saliency information and the estimation of local and global image color descriptors. The salient point detection process involves estimation of DIstaNces On Selective Aggregation of chRomatic image Components (DINOSARC). The descriptors are extracted from superpixels by coevaluating both point and region-level information. The main conclusions of the experiments performed on a publicly available dataset of WCE images are (a) the proposed salient point detection scheme results in significantly less and more relevant salient points; (b) the proposed descriptors are more discriminative than relevant state-of-the-art descriptors, promising a \u2026",

More specifically, a novel methodology is investigated for discriminating defects by applying a supervised neural classification technique, namely SVM, to innovative multidimensional wavelet based feature vectors. These vectors are extracted from the K-Level 2-D DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) transformed original image using Vector Quantization techniques and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to these wavelet domain quantization vectors. The results of the proposed methodology are illustrated in defective textile images where the defective areas are recognized with higher accuracy than the one obtained by applying two rival defect detection methodologies. The first one of them uses all the wavelet coefficients derived from the k-Level 2-D DWT and involves SVM again in the classification stage, while the second one uses again all the wavelet coefficients derived from the k-Level 2-D DWT but involves a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network in the classification stage. The promising results herein shown outline the importance of judicious selection and processing of 2-D DWT wavelet coefficients for industrial pattern recognition \u2026",

The spectral information of the three color channels forming the endoscopic frames is used for the description of the colonic mucosa. The suitability of different color models for this application is investigated. The textural properties of the colonic mucosal surface are measured using second order statistical descriptors on the wavelet transform of the multichannel video signals.

            "Abstract": "Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are generalized fuzzy sets whose elements are characterized by a membership, as well as a non-membership value. The membership value indicates the degree of belongingness, whereas the non-membership value indicates the degree of non-belongingness of an element to that set. The utility of intuitionistic fuzzy sets theory in computer vision is increasingly becoming apparent, especially as a means to coping with noise. In this paper, we investigate the issue of clustering intuitionistic fuzzy image representations. To achieve that we propose a clustering approach based on the fuzzy c-means algorithm utilizing a novel similarity metric defined over intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for object clustering in the presence of noise and image segmentation. The results indicate that clustering intuitionistic fuzzy image representations can be \u2026",

Furthermore, VCE has the potential to become the leading screening technique for the entire gastrointestinal tract. Computational methods that can be implemented in software can enhance the diagnostic yield of VCE both in terms of efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Since the appearance of the first capsule endoscope in clinical practice in 2001, information technology (IT) research groups have proposed a variety of such methods, including algorithms for detecting haemorrhage and lesions, reducing the reviewing time, localizing the capsule or lesion, assessing intestinal motility, enhancing the video quality and managing the data.

The recognition of a polypoid tumor of the colon in the original image, which were used for training was very high. The trained network was also able to satisfactorily recognize the tumor in a sequence of video frames. The results of the proposed approach were very promising and it seems that it can be efficiently applied for tumor recognition.",

In this paper we propose M3G, a novel method for automatic gridding of cDNA microarray images based on the maximization of the margin between the rows and the columns of the spots. Initially the microarray image rotation is estimated and then a pre-processing algorithm is applied for a rough spot detection. In order to diminish the effect of artefacts, only a subset of the detected spots is selected by matching the distribution of the spot sizes to the normal distribution.
