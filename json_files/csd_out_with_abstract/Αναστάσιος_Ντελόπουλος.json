Despite the progressive nature of PD, early diagnosis, tracking the disease\u2019s natural history and measuring the drug response are factors that play a major role in determining the quality of life of the affected individual. Apart from the common motor symptoms, ie, tremor at rest, rigidity and bradykinesia, studies suggest that PD is associated with disturbances in eating behavior and energy intake. Specifically, PD is associated with drug-induced impulsive eating disorders such as binge eating, appetite-related non-motor issues such as weight loss and/or gain as well as dysphagia\u2014factors that correlate with difficulties in completing day-to-day eating-related tasks.

            "Abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss globally. Yet despite its prevalence, the majority of affected people lack access to the specialized ophthalmologists and equipment required for assessing their condition. This can lead to delays in the start of treatment, thereby lowering their chances for a successful outcome. Machine learning systems that automatically detect the disease in eye fundus images have been proposed as a means of facilitating access to DR severity estimates for patients in remote regions or even for complementing the human expert's diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a machine learning system for the detection of referable DR in fundus images that is based on the paradigm of multiple-instance learning. By extracting local information from image patches and combining it efficiently through an attention mechanism, our system is able to achieve high classification accuracy. Moreover, it can highlight potential image regions where DR manifests through its characteristic lesions. We evaluate our approach on publicly available retinal image datasets, in which it exhibits near state-of-the-art performance, while also producing interpretable visualizations of its predictions.",

To detect early signs of problematic eating behaviour, this paper proposes a novel method for building behaviour assessment models. The goal of the models is to predict whether the in-meal eating behaviour resembles patterns associated with obesity, eating disorders, or low-risk behaviours. The models are trained using meals recorded with a plate scale from a reference population and labels annotated by a domain expert. In addition, the domain expert assigned scores that characterise the degree of any exhibited abnormal patterns. To improve model effectiveness, we use the domain expert's scores to create training error regularisation weights that alter the importance of each training instance for its class during model \u2026",

The main idea behind our approach is the fact that each point correspondence in our data belongs to one of two classes (inliers/outlier). The classification of each point match relies on the histogram of a quantity representing the difference between cross ratios derived from a construction involving 6-tuples of point matches. Neither constraints nor scenario dependent parameters/thresholds are needed. Even for few candidate point matches the ensemble of 6-tuples containing each of them turns to provide statistically reliable histograms that prove to discriminate between inliers and outliers. In fact, in most cases a random sampling among this population is sufficient \u2026",

Researchers have proposed solutions to estimate SES indicators by analyzing Google Street View images, however, these methods are also resource-intensive, since they require large volumes of manually labeled training data.(2) Methods: We propose a methodology for automatically computing surrogate variables of SES indicators using street images of parked cars and deep multiple instance learning. Our approach does not require any manually created labels, apart from data already available by statistical authorities, while the entire pipeline for image acquisition, parked car detection, car classification, and surrogate variable computation is fully automated. The proposed surrogate variables are then used in linear regression models to estimate the target SES indicators.(3) Results: We implement and evaluate a model based on the proposed surrogate variable at 30 municipalities of varying SES in Greece. Our model has R 2= 0.76 and a correlation coefficient of 0.874 with the true unemployment rate, while it achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 0.089 and mean absolute error of 1.87 on a held-out test set. Similar results are also obtained for other socioeconomic indicators, related to education level and occupational prestige.(4) Conclusions: The proposed methodology can be used to estimate SES indicators at the local level automatically, using images of parked cars detected via Google Street View \u2026",

The produced aggregate membership functions represent objects, which bear combinations of the properties specified by the cues.

Previous studies, however, have shown that in many cases the resulting training sets suffer from severe label noise that has a significant impact in the SVM concept detector performance. This paper evaluates and proposes a set of strategies for automatically building effective concept detectors from clickthrough data. These strategies focus on: (1) automatic training set generation; (2) assignment of label confidence weights to the training samples and (3) using these weights at the classifier level to improve concept detector effectiveness. For training set selection and in order to assign weights to individual training samples three Information Retrieval (IR) models are examined: vector space models, BM25 and language models.

HPV typing is often performed by means of manually analyzing PCR-RFLP gel electrophoresis images. However, the typing procedure that is currently employed suffers from unsatisfactory accuracy and high time consumption. In order to treat these problems we propose a novel approach to HPV typing that automates the analysis of the electrophoretic images and concurrently improves the accuracy of the typing decision. The proposed methodology contributes both to the extraction of information from the images through a novel modeling approach and also to the process of making a typing decision based on the above information by the introduction of an original HPV typing algorithm.

Since it cannot be cured, treatment options focus on the improvement of PD symptoms. In fact, evidence suggests that early PD intervention has the potential to slow down symptom progression and improve the general quality of life in the long term. However, the initial motor symptoms are usually very subtle and, as a result, patients seek medical assistance only when their condition has substantially deteriorated; thus, missing the opportunity for an improved clinical outcome. This situation highlights the need for accessible tools that can screen for early motor PD symptoms and alert individuals to act accordingly.

The algorithm proceeds by applying FastMap on the computed kernel matrix as a dimensionality reduction technique. The embedded vectors are used to produce an affinity matrix. Finally, spectral clustering is performed on the computed affinity matrix.

Two main data sources were involved in the study. In particular, the first one includes qualitative data from semi-structured interviews, involving 10 PD patients and four clinicians in the co-creation process of the game design, whereas the second one relates with data from an online questionnaire addressed by 104 participants spanning the whole related spectrum, i.e., PD patients, physicians, software/game developers.

The scored images are then used to create training sets for SVM and appropriate sample weights for two SVM variants: the Fuzzy SVM (FSVM) and the Power SVM (PSVM). These SVM variants incorporate weights for each individual training sample and can therefore be used to model label uncertainty at the classifier level. Experiments on the MSR-Bing Image Retrieval Grand Challenge dataset (consisting of 1M images and 82.3M unique clicks) show that FSVM is the most robust SVM algorithm \u2026",

Recent developments in mobile and wearable devices, such as smartphones and smartwatches, have allowed the automated detection and objective measurement of PD symptoms. In this paper we investigate the hypothesis that PD motor symptom degradation can be assessed by studying the in-meal behavior and modeling the food intake process. To achieve this, we use the inertial data from a commercial smartwatch to investigate the in-meal eating behavior of healthy controls and PD patients.

Several parameters of the living environment are contributing to this increase, such as the density of fast food retailers, and thus, preventive health policies against childhood obesity must focus on the environment to which children are exposed. Currently, there are no systems in place to objectively measure the effect of living environment parameters on obesogenic behaviors and obesity. The H2020 project \u201cBigO: Big Data Against Childhood Obesity\u201d aims to tackle childhood obesity by creating new sources of evidence based on big data.Objective: This paper introduces the Obesity Prevention dashboard (OPdashboard), implemented in the context of BigO, which offers an interactive data platform for the exploration of objective obesity-related behaviors and local environments based on the data recorded using the BigO mHealth (mobile health) app.Methods: The OPdashboard, which can be accessed on the web, allows for (1) the real-time monitoring of children\u2019s obesogenic behaviors in a city area,(2) the extraction of associations between these behaviors and the local environment, and (3) the evaluation of interventions over time. More than 3700 children from 33 schools and 2 clinics in 5 European cities have been monitored using a custom-made mobile app created to extract behavioral patterns by capturing accelerometer and geolocation data.

The geometric objects and their relationships have been modelled as elements of a 3D Geo metric Algebra. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is more robust to measurement noise - such as motion estimation errors - than traditional tools for extracting 'structure from motion' (SFM) under the or thography assumption.",

The proposed method is based on features, extracted from reference logo images and test images. Extracted features are combined with respect to their similarity in their descriptors' space and afterwards with respect to their geometric consistency on the image plane. The contribution of this paper is a novel method for fast geometric consistency test. Using state of the art fast matching methods, it produces pairs of similar features between the test image and the reference logo image and then examines which pairs are forming a consistent geometry on both the test and the reference logo image. It is noteworthy that the proposed method is scale, rotation and translation invariant. The key advantage of the proposed method is that it exhibits a much lower computational complexity and better performance than the state of the art \u2026",

As a result, experiments in the UCF11 and UCF101 datasets show that our method consistently outperforms unsupervised LDA in every metric. Furthermore, analysis shows that class-relevant topics of fsLDA lead to sparse video representations and encapsulate high-level information corresponding to parts of video events, which we denote\" micro-events\".",

A number of single meal analysis methods that have been successfully applied are based on the Mandometer, a weight scale that continuously measures the weight of food on a plate over the course of a meal. Experimental meal analysis is performed using the cumulative food intake curve, which is produced by the semi-automatic processing of the Mandometer weight measurements, in tandem with the video recordings of the eating session. Due to its complexity and the video recording dependence, this process is not suited to a clinical or a real-life setting.In this work, we evaluate a method for automating the extraction of an accurate food intake curve, corrected for food \u2026",

Recently, certain HPV types have been associated with the development of several cancer types (Parkin, 2006), including anal, vaginal, penile, oral, and pharyngeal cancer.The cervical cancer is currently the most prominent case of association between HPV and cancer. The persistent infection of the anogenital tract by a group of HPV types has been proved to be the main causal factor of cervical cancer (Bosch et al., 2002; Walboomers et al., 1999). This group of cervical cancer related types currently includes 30 to 40 types. However, not all the types in the group induce the same risk for the development of cervical cancer. In fact, virologists have classified the aforementioned types with respect to their oncogenic activity as low-risk, high-risk, and potentially high-risk (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2003), while other HPV types remain unclassified.",

The occluded parts provide a spurious link that can lead to undersegmentation. In this paper, following the framework of previous work where a video is divided in subsequences, we focus on the negative effect of occlusions and propose a method that resolves such cases. We improve the quality and robustness of segmentation by rejecting noisy trajectories using the sparsity of reprojection error.

This paper presents an algorithm for automatically processing continuous in-meal weight measurements in order to extract the clean CFI curve and in-meal eating indicators, such as total food intake and food intake rate. The algorithm relies on the representation of the weight-time series by a string of symbols that correspond to events such as bites or food additions. A context-free grammar is next used to model a meal as a sequence of such events. The selection of the most likely parse tree is finally used to determine the predicted eating sequence.

Most approaches rely on detecting distictive structures on the sound wave, or on extracting a set of features and using a classifier to detect chews. In this work, we propose to use feature-learning in the time domain with 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks for for chewing detection.

            "Abstract": "Canopy height is a fundamental biophysical and structural parameter, crucial for biodiversity monitoring, forest inventory and management, and a number of ecological and environmental studies and applications. It is a determinant for linking the classification of land cover to habitat categories towards building one-to-one relationships. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or 3D Stereoscopy are the commonly used and most accurate remote sensing approaches to measure canopy height. However, both require significant time and budget resources. This study proposes a cost-effective methodology for canopy height approximation using texture analysis on a single 2D image. An object-oriented approach is followed using land cover (LC) map as segmentation vector layer to delineate landscape objects. Global texture feature descriptors are calculated for each land cover object and used as variables in a number of classifiers, including single and ensemble trees, and support vector machines. The aim of the analysis is the discrimination among classes in a wide range of height values used for habitat mapping (from less than 5 cm to 40 m). For that task, different spatial resolutions are tested, representing a range from airborne to spaceborne quality ones, as well as their combinations, forming a multiresolution training set. Multiple dataset alternatives are formed based on the missing data handling, outlier removal, and data normalization techniques. The approach was applied using orthomosaics from DMC II airborne images, and evaluated against a reference LiDAR-derived canopy height model (CHM). Results reached overall object-based \u2026",

In this work we use an in-ear microphone, commonly used for chewing detection, and propose algorithms for recognizing three food-texture attributes, specifically crispiness, wetness (moisture), and chewiness. We use binary SVMs, one for each attribute, and propose two algorithms: one that recognizes each texture attribute at the chew level and one at the chewing-bout level. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on a dataset with 9 subjects. We also evaluate them using leave-one-food-type-out cross-validation, in order to examine the generalization of our approach to new, unknown food types. Our approach performs very well in recognizing crispiness (0.95 weighted accuracy on new subjects and 0.93 on new food types) and demonstrates promising results for objective and automatic recognition of wetness and chewiness.",

            "Abstract": "Clickthrough data from image search engines provide a massive and continuously generated source of user feedback that can be used to model how the search engine users perceive the visual content. Image clickthrough data have been successfully used to build concept detectors without any manual annotation effort, although the generated annotations suffer from labeling errors. Previous research efforts therefore focused on modeling the sample uncertainty in order to improve concept detector effectiveness. In this paper, we study the problem in an online learning setting using streaming clickthrough data where each click is treated seperately when it becomes available; the concept detector model is therefore continuously updated without batch retraining. We argue that sample uncertainty can be incorporated in the online learning setting by exploiting the repetitions of incoming clicks at the classifier level \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The importance of automated and objective monitoring of dietary behavior is becoming increasingly accepted. The advancements in sensor technology along with recent achievements in machine-learning--based signal-processing algorithms have enabled the development of dietary monitoring solutions that yield highly accurate results. A common bottleneck for developing and training machine learning algorithms is obtaining labeled data for training supervised algorithms, and in particular ground truth annotations. Manual ground truth annotation is laborious, cumbersome, can sometimes introduce errors, and is sometimes impossible in free-living data collection. As a result, there is a need to decrease the labeled data required for training. Additionally, unlabeled data, gathered in-the-wild from existing wearables (such as Bluetooth earbuds) can be used to train and fine-tune eating-detection models. In this work, we focus on training a feature extractor for audio signals captured by an in-ear microphone for the task of eating detection in a self-supervised way. We base our approach on the SimCLR method for image classification, proposed by Chen et al. from the domain of computer vision. Results are promising as our self-supervised method achieves similar results to supervised training alternatives, and its overall effectiveness is comparable to current state-of-the-art methods.

However, optical systems are reported to be inferior in terms of accuracy in camera motion estimation. Moreover, marker-based approaches often cause problems in image/video compositing and impose undesirable constraints on camera movement, present work introduces a novel methodology for the construction of a two-tone blue screen, which allows the localization of camera in three-dimensional (3-D) space on the basis of the captured sequence. At the same time, a novel algorithm is presented for the extraction of camera's 3-D motion parameters based on 3-D-to-two-dimensional (2-D) line correspondences. Simulated experiments have been included to illustrate the performance of the proposed system.",

Our submission aims at experimentally evaluating three research items, that are important for work that is currently in progress. First, we examine the use of bag-of-words audio features for video concept detection, with noisy and/or low-quality video data. Although audio is important for some concepts and has shown promising results at other datasets, the results indicate that it can also lead to a decrease in performance when the quality is low and the negative examples are not adequately represented. We also explore the possibility of using a cross-domain concept fusion approach for reducing the number of dimensions at the final classifier. The corresponding experiments show, however, that when drastically reducing the number of dimensions the effectiveness drops. Finally, we also examined a transformation of the feature space, using a set of functions that are parametrically constructed from the data.",

More specifically, the aim is to reduce artifacts on the human figures in a scene (foreground), unlike other methods which target the background. Skeletal tracking is for the first time used to guide the image completion process, referred to as silhouette completion, as a tool to bypass occlusions. One reference viewpoint is primarily used in the view synthesis stage. The proposed algorithms are used as a complement to the general image completion methods\u2013the latter ones handle the background and the former ones the foreground.Two approaches are examined and implemented. An initial stage for both approaches, exploits the skeleton to detect any discontinuities in the figure. Parts that are not missing but filled with background pixels and, therefore, would not get inpainted by a conventional method, are now detected and a mask is formed there. In the first approach\u2013\u2018silhouette completion via inpainting\u2019\u2013an orientation term is introduced in priority computation to favor patches with structures parallel to the skeleton. In this way, appropriate structures can propagate and complete the figure naturally. In the second approach\u2013\u2018silhouette completion with one plus view\u2019\u2013the mask is formed in the same way as described above. However, it is filled in not via inpainting but with the corresponding information from a camera on the opposite side of the reference view instead. In this case, only the information contained in the mask is required to complete the silhouette. It can be an interesting alternative to the two-view approach in view synthesis in cases where the center of attention is on \u2026",

This broad definition of multimedia includes text, audio (speech, music), images, video and even other types of signals such as bio-signals, temperature and pressure recordings, etc. Limiting the types of human perception mechanisms to vision and hearing senses yields a somehow narrower definition of multimedia content that is closer to the scope of multimedia in our everyday or commercial language.

These include text, digital audio (including digital speech), digital images and video.Although some of the concepts presented in this chapter are easily extendable to all types of digital multimedia content, we shall focus on speech and video. The reason of adopting this restrictive approach is that these two modalities (i) constitute the vast amount of data transmitted over wireless channels;(ii) they both share the need to be streamed through these channels and (iii) much of the research and standardization activities have been aimed at their efficient transmission.

            "Abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that manifests through slowly progressing symptoms, such as tremor, voice degradation and bradykinesia. Automated detection of such symptoms has recently received much attention by the research community, owing to the clinical benefits associated with the early diagnosis of the disease. Unfortunately, most of the approaches proposed so far, operate under a strictly laboratory setting, thus limiting their potential applicability in real world conditions. In this work, we present a method for automatically detecting tremorous episodes related to PD, based on acceleration signals. We propose to address the problem at hand, as a case of Multiple-Instance Learning, wherein a subject is represented as an unordered bag of signal segments and a single, expert-provided, ground-truth.

Although the major causes of obesity are known, the obesogenic behaviors manifest as a result of complex interactions of the individual with the living environment. For this reason, addressing childhood obesity remains a challenging problem for public health authorities. The BigO project (https://bigoprogram.eu) relies on large-scale behavioral and environmental data collection to create tools that support policy making and intervention design. In this work, we propose a novel analysis approach for modeling the expected population behavior as a function of the local environment.

            "Abstract": "The consumption of tobacco has reached global epidemic proportions and is characterized as the leading cause of death and illness. Among the different ways of consuming tobacco (e.g., smokeless, cigars), smoking cigarettes is the most widespread. In this paper, we present a two-step, bottom-up algorithm towards the automatic and objective monitoring of cigarette-based, smoking behavior during the day, using the 3D acceleration and orientation velocity measurements from a commercial smartwatch. In the first step, our algorithm performs the detection of individual smoking gestures (i.e., puffs) using an artificial neural network with both convolutional and recurrent layers. In the second step, we make use of the detected puff density to achieve the temporal localization of smoking sessions that occur throughout the day. In the experimental section we provide extended evaluation regarding each step of the proposed algorithm, using our publicly available, realistic Smoking Event Detection (SED) and Free-living Smoking Event Detection (SED-FL) datasets recorded under semi-controlled and free-living conditions, respectively. In particular, leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) experiments reveal an F1-score of 0.863 for the detection of puffs and an F1-score/Jaccard index equal to 0.878/0.604 towards the temporal localization of smoking sessions during the day. Finally, to gain further insight, we also compare the puff detection part of our algorithm with a similar approach found in the recent literature.",

In particular, we work on a dataset of rectified facades and we attempt to discover the origin of a number of query facade segments, contaminated with noise. The building block of our description are the windows of the facade. To this direction we develop an algorithm that achieves to accurately detect them. Our core contribution though, lies on the probabilistic manipulation of the geometry of the detected windows. In particular, we propose a simple probabilistic grammar to model this geometry and we propose a methodology for learning the parameters of the grammar from a single instance of each facade through a MAP estimation procedure. The produced generative model is essentially a detector of the particular facade. After producing one model per facade in our dataset, we proceed with the classification of the query segments. Promising results indicate that the simultaneous use of an appearance model together with our geometric formulation always achieved superior classification rates than the exclusive use of the appearance model itself, justifying the value of probabilistic geometric grammars for the task of facade classification.",

Despite the abundance of methods and algorithms that are available in bibliography, commercial solutions are mostly limited to digital logging applications for smart-phones. One factor that limits the adoption of such solutions is that they usually require specialized hardware or sensors. Based on this, we evaluate the potential for estimating the weight of consumed food (per bite) based only on the audio signal that is captured by commercial ear buds (Samsung Galaxy Buds). Specifically, we examine a combination of features (both audio and non-audio features) and trainable estimators (linear regression, support vector regression, and neural-network based estimators) and evaluate on an in-house dataset of 8 participants and 4 food types. Results indicate good potential for this approach: our best results yield mean absolute error of less than 1 g for 3 out of 4 food types when training food-specific models, and 2.1 g when training on all food types together, both of which improve over an existing literature approach.",

The primary aim of this study was to investigate differences in objectively measured EI between groups of healthy controls (HC), early (ESPD) and advanced stage PD patients (ASPD) during a standardized lunch in a clinical setting. The secondary aim was to identify clinical features and eating behavior abnormalities that explain EI differences. All participants (n= 23 HC, n= 20 ESPD, and n= 21 ASPD) went through clinical evaluations and were eating a standardized meal (200 g sausages, 400 g potato salad, 200 g apple pur\u00e9e and 500 mL water) in front of two video cameras. Participants ate freely, and the food was weighed pre-and post-meal to calculate EI (kcal). Multiple linear regression was used to explain group differences in EI. ASPD had a significantly lower EI vs. HC (\u2212 162 kcal, p< 0.05) and vs. ESPD (\u2212 203 kcal, p< 0.01) when controlling for sex. The number of spoonfuls, eating problems, dysphagia and upper extremity tremor could explain most (86%) of the lower EI vs. HC, while the first three could explain~ 50% vs. ESPD. Food component intake analysis revealed significantly lower potato salad and sausage intakes among ASPD vs. both HC and ESPD, while water intake was lower vs. HC.

            "Abstract": "Large portion sizes and a high eating rate are associated with high energy intake and obesity. Most individuals maintain their food intake weight (g) and eating rate (g/min) rank in relation to their peers, despite food and environmental manipulations. Single meal measures may enable identification of \u201clarge portion eaters\u201d and \u201cfast eaters,\u201d finding individuals at risk of developing obesity. The aim of this study was to predict real-life food intake weight and eating rate based on one school lunch. Twenty-four high-school students with a mean (\u00b1SD) age of 16.8 yr (\u00b10.7) and body mass index of 21.9 (\u00b14.1) were recruited, using no exclusion criteria. Food intake weight and eating rate was first self-rated (\u201cLess,\u201d\u201cAverage\u201d or \u201cMore than peers\u201d), then objectively recorded during one school lunch (absolute weight of consumed food in grams). Afterwards, subjects recorded as many main meals (breakfasts, lunches and dinners) as possible in real-life for a period of at least two weeks, using a Bluetooth connected weight scale and a smartphone application. On average participants recorded 18.9 (7.3) meals during the study. Real-life food intake weight was 327.4 g (\u00b1110.6), which was significantly lower (p= 0.027) than the single school lunch, at 367.4 g (\u00b1167.2). When the intra-class correlation of food weight intake between the objectively recorded real-life and school lunch meals was compared, the correlation was excellent (R= 0.91). Real-life eating rate was 33.5 g/min (\u00b114.8), which was significantly higher (p= 0.010) than the single school lunch, at 27.7 g/min (\u00b113.3).

Use of self-reports and other non-automated means of monitoring have been found to be unreliable, compared to the use of wearable sensors. Various modalities have been reported, such as acoustic signal from ear-worn microphones, or signal from wearable strain sensors. In this work, we introduce a new sensor for the task of chewing detection, based on a novel photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor placed on the outer earlobe to perform the task. We also present a processing pipeline that includes two chewing detection algorithms from literature and one new algorithm, to process the captured PPG signal, and present their effectiveness.

An algorithm is provided that ranks the senses of a word in a text based on this information, effectively leading to word sense disambiguation. In the second part, a method based on WordNet is developed that constructs the fuzzy sets for the senses (independent of any text).

In particular, the chromosomes of human beings are categorized into 22 autosome and 2 sex classes. Chromosome analysis aims at revealing numerical and/or structural chromosome abnormalities that have been found to be responsible for several diseases, including cancer (eg, leukemia). The aforementioned fact emphasizes the significance of chromosome analysis in the field of cytogenetics with widespread applications in prenatal screening, genetic counseling, oncology, radiation dosimetry and toxicology (Carothers & Piper, 1994). The first step towards human chromosome analysis is the assignment of the chromosomes into the aforementioned 24 classes (chromosome classification). This task is carried out on microscope images of single cells that depict the complete set of chromosomes as partially overlapping objects\u2013see Figure 1 (a) for an example. The overlapping objects are first segmented and subsequently categorized, based on their visual features (eg, their relative length), into the 24 classes of human chromosomes taking into account the biologically-dictated number of instances per class. The task of classifying all the chromosomes in a microscope image is called karyotyping; a typical karyotyping outcome is depicted in Figure 1 (b). Initially, chromosome analysis has been performed manually by cytogeneticists. However, this has been proved to be a very time-consuming and laborious yet error-prone task.

In addition experimental measurements validate the hypothesis that each of these manifolds can be decomposed to a small number of linear subspaces of very low dimension. This yields a parameterization of the manifolds that allows for computing the distance of a feature vector from each subspace and consequently from each one of the six manifolds. Two alternative classifiers are next proposed that use the corresponding distances as input: the first one is based on the minimum distance from the manifolds, while the second one uses SVMs that are trained with the vector of all distances from each subspace \u2026",

This potential has led many researchers to develop methods that use widely available sensors to measure and quantify the presence of PD symptoms such as tremor, rigidity and braykinesia.

The proposed multiresolution approach greatly improves the trade-off between accuracy and timeperformance leading to satisfactory results with a considerably low amount of computations. Moreover, based on the point gatherings extracted in [14], the bounding polygon and the direction of movement are estimated for each mobile object; thus yielding an adequate representation in the MPEG-7 sense. Finally, the resulting polygons can be used as appropriate initial estimates for methods that extract object contours, eg curve propagation approaches, such as [8, 10] which utilize the level-set method.",

The runs employ multiple low-level features based on all available modalities (visual, audio and text) and the results show that use of such features improves the retrieval effectiveness significantly. We also use a concept score fusion approach that achieves good results with reduced low-level feature vector dimensionality. Furthermore, a weighting scheme is introduced for cluster assignment in the \u201cbag-of-words\u201d approach. Our runs achieved good performance compared to a baseline run and the submissions of other TRECVID-2009 participants. For the Interactive Search task, we focus on the evaluation of the integrated VITALAS system in order to gain insights into the use and effectiveness of the system\u2019s search functionalities on (the combination of) multiple modalities and study the behavior of two user groups: professional archivists and non-professional users. Our analysis indicates that both user groups submit about the same total number of queries and use the search functionalities in a similar way, but professional users save twice as many shots and examine shots deeper in the ranked retrieved list. The agreement between the TRECVID assessors and our users was quite low. In terms of the effectiveness of the different search modalities, similarity searches retrieve on average twice as many relevant shots as keyword searches, fused searches three times as many \u2026",

In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a computerized methodology for improving virus typing via PCR-RFLP gel electrophoresis. A novel realistic observation model of the viral DNA motion on the gel matrix is employed to assist in exploiting additional virus-related information in comparison to the conventional approaches.

Currently, no good technological solutions are available. Hence, the SPLENDID eating detection sensor (ie an ear-worn device) was developed to enable complete and objective measurements of eating events. The technical performance of this device has been described before. To date, literature is lacking a description of how such a device is perceived and experienced by potential users. The current paper describes how potential users perceived and experienced the SPLENDID eating detection sensor during the different stages of its development. Potential users evaluated the eating detection sensor at different stages of its development: 1) At the start twelve health professionals (eg dieticians or personal trainers) were interviewed and a focus group was held with five potential end-users (m/w= 0/5, age: 22\u00b12 yrs., BMI: 22.5\u00b11.9 kg/m2) to find out about their thoughts on the concept of the eating detection sensor. 2) Preliminary prototypes of the eating detection sensor were tested in a laboratory setting where 23 participants (m/w= 13/10, age: 23\u00b13 yrs., BMI: 22.6\u00b13 kg/m2) reported their experiences. 3) The first wearable version of the eating detection sensor was tested in a semi-controlled study where 22 young, overweight adults (m/w= 3/19, age: 23\u00b12 yrs., BMI: 28.0\u00b12.3 kg/m) used the sensor on two days and reported their experiences. 4) The final version of the sensor was tested in a 4-week feasibility study by 20 young, overweight adults (m/w= 4/16, age: 25\u00b12 yrs., BMI: 28.8\u00b12.8 kg/m2) who reported their \u2026",

Optical tracking systems for virtual sets production have become particularly popular tending to substitute electro-mechanical ones. In this work, an existing optical tracking system is revisited, in order to tackle with inherent degenerate cases; namely, reduction of the perspective projection model to the orthographic one and blurring of the blue screen. In this context, we propose a simple algorithm for 3D motion estimation under orthography using 3D-to-2D line correspondences. In addition, the watershed algorithm is employed for successful feature extraction in the presence of defocus or motion blur.",

Effective prevention and treatment starts at the early age and requires objective knowledge of population-level behavior on the region/neighborhood scale.

The behavioral information is related to physical activity, types of visited places, and transportation mode used between them. The system employs indicator-extraction algorithms from the literature which we evaluate on publicly available datasets.

Each semantic entity in the encyclopedia is defined in terms of other semantic entities as well as low level features, which we call syntactic entities, in a hierarchical scheme. Furthermore, a methodology is introduced, which can be used to evaluate the direct contribution of every syntactic feature of the document to the identification of semantic entities. This information allows us to estimate the quality of the result as well as the required computational cost of the search procedure and to balance between them. Our approach could be particularly important in real time and/or bulky search/indexing applications.",

To this end, the BigO system facilitates the collection, processing and modelling of behavioural data at population level to provide evidence for effective policy and interventions design.

            "Abstract": "Mobile technologies targeting both eating and physical activity behavior provide new opportunities for weight management, but for data on eating behavior these rely on self-report. This results in unreliable information and is burdensome for the user. SPLENDID, an EU project, aims to take the next step in the development of these mobile technologies and is currently developing a wearable personal coach; ie a system that will actively monitor eating and physical activity behavior and provides real-time feedback. For the system to be implemented successfully it is essential that it is accepted by consumers and health professionals. While still under development it was investigated how the system is perceived by them. The system was discussed in a focus group with five females (age: 19\u201324 years) interested in weight management. Nineteen overweight young adults completed a questionnaire on their experiences with the system after 5 hours of using and wearing the system. Furthermore, twelve health professionals were interviewed on the system. Overall the system was perceived as very promising. The objective measurements of both eating and physical activity behavior, and real-time feedback were especially appreciated. However, it was emphasized that the system should be discrete, user-friendly and comfortable for the consumer, and saves the health professional time. These results of the focus group, interviews and questionnaire on user experience are promising and are being taken into account in the further development of the system.",

We explore two alternative approaches for handling noisy training data at the classifier level by training concept detectors with two SVM variants: the Fuzzy SVM and the Power SVM. Experimental results on images collected from a professional image search engine indicate that 1) Fuzzy SVM outperforms both SVM and Power SVM and is the most effective approach towards handling label noise and 2) the performance gain of Fuzzy SVM compared to SVM increases progressively with the noise level in the training sets.",

Toward this goal, ASSIST provides the means for seamless integration and virtual unification of distributed and heterogeneous CxCa data repositories, and the underlying mechanisms to undertake the entire process of expressing and statistically evaluating medical hypotheses based on the collected data in order to generate medically important associations.

            "Abstract": "Weighted SVM (or fuzzy SVM) is the most widely used SVM variant owning its effectiveness to the use of instance weights. Proper selection of the instance weights can lead to increased generalization performance. In this work, we extend the span error bound theory to weighted SVM and we introduce effective hyperparameter selection methods for the weighted SVM algorithm. The significance of the presented work is that enables the application of span bound and span-rule with weighted SVM. The span bound is an upper bound of the leave-one-out error that can be calculated using a single trained SVM model. This is important since leave-one-out error is an almost unbiased estimator of the test error. Similarly, the span-rule gives the actual value of the leave-one-out error. Thus, one can apply span bound and span-rule as computationally lightweight alternatives of leave-one-out procedure for hyperparameter selection. The main theoretical contributions are: (a) we prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the span of a support vector in weighted SVM; and (b) we prove the extension of span bound and span-rule to weighted SVM. We experimentally evaluate the span bound and the span-rule for hyperparameter selection and we compare them with other methods that are applicable to weighted SVM: the -fold cross-validation and the  bound. Experiments on 14 benchmark data sets and data sets with importance scores for the training instances show that: (a) the condition for the existence of span in weighted SVM is satisfied almost always; (b) the span-rule is the most effective method for weighted SVM \u2026",
