Specifically, the fair spectrum allocation (SA) problem is examined for a priori reserving resources aiming to achieve near-even minimum quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for all contending connections. The fairness problem arises when greedy SA policies are followed, which are based on point-based maximum demand predictions, especially under congested networks, with some connections highly overprovisioned and others entirely blocked, resulting in highly uneven QoS connection guarantees. To address this problem, we consider predictive traffic distributions allowing the exploration of several combinations of possible SAs. To find a fair SA policy, we resort to an \u03b1-fairness scheme, while QoS fairness is evaluated according to a game-theoretic analysis based on the coefficient of variations of the \u2026",

During the Haiti earthquake (January 2010), all cellular networks were severely affected to the extent that they became non-operational, either due to the infrastructure damage around Port-au-Prince or due to severe congestion. The effects of the Tohoku earthquake in Japan (March 2011) on the telecommunications infrastructure were equally dramatic. In total, 1.9 million communication lines and about 29,000 cellular base stations suffered extensive damage.

This is possible due to the emergence of optical network elements that have the intelligence required to efficiently control the network. Optical mesh networks will enable a variety of dynamic services such as bandwidth-on-demand, Just-In-Time bandwidth, bandwidth scheduling, bandwidth brokering, and optical virtual private networks that open up new opportunities for service providers and their customers alike. Path Routing in Mesh Optical Networks combines both theoretical as well as practical aspects of routing and dimensioning for mesh optical networks. All authors have worked as technical leaders for the equipment vendor Tellium who implemented such capabilities in its product, and whose product was deployed in service provider networks. Path Routing in Mesh Optical Networks Presents an in-depth treatment of a specific class of optical networks, ie path-oriented mesh optical networks. Focuses on routing and \u2026",

It is for that reason that communication over wireless local area networks (WLANs) is becoming the primary means of transporting data to/from vehicles. However, due to their limit range WLANs only offer intermittent connectivity, and due to node mobility the established connections are only available for a short period of time.

The dynamic vehicle routing problem is addressed where nodes are removed, representing customers that have already been visited, or added, representing customers that placed a new order and need to be visited. These change-related information are used to heuristically repair the solution of the previous environment, based on effective moves of the unstringing and stringing operator.

Several routing/provisioning schemes to dynamically provision both unicast and multicast connection requests are presented. In addition, a constraint-based grooming strategy is devised to utilize the overall network resources as efficiently as possible. Based on this strategy, several different sequential multicast grooming heuristics are first presented. Then, we devise a hybrid grooming approach and combine it with sequential approaches to achieve a grooming scheme that is biased toward serving multicast traffic demands in comparison with all other sequential grooming approaches. To achieve our objective, we decompose the problem into four subproblems: 1) routing problem; 2) light-tree-based logical-topology \u2026",

In this paper, we propose the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that solves the RWA problem with the objective to minimize the in-band and out-of-band crosstalk interactions. The proposed GA algorithm is compared to an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation with the same objective as well as to a traditional RWA that has as an objective the minimization of the number of wavelengths used. Thus, the proposed approach can be compared with both the lower and upper bounds of crosstalk interactions.

Two regeneration placement heuristics are proposed, namely the Q-based regenerator placement (QbRP) heuristic and the Q-based regenerator placement with path correlation (QbRPC) heuristic. Simulations are performed on a number of metropolitan area networks considering a static traffic model for both the proposed heuristics and for a known regeneration placement heuristic, namely the nodal degree first (NDF) algorithm. Results showed that both QbRP and QbRPC outperform NDF while QbRPC performs the best among the three. Furthermore \u2026",

The continuous growth of network traffic with tightening performance requirements combined with evolving physical-layer security threats poses multi-faceted challenges for network operators. To reduce network exposure to physical-layer attacks while satisfying the traffic growth and maintaining economic viability, awareness of attacks can be incorporated into fundamental optical network planning procedures. This can be done in several ways, attaining different trade-offs between the cost and the achievable level of physical-level security. This chapter focuses on security-aware carrier network planning. It first provides an overview of the most important optical technologies for carrier networks, followed by a discussion of soft and hard attack-aware network planning schemes \u2026",

Data gathered (and information generated) within and around vehicles will be used to improve road safety, travelling efficiency, and passenger comfort and convenience. However, delivering such data to the infrastructure (to process information and generate intelligence) is a challenging task, mainly due to the very large volume of data traffic produced. A promising approach to support these communication needs is to deliver data traffic opportunistically through the available WiFi APs. Evidently, the intermittent connectivity of these hotspots and the inherent mobility of the vehicles severely limit the volume of traffic sent at any one instance in time.

For the cost optimization problem, an optimal policy is found that dynamically decides, as the vehicle moves, at which charging station the vehicle should be charged, in order to minimize the service fuel cost. The problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and is solved by applying reinforcement learning (RL). The RL charging policy (RLCP), found after solving the POMDP, is compared to two benchmark policies and it is shown that RLCP outperforms both. Most importantly, RLCP can be automatically adjusted to significant variations on the vehicle's energy consumption behavior by continuously training the RLCP model according to the most recent information obtained from the vehicle's environment.",

In fact, WDM traffic is heterogeneous in nature and only part of the traffic is multicast and the rest is unicast, therefore we expect the presence of both unicast and multicast traffic in future optical networks. This paper studies the problem of dynamic provisioning of survivable heterogeneous unicast and multicast traffic in WDM networks. Specifically, we propose new protection schemes to provision and protect unicast and multicast connection requests against singlelink failures in WDM-mesh networks. The simulation results of the proposed protection schemes are compared with each others and with those found in the literature. The results showed that our proposed scheme TP-OSPT outperforms all other schemes for moderate and large multicast group size. On the other hand \u2026",

Thus, energy efficiency in optical networks is mandatory for the sustainability of the future Internet. The objectives of the current work are to identify the main causes of energy consumption for current fixed-grid wavelength division multiplexing and future flex-grid optical networks, and to propose and compare techniques for improving their energy efficiency.

The current round of carrier Ethernet standards will successfully equip service providers (SPs) with the required tools to provide carrier-grade scalability and to provision and engineer connection-oriented point-to-point (P2P) packet trunks across a native Ethernet infrastructure. Building on these standards, this paper demonstrates how to support and implement full traffic engineering in a global-scale, two-tiered native Ethernet-over-WDM optical networking architecture. To achieve these objectives, several networking innovations are presented and developed including: 1) a GMPLS-based unified control plane that offers a tighter integration between layer-1 (optical transport layer) and layer-2 (Ethernet layer), 2) a fully distributed integrated routing and signaling framework for dynamically \u2026",

It possess several attributes that distinguish it from the well-known local area network (LAN), quality of service (QoS) been an integral one. Among the QoS privileges provided by CENs is a reserved bandwidth. Because CENs are designed to cover large areas (tens of km) and transmit at high data rates (100 Gbps), these networks have a high bandwidth-delay product (BDP). It is known that connection-oriented transport protocols have difficulty sustaining high throughputs in high BDP networks. A new transport protocol is proposed to overcome the difficulties these networks incur while providing QoS guarantees at the transport-layer level.

The development of algorithms that work efficiently for this kind of networks is important, since in practice the network is modeled as a mixed graph. Simulations show that for the case of mixed-graph networks, the proposed multicast protection algorithm is able to calculate arc-disjoint tree pairs with lower blocking ratio and average cost compared to the existing algorithms, especially for multicast sessions with destination sets that comprise of up to half of the network nodes.",

It is, thus, imperative that developed project schedules should have not only well-thought project logic networks (successor/predecessor information and activity durations) but also resource assignments (including cost) for each activity in the network so that the effects of resource constraints can effectively be accounted for. The paper presents a new approach to resource-constrained scheduling that allows for activity prioritization when a project is subject to limited resources. The methodology proposed is based on a utility index, hereby defined as the ratio of the number of required resources for a specific activity to the total number of required resources among competing activities. A dynamic programming technique is adopted to maximize the utility value for each activity so that the resource allocation among competing activities, as suggested by the method, results in the minimum overall project duration.",

Shared mesh restoration is used to protect against failures and a re-optimization algorithm is implemented to regain portion of the protection capacity used.Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) networks that route optical connections using intelligent optical crossconnects (OXCs) are firmly established as the core constituent of next generation networks. With connection rates reaching tens of Gb/s, preventing and repairing failures is increasingly becoming an integral part of the network design process. In end-to-end dedicated (1+ 1) mesh protection (Figure 1), the ingress and egress OXCs of the failed connection attempt to restore the signal on a predefined backup path that is disjoint from the primary path. Path diversity guarantees that primary and backup paths will not simultaneously succumb to the same failure. Diversity of routes in an optical network is defined using the notion of Shared Risk Groups [1]. A set of optical channels that have the same risk of failure is called a Shared Risk Group (SRG). For example, all the channels that are multiplexed onto a WDM fiber-link is a shared risk group since the failure of the fiber-link simultaneously affects all the channels that are carried over that fiber. SRGs are configured by the network operator with the knowledge of the physical fiber plant of the optical network. Even though dedicated protection requires large amount of capacity, the backup path remains \u201clive\u201d in permanence, thus saving crucial path-setup latency when recovery takes place.

            "Abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to become a reality on roads in the near future bringing significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. Cooperation and coordination among CAVs will be enabled through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) wireless communications. Each vehicle knows its current location and in many cases will have to communicate this information to its associated Roadside Unit (RSU). With the proliferation of CAVs, the RSU is expected to receive and process a large amount of feedback information from its assigned CAVs. Thus, an event-triggered communication scheme is proposed instead of conventional approaches where communication takes place in a periodic manner. Further, the effect of age of information on the resulting accuracy of the vehicle tracking error is taken into account by considering the message queue wait time \u2026",

The adaptive technique is examined under a real public transport bus service scenario, where local and remote hosts use a set of mobility models to track travel times and update their arrival schedules according to detected deviations, i.e., event interrupts.",

Appropriate fault recovery techniques are thus crucial to meet the requirements set by the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between carriers and their customers.In this paper, we focus on practical issues related to the deployment of fault recovery mechanisms in commercial optical networks.

This is an extension of the well-known multiple traveling salesman problem. The proposed formulation can be applied in several domains such as the monitoring of traffic flows in a transportation network, or the monitoring of remote locations to assist search and rescue missions. Aiming to find the optimal schedule, the problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Given that the problem is highly combinatorial, the optimal solution scales only for small sized problems. Thus, a greedy algorithm is also proposed that uses a one-step look ahead heuristic search mechanism. In a detailed evaluation, it is observed that the greedy algorithm has near-optimal performance as it is on average at 92.06% of the optimal, while it can potentially scale up to settings \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The metro Ethernet network (MEN) expands the advantages of Ethernet to cover areas wider than LAN. Ethernet Services were created to provide multiple services to this carrier-grade network that is rapidly growing popularity in North America [21], Europe [22], and Asia [23]. Techniques to police the network layer for MENs are very mature; but the transport layer relies on different flavors of TCP that do not get the most of Ethernet services. We propose a transport layer protocol that can replace previous versions of TCP to better suit metro Ethernet service policies, such as those established for specified service level agreements (SLAs). Ethernet service's traffic and performance parameters include committed information rate (CIR), excess information rate (EIR), and guaranteed packet loss rate. The purpose of this transport protocol is to integrate these parameters, which are applied at the networking layer, into the \u2026",

The proposed scheme exhibits improved performance in terms of blocking probability compared to other traditional segment-based multicast protection schemes, especially when sharing techniques are also utilized. Furthermore, when physical layer impairments are also taken into account for the calculation of the working and protection light-trees, it is shown that the LP technique presents significant improvement in performance compared to the other commonly used protection techniques.",

            "Abstract": "Increased traffic volume due to the introduction of new broadband services is driving carriers to the deployment of an optical transport layer based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)[1]. The network infrastructure of existing core networks is currently undergoing a transformation from rings using SONET Add/Drop Multiplexers (ADMs) to mesh topologies using Optical Cross-connects (OXCs). A core optical network architecture can be opaque or transparent. An opaque architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic undergoes an Optical to Electronic to Optical (OEO) conversion at different places in the network. A transparent architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic stays in the optical domain from the time it is generated at the edge of the network until it leaves the network.Even though the applications driving the large scale deployment of transparent optical switches are not currently in place (niche applications in today\u2019s networks only use a very small number of transparent switches), and the traffic demand does not currently justify the use of transparent switches that are cost effective at very high bit rates, it is possible that at some point in the future transparent switches may be deployed in the network. Based on this assumption, this paper explores the technology issues and challenges that are associated with 3D MEMS-based switch fabrics. These fabrics offer the most viable approach to make single-stage switch fabrics with large port counts that can be used for the deployment of transparent switches in the network.",

Due to crosstalk-induced interactions among different connections, malicious high-power jamming signals can potentially spread widely in the network. Therefore, it is necessary to design an optical network in a way that the spread of an attack is minimized. This is achieved in this work by the design of appropriate power equalizer placement and attack-aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithms in the form of Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulations.

High-power jamming attacks are modeled based on their impact on the lightpaths\u2019 quality of transmission (QoT) through inter-core crosstalk. Based on a desired threshold on a lightpath\u2019s QoT, the modulation format used, the length of the path, as well as a set of physical layer characteristics, each lightpath can potentially tolerate a high-power jamming attack. In this paper, an integer linear program is thus formulated, as well as heuristic algorithms to solve the problem of attack-aware routing, spectrum, modulation format, and core allocation in SS-FONs, aiming to both efficiently provision the network in terms of network resources, as well as minimize the impact of high-power jamming attacks on the established lightpaths.

In particular, a Gaussian process classifier is trained on historical data extracted from the examined network, with the goal of modeling and predicting the failure probability of each link therein. To limit the set of suspect links for every failure incident, the proposed approach is complemented by the utilization of a graph-based correlation heuristic. The proposed approach is tested on a number of datasets generated for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based optical network, and demonstrates that the approach achieves a high localization accuracy (91%\u201399%) that is insignificantly affected as the size of the historical dataset is reduced.

The data-driven QoT technique analyzes data of previous connection requests and, through a training procedure that is performed on a neural network, returns a data-driven QoT model that near-accurately decides the QoT of the newly arriving requests. The advantages of the data-driven QoT approach over the existing Q-factor techniques are that it is self-adaptive, it is a function of data that are independent from the physical layer impairments (PLIs) eliminating the requirement of specific measurement equipment, and it does not assume the existence of a system with extensive processing and storage capabilities. Further, it is fast in processing new data and fast in finding a near-accurate QoT model provided that such a model exists \u2026",

In practice, these requests arrive in the network and stay for some time, holding resources of it. Therefore, some arcs may not have free wavelengths to be used, leading to a directed-graph network for the upcoming requests. A directed graph is defined as the one having both unidirectional and bidirectional connections between its nodes. However, all segment-based approaches outlined in the literature for provisioning survivable multicast requests, ignore the fact that the routing must be performed on a directed graph. This leads to excessive use of network resources and, consequently, to a high blocking ratio of the arriving requests as well as high average cost of the established ones.

Moreover, each of the links is composed of multiple wavelengths to propagate optical signals or optical packets, and each of the replicated versions of the data payload may be propagated over a selected one of the wavelengths in each corresponding one of the plurality of links.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) algorithms together with network coding (NC) are proposed for elastic optical networks. NC has been used in optical networks for protection against link failures and also in multicasting to improve spectral efficiency. In this work, NC is used to protect confidential connections against eavesdropping attacks. The confidential signals are XOR-ed with other signals at different nodes in their path while transmitted through the network. These signals can be combined either at the source node and/or at intermediate nodes. To implement NC for confidential connections, a set of constraints for the NC problem in addition to the constraints of the RSA problem are incorporated to the algorithms. The combination of signals through network coding significantly increases the security of confidential connections, since an eavesdropper will receive a combination of signals from different connections, making it extremely difficult for the confidential signal to be decrypted. A number of RSA strategies are examined in terms of confidentiality, spectrum utilization, and blocking probability. Performance results demonstrate that network coding provides an additional layer of security for confidential connections with only a small increase in the spectrum usage.",

These architectures have several attractive properties that make them desirable for a large number of applications. Even though arbitrary mesh network architectures provide additional degrees of freedom and are more flexible than rings, in a number of applications there are advantages to decomposing the mesh topologies into a set of rings that cover the network. One of the primary uses of ring covers is to provide survivability against link and node failures. This paper investigates novel approaches for establishing ring covers in optical networks with mesh topologies, while minimizing the length of the ring covers.",

Due to global warming, pollution and climate changes, logistic companies such as FedEx, UPS, DHL and TNT have became more sensitive to the environment and they are investing in ways to reduce the CO2 emissions that result as part of their daily operations. There is no doubt that using Electric Vehicles (EVs) instead of conventional vehicles will significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions [1], a fact that increases the interest of logistic companies in utilizing EVs for their daily operation. In these circumstances, the problem of routing a fleet of EVs has emerged, namely the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP)[2]. In this report, a benchmark set of EVRP instances is provided with known and unknown optimum values. The rest of this report is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the EVRP problem in which a detailed mathematical formulation of the problem is presented. Section 3 gives details of the EVRP benchmark set. Section 4 demonstrates the criteria of evaluating an algorithm on the benchmark set. Finally Section 5 concludes this report.",

The protection fibers (119, 121) in the links are pre-arranged into protection cycles so that if a link failure occurs, protection switches in the network nodes (101, 107) connected in the failed link will switch the working fiber data path onto an alternate path comprised of protection fibers (119, 121). Data can then be transmitted through the protection cycle around the fault to reach the node on the other side of the failed link. The same protection fibers (119, 121) can be used to protect a priority connection against center switch failure in a network. The protection switches in each node (101, 107) which connect working fibers (115, 117) to protection fibers (119, 121) are very fast and their settings do not depend on the state of the network.",

Since the signals in transparent WDM networks are transmitted all-optical, these networks are vulnerable against high-power jamming attacks. Due to crosstalk induced interactions among different connections, malicious high-power signals are spread in the network. To this end, it is necessary to plan an optical network in a way that the spread of an attack is minimized. In this work an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is proposed that addresses the problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) with the objective to minimize the propagation of the introduced high-power malicious signals. The physical layer attack propagation is modeled as interactions among connections through in-band channel crosstalk. Additionally \u2026",

In this ring-based architecture, each optical network unit can independently detect, manage, and recover most of the networking failure scenarios.

An effective scheme for the calculation of a pair of disjoint trees, namely the New Arc-Disjoint Trees (NADT) protection scheme, is presented. The key idea of this technique is to gradually construct the primary tree, verifying that after the addition of each one of the destinations of the multicast session, a secondary (arc-disjoint) tree can still be obtained. The proposed protection technique is combined with two existing heuristics for multicast routing in mixed-graph sparse-splitting networks. Performance results demonstrate that the proposed NADT protection technique clearly outperforms the conventional approach in terms of blocking ratio, and presents a negligible increase of the average cost of the derived pair of arc-disjoint trees.",

The remaining, multicast-incapable (MI) nodes, can have either Drop-or-Continue (DoC) or Drop-and-Continue (DaC) capabilities. For the case of DaCs, if a MI node is a destination of the multicast group, it can drop a fraction of the incoming signal locally and transmit the rest to the next node. The current paper presents an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation as well as novel heuristic multicast routing algorithms under the sparse-splitting constraint, for networks with or without DaC nodes. Performance results show that the proposed algorithms achieve an important decrease of the average cost of the derived solutions, compared to existing relevant techniques, and attain results very \u2026",

Initially, a crosstalk- aware approach is presented that accounts for the crosstalk effects in the network that can have detrimental impact on the connections established in the network. This approach is subsequently enhanced with a feedback-based procedure that takes into account all physical layer impairments, aiming to minimize the number of connections that cannot be established in the network due to quality-of-transmission (QoT) considerations.",

It possess several attributes that distinguish it from Metro Ethernet Networks (MENs), quality of service (QoS) being an integral one. Because CENs are designed to cover large areas (thousands of km) and transmit at high data rates (100 Gbps), these networks have a high bandwidth-delay product (BDP). Long distance transmissions that require data integrity suffer a transport-layer throughput bottleneck effect. Under these conditions, systems (including testbeds) exhibit a detrimental performance evaluation reduction as the round-trip time (RTT) increases. A new transport protocol is proposed to overcome the difficulties these networks incur, while providing QoS guarantees at the transport-layer level, hence maintaining the committed throughput levels established in the service level agreement (SLA).

The generation of a feasible and efficient schedule is a difficult task due to the physical and power constraints of the charging station, i.e., the maximum contracted power and the maximum power imbalance between the lines of the electric feeder. The ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic is applied to coordinate the charging process of the EVs within the charging station by generating efficient schedules. The behaviour and performance of ACO is analyzed and compared against state-of-the-art approaches on a benchmark set inspired by real-world scenarios. The experimental results show that the application of ACO is highly effective and outperforms other approaches.",

            "Abstract": "Due to crosstalk-induced interactions among different connections, malicious high-power jamming signals can potentially spread widely in a transparent optical network. Moreover, due to imperfect port isolation in wavelength selective switches (WSSs), present within the optical switching nodes, crosstalk also affects the quality of the transmitted signal. Therefore, it is necessary to design an optical network in a way that the effect of crosstalk is minimized, while at the same time keeping the cost and the power consumption of the network low. This is achieved, in this work, by the design of appropriate WSS placement and crosstalk-aware routing and spectrum assignment algorithms in flexible grid optical networks, in the form of an integer linear program formulation and a heuristic algorithm analogous to vertex coloring. The objective of the optimization algorithms is to minimize the impact of the crosstalk effect, thus \u2026",

In this architecture, better decisions can be made for provisioning and managing network resources, leading to their more efficient use.

This work focuses on the latter and presents the CARAMEL architecture aiming at assessing the integrity of the information transmitted by vehicles, as well as at improving the security and privacy of communication for connected and autonomous driving. The proposed architecture includes: (1) multi-radio access technology capabilities, with simultaneous 802.11p and LTE-Uu support, enabled by the connectivity infrastructure; (2) a MEC platform, where, among others, algorithms for detecting attacks are implemented; (3) an intelligent On-Board Unit with anti-hacking features inside the vehicle; (4) a Public Key Infrastructure that validates in real-time the integrity of vehicle\u2019s data transmissions. As an indicative application, the interaction between the entities of the CARAMEL architecture is showcased in case of a GPS spoofing attack scenario. Adopted attack detection techniques exploit robust in-vehicle and cooperative approaches that do not rely on encrypted GPS signals, but only on measurements available in the CARAMEL architecture.",

In this paper, ACO is applied to the electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP). New challenges arise with the consideration of electric vehicles instead of conventional vehicles because their energy level is affected by several uncertain factors. Therefore, a feasible route of an electric vehicle (EV) has to consider visit(s) to recharging station(s) during its daily operation (if needed). A look ahead strategy is incorporated into the proposed ACO for EVRP (ACO-EVRP) that estimates whether at any time EVs have within their range a recharging station. From the simulation results on several benchmark problems it is shown that the proposed ACO-EVRP approach is able to output feasible routes, in terms of energy, for a fleet of EVs.",

Specifically, this work proposes and devises a simple self-healing Ethernet PON architecture that supports a truly shared LAN capability among end users. The main characteristic of the proposed architecture is that it supports a fully distributed control plane among the optical network units (ONUs) for ONU-to-ONU communication. The control plane supports fully distributed fault detection and recovery mechanisms as well as a decentralized dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme in which the optical line terminator is excluded from both the bandwidth \u2026",

The considered physical layer attacks addressed in this chapter are high\u2010power jamming attacks. These attacks are modeled as interactions among lightpaths as a result of intra\u2010channel and/or inter\u2010channel crosstalk. The proposed Aa\u2010RWA algorithm first solves the problem for given traffic demands, and subsequently, the algorithm is enhanced in order to deal with demands under uncertainties. The demand uncertainty is considered in order to provide a solution for several periods, where the knowledge of demands for future periods can only be estimated. The objective of the Aa\u2010RWA algorithm is to minimize the impact of possible physical layer attacks and at the same time minimize the investment cost (in terms of switching equipment deployed) during the network planning phase.",

In this paper, a novel resilient transport control scheme is proposed for Ethernet services that utilize a less aggressive congestion window reduction algorithm when a non-congested environment is detected. A stochastic model for packet loss is proposed, in which packet losses are expressed as a random function of congestion and random loss present in the network Transport layer congestion control is stated as a hypothesis test process; making decisions based on multiple ACK feedbacks.

However, drones potentially pose great threats to security and public safety, especially when their malicious use involves critical infrastructures and public spaces. This work proposes a multiagent counter-drone system where a team of pursuer drones cooperate in order to track and jam multiple rogue drones. Specifically, a cooperative multi-agent approach is proposed in which the best joint mobility and power control actions of each agent are chosen so that the rogue drones are optimally tracked and jammed over time. Two variants of the joint optimization problem are developed and extensive simulations are conducted so as to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.",

Assuming linear-Gaussian systems, the presented approach, i.e., AVOID-OM, tackles the problem in two phases. First it decides the best arrival moment in time for a vehicle to enter the area surrounding the intersection, i.e., the danger zone. Then, it selects a set of controls for the vehicle that allows the safe traversal of the intersection, even in presence of vehicle location uncertainty. The overall objective is the maximization of the capacity of the intersection and the presented approach improves previous state-of-the-art solutions both in terms of average number of admitted vehicles and of the vehicles' average speed, while also ensuring smoothness in the vehicles' acceleration profiles.",

The PBA model is compared to a number of benchmark BA models that naturally arise after the assumption of traffic demand uncertainty. For comparing all the BA models developed, a conventional routing and spectrum allocation heuristic is used adhering each time to the BA model followed.

This chapter provides an overview of current protocols utilized for the control plane in optical networks and then delves into a new unified control plane architecture for IP-over-WDM networks that manages both routers and optical switches. Provisioning, routing, and signaling protocols for this control model are also presented, together with its benefits, including the support of interdomain routing/signaling and the support of restoration at any granularity. Introduction In the last two decades optical communications have evolved from not only providing transmission capacities to higher transport levels, such as inter-router connectivity in an IP-centric infrastructure, to providing the intelligence required for efficient point-and-click provisioning services, as well as resilience against potential fiber or node failures. This is possible due to the emergence of optical network elements that carry the intelligence required to efficiently manage such networks. Current deployments of wavelength division multiplexed (WDM)-based optical transport networks have met the challenge of accommodating the phenomenal growth of IP data traffic while providing novel services such as rapid provisioning and restoration of very high bandwidth circuits, and bandwidth on demand.",

EVRP is more challenging than the conventional vehicle routing problem, as with the consideration of electric vehicles additional hard constraints arise within the EVRP due to their limited driving range (e.g., the consideration whether electric vehicles need to visit a charging station during their daily operation). The proposed parallel ACO algorithm with several colonies also uses a migration policy to allow communication between the different colonies \u2026",

The entropy, as a measure of the degree of disorder in a system, is an indicator of a project's tendency to progress out of order and into a chaotic condition and it can thus serve to forecast a project's development. The entropy metric used in the analysis is based on the resource assignments per activity (required vs. assigned resource units).",

To understand the operation characteristics of CIs, as well as the behavior of interdependencies between different CIs, we usually use modeling and simulation methodologies. In this work we propose an interdependent CI modeling methodology based on hybrid systems. We adopt open hybrid automata to model the constituent components of different critical infrastructures, including any dependencies that may exist between them. Then, using open hybrid automata composition properties, we can compose different CI component models together, creating a single hybrid automaton model that represents interdependent CIs. Finally, simulating the composition model we can generate sample paths that show how component faults can cascade and/or escalate \u2026",

Most of this work has been based on the tweaking of the additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) parameters. The Ethernet Services transport protocol (ESTP) takes a different approach by making the AIMD parameters vary dynamically based on the traffic policing parameters and congestion feedback that is available at the transport layer.

To introduce physical (optical) layer security and protect these networks against eavesdropping attacks, spread spectrum (SS) with signal overlapping techniques are used to encode each requested confidential connection. In order to attain access to the signal and compromise a confidential connection, an eavesdropper will now have to lock on the correct frequency, determine the correct code and symbol sequence amongst co-propagated overlapped signals, and decode the signal. Different routing strategies and a novel spectrum allocation technique are proposed in an attempt to add an extra layer of security for confidential connections, while also considering spectrum utilization.

Specifically, it examines the fair EV charging scheduling problem, where fairness refers to the achievable charging levels of EVs contending for energy utilities within a planning horizon. For finding fair utility allocations the a-fairness approach is used, inspired by welfare economics, that is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP) and as an ant colony optimization (ACO), considering both the system's and EV owners' constraints and requirements. It is shown that with this approach the operator is able to control the fairness-efficiency trade-off (with system efficiency affecting the operator's revenue) by appropriately selecting the inequality aversion parameter a to best meet targeted performance metrics.

Under this regime, the present work details an event-triggering technique (ETT) for efficient and effective tracking of road vehicles in the realm of intelligent transportation systems. The technique assumes that both the local and remote host follow a predetermined mobility model to approximate the actual vehicle location. Upon detection of deviation from this model, the local host triggers an update event to resynchronize the remote host.

            "Abstract": "This paper deals with the subject of shortest (in terms of traveling time) path routing in transportation networks, where the speed in the network\u2019s roads is a function of the time interval. These networks are encountered in practice when the roads\u2019 speed has been measured for several time instants during a large period of time (eg, an entire year). In this way, time-dependent speed patterns can be derived for the network\u2019s roads, that constitute an estimation of the network\u2019s future behavior. For shortest path routing in these networks, the traveling time on the network\u2019s roads must be calculated according to the time instant of departure. Conventional approaches perform this calculation under the assumption that the road\u2019s speed has a constant (possibly distinct) value inside each time interval. In the work presented here, the assumption that the road\u2019s speed is linear (possibly distinct) function of time inside each time interval, is considered. Under this assumption, a procedure is proposed that derives the traveling time on the network\u2019s roads according to the time instant of departure. It is combined with Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm, resulting in a practically applicable algorithm for optimal shortest path routing for the type of networks investigated in this work.",

The combination of signals through NC significantly increases the security of confidential connections, since an eavesdropper must access all individual signals, traversing different links, in order to decrypt the combined signal. A novel heuristic approach is proposed that solves the combined network coding and routing and spectrum allocation problem that also takes into account additional NC constraints that are required in order to consider a confidential connection as secure \u2026",

The aim is to localize single-link failures by utilizing statistical machine learning techniques trained on data that describe the network state upon current and past failure incidents. In particular, a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier is trained on historical data extracted from the examined network, with the goal of modeling and predicting the failure probability of each link therein. To limit the set of suspect links for every failure incident, the proposed approach is complemented with the utilization of a Graph-Based Correlation heuristic. The proposed approach is tested on a dataset generated for an OFDM-based optical network, demonstrating that it achieves a high localization accuracy. The proposed scheme can be used by service providers for reducing the Mean-Time-To-Repair of the failure.",

Currently, optical networks utilize dense wavelength division multiplexed transmission systems, together with intelligent optical networking equipment to accommodate this demand. Optical networks must be able to provide robust and reliable end-to-end service to customers, with differentiated service level agreements. In order to guarantee these prescribed service levels, these networks need to employ a fast, efficient and reliable fault restoration approach. This is an important aspect of the network operation, as in these networks failures can occur frequently, either due to accidents, equipment malfunction, human error or even malicious attacks.

In particular, an algorithm for solving the Energy-Aware RWA (EA-RWA) problem in MLR translucent networks based on an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is proposed. Our study shows that energy savings can be obtained by minimizing the power consumed at the optical layer, through the reduction of the number of power-consuming components in conjunction with the data rate and modulation format adaptation.",

Nevertheless, full autonomy still requires further development that will only be achieved through a high level of cooperation and coordination among vehicles. For the safe execution of several autonomous functions, vehicles will need to frequently communicate their current location to the Road Side Units (RSUs). However, due to information aging, it is expected that the delays from the time a message is generated until the location of the vehicle is updated will induce a tracking error. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the frequency of location updates and tracking error. Further, in order to reduce the queue-induced delays present in the system, the number of messages can be reduced by employing an event-triggered communication scheme.

The main objective of the heuristic algorithms is to improve the time delay of the high priority packet delivery from the infrastructure to the end-users (mobile or fixed users). This is achieved through dynamic packet reordering and scheduling in different priority queues and wavelengths in a ring-based WDM-PON architecture that is utilized to backhaul mobile traffic. The heuristic algorithms implementing dynamic scheduling are compared in terms of the high priority packet delay for varying traffic loads.",

With the proposed approach, we show that less information, independent of the amount of traffic demand, is sufficient to determine the shareability of protection channels with remarkable accuracy. Experiments also demonstrate that our approach yields faster computation times with no significant penalty in terms of capacity usage.",

            "Abstract": "Highly populated cities face several challenges, one of them being the intense traffic congestion. In recent years, the concept of Urban Air Mobility has been put forward by large companies and organizations as a way to address this problem, and this approach has been rapidly gaining ground. This disruptive technology involves aerial vehicles (AVs) for hire than can be utilized by customers to travel between locations within large cities. This concept has the potential to drastically decrease traffic congestion and reduce air pollution, since these vehicles typically use electric motors powered by batteries. This work studies the problem of scheduling the assignment of AVs to customers, having as a goal to maximize the serviced customers and minimize the energy consumption of the AVs by forcing them to fly at the lowest possible altitude. Initially, an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is presented, that is solved offline and optimally, followed by a near-optimal algorithm, that solves the problem incrementally, one AV at a time, to address scalability issues, allowing scheduling in problems involving large numbers of locations, AVs, and customer requests.",

A jamming attack is defined as a harmful signal interference with other signals, leading to service degradation, that is possible through intra-channel or inter-channel crosstalk effects. An Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is proposed to solve the problem of attack-aware routing and wavelength assignment (Aa-RWA), jointly with the placement of OPM equipment, in order to minimize the impact of physical layer jamming attacks in optical networks.

However, the limited driving range of EVs may require visits to recharging stations during their operation. These potential visits have to be addressed, avoiding unnecessary long detours. We formulate the electric capacitated vehicle routing problem (E-CVRP), which incorporates the possibility of EVs visiting a recharging station while satisfying the delivery demands of customers. The energy consumption of the EVs is proportional to their cargo load which is an important constraint in real-world logistics applications. A new set of benchmark instances is proposed for the E-CVRP. As solution methods to these new benchmarks, we apply the ant colony optimization metaheuristic method and an exact method.

In this work, the MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS), one of the best ACO variations, is integrated with advanced and effective local search operators, i.e., the Lin-Kernighan and the Unstringing and Stringing heuristics, resulting in powerful memetic algorithms. The best solution constructed by ACO is passed to the operator for local search improvements. The proposed memetic algorithms aim to combine the adaptation capabilities of ACO for DOPs and the superior performance of the local search operators. The travelling salesperson problem is used as the base problem to generate both \u2026",

HGs are constructed dynamically upon the arrival of each multicast call, in such a way that they are consisting of both the available physical links and the logical links with available free capacity. Two schemes for building the HGs are proposed, namely the minimum free capacity light-tree first (MCF) and the maximum free capacity light-tree first (MXCF), and also a novel hybrid Steiner tree (HST) heuristic for routing/grooming on HGs is presented. The proposed routing/grooming approach exhibits improved performance in terms of blocking probability compared to existing multicast grooming approaches that route/groom multicast calls by considering physical and logical links separately.",

In these architectures a single OXC is capable of switching tens of terabits of traffic per second. With such data transfer rates at stake, it becomes increasingly challenging for carriers to (1) efficiently and cost-effectively operate and manage their infrastructure, and (2) cope with network failures while guaranteeing prescribed service level agreements (SLAs) to their customers. Proper routing of primary and backup paths is a critical component of the routing and restoration architecture required to meeting these challenges.

One approach is to provision the requests that have acceptable quality-of-transmission (QoT) assuming a fully-loaded network for specific modulation formats, so that in the future these connections will remain feasible when subsequently new connections are established. This approach restricts the candidate path space to ensure that an established connection has acceptable QoT irrespective of the network state. The second approach is to take into account the current state of the network during the provisioning of each connection request. In the latter approach, the algorithm has to \u2026",

Furthermore, the case where the road's speed is a linear function of time inside each time interval (in general, different linear function for each time interval) is investigated. A procedure that derives the road's traversal time according to the time instant of departure is proposed for this case as well. The proposed procedures are combined with Dijkstra's algorithm and the resulting algorithms, that are practically applicable and of low complexity, provide optimal shortest path routing in the networks under investigation.",
