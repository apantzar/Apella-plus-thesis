The device exploits EBG properties to form the desired stopband, whereas tunability is used by means of switching elements. Numerical analysis is performed by a finite element scheme revealing the DC\u2010extending bandstop behavior of the structure. In addition, a prototype of the proposed filter is constructed and measured. Experimental data demonstrate the robustness of the conducted simulations, while an adequate tuning range is observed.

This metamaterial-inspired structure replaces the vias of a classical SIW by providing a negative dielectric effective material parameter behavior which results to the block of the wave propagation to the direction perpendicular to the axis of propagation. Using this structure as a waveguide, slot antennas are consequently designed, by the proper opening of slots on the substrate and the utilization of matching circuits.",

The reduction of degrees of freedom, achieved by the employment of such elements, facilitates the solution of the resulting eigenvalue equation. Thus, an efficient 3-D finite-element analysis tool is developed to calculate the band structure of both symmetric and asymmetric photonic crystal slabs. Dispersion relation results for two different types of photonic crystal waveguides are also presented, to further verify the method.",

The featured technique combines a finite-volume time-domain and a pseudo-spectral time-domain approach which divide the domain into manageable regions.

We focus on the integrated stripline circuits since they are less susceptible to radiation and dispersion effects compared to microstrips. A quasi-static approximation was adopted and a comprehensive field characterization is achieved by discretizing the time and space into cells and thereafter applying the Maxwell's equations and boundary conditions. Finally, the frequency dependent circuit parameters, namely the per-unit length (p.u.l) resistance and conductance, were estimated using the fundamental laws of electromagnetism.",

In each iteration, the algorithm finds the direction of the peak of the greatest sidelobe, which is considered as direction of arrival (DoA) of a hypothetical interference signal, and the conventional beamformer is then employed to find proper antenna array weights that produce an extra null toward this direction.

            "Abstract": "The design and optimization of wideband log-periodic dipole arrays (LPDAs) are presented in this chapter. The LPDAs are expected to simultaneously satisfy several requirements inside a wide operating frequency range. In particular, the optimized LPDA has to provide standing wave ratio (SWR) below a predefined value, gain values as high as possible, gain flatness (GF) below a desired value, both side lobe level (SLL) and front-to-back ratio (FBR) below a desired value, and all these requirements must be satisfied at the same time inside the entire frequency range of operation. Since the design problem is nonlinear and inherently multiobjective, the simultaneous realization of all the above requirements can only be achieved by applying global optimization algorithms. These algorithms are usually based on evolutionary optimization methods and have been proved to be capable of solving complex nonlinear problems with great success. Such an evolutionary method with high potential in antenna design is presented in this chapter. The method is called invasive weed optimization (IWO) and is applied in conjunction with the method of moments (MoM) to optimize LPDAs under the above-mentioned requirements. The MoM is a well-known full-wave analysis method and is utilized here to extract the radiation characteristics of the LPDA required by the IWO algorithm. Several design cases are studied concerning the LPDA geometry and the operating bandwidth. The derived LPDA geometries exhibit a behavior close to the desired one and therefore are able to enhance the performance of a wireless network in practical applications.",

The whole set of properties is enforced to the shape functions, in order to produce their explicit expressions. Second and third order vector finite elements are produced and implemented in threedimensional electromagnetic prapagation, radiation and scattering problems, thus providing a promising tool for electromagnetic analysis.",

In particular, we consider the highly interesting case of theso-called interface modeling, i.e. when aplane wave propagates to the interior ofa building. The methodology presented herein, is based on a parabolic wave equation in three dimensions, while the cross section of the computational domain, as the wave propagates,is modeled by means of a finite element technique, terminated by highly absorbing PML boundaries. This formulation enables a robust computational modeling of obstacles of complex shape in a fully automated way. On the other hand, the formulation does not make any \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for modeling wave propagation in dispersive Cole-Cole media is proposed. The main difficulty in time-domain modeling of a Cole-Cole medium is that the polarization relation that describes its electromagnetic behavior is a differential equation of fractional order. By definition, the fractional derivative of a function is a nonlocal operator and its computation at a time instant involves all previous function values. Thus, the memory demands of a typical FDTD scheme for Cole-Cole media would be high. However, by an appropriate approximation of the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov definition of the fractional derivative, we can implement an FDTD scheme with reasonable memory demands. This is achieved by means of sums of decaying exponentials used to approximate the coefficients that appear in the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov definition. As a result, the FDTD scheme requires the \u2026",

The robot is able to perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), thanks to its optical sensors. As the robot moves inside the target area, it continuously interrogates all RFID tags within range. Passive RFID tags, placed at known locations, are used for the estimation of the locations of the target tags, by properly manipulating the measured backscattered power. The proposed method does not depend on the location of the reader, but only on the locations of the reference tags. Hence, positioning-errors related to SLAM are not accumulated. Mobility of the robot ensures rich collection of measurements. We propose a method for dynamic, real-time configuration of the parameters of the fingerprinting algorithm and real-time evaluation of the localization error of the unknown tags. This is \u2026",

The time-domain method is based on the different nature of the problem in conductors and semiconductors, compared to the insulating media that separate them. Therefore, the static problem in the silicon oxide is separated from the diffusion problem in conductors. The latter one is solved by an efficient DuFort-Frankel technique, while the static problem is solved in a coarse finite element method (FEM) mesh. In each step, the two problems are appropriately coupled by means of the interface conditions. The time-domain nature of this method permits the use of proper fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based postprocessing procedures to calculate the per unit length parameters in a fast and efficient manner",

The proposed method is versatile and offers an initial, valuable estimation of the structure's frequency response, which may be used as a guideline for the final MTS fine tuning. As proof of concept, split-ring resonator (SRR) MTSs coupled to microstrip lines are analyzed, and their response is compared with the full-wave finite-element method (FEM) results.",

Therefore, the static problem in the silicon oxide is separated from the diffusion problem in conductors. The latter one is solved by an efficient DuFort-Frankel technique, while the static problem is solved in a coarse finite element method (FEM) mesh. In each step, the two problems are appropriately coupled by means of the interface conditions.

By properly adjusting these two parameters, the exponential LPDA (ELPDA) geometry obtains wideband behavior with excellent radiation characteristics. A near optimal ELPDA geometry that achieves the desired radiation characteristics inside the required bandwidth is found in the present work by applying a recently developed method called invasive weed optimization (IWO).

The metasurface is fabricated by embedding a square periodic array of high\u2010permittivity ceramic cuboid resonators in a 3D\u2010printed substrate of polylactic acid. It is demonstrated that by properly selecting the resonator geometry and by tuning the angle of incidence through mechanical rotation, the metasurface can switch between a polarization beam splitting and bandpass or bandstop operation. Such performance is achieved by exploiting the highly asymmetric Fano spectral profile of the toroidal resonance and the very low (high) dispersion of the associated p\u2010(s\u2010) polarized mode resulting from the resonant toroidal dipole mode's field profile, as evidenced by both full\u2010wave and band structure \u2026",

The strong interaction between two side-by-side placed CSRRs provides the necessary means to block propagation through the ring structure and completely replace the series of via posts that is characteristic of a conventional SIW. The proposed transmission line has excellent propagation characteristics, since propagation losses are kept at levels comparable to those of the classic SIW, while the fully planar structure and the associated ease of implementation render the proposed SIW a strong alternative for a cost-effective implementation of millimeter-wave circuits and antennas.",

            "Abstract": "An aperiodic reconfigurable microstrip antenna array is designed to serve as a DVB-T base station antenna operating in a single broadcasting channel. The antenna array is optimized at 698 MHz (center frequency of DVB-T channel 49) to concurrently achieve a particular radiation pattern shaping with high forward gain, main lobe tilting and null filling inside the service area, as well as low sidelobe level outside the service area, and low standing wave ratio at the inputs of all the array elements. To concurrently satisfy all the above requirements, both the geometry dimensions and the array feeding weights (amplitudes and phases) are optimized, thus leading to a complex multi-variable and multi-objective problem. The problem is solved by applying a recently developed particle swarm optimization (PSO) improved variant, called PSO with velocity mutation, in conjunction with the CST software package, which is employed by the PSOvm every time a full-wave analysis is required. Furthermore, all the optimization methods found in the CST environment are compared with the PSOvm. The results show that the PSOvm is capable of producing an antenna array geometry, which is closer to the predefined requirements than the geometries derived by the rest of the optimizers, in the least amount of computational time.

In the second phase, the MFN is considered to terminate at lumped loads with values equal to the input impedances of the respective elements of the optimized MAA and is then optimized to achieve low standing wave ratio, high power efficiency, and output currents equal to those applied in the first phase by the current sources.

This allows for the formation of an optimization problem, which can be solved rapidly by standard methods.

Improved accuracy and lower dispersion errors are attained via higher-order FDTD schemes with regular and non-Cartesian lattices constructed by hexagonal or tetradecahedral cells.

Therefore, the purely static problem in the regions filled with silicon oxide is totally separated from the diffusion problem in the conducting regions. The latter one is solved by means of a simple and efficient DuFort-Frankel technique using finite differences, while the static problem is dealt with by means of a finite element method with coarse meshing, since outside the conductors the field variations are much less intense.

The resulting model is in terms of a concatenation of a number of non-uniform segments of lumped passive circuit representations of the per-unit-length series impedance and shunt admittance matrices, the lengths of which are obtained as a result of a Pade-Chebyshev approximation of the frequency-dependent input impedance matrix of the multiconductor transmission line system.

This formulation enables a robust computational modeling of obstacles of complex shape in a fully automated way.

Hence, an optimal, with respect to convergence element can be derived, if the transformation is defined such that the eigenvalues of the element matrix are as clustered as possible. We provide a general explicit formula for the 3-D transformation of degrees of freedom (DoF) and basis functions (BF) and investigate its effects on the convergence rate.

            "Abstract": "The drivetrain characteristics of electrically assisted, tricycle human powered vehicles are the subject of this paper. The two configurations of the vehicle that appear commercially, delta and tad-pole, are studied regarding to the impact of the electrical drivetrain to their steering behavior. For this purpose, two corresponding tricycles, constructed at the premises of the Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki are utilized. The electronic differential system implemented in the delta human powered vehicle is theoretically analyzed and experimentally tested. Measurements on the system during specific vehicle routes and discussion on its connection to the vehicle's steering behavior validate the system's efficiency.",

            "Abstract": "The use of conventional nodal finite elements in the analysis of vector three-dimensional electromagnetic field problems has a series of major difficulties and drawbacks. When vector electromagnetic fields with tangential continuity on interface boundaries, such as the electric or magnetic field intensity are interpolated by nodal field values, the resulting expression is continuous over the entire domain of computation. Hence, normal continuity is also imposed and large errors are produced in the vicinity of a material discontinuity. Another serious difficulty is related to the imposition of boundary conditions on edges and corners of the boundary surfaces. This is because normal vectors are not well defined on geometric singularities and as a result, boundary conditions are not well approximated. However, there is a much more severe consequence when nodal elements are used to discretize vector fields, the \u2026",
