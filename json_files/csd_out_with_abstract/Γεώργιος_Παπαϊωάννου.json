We approach reassembly from a geometric matching perspective and propose a pipeline for the automatic solution of the problem, where an efficient and generic three-level coarse-to-fine search strategy is used for the underlying global optimization. Key to the efficiency of our approach is the use of a discretized approximation of the surfaces\u2019 distance field, which significantly reduces the cost of distance queries and allows our method to systematically search the global parameter space with minimal cost. The resulting reassembly pipeline provides highly reliable alignment, as demonstrated through the reassembly of fractured objects from their fragments and the reconstruction of 3D objects from partial scans, showcasing the wide applicability of our methodology.",

For this task, the method introduces multiple generic illumination constraints and physically\u2010based light transport estimators, operating alongside typical geometric design guidelines, in a unified manner.

While the hardware-accelerated A-buffer is the dominant structure for holding multiple fragments via per-pixel linked lists, several variants have been proposed to alleviate the cost of excessive allocation and random access of video-memory. k-buffer is a widely-accepted A-buffer approximation, able to capture the k-closest to the viewer fragments, due to its reduced memory and computation requirements. To alleviate contention of distant fragments when rendering highly-complex scenes, k+-buffer [Vasilakis and Fudos 2014] concurrently performs culling checks to efficiently discard fragments that are farther from all currently maintained fragments. Unfortunately, the fragment elimination process is performed inside the pixel shader execution, thus not exploiting the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, real-time video communication over the internet through video conferencing applications has become an invaluable tool in everyone's professional and personal life. This trend underlines the need for video coding algorithms that provide acceptable quality on low bitrates and can support various resolutions inside the same stream in order to cope with limitations on computational resources and network bandwidth. In this work, a novel scalable video coding algorithm based on the contourlet transform is presented. The algorithm utilizes both lossy and lossless methods in order to achieve compression. One of its most notable features is that due to the transform utilised, it does not suffer from blocking artifacts that occur with many widely adopted compression algorithms. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the vast computational capabilities of modern GPUs, in order to achieve real-time performance and provide satisfactory encoding and decoding times at relatively low cost, making it suitable for applications like video conferencing. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs satisfactorily in terms of compression ratio and speed, while it outperforms standard methods in terms of perceptual quality on lower bitrates.",

Although various alternatives have been introduced to partially or completely alleviate the noticeable quality artifacts produced by the initial k-buffer algorithm in the expense of memory increase or performance downgrade, appropriate tools to automatically and dynamically compute the most suitable value of k are still missing.

While any GPU ray tracing architecture can be used for photon mapping, performing ray traversal in image space minimises acceleration data structure construction time and supports arbitrarily complex and fully dynamic geometry. Furthermore, this strategy maximises data structure reuse by encompassing rasterisation, ray tracing and photon gathering tasks in a single data structure.

In every frame, our algorithm operates in two stages: A compact representation of the scene geometry is built based on primitive linked-lists, followed by a traversal step that decouples the ray-primitive intersection tests from the illumination calculations; a process inspired by deferred rendering and the path integral formulation of light transport. Efficient empty space skipping is achieved by exploiting several culling optimizations both in xy-and z-space, such as pixel frustum clipping, depth subdivision and lossless buffer down-scaling.

Our compression scheme allows a full-color image to be directly rasterized using only two color channels at each pixel, instead of three, thus reducing both the consumed storage space and bandwidth during the rendering process. Exploiting the fact that the human visual system is more sensitive to fine spatial variations of luminance than of chrominance, the rasterizer generates fragments in the YCoCg color space and directly stores the chrominance channels at a lower resolution using a mosaic pattern. When reading from the buffer, a simple and efficient edge-directed reconstruction filter provides a very precise estimation of the original uncompressed values. We demonstrate that the quality loss from our method is negligible, while the bandwidth reduction results in a sizable increase in the fill rate of the GPU rasterizer.",

It follows that the dual stage version performance will always be slower than the optimized one.

The method pre-computes, for each object in the scene, the visibility and normal information, as seen from the environment, onto the bounding sphere surrounding the object and encodes it into maps. The visibility function is encoded by a four-dimensional visibility field that describes the distance of the object in each direction for all positional samples on a sphere around the object. In addition, the normal vectors of each object are computed and stored in corresponding fields for the same positional samples for use in the computation of reflection in ray-tracing. Thus we are able to speed up the calculation of most algorithms that trace rays to real-time frame rates. The pre-computation time of our method is relatively small. The space requirements amount to 1 byte per ray direction for the computation of ambient occlusion and soft shadows and 4 bytes per ray direction for the computation of reflection in ray-tracing. We present the acceleration results of our method and show its application to two different intersection intensive domains, ambient occlusion computation and stochastic ray tracing on the GPU.",

This increasing availability of acquisition technologies also implies a need for intelligent processing methods that can cope with imperfect object scans. Specifically for Cultural Heritage objects, besides imperfections given by the digitization process, also the original artifact objects may be imperfect due to deterioration or fragmentation processes. Currently, the reconstruction of previously digitized CH artifacts is mostly performed manually by expert users reassembling fragment parts and completing imperfect objects by modeling. However, more automatic methods for CH object repair and completion are needed to cope with increasingly large data becoming available.In this conceptual paper, we first provide a brief survey of typical imperfections in CH artifact scan data and in turn motivate the need for respective repair methods. We survey and classify a selection of existing reconstruction methods with respect to their applicability for CH objects, and then discuss how these approaches can be extended and combined to address various types of physical defects that are encountered in CH artifacts by proposing a flexible repair workflow for 3D digitizations of CH objects. The workflow accommodates an automatic reassembly step which can deal with fragmented input data. It also includes the similarity-based retrieval of appropriate complementary object data which is used to repair local and global object defects. Finally, we discuss \u2026",

These loads are transmitted through the tires and the wheels ensuring that vibrations are isolated and not perceived by the passengers. Depending on the aspect of interest regarding the design of a suspension system, the focus of the studies is turned on the ride comfort or the road holding of the vehicle being the basic needs for a good suspension system. Ride comfort is related to the passenger\u2019s perception of the moving vehicle\u2019s environment, while road holding is the degree to which a car maintains contact with the road surface in various types of directional changes. Keeping the tires in contact with the ground constantly is of vital importance for the friction between the vehicle and the road affecting the vehicle\u2019s ability to steer, brake and accelerate. Time domain statistics, such as mean suspension deflection, maximum and RMS values of suspension acceleration are often used in suspension design as criteria for road comfort ability. The main conflict and common trade-off in the automotive industry is the one concerning the displacement and the acceleration of the suspension. A hard configuration with high spring stiffness and high damping is required for reducing the suspension displacement. On the other hand, low spring stiffness and low damping is required for reducing suspension acceleration. This conflict depicts the trade-off between the ride comfort and the road holding. Multibody dynamics have been used extensively by automotive industry to model and design vehicle suspension. Before modern optimization \u2026",

Caching of 360 video content at caches close to the user reduces content delivery delay and bandwidth consumption. In 360 video streaming, the recently proposed tiling approach allows the streaming of different parts (tiles) of the 360 content at different resolutions as opposed to monolithic single-stream transmission.",

Ad\u2010-ditional advantageous characteristics would be low computational complexity and real-time performance, allowing the algorithm to be used in a wide variety of less powerful comput\u2010-ers. Transmission of video over the network would benefit by the ability to adapt to the net\u2010-work's end-to-end bandwidth and transmitter/receiver resources, as well as by resistance to packet losses that might occur. Additionally, scalability and resistance to noise would be highly advantageous characteristics for a modern video compression algorithm.

The proposed method combines planar and solid occluders using a unified selection approach and is ideal for dynamic environments, as it doesn\u2019t depend on precalculated visibility data.

Therefore, there is no need for laborious annotations to form large datasets in various notation styles. The experimental evaluation has been performed on a publicly available and diverse dataset of floor plans. The results show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art method, with respect to retrieval accuracy. Further experiments \u2026",

Despite the thorough investigation in this area, selective rendering has not addressed so far fragment visibility determination problems. To this end, we present the first \u201cselective multi-fragment rendering\u201d solution that alters the classic k-buffer construction procedure from a fixed-k to a variable-k per-pixel fragment allocation guided by an importance-driven model. Given a fixed memory budget, the idea is to allocate more fragment layers in parts of the image that need them most or contribute more significantly to the visual result. An importance map, dynamically estimated per frame based on several criteria, is used for the distribution of the fragment layers across the image. We illustrate the effectiveness and quality superiority of our approach in comparison to previous methods when performing order-independent transparency rendering in various, high depth-complexity, scenarios.",

Reducing the spherical harmonics coefficients for the chrominance components allows the storage of luminance in higher order spherical harmonics in the same memory budget resulting in finer representation of intensity transitions. We combine the radiance field chrominance compression with an optimized cache population scheme, by generating cache points only at locations, which are guaranteed to contribute to the reconstructed surface irradiance. These computation and storage savings allow the use of higher-order spherical harmonics representation to sufficiently capture and reconstruct the directionality of diffuse irradiance, while maintaining fast and customizable performance. We exploit this radiance representation in a low-cost real-time radiance caching scheme, with support for arbitrary light bounces and view-independent indirect occlusion and showcase the improvements in highly complex and dynamic environments. Furthermore, our general qualitative evaluation indicates benefits for offline rendering application as well.",

As often noted, diffuse indirect illumination has the characteristics of a low frequency function, consisting of smooth gradations. We exploit this by performing the indirect lighting computations on a rough approximation of the scene, the imperfect volume. The scene is converted on the fly to a dense point cloud, and each point is directly rendered to a volume texture, marking the corresponding voxel as occupied. A framebuffer reprojection scheme ensures that voxels visible to the main camera will get more points. Ray-marching is then used to compute the ambient occlusion or the indirect illumination of each voxel, and the results are stored using spherical harmonics. We demonstrate that the errors introduced by the imperfections in the volume are small and that our method maintains a high frame rate on scenes with high geometric complexity.",

In this paper we first identify the reasons for this performance degradation and propose a hybrid optimization system that combines a Simulated Annealing search along with the standard Sparse ICP, in order to solve the underlying optimization problem more efficiently. We also provide several insights on how to further improve the overall efficiency by using a combination of approximate distance queries, parallel execution and uniform subsampling.

Traditionally, these are accomplished using radius and k-nearest neighbors search operations, which utilize kd-trees and other specialized spatial data structures that fall short of delivering high performance. Recently, advances in ray-tracing performance, with respect to both acceleration data-structure construction and ray-traversal times, have resulted in a wide adoption of the ray-tracing paradigm for graphics-related tasks that spread beyond typical image synthesis. In this work, we propose an alternative formulation of the radius-search operation that maps the problem to the ray-tracing paradigm in order to take advantage of the available GPU-accelerated solutions for it. We demonstrate the performance gain relative to traditional spatial search methods, especially on dynamically updated sample sets, using two representative applications: geometry processing of point-wise operations on scanned point clouds and global illumination via progressive photon mapping.",

            "Abstract": "We present a complete method, encapsulated in our Virtual Archaeologist system, for the full reconstruction of archaeological finds from 3D scanned fragments. Virtual Archaeologist is designed to assist archaeologists in reconstructing monuments or smaller finds by avoiding unnecessary manual experimentation with fragile and often heavy fragments. An automated procedure cannot completely replace the archaeology expert, but provides a useful estimation of valid fragment combinations, and accurately measures fragment matches. In Virtual Archaeologist, we regard the reconstruction problem from a general, geometric point of view, relying on the broken surface morphology to determine correct matches between fragments.",
