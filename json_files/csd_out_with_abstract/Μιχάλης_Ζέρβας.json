Nanoscale apertures in thin noble-metal films, with dimensions comparable to the light wavelength, can form plasmonic nano-resonators and show astonishing optical properties leading to enhanced and selective light transmission and confinement. A number of different nano-structures have been considered and studied in detail for their ability to concentrate light.",

The fiber geometry is based on a series of circularly arranged high index rods embedded in a leaky silica cladding. The operation principle relies on the resonant coupling of the core and rod modes and the wavelength-dependent leaking of the structure. The fabricated fiber demonstrated wide transmission window and filtering of SRS with extinction in excess of 20 dB at the Raman Stokes wavelength, excellent robustness with bending, and high output beam quality. The fiber has been tested as a beam delivery fiber of a commercial pulsed fiber laser system in order to explore the filtering performance and its limitations.",

            "Abstract": "Since the discovery of photosensitivity and the ability to change the refractive index in optical fibre with a period comparable to the wavelength of the transmitted light became practical [1, 2], the applications of Bragg gratings have near exploded in the number of systems-utilities. The field now have progressed to an extend where nearly all aspects of transmission systems technology either have the potential or indeed already include Bragg grating devices in one form or another. The advantages using Bragg gratings in systems contexts are many, but a major reason for their employment is their relative ease of manufacture and all-fibre nature making them compatible with existing network fibre thus enhancing transparency of the total network. Roughly speaking a transmission system (Fig. 1) can be split up into a number of sections being, a transmitter section (including multiplexing), a transmission section (including amplification), a regeneration section, which can be either a retiming or reshaping or both, this section typically includes dispersion control of some sort as well, and finally a receiver section which in part can be an add-drop section. In each of these sections there are applications of Bragg gratings that can replace existing components and in many cases even enhance overall system-performance. We will in this presentation discuss some of the latest advances in the fields of systems applications of fibre Bragg grating devices and related technologies and discuss some new approaches to increase data-capacity in the existing systems.",

However, defects such as striations can be formed while cutting, which can negatively affect the final quality of the cut. As the light-matter interactions that occur during laser machining are highly non-linear and difficult to model mathematically, there is interest in developing novel simulation methods for studying these interactions. Deep learning enables a data-driven approach to the modelling of complex systems. Here, we show that deep learning can be used to determine the scanning speed used for laser cutting, directly from microscope images of the cut surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a trained neural network can generate realistic predictions of the visual appearance of the laser cut surface, and hence can be used as a predictive visualisation tool.",

We have shown that the relative phase between the fundamental fiber mode and the transverse perturbation significantly affects the local TMI gain. By controlling the relative phase, the TMI gain can be reduced significantly, with the gain variation being more pronounced as the core diameter increases. This finding can be used in conjunction with other proposed approaches to develop efficient strategies for mitigating TMI in high power fiber amplifiers and lasers.",

Such flexibility makes microbottles attractive and adaptable laser cavities. In this paper, lasing characteristics of Yb^3+-doped microbottle laser (MBL) coupled to tapered fiber are theoretically investigated. It is demonstrated that desired lasing characteristics for a particular mode are achievable by controlling the taper-resonator coupling, intrinsic quality factor (Q) and dopant concentration. Although, high Q whispering gallery cavities provide high internal powers, which is favorable especially for low gain materials, they lack high output powers. Hence, care should be taken in designing MBLs to attain the highest possible output power. Here, we address such issues \u2026",

A Teflon buffer layer is deposited on the waveguide to separate the microsphere from the waveguide and the effect of this separation on the measured quality-factor is discussed. The whispering-gallery mode propagation along the cavity of the microsphere as well as the optical path lengths of the modes are determined; the experimental and theoretical data are compared and discussed. A five-fold increase of the Q-factor was obtained by increasing the sphere-waveguide separation.",

Fiber offers cylindrical symmetry and also offer higher refractive index of core compared to cladding. This avoids the need of stack and draw process and refractive index compensation of core doped with index raising rare earth and co-dopants ions, which are an indispensable condition in most of other fiber designs. That is why, this fiber design can be fabricated with conventional modified chemical vapour deposition process in conjunction with solution doping process, which can dramatically reduce the fabrication cost, hence suitable for mass production. Fiber offers very high loss (>10dB/m) and low power fraction in core (<50%) to the higher order modes for low loss of fundamental mode (<0.1dB/m) and high power fraction in core (>80%) thanks to the resonant coupling between core and ring modes.

Guiding and modal properties of metal-coated optical fiber tips with embedded PSNRs are investigated through finite element method (FEM) simulations towards the identification of their optimization parameters. It was found that the placement of a PSNR at the cut-off radius of a metal-coated fiber tip, where the group velocity tends to zero, leads to considerable intensity enhancement of the field confined beyond the diffraction limit.

In this paper, we express in detail the tapered fiber asymmetric coupling mechanism to multimode microsphere resonators in order to selectively excite or collect WGMs. It is shown that due to the close effective refractive indices of degenerate spherical WGMs, depending on the amount of phase matching and overlap of fiber and resonator modes, a combination of WGMs with certain intrinsic losses is excited. By precisely designing the taper dimensions, critical coupling to one or a group of modes can be satisfied.

            "Abstract": "Coherent beam combination of multiple fibres can be used to overcome limitations such as the power handling capability of single fibre configurations. In such a scheme, the focal intensity profile is critically dependent upon the relative phase of each fibre and so precise control over the phase of each fibre channel is essential. Determining the required phase compensations from the focal intensity profile alone (as measured via a camera) is extremely challenging with a large number of fibres as the phase information is obfuscated. Whilst iterative methods exist for phase retrieval, in practice, due to phase noise within a fibre laser amplification system, a single step process with computational time on the scale of milliseconds is needed. Here, we show how a neural network can be used to identify the phases of each fibre from the focal intensity profile, in a single step of ~ 10 milliseconds, for a simulated 3-ring hexagonal close packed arrangement, containing 19 separate fibres and subsequently how this enables bespoke beam shaping. In addition, we show that deep learning can be used to determine whether a desired intensity profile is physically possible within the simulation. This, coupled with the demonstrated resilience against simulated experimental noise, indicates a strong potential for the application of deep learning for coherent beam combination.",

In that case, the pump pulse preceded the signal pulse train. Here, we propose a tandem pumping scheme in rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers, where a train of signal pulses is amplified by a pump pulse, which is almost exactly temporally overlapped. Simulations demonstrate that this can be used to create uniform gain across the signal pulse train, even at very high total pulse energies, where there would be significant gain shaping in the previous case. In addition, the pump is absorbed in a much shorter length, which increases the threshold for nonlinear effects and gain of greater than 26 dB is \u2026",

It is shown that common features of dispersion-engineered waveguides such as refractive-index trenches, rings and oscillations come naturally from this approach when the magnitude of leaky poles in increased. Increasing the number of poles is shown to offer a small but measureable change in higher order dispersion with designs dominated by a three pole design with a leaky pole pair of the smallest modulus.",

First, the waveguide asymmetry (V2/V1  ratio) should be optimized in order to minimize the extinction ratio of the unwanted mode at the null coupler waist. Second, the coupler taper shape should be optimized in order to further minimize the aforementioned extinction ratio. Third, the grating tilt angle and relative width can be also optimized to give negligible backreflections at the input port and minimize radiation losses.

Simulations for a microsphere show that the tapered fiber coupling mechanism induces cross-coupling between coherent orthonormal WGMs. We show that the degree of such cross-coupling depends basically on the fiber diameter, air-gap between the taper and resonator, intrinsic losses and eccentricity. The WGM cross-coupling affects the total transmission and spectral line-shape of the internal powers resulting in a controllable transformation of the line-shape to non-Lorentzian spectra.

This new approach has allowed us to construct Bragg gratings with versatile structures such as phase shifts and apodization profiles. Simple uniform gratings, single and multiple phase shifted gratings, apodized gratings and chirped gratings have been made in this method; using grating detuning and this new phase controlled method we have shown that planar Bragg gratings can be written among 700 nm wavelength range on a single chip exclusively using software control.",

The fibre geometry is based on the series of circularly arranged high index rod resonators embedded in the silica cladding. The operation principle relies on the resonant coupling of the core and resonators modes. The fabricated fibre demonstrated wide transmission window and filtering of SRS from the output spectra (with the extinction which exceeds 20dB at the Raman Stokes wavelength), robustness for bending and high output beam quality.

This implies that the TBP value is restricted. Here, we investigate the synthesized refractive index profile in compact Bragg grating design for theoretical simulation and the linearity-enhanced direct UV grating writing fabrication for experimental implementation. The fabricated device could process microwave photonic signals as Hilbert transformation between 50 GHz and 3 THz, with the TBP above 60, which is the largest experimental data to the best of our knowledge.

Laser machining is a highly non-linear process and is challenging to model via equation-based approaches (e.g. finite element modelling), particularly as the physical origins of many effects are not fully understood [1] . Recently, deep learning has been shown to be capable of modelling femtosecond laser machining [2] . Modelling via deep learning uses a data-driven approach, where the model is created directly from experimental data. Deep learning therefore provides an excellent opportunity for simulating laser machining effects that are not fully understood, and consequently assists in parameter optimisation and \u2026",

Measurements ensure a robust effective single-mode operation without the need of tight coiling as required for conventional fibers thanks to the ultralow NA (\u223c0.038) and resonant ring surrounding the core. All-solid and cylindrical design ensures the suitability for mass scale production with the added benefit of all-fiberized device structure. A compact master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) has been built using this fiber delivering \u223c23.5\u2009\u2009ps pulses at 13.5 MHz repetition rate delivering up to \u223c52\u2009\u2009W of average output power corresponding to a pulse energy of \u223c3.8\u2009\u2009\u03bcJ and peak power of >160\u2009\u2009kW, while maintaining \u223c76% slope efficiency. The output beam exhibits a polarization extinction ratio of more than 15 dB and a M^2 less than 1.15.",

The integrated device is fabricated via a direct UV grating writing technique in a silica-on-silicon platform. The photonic Hilbert transformer operates at bandwidths of up to 2 THz (\u223c16\u2009\u2009nm) in the telecom band, a 10-fold greater bandwidth than any previously reported experimental approaches. Achieving this performance requires detailed knowledge of the system transfer function of the direct UV grating writing technique; this allows improved linearity and yields terahertz bandwidth Bragg gratings with improved spectral quality. By incorporating a flat-top reflector and Hilbert grating with a waveguide coupler, an ultrawideband all-optical single-sideband filter is demonstrated.",

The origin of TMI is predominantly thermal and a number of theoretical models have been introduced to explore its characteristics [3-9]. The majority of TMI reports so far deal with fibre amplifiers in MOPA configurations [3-14], and only a small numbers of recent reports refer to TMI in single-cavity HPFLs [15-16]. In addition, most of the experimental TMI work is carried out under steady-state pumping conditions and the transient TMI response is largely overlooked [17]. TMI threshold reduces in the presence of backreflections in amplifiers [18], and, therefore, TMI effects are expected to be more pronounced in single-cavity HPFL oscillators.",

A polarization-resolved measurement was set-up in order to fully characterize the fabricated PBMR. Initially, the uncoated BMR with waist diameter of 181 \u03bcm, stem diameter of 125 \u03bcm and length of 400 \u03bcm was fabricated and then gold film was deposited on the surface. Due to surface curvature, the gold film covering half of the BMR had a characteristic meniscus shape and maximum thickness of 30 nm. The meniscus provides appropriately tapered edges which facilitate the adiabatic transformation of BMR WGMs to SPWs and vice versa. This results in low transition \u2026",

After propagating through the fiber under test, the power of the received light is measured with an integrating sphere that captures all angles. Fig. 1 (c) shows the characterization of different cladding mode-strippers (MS). The reference fiber is a circular coreless fiber formed by low-loss synthetic silica glass and low-index polymer. It has a numerical aperture (NA) of~ 0.44 and it is typically used for pump power delivery. MS# 1 is less effective than MS# 2 at attenuating both low-and higher-order cladding modes.

All-fiber and all-guided architecture of fiber lasers offer instant turn-on operation, and facilitate heat removal and minimize external cooling requirements. Laser power modulation is used for reducing thermal effects such as the heat-affected zone (HAZ), reducing dross and permitting kerf widths of less than 20 \u00b5m.

Type I second-harmonic generation was implemented in a lithium triborate crystal via noncritical phase matching by temperature tuning. Narrow-bandwidth green light of average output power of up to 9 W, with a pulse duration of 1.8 ns and a peak power of 25 kW, was obtained at a repetition rate of 200 kHz. The pump-to-green conversion efficiency reached 30%. This linearly polarized, narrow bandwidth, tunable source has great potential for applications, such as material processing, sensing, and medical research.",

The next industrial digital manufacturing era requires beam shaping capabilities to provide efficacy, energy efficiency, and new functionalities for advanced manufacturing [1] . Recently, we presented a robust kW-class FL with an adjustable beam profile offering improved material processing capability, as compared with standard Gaussian beams [2] . The output beam can be configured from a diffraction-limited Gaussian profile into higher M 2 petal-like shaped beams. Petal beams (PBs) are known as linearly polarized (LP mn ) modes supported by optical fibres [3] . A remarkable property of partially blocked petal beams is that they self-heal or self-reconstruct in the far field, after a certain propagation distance [4] . Beam self-healing is an exciting research topic and different approaches have been proposed to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We propose a new tandem pumping scheme in three-level rare-earth-doped optical fibers, where energy storage in a pump fiber laser enables much shorter (~500 ns) pump pulses than is possible with pulsed diode laser pumping. This has the effect of reducing the time during which the final amplifier has high inversion and, hence, reduces the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) when compared with continuous wave (CW) tandem pumping. We simulate the gain and ASE dynamics in a pulse-pumped Yb-doped fiber amplifier and show that the ratio of amplified signal to ASE background can be improved by up to two orders of magnitude over a large range of pulse energies compared with CW tandem pumping. Sub-microsecond pulsed tandem pumping offers a relatively straightforward, as yet experimentally untried, way to substantially reduce undesirable ASE compared with the levels in diode-pumped fiber \u2026",

The method relies on luminescence measurements, analyzed through an optical tomography technique, to define the active dopant distribution and ray-deflection measurements to calculate the refractive index profile. The concurrent evaluation of both the preform refractive index and the active dopant profiles allows for an accurate establishment of the dopant distribution within the optical core region. This combined information is important for the optimization and development of a range of advanced fibers, used, for example, in a high-power fiber lasers and modern spatial-division-multiplexing optical communication systems. In addition, the non-destructive nature allows the technique to be used to identify the most appropriate preform segment, thus increasing fiber yield and reducing development cycles. We demonstrate the technique on an Yb 3+-doped aluminosilicate fiber preform and compare it with independent refractive index and active-dopant measurements. This technique will be useful for quality evaluation and optimization of optical fiber preforms and lends itself to advanced instrumentation. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "We measure the in-band dispersion penalty in a cascade of five 50-GHz low-dispersion linear-phase fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and compare the results with conventional apodised FBGs. At the 0.5-dB power penalty level,the usable bandwidth of a single linear-phase FBG (40 GHz) is twice as wide as that of a conventional apodised FBG (19 GHz). The bandwidth-utilization factor of a single linear-dispersion grating is 89%, while for the five-grating cascade, it is 76%. To our knowledge, these are the highest values reported to date for cascaded optical devices. The corresponding factors for the conventional gratings are 53% and 31%. We also measure the additional penalty on a dropped channel caused by a cascade of five adjacent-channel gratings. The bandwidth narrowing due to the adjacent-channel FBGs is 6 GHz both for linear-phase and conventional FBGs, giving a usable bandwidth of 34 GHz (linear \u2026",

We practically demonstrate a photonic Hilbert transformer in planar geometry; utilising a pi-phase shift planar Bragg grating with proper apodization profile. The device is fabricated by direct UV grating writing technology in silica-on-silicon [1]. The PHT has a pi-phase shift at the zero point of the frequency response, whereas the amplitude remains constant. The pi-phase shift in PHT is simply induced by placing a pi-phase shift in the refractive index modulation. The constant amplitude is achieved by precise apodization of the grating coupling strength, while the apodization profile is given by [2]. With our current direct UV writing technology, the proposed grating can be fabricated in a much higher accuracy then the conventional fibre Bragg grating manufacturing technique. We will present our latest work on more complex apodized gratings to obtain the ideal realisable frequency and temporal responses for PHTs.",

The glasses, based on gallium lanthanum sulphides are readily doped with high concentrations of rare earth elements. Quality factors of greater than 10,000 have been measured and laser action in neodymium-doped spheres demonstrated. Evidence for non-linear effects is also observed. These simple compact lasers have extremely low thresholds and are attracting interest as another building block in photonic circuits.",

Its advantages over the pure metal tips conventionally used, are the inherent enhanced environmental robustness due to inert borosilicate cladding and the capability of multiple excitation of the tapered nanowire through the length of the fiber due to the enabled total internal reflection at the borosilicate/air interface. Simulations through finite element method (FEM) have demonstrated an improved field enhancement at the tapered region of such microfibers. Furthermore, experimental results on tapering in copper based microfibers together with light coupling and propagation studies will be demonstrated revealing the potential for the development of plasmonic devices for sensing applications.",

Recently, LN structures suitable for WGM micro-resonators have been fabricated using surface tension reshaping of a previously micro-structured substrates, producing ultra-smooth surfaces while also maintaining the useful crystalline properties of the original material [1]. The method is based on the preferential melting of a surface layer [2] at temperatures close to the melting point for the bulk material. Upon cooling, the melted surface layer re-crystallizes, seeded by the bulk crystal that remains solid during the process, and is reshaped by the surface tension to form ultra-smooth single crystal superstructures. Fig. 1 shows some surface tension reshaped structures which have been obtained by varying the initial microstructure \u2026",

The two main radiation forces involved are the transverse gradient force which attracts a particle into the waveguide and the combined scattering and dissipative forces which drive the particle forward along the channel. The dependence of these forces on parameters including the incident wavelength, the surrounding medium embedding the particles, and the polarizability of the particles is discussed. Both dielectric and metallic gold spheres of radius 10 nm are considered in the model. Special emphasis is devoted to the maximization of the transverse gradient force due to the optical intensity gradient at the waveguide surface, and the wavelength dependence of the polarizability of gold nanoparticles.",

This evolution in manufacturing techniques has lead to an impressive collection of a variety of Bragg grating based components and devices, [3], and the robustness of many of these devices in laboratory experiments have pushed their employment in real system environments. Convincing performance, in the relative short lifetime of the technology, led in 1995 to the commercialisation of a series Bragg grating products. Among these were the chirped fibre Bragg grating. It was originally proposed by Ouellette [4] as a device capable of compensation of chromatic dispersion by incorporating reflective differential delay \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Methods for analyzing waveguide couplers are non-destructive, and comprise introducing probe light into a coupler; providing a source of perturbing radiation; presenting the coupling region of the coupler to the perturbing radiation to generate a temperature gradient across the waveguide, either from a direction so as to expose one waveguide before another waveguide and perturb the coupling region asymmetrically, or from a direction so as to expose the waveguides together and perturb the coupling region symmetrically; monitoring the power and/or phase of transmitted probe light, and repeating the presenting and monitoring along the length of the coupling region. Theoretical modeling shows that the transmitted probe light contains information from which can be derived the coupling profile, and power evolution and distribution along the coupling region, including location of the 50-50% points.",

This work introduces the use of planar Bragg gratings in all-optical signal processing. The key fabrication technique is direct grating writing (DGW). One significant advantage of the DGW system is the small spot size of the focused laser beam used to inscribe the waveguide and grating. Rather than using the wide area exposure such as that from a phase mask, DGW uses a direct UV laser spot such that the dimensions of the UV induced structure are determined by the focal spot size. For complex grating engineering this feature is superior to the conventional phase mask techniques, allowing accurate control of the chirp, phase shifts, apodisation and other parameters to produce intricate optical response.",

            "Abstract": "The ever increasing demand for bandwidth, led to the introduction of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) as one technique to increase capacity in the optical fibre networks. Initially 100GHz was set as the standard channel separation by the ITU, but this spacing is due to capacity constraints, already being reduced to 50GHz to accommodate extra data-traffic. Even 25GHz channel separations are currently being discussed and may very well become the trend of the future on the moderate bit-rate of 10Gbit/s, as an alternative to faster bit-rates whilst faster electronics is maturing. This trend therefore calls for filters that can perform filtering duties, that on top of a solid functionality, also act as passive ultra-selective filters that can maintain channel integrity at any cost. The technology of Fibre Bragg gratings has come a long way since the initial demonstrations in 1978 by Hill et al. at the CRC in Canada. Bragg gratings and in particular apodised Bragg gratings has previously been shown to exhibit near ideal characteristics for compact and high filling factor values on grid spacings as small as 25GHz [1]. However, it has also been discussed how these filters, despite their near ideal spectral performance, suffer from non-linear phase attributes in the stop-band, that could limit their use in high bit-rate systems (10Gbit/s and above)[2]. Linear-phase filters therefore have been proposed as a solution to this problem, but some previous demonstrations have suffered from low rejection values [2]. In this talk we show linear-phase (dispersion-less) Bragg grating square-filters for 25GHz and 50GHz channel separations that exhibit grid filling-factor values of 75 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Thermal treatment of micro-structured lithium niobate substrates at temperatures close to, but below the melting point, allows surface tension to reshape a preferentially melted surface zone [1] of the crystal to form ultra-smooth single crystal toroidal or spherical structures. Such structures, an example of which is shown in figure 1, are suitable for the fabrication of photonic micro-resonators with low scattering loss. The thermally treated material maintains its single crystal nature after the thermal treatment because the bulk remains solid throughout the process acting as seed during the recrystallization process which takes place during the cooling stage. The single crystal nature of the reshaped material has been verified by piezoresponse force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and chemical etching. The inherent properties of lithium niobate crystals (optically nonlinear, piezoelectric and electro-optic) makes the resultant micro-resonator extremely suitable for sensing applications, for the production of micro-lasers (if doped with Er or Nd), for nonlinear frequency generation and finally for switching/modulation and tunable spectral filtering in optical telecommunications. The transformation of the initial surface micro-structures to the resulting resonator structure is a temperature dependent process as the surface tension acts on the surface melted layer of the crystal, Experimental investigation and modelling of the thermal treatment as well as investigation of the performance of these microresonators is underway to establish full control of the fabrication process for practical applications.",

Bragg gratings have been written using electron beam lithography and etching on a complex waveguide structure consisting of a thin silicon overlay on ion diffused waveguides in LiNbO/sub 3/. This configuration enhances the guided field closer to the surface resulting in strong interaction with the film region. A new waveguide grating design process which relies on a novel grating patterning method and new materials will be presented in this paper. This design consists of the combination of a potassium ion-exchanged single-mode channel waveguide with a high index film (InO/sub x/) overlaid on its upper surface.",

We have tested Yb-doped fiber amplifiers operated under both pulsed and CW mode. Using OTDR background-loss measurements we show, for the first time, that the photodarkening-induced loss is non-uniformly distributed along the length of the active fiber. By calculating the average inversion along the fiber length, we show that the induced loss follows closely an Yb-inversion dependence to the power of 2. In addition we have studied the temperature dependence of the output power variation. It is shown that increasing (decreasing) operating temperature results in decrease \u2026",

As the spectrum and coupling efficiency highly depend on the excitation position, the coupling system requires precise alignment, and packaging is complex.

            "Abstract": "The development of ultrafast laser technology and high-speed fibre-optic communications, has resulted in the need to develop all-optical techniques for implementing many network operations. Superstructured fibre Bragg grating (FBG) technology has advanced to the point that the design and fabrication of passive filters of highly complicated optical responses is feasible. Thus, FBGs can be used for applications involving coherent control of short or ultrashort pulses, such as pattern generation and pulse shaping at high speeds. Key benefits offered by this filtering approach are full integration with fiberised systems, and precise control of the amplitude and phase of the filter responses. Due to their coherence properties, superstructured FBGs are monolithic devices, and consequently their operation does not require any external configurations (eg adjustable delay lines, etc.). We have demonstrated this powerful signal processing technique in a series of different experiments, including the generation of a 40GHz pulsed signal by repetition rate multiplication of 10GHz pulses, and shaping of solitons into square pulses. In this talk I will focus mainly on our more recent results, concerning pulse encoding and decoding schemes suitable for optical code-division multiple access (OCDMA) systems. Bipolar codes of a chip rate of 160Gchip/s are written in single superstructured FBGs. An incoming 10Gbit/s signal is encoded, transmitted and then decoded using a second, matched-filter FBG.",

            "Abstract": "In this work we study the conditions for the onset of modal instabilities in two-mode fiber amplifiers. We show that transverse-mode instability (TMI) results as a consequence of cross-phase modulation and four-wave mixing processes. The TMI threshold condition corresponds to a self-phase and cross-phase modulation induced nonlinear phase matching between LP01 and LP11 modes. The derived TMI power threshold shows a functional dependence on fiber and amplification parameters similar to previously derived formula applicable to single-mode fiber amplifiers.",

Toluene was used as a convenient model analyte, and a 40-fold greater signal was collected from the waveguide end. Simulations of angular and spatial Raman emission distributions showed good agreement with experiments, with the enhancement resulting from efficient collection of power from dipoles near the surface into the high-index waveguide film and substrate, combined with long interaction length. The waveguide employed was optimized at the excitation wavelength but not at emission wavelengths, and full optimization is expected to lead to enhancements comparable to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in robust low-cost metal-free and nanostructure-free chips.",

Firstly the interferometric full-coupler based OADM is modelled in various configurations using coupled mode theory. Implications of the inherent non-optimum overall performance of this device in conjunction with additional system issues like filter misalignments and cascading are analysed. Filters with typical degraded spectral characteristics in the Drop or Add action exhibits at least 0.15 dB higher Eye Opening Penalty (EOP) compared to filter with optimized flat spectral response. For this kind of OADMs we found also that the Intra-Band dispersion EOP performance in a cascaded 'Add-and-Drop operation' - in a single-wavelength-processing-node - for a specific OADM is insensitive to the arrangement of the Bragg grating in the coupler waist and consequently to the individual spectral characteristics of the Add or Drop actions.",

The TMI power threshold is shown to be ~65% of the TL one and dominates power scaling. In addition to commonly used limiting effects, we introduce a bend-induced mechanical reliability criterion, which limits the maximum allowable cladding diameter to ~600\u03bcm. This also results in the introduction of a critical pump brightness, the minimum required pump brightness at which the maximum signal power is achieved. The maximum achievable power depends primarily on the choice of pumping wavelength, amplifier gain and heat coefficient. Maximum signal powers of ~28kW to ~38kW, for diode pumping (\u03bb_p = 976nm), and ~35kW to ~52kW, for tandem pumping (\u03bb_p = 1018nm), are predicted for single-mode fiber amplifiers operating at signal wavelength \u03bb_s \u2026",

However, high bit-rate transmission is severely limited by the fibre residual loss and dispersion [1]. Fibre non-linearities, on the other hand, can further limit high bit rates over long distances [2]. Figure 5.1 shows a typical attenuation and dispersion spectrum of single-mode, standard-telecommunication fibres (STF) and dispersion-shifted fibres (DSF). In the second telecommunications window (centered around 1.31 \u03bcm), STFs exhibit very low dispersion and propagation losses of about 0.35 dB/km. Use of DSFs can shift the zerodispersion point in the third telecommunication window (centered around 1.55 \u03bcm), where the propaegation loss is about 0.2 dB/km.",

In addition to record spectral efficiencies, coherent communication systems offer other advantages in terms of system flexibility, reduced signal-to-noise ratio requirements, increased resilience against fiber chromatic dispersion and in many aspects simplify the system design. However, coherent detection systems, such as, for example, coherent-optical orthogonal-frequencydivision-multiplexed (CO-OFDM) systems, and advanced modulation formats, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), impose much more stringent requirements on source linewidth, stability, and phase/frequency noise characteristics. The development of inexpensive laser sources, with high coherence and stability, is expected to replace expensive external-cavity semiconductor lasers and allow their use as local oscillators similar to the way local oscillators are used in today\u2019s radio communication systems. The performance of CO-OFDM is in general 3dB better than that of incoherent OFDM since no optical power is allocated for the carrier. However, CO-OFDM requires a laser at the receiver to generate the carrier locally. It is, therefore, more sensitive to phase noise and the main challenge of CO-OFDM is that the phase noise of the local oscillator must be compensated for. It has been shown that the influence of phase noise can be reduced by using lasers with narrow linewidth [2, 3].So far, practical commercial telecommunication systems are almost entirely based on \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Optical microresonators of different configurations have been studied extensively over the last two decades and applied successfully in various fields in photonics, such as light-atom interactions, quantum electrodynamics, sensing and telecommunications. In general, they rely on light trapping in small volumes, primarily by whispering-gallery mode (WGM) excitation. The resulting high-Q resonances show significant internal intensity build-up and tremendous increase of the effective propagation lengths. These attributes facilitate a number of optical functions, such as low threshold lasing, efficient non-linear interactions, controlled dispersion, and make optical microresonators very good candidates as building blocks in miniaturised, highly-efficient integrated circuits. In this presentation, we review various advanced microresonator structures and consider their applicability in different telecommunication applications. We will consider microresonator-based devices such as fully integrated microsphere lasers, microsphere-based filters with improved characteristics, bottle-microresonator based add-drop multiplexers and tapered-microcylinder dispersion compensators.",

The FM and HOM power evolution indicates the presence of two competing effective laser cavities which result in rich output dynamics and full chaotic operation. The thermal and inversion related contributions to the observed instabilities have been identified by monitoring the associated characteristic instability frequencies under pulsed pumping. It is shown that in the transient regime, both inversion and thermal effects contribute successively to the observed power instabilities. Increasing the pump power leads to full chaotic response through an interplay between transverse and longitudinal \u2026",

Compared to bare-fiber cylindrical resonators, the bottle microresonator results in a 35x increase of the observed Q factor.",

Using a failure-in-time analysis we also introduced a new power limiting factor due to mechanical reliability of bent fibers. For diode (tandem) pumping power limits of 28kW (52kW) are predicted.

            "Abstract": "Fibre Bragg gratings have over a relatively short evolutionary process matured from prototypes in laboratory environments to commercial products in real world applications. This short process has been driven by a combined effort from many research groups throughout the scientific communities in the development and refinement of grating fabrication techniques as well as a number of potential applications. One field that has attracted attention from many obvious applications of Bragg gratings is that of microwave photonics, where optical devices and systems are employed to generate, transport and process RF, microwave and millimetre wave signals. Bragg grating lasers and in particular the distributed-feedback (DFB) fibre-laser exhibit many attractive features including narrow (kHz) line width and being based on and around a fibre Bragg grating, they exhibit the robustness in performance offered by these together with inherent fibre compatibility. In light of this and with a number of applications in mind, we have developed a DFB-fibre laser source operating CW on two frequency channels separated by 15GHz, 25GHz, 50GHz and 100GHz respectively with output powers up to 1mW/channel. The laser consists of a superstructure Bragg grating with multiple phase-shifts written into a rare-earth doped fibre, where the periodicity of the phase-shifts determines the frequency separation of the generated channels. Additionally, the fibre-lasers are designed to operate with single sided output to optimise output-power. Furthermore, they can be made to operate in both single and dual polarisation mode configuration on both channels by controlling the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Optical microresonators supporting whispering-gallery modes (WGM), with a variety of geometries and associated small mode volumes and large optical quality factors (Q), thereby yielding high optical intensities and long photon lifetimes have attracted considerable interest recently for applications including narrow linewidth microlasers, all-optical switching and biosensors (1). We recently fabricated fiber and capillary based double-neck bottle-shaped solid and hollow microresonators and made the first experimental demonstration of high-Q WGMs in them (2, 3). Although bottle microresonators support WGMs, they have very different characteristics from the conventional equatorial WGM microresonators such as microspheres and microtoroids. Bottle microresonators are highly oblate resonators and sustain non-degenerate WGMs that exhibit two well-separated spatial regions with enhanced field strength, corresponding to modal turning points. We have experimentally observed these intensity maxima on both sides of the bottle microresonator near the turning points and measured the resonance spectrum for the first time, as shown in Fig. 1.The dense spectral features may be a serious hindrance when these microresonators are used for refractometric optofluidic sensing applications. We have used various approaches to clean the spectrum, resulting in only a very few modes remaining within the free spectral range and these results will be discussed.",

In this paper an erbium-doped silicate glass microsphere is coupled to an ion-exchanged glass waveguide, and excitation spectra for the sphere whispering-gallery modes are determined as a function of spatial separation. Modal assignment allows extraction of the physical parameters of the microsphere and the dependence of Q-factor with separation is compared with theory.

A polarimetric setup was utilized to investigate the evolution of the transmission dips, polarization cross-coupling (PXC) peaks, and scattered light as the input polarization is varied. It is shown that the transmission dip and PXC minima are shifted with respect to the ideally expected input polarization angle. A theoretical model based on Jones matrix calculus was developed in order to identify the root cause of the observed effects. The modelling has attributed the observed shifts to the residual birefringence of the output part of the microtaper fiber used for evanescent coupling into the MRs.",

            "Abstract": "A 2 W deep-ultraviolet (DUV) source at 274 nm with 5.6 kW peak power is demonstrated by frequency quadrupling a diode-seeded, polarization-maintaining (PM), Yb-doped fiber master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) system delivering 1.8 ns pulses at a repetition rate of 200 kHz. The second harmonic generation (SHG) and the fourth harmonic generation (FHG) are achieved by using Lithium Triborate (LBO) crystal and \u03b2\u2212BaB_2O_4 (BBO) crystal in sequence, with an IR-to-green and green-to-UV conversion efficiency of up to 65% and 26%, respectively. This is the first kW peak power pulsed UV system reported at 274 nm which has great potential for machining insulators, 2D materials, isotopic separation of Calcium-48, and fluorescence analysis of biological molecules.",

            "Abstract": "Bragg gratings in optical fibre waveguides have now been around for nearly 25 years and they were soon after being realised identified as one of the most significant fibre-optic inventions with potentials in a wide variety of areas among telecommunications equivalent to that of the erbium doped fibre amplifier. Following their creation a plurality of infibre functions were thought possible with low or no insertion-loss. Although fabrication and control of vital grating parameters was limited in the early stages of their life, initially a number of filtering functions were identified for obvious demonstrations. It soon became apparent though that not just standard filtering manipulation was possible. Identifying the true potential of the devices has let to considerable effort being concentrated on their full exploitation implying building an infrastructure supported by theoretical design [2] and manufacturing techniques [3, 4] around them. These techniques combined have let to a scenario where currently it is the imagination more than the actual design and manufacturing capabilities that imposes a limitation to what is being demonstrated. We will in this presentation discuss and highlight some of the most recent advances in Bragg grating devices and applications in advanced components. In particular we will show examples of the latest in Bragg gratings for dispersion-control, short pulse manipulation and advanced filtering applications and speculate into what the future holds for these unique devices.",
