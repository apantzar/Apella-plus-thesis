It involves a multiparametric design space exploration for optimization, followed by design verification. Designers of special purpose VLSI implementations often need to explore parameters, such as optimal bitwidth and data representation, through time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. A prominent example of this simulation-based exploration process is the design of decoders for error correcting systems, such as the Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes adopted by modern communication standards, which involves thousands of Monte Carlo runs for each design point. Currently, high-performance computing offers a wide set of acceleration options that range from multicore CPUs to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

The methodology is based on a flow graph that describes the streaming computations and communications.

These systems have been implemented with a variety of single core or multi-core technologies from general purpose processors (GPPs) to fixed ASICs.This paper describes the porting of the AVS (Audio Video Standard)[1] video decoder to Tensilica\u2019s Diamond 388VDO dual core [2], a heterogeneous dual core processor which consists of two cores with video specific instruction extensions. The AVS was drafted by the A/V work group of China to replace older and royalty-burdened standards such as MPEG-2 and H. 264 mainly in consumer applications. We start from an open source implementation of the AVS decoder, OpenAVS [3], which targets a general processor platform (GPP), and we gradually transform the code to enable a dual core implementation on the Diamond 388VDO core. Our aim is to achieve real time, 25 fps, progressive D1 resolution (720x576) AVS video decoding. The Diamond family of processors includes preconfigured versions of the 32-bit Xtensa configurable architecture optimized for video encoding and decoding. Diamond uses the capability of the Xtensa architecture to configure a processor core by adding extra application-specific instructions. Its enhanced instruction set supports all popular video codecs such as MPEG-4, H. 264, VC-1 (all in Main Profile) for performance up to D1 resolution, ie 720x576x25 (PAL) or 720x480x30 (NTSC) pixels/sec.

In this paper, we present our approach, which aims at developing a new class of micro-servers\u2013the UniServer-that exceed the conservative energy and performance scaling boundaries by introducing novel mechanisms at all layers of the design stack.

Low overhead schemes are employed to monitor and predict the hardware behavior and report it to the system software, which is responsible for optimizing the system operation in terms of energy or performance, while guaranteeing non-disruptive operation under extended operating points. To efficiently manage any potential fault that may incur under extended margins, we aim at identifying critical/vulnerable software structures and developing low cost techniques for protecting them.

Extrapolating current trends, this portion is likely to increase in the near future, since the devices devoted to the caches occupy an increasingly larger percentage of the total area of the chip. We propose a method that uses an additional minicache located between the I-Cache and the central processing unit (CPU) core and buffers instructions that are nested within loops and are continuously otherwise fetched from the I-Cache.

Specifically, the system and method replaces bad pixel data in the image data by comparing each pixel to selected neighboring pixels, including pixels of other colors in some cases, and determining if the pixel is likely corrupt, such as from a detective pixel. Corrupted pixels are then replaced using averages, means, maximums, or other statistical functions of select nearby pixels.",

Current approaches to software-based approximate computing often require the programmer to specify parts of the code or data structures that can be approximated. A largely unaddressed challenge is how to automate the analysis of the significance of code for the output quality. To this end, we propose a methodology and toolset for automatic significance analysis. We use interval arithmetic and algorithmic differentiation in our profile-driven yet mathematical approach to evaluate the significance of input and intermediate variables for the output of a computation. Our methodology effectively matches decisions of a domain expert in significance characterization for a set of benchmarks, and in some cases offers new insights.

The key to this high code efficiency are mainly the Intra and Inter prediction modes provided by the standard. However, the compression efficiency of the H264 standard comes at the cost of increased complexity of the encoder. Therefore it is very important to design video architectures that minimize the cost of the prediction modes in terms of area, power dissipation and design complexity. A common aspect of the Inter and Intra Prediction modes, is the Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD). In this paper we present a new algorithm that can replace the SAD in Intra Prediction, and which provides a more efficient hardware implementation.",

The proliferation of imaging in mobile phones, digital cameras, webcams, toys, etc. creates the need for a low cost, small footprint image sensor. Nowadays, sensor optics account for approximately half the cost of an image sensor system for a camera phone, and their cost does not scale down as fast as the cost of semiconductors. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and the hardware implementation of a novel color processing chain that uses image processing techniques to compensate for the spatial variations in image attributes and quality due to low cost optics.

Extrapolating current trends, this portion is likely to increase in the near future, since the devices devoted to the caches occupy an increasingly larger percentage of the total area of the chip.

            "Abstract": "The proliferation of heterogeneous computing platforms presents the parallel computing community with new challenges. One such challenge entails evaluating the efficacy of such parallel architectures and identifying the architectural innovations that ultimately benefit applications. To address this challenge, we need benchmarks that capture the execution patterns (i.e., dwarfs or motifs) of applications, both present and future, in order to guide future hardware design. Furthermore, we desire a common programming model for the benchmarks that facilitates code portability across a wide variety of different processors (e.g., CPU, APU, GPU, FPGA, DSP) and computing environments (e.g., embedded, mobile, desktop, server). As such, we present the latest release of OpenDwarfs, a benchmark suite that currently realizes the Berkeley dwarfs in OpenCL, a vendor-agnostic and open-standard computing \u2026",

In this paper, we present our approach, which aims at developing a new class of micro-servers - the UniServer - that exceed the conservative energy and performance scaling boundaries by introducing novel mechanisms at all layers of the design stack. The main idea lies on the realization of the intrinsic hardware heterogeneity and the development of mechanisms that will automatically expose the unique varying capabilities of each hardware.

We model the problem in a formal way, capturing the most important aspects that drive VM management and system configuration decisions. Then, we introduce XM-VFS policy that reduces infrastructure operator costs by reducing voltage margins, and compare it with the state-of-the-art which employs dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS \u2026",

The main idea behind the proposed approach lies on the observation that not all operations are equally important in shaping the output quality of various applications and of the overall system. Based on such an observation, we suggest that all levels of the software design stack, including the programming model, compiler, operating system (OS) and run-time system should identify the critical tasks and ensure correct operation of such tasks by assigning them to dynamically adjusted reliable cores/units. Specifically, based on error rates and operating conditions identified by a sense-and-adapt (SeA) unit, the OS selects and sets the right mode of operation of the overall system. The run-time system identifies the critical/less-critical tasks based on special directives and \u2026",

However, these worst-case scenarios occur rarely, if ever, thus the operating voltage is overly pessimistic resulting in excessive power dissipation which leads to decreased performance under power capping. In this paper, we investigate the impact of reducing voltage margins beyond the nominal level on the efficiency of CPU power capping mechanisms, for three commercial systems, two Applied Micro ARMv8 micro-servers (X-Gene2 and X-Gene3) and an Intel x86-64 (Xeon E3). We show that CPU power capping at reduced voltage margins compared with Intel's RAPL and Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS) mechanisms results in performance improvement by up to 64% and 24% on average, respectively.

While it is possible to determine a safe undervolting level for each application, typically only the most conservative setting is applied statically across all workloads. In this paper, we go a step further and investigate the gains that can be achieved by dynamically and transparently changing the level of CPU undervolting at runtime. To enable this functionality, we design and implement a novel, OS-level, context-aware dynamic undervolting mechanism, able to decide and apply voltage levels according to the specific tolerance of each workload that executes on a multicore CPU at a particular time. Our mechanism can further differentiate between the user-and kernel-level code executed within the same application thread, enabling the exploitation of differences in their undervolting \u2026",

We present a probabilistic push-and-pull approach for register queue size estimation of a streaming data flow graph. We evaluated our techniques using an industrial tool/low.

Both conventional (Voltage and Frequency Scaling) and more aggressive (undervolting, overclocking) techniques can be applied to reduce the energy footprint of the infrastructure and thus the cost of the operator. However, these techniques may affect the quality of service (QoS), potentially activating service level agreement (SLA) violation penalties for the provider. In this paper we model and study this tradeoff. We find that undervolting is the most effective of the three techniques in reducing infrastructure operation cost. We identify optimal operating points, and we study the effect of different parameters, such as the severity of SLA penalties, the length of the job and the existence of error protection mechanisms, on the optimal operating point and the extent of potential benefits.",
