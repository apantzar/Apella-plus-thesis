            "Abstract": "Supporting real-time, cost-effective execution of Complex Event processing applications in the cloud has been an important goal for many scientists in recent years. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) have been widely adopted by major computing companies as a powerful approach for large-scale Complex Event processing (CEP). However, determining the appropriate degree of parallelism of the DSPS' components can be particularly challenging as the volume of data streams is becoming increasingly large, the rule set is becoming continuously complex, and the system must be able to handle such large data stream volumes in real-time, taking into consideration changes in the burstiness levels and data characteristics. In this paper we describe our solution to building elastic complex event processing systems on top of our distributed CEP system which combines two commonly used frameworks \u2026",

Especially for hospitals, the expectations regarding improved efficiency and effectiveness by the introduction of novel AI applications are huge. However, experiences with real-life AI use cases are still scarce. As a first step towards structuring and comparing such experiences, this paper is presenting a comparative approach from nine European hospitals and eleven different use cases with possible application areas and benefits of hospital AI technologies. This is structured as a current review and opinion article from a diverse range of researchers and health care professionals. This contributes to important improvement options also for pandemic crises challenges, e.g., the current COVID-19 situation. The expected advantages as well as challenges regarding data protection, privacy, or human acceptance are reported. Altogether, the diversity of application cases is a core characteristic of AI applications in hospitals, and this requires a specific approach for successful implementation in the health care sector. This can include specialized solutions for hospitals regarding human\u2013computer interaction, data management, and communication in AI implementation projects.",

Objects that \u201clive\u201d for long time intervals have large MBRs which introduce a lot of empty space. Clustering long intervals has been dealt in temporal databases by the use of partially persistent indices.

Here we formalize non-metric similarity functions based on the Longest Common Subsequence that are very robust to noise. Furthermore they provide an intuitive notion of similarity between time-series by giving more weight to the similar portions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences in time is allowed, as well as global translating of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided.

Our mechanism is efficient since it is bounded by the number of neighbors and scalable because no global knowledge is required to be maintained.ISM consists of four components: A Profiling Structure which logs queryhit messages coming from neighbors, a Query Similarity function which calculates the similarity queries to a new query, RelevanceRank which is an online neighbor ranking function and a Search \u2026",

We show that SES is strongly NP-hard, even in highly restricted instances. To cope with the hardness of the SES problem we design a greedy approximation algorithm.

Furthermore, user defined rules are static so changes in the monitored environment cannot be easily detected. In this paper we investigate the development of a scalable and dynamic traffic management system. Our work makes several contributions: We propose a novel system that combines Esper with a stream processing framework, Storm, in order to parallelize the processing of larger amounts of data. We propose a novel rules\u2019 assignment algorithm for distributing Esper rules to the available CEP engines, in a way that maximizes the overall system\u2019s throughput. Finally, our system adapts to changes of the environment by processing historical data via Hadoop and dynamically updating the Esper rules based on the generated results.

            "Abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) databases are becoming prevalent on the Internet for distribution and sharing of documents, applications, and other digital media. The problem of answering large-scale ad hoc analysis queries, for example, aggregation queries, on these databases poses unique challenges. Exact solutions can be time consuming and difficult to implement, given the distributed and dynamic nature of P2P databases. In this paper, we present novel sampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad hoc aggregation queries in such databases. Computing a high-quality random sample of the database efficiently in the P2P environment is complicated due to several factors: the data is distributed (usually in uneven quantities) across many peers, within each peer, the data is often highly correlated, and, moreover, even collecting a random sample of the peers is difficult to accomplish. To counter these \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Satisfying energy constraints while meeting performance requirements is a primary concern when a sensor network is being deployed. Many recent proposed techniques offer error bounding solutions for aggregate approximation but cannot guarantee energy spending. Inversely, our goal is to bound the energy consumption while minimizing the approximation error. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, region sampling, for computing approximate aggregates while satisfying a pre-defined energy budget. Our algorithm is distinguished by segmenting a sensor network into partitions of non-overlapping regions and performing sampling and local aggregation for each region. The sampling energy cost rate and sampling statistics are collected and analyzed to predict the optimal sampling plan. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data sets indicate that our approach is at a minimum of 10% more \u2026",

            "Abstract": "With advances in remote sensors, sensor networks, and proliferation of location sensing devices into common walks of lives and businesses, the generation of disparate, dynamic, and geographically distributed spatiotemporal data has exploded in recent years. Knowledge extracted from spatial and spatiotemporal data plays a critical role in our daily lives, whether it is to understand the human implications of global environmental changes, responding to natural disasters, or simply finding alternate routes in case of an emergency. However, unprecedented data growth is leading into a data-rich but information-poor environment as the rate at which the geospatial data being generated clearly exceeds our ability to organize and analyze it to extract useful patterns that are critical to the understanding of dynamically changing world in a timely manner. It is therefore, imperative that efficient and effective data mining techniques are needed for extracting useful information from these large heterogeneous and multi-modal datasets. However, traditional data mining techniques are ineffective, as they don\u00d5t incorporate idiosyncrasies of spatial domain, such as, spatial autocorrelation, spatial context, and spatial constraints. Recognizing the need for an international forum to disseminate research results and discuss the needs of the spatial and spatiotemporal data mining community, the SSTDM series of workshops were started in 2006 as satellite event with IEEE ICDM.Initial workshops (SSTDM/ICDM-06, SSTDM/ICDM-07, STDM/ICDE-07) have mostly focused on algorithmic aspects of SSTDM on vector data types.

            "Abstract": "The emergence of the field of data mining in the last decade has sparked an increasing interest in clustering of tiate series. Although there has been much research on clustering in general, most classic machine learning and data mining algorithms do not work well for time series due to their unique structure. In particular, the high dimensionaliF, very high feature correlation, and the (typically) large amount of noise that characterize time series data present a difficult challenge. In this work we address these challenges by introducing a novel anytiate version of k-Means clustering algorithm for time series. The algorithm works by leveraging off the multi-resolution property of wavelets. In particular, an initial clustering is perforated with a very coarse resolution representation of the data. The results obtained from this\" quick and dirty\" clustering are used to initialize a clustering at a slightly finer level of approximation. This process is repeated until the clustering results stabilize or until the\" approxiatation\" is the raw data. In addition to casting k-Means as an anytime algorithm, our approach has two other very unintuitive properties. The quality of the clustering is often better than the batch algorithm, and even if the algorithm is run to coatpletion, the time taken is typically much less than the time taken by the original algorithm. We explain, and eatpirically demonstrate these surprising and desirable properties with coatprehensive experiatents on several publicly available real data sets.",

            "Abstract": "Top-k dominating queries combine the natural idea of selecting the k best items with a comprehensive \u201cgoodness\u201d criterion based on dominance. A point p1 dominates p2 if p1 is as good as p2 in all attributes and is strictly better in at least one. Existing works address the problem in settings where data objects are multidimensional points. However, there are domains where we only have access to the distance between two objects. In cases like these, attributes reflect distances from a set of input objects and are dynamically generated as the input objects change. Consequently, prior works from the literature can not be applied, despite the fact that the dominance relation is still meaningful and valid. For this reason, in this work, we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries over distance-based dynamic asttribute vectors, defined over a metric space. We propose four progressive algorithms that utilize the properties of the underlying metric space to efficiently solve the problem, and present an extensive, comparative evaluation on both synthetic and real world data sets.",

            "Abstract": "Micro-blogging services such as Twitter have gained enormous popularity over the last few years leading to massive volumes of user generated content. A portion of this content is shared via geo-aware mobile devices, such as smartphones. Pieces of information shared on such a device can be tagged with the user\u05f3s location, conditional on the user\u05f3s settings. These geostamps enable a number of mainstream applications, such as emergency response, disease tracking, news reporting, and advertising. Unfortunately, informative geostamps are typically sparse, since content is often shared via devices that do not support geo-tagging, such as desktop or laptop computers. In addition, even if a mobile device is used, a flawed geo-location service can lead to missing geostamps, or geostamps that are too general to be informative. In this work, we address this sparsity issue via a new approach that identifies users \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The problem of obtaining efficient answers to top-k queries has attracted a lot of research attention. Several algorithms and numerous variants of the top-k retrieval problem have been introduced in recent years. The general form of this problem requests the k highest ranked values from a relation, using monotone combining functions on (a subset of) its attributes. In this paper we explore space performance tradeoffs related to this problem. In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries. We then address the problem of identifying the most promising (in terms of performance) views to use for query answering in the presence of a collection of views. We formalize both problems and present efficient algorithms for their solution. We also discuss several extensions of the basic problems in this setting.We present the results of a thorough experimental study that deploys our techniques on real and synthetic data sets. Our results indicate that the techniques proposed herein comprise a robust solution to the problem of top-k query answering using views, gracefully exploring the space versus performance tradeoffs in the context of top-k query answering.",

IMR is an important metric not only because it provides information about infant births in an area, but it also measures the general societal health status. In the United States of America, the IMR is higher than many other developed countries, despite the high level of prosperity. It is important to note here that the USA exhibits strong and persistent inequalities in the IMR across different racial and ethnic groups (Kochanek et al. in Natl Vital Stat Rep 65 (4): 1\u2013122, 2006). In this paper, we study predictive models in the problem of infant mortality. We implement traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art neural network models with various combinations of features extracted from birth certificates. Those combinations include features that can be summed as socio-economic \u2026",

Smart Trace, relies on an in-situ data storage model, where geo-location data is recorded locally on smart phones for both performance and data-disclosure reasons. Smart Trace then deploys an efficient top-K query processing algorithm that exploits distributed trajectory similarity measures, resilient to spatial and temporal noise, in order to derive the most relevant answers to Q quickly and efficiently.

The queries of interest are range queries of the form, \"find the objects that appear in area S between frames f/sub i/ and f/sub j//sup \"/ as well as nearest neighbor queries such as, \"find the q nearest objects to a given position A between frames f/sub i/ and f/sub j//sup \"/. The straightforward approach to index such objects considers the frame sequence as another dimension and uses a 3D access method (such as an R-Tree or its variants). This, however, assigns long \"lifetime\" intervals to objects that appear through many consecutive frames. Long intervals are difficult to cluster \u2026",

We introduce an algorithm that discovers clusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions via local weightings of features. This approach avoids the risk of loss of information encountered in global dimensionality reduction techniques. Our method associates to each cluster a weight vector, whose values capture the relevance of features within the corresponding cluster.

Our algorithm works as follows: first, the codebook is obtained through a LVQ (learning vector quantization), which adjusts the codebook to be nearer to the optimal codebook. Second, ALVQ compresses the codebook update data pieces and transfers the compressed information to the base station. Using 2-level piece-wise regression, ALVQ can compress the updates with high precision while saving more bandwidth for data transmission in \u2026",

We formally define a new class of density-based queries and give approximate, on-line techniques that answer them efficiently.

The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact that the spatial and temporal predicates are not specified by the query.

Our study focuses on multi-hop distributed networks in which the data is accessible by traversing a network of nodes. Such a setting captures very well the computation framework of emerging Sensor Networks, Peer-to-Peer Networks and Vehicular Networks.

            "Abstract": "We propose an embedding-based framework for subsequence matching in time series databases that improves the efficiency of processing subsequence matching queries under the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure. This framework partially reduces subsequence matching to vector matching, using an embedding that maps each query sequence to a vector and each database time series into a sequence of vectors. The database embedding is computed off-line, as a preprocessing step. At runtime, given a query object, an embedding of that object is computed online. Relatively few areas of interest are efficiently identified in the database sequences by comparing the embedding of the query with the database vectors. Those areas of interest are then fully explored using the exact DTW-based subsequence matching algorithm. We apply the proposed framework to define two specific methods. The first method focuses on time series subsequence matching under unconstrained Dynamic Time Warping. The second method targets subsequence matching under constrained Dynamic Time Warping (cDTW), where warping paths are not allowed to stray too much off the diagonal. In our experiments, good trade-offs between retrieval accuracy and retrieval efficiency are obtained for both methods, and the results are competitive with respect to current state-of-the-art methods.",

Towards this goal, we suggest a novel propagation model, namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model, that effectively captures the way contradictory information, i.e., misinformation and credible information, propagates in the network. The DLT model considers the probability of a user alternating between competing beliefs, assisting in either the propagation of misinformation or credible news. Based \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to address classication problems. It relies on the assumption of locally constant class conditional probabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a nite number of examples due to the curse of dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under these conditions when using the nearest neighbor rule. The employment of a local adaptive metric becomes crucial in order to keep class conditional probabilities close to uniform, and therefore to minimize the bias of estimates. We propose a technique that computes a locally exible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The maximum margin boundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over the query's neighborhood. Such direction provides a local weighting scheme for input features. We present experimental evidence of classi cation performance improvement over the SVM algorithm alone and over a variety of adaptive learning schemes, by using both simulated and real data sets. Moreover, the proposed method has the important advantage of superior e ciency over the most competitive technique used in our experiments.",

Such information is collectively called the \u201cHidden Web\u201d and is mostly inaccessible by traditional search engine crawlers that scout the Web following links. Since the only way to access the Hidden Web pages is through the submission of queries to the Hidden Web sites, previous work [14, 18] has focused on how to automatically generate queries in order to incrementally retrieve and cover a Hidden Web site in depth, as much as possible.For certain applications however it is not necessary to have crawled a Hidden-Web site in-depth. For example, a metasearcher or a content aggregator will utilize only the top portion of the ranked result lists coming from the querying of a Hidden Web site instead of its full content. Hence, if we can crawl a Hidden Web site in breadth, ie download just the top results for all potential queries, we can enable such applications without the need for allocating resources for fully crawling a potentially huge Hidden Web site. In this paper we present algorithms for crawling a Hidden Web site by taking the ranking of the results into account. Since we do not know all potential queries that may be directed to the Web site in advance, we study how to approximate the site\u2019s ranking function so that we can compute the top results based on the data collected so far. We provide a framework for performing ranking-aware Hidden Web crawling and we show experimental results on a real Web site demonstrating the performance of our methods.",

This paper describes a Selective Bayesian classifier (SBC) that simply uses only those features that C4. 5 would use in its decision tree when learning a small example of a training set, a combination of the two different natures of classifiers. Experiments conducted on ten datasets indicate that SBC performs reliably better than NB on all domains, and SBC outperforms CA. 5 on many datasets of which C4. 5 outperform NB. Augmented Bayesian classifier (ABC) are also tested on the same data, and SBC appears to perform as well as ABC. SBC also can eliminate, on most cases, more than half of the original attributes, which can greatly reduce the size of the training and test data, as well as the running time. Further, the SBC algorithm typically learns faster than both C4. 5 and NB, needing fewer training examples to reach high accuracy of classification.",

For every story, it extracts a Knowledge Base (KB) using open information extraction techniques and utilizes this KB in order to build a summary for the user. News Monitor allows the users to query the article in natural language using the state-of-the-art framework BERT. Nevertheless, it allows the user to perform queries also in the KB in order to identify relevant articles. Finally, News Monitor crawls Twitter using a dynamic set of keywords in order to retrieve relevant messages. The framework is distributed, online and performs analysis in real-time.",

            "Abstract": "Micro-blogging services such as Twitter have gained enormous popularity over the last few years leading to massive volumes of user generated content. In combination with the proliferation of smart-phones, this information is generated live from a multitude of content contributors. Interestingly, the content and timestamp of tweets is not the only information that can produce useful knowledge. The location information of users is of great significance since it can be utilized in a variety of applications such as emergency identification, tracking the spread of a disease and advertising. Unfortunately, information regarding location is very rare since many users do not accurately specify their location, and fewer posts have geographic coordinates. In this work, we aim to confront this data sparsity issue. Utilizing Twitter\u2019s social graph and content, we are able to obtain users from a specific location. We optimize our method to work with minimum amount of queries considering the large volume of data in such settings. We also provide a mechanism for geo-locating a tweet within a city and present the qualitative enrichment in our data, achieved by our method.",

The distributed nature of peer-to-peer databases further complicates this issue by introducing an access overhead cost in addition to the cost of sending individual tuples over the network. We propose a two-level sampling approach focusing on peer-to-peer databases for maximizing sample quality given a user-defined communication budget. Given that individual peers may have varying cardinality we propose an algorithm for determining the optimal sample rate (the percentage of tuples to sample from a peer) for each peer. We do this by analyzing the variance of individual peers, ultimately minimizing the total variance of the entire sample. By performing local optimization of individual peer sample rates we maximize \u2026",

Systems should be able to cope with these challenges and adapt to dynamic and unpredictable load changes in real-time.

We show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only NP-hard to solve optimally, but also NP-hard to approximate. We also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-Effectors problem in networks.

Efficient processing of historical queries on spatiotemporal archives requires equally sophisticated indexing schemes. Typical spatiotemporal indexing techniques represent the objects using minimum bounding regions (MBR) extended with a temporal dimension, which are then indexed using traditional multidimensional index structures. However, rough MBR approximations introduce excessive overlap between index nodes, which deteriorates query performance.

Applications such as audio capture, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), image sensing, motion detection, feature extraction and cepstrum calculations generate raw data in much larger quantity than more mundane applications as temperature and humidity sensing. In-situ processing of data is an effective way to reduce the amount of information needed to be transmitted over the wireless links. The Co-S platform which we develop addresses this very crucial aspect of sensor network design. The Co-S integrated with a System on Chip (SoC) based host platform and a gigabyte scale energy efficient data storage system, simultaneously satisfies the constraints of low power consumption and a small form factor. As opposed to the Sense-and-Send approach which simply entails transmission of raw sensory data from the nodes, the proposed Sense-and-Store paradigm, builds upon the availability of the low power flash memories for storage of sensed data along with key query results (max, min, average, extracted harmonics) for transmission through the network. This approach not only reduces energy consumption (typically two orders of magnitude), of the sensing node in question, but also intuitively reduces network traffic load vis-\u00e0-vis complete deployment scenario.",

This leads to a classification problem with at least two classes: identical and not identical. Classifying pairs of records needs a three-step procedure. The first step is to define suitable common properties (attributes) of data for all different sources. Secondly, to allow comparisons the values of the records are transformed to these common properties. Finally, the classification is performed on an almost finite subset, the range of an appropriate comparison function.

Users constantly post snippets of information regarding their actions, interests or perception of their surroundings, which is why they have been attributed the term Live Web. Nevertheless, research on such platforms has been quite limited when it comes to identifying events, but is rapidly gaining ground. Event identification is a key step to news reporting, proactive or reactive crisis management at multiple scales, efficient resource allocation, etc. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically identifying events as they occur, in such a user-driven, fast paced and voluminous setting. We propose a novel and natural way to address the issue using notions from emotional theories, combined with spatiotemporal information and employ online event detection mechanisms to solve \u2026",

The proposed framework transforms vector data into a fully connected graph, or just works straight on the given graph data. User constraints are represented by electromagnetic fields that affect the weight of the graph\u2019s edges. A clustering algorithm is then applied on the adjusted graph, using k-distinct shortest paths as the distance measure. Our framework provides better accuracy compared to MPCK-Means, SS-Kernel-KMeans and Kmeans+Diagonal Metric even when very few constraints are used, significantly improves clustering performance on some datasets that other methods fail to partition successfully, and can cluster both vector and graph datasets. All these advantages are demonstrated through thorough experimental evaluation.",

The performance of NB suffers in domains that involve correlated features. C4.5 decision trees, on the other hand, typically perform better than the Naive Bayesian algorithm on such domains. This paper describes a Selective Bayesian classifier (SBC) that simply uses only those features that C4.5 would use in its decision tree when learning a small example of a training set, a combination of the two different natures of classifiers. Experiments conducted on ten data sets indicate that SBC performs markedly better than NB on all domains, and SBC outperforms C4.5 on many data sets of which C4.5 outperform NB. Augmented Bayesian classifier (ABC) is also tested on the same data, and SBC appears to perform as well as ABC. SBC also can eliminate, in most cases, more than half of the original attributes, which \u2026",

Data streams are characterised by their enormous size (potentially infinite), rapid arrival rate and their transient nature (in terms of data distributions). Since the data streams are open-ended by definition (ie, they have and infinite size as data keeps arriving), these operators would go into a perpetual wait state. Moreover, these conventional operators are designed to give the exact answers and always make a complete iteration over all the available data whenever they are invoked, hence, are extremely resource intensive, not in terms of time and space. In the context of stream mining, where resources are limited, the algorithms make a trade off of accuracy for efficiency. The answers provided by the streaming algorithms are approximation of the original answers (with error bounds).

            "Abstract": "Many modern applications require the evaluation of analytical queries on large amounts of data. Such queries entail joins and heavy aggregations that often include user-defined functions (UDFs). The most efficient way to process these specific type of queries is using tree execution plans. In this work, we develop an engine for analytical query processing and a suite of specialized techniques that collectively take advantage of the tree form of such plans. The engine executes these tree plans in an elastic IaaS cloud infrastructure and dynamically adapts by allocating and releasing pertinent resources based on the query workload monitored over a sliding time window. The engine offers its services for a fee according to service-level agreements (SLAs) associated with the incoming queries; its management of cloud resources aims at maximizing the profit after removing the costs of using these resources. We have fully implemented our algorithms in the Exareme dataflow processing system. We present an extensive evaluation that demonstrates that our approach is very efficient (exhibiting fast response times), elastic (successfully adjusting the cloud resources it uses as the engine continually adapts to query workload changes), and profitable (approximating very well the maximum difference between SLA-based income and cloud-based expenses).",

However, in many spatial and/or spatio-temporal applications objects have extent in various dimensions, while they can be located anywhere in the application space. The aggregation predicate is typically described by a multi-dimensional box (box-sum aggregation). We examine two variations of the problem. In the simple case an object's value contributes to the aggregation result as a whole as long as the object intersects the query box. More complex is the functional box-sum aggregation introduced in this paper, where objects participate in the aggregation proportionally to the size of their intersection with the query box.

It generates cluster descriptions in the form of DNF expressions that are minimized for ease of comprehension.

However, there are domains where we only have access to the distance between two objects. In cases like these, attributes reflect distances from a set of input objects and are dynamically generated as the input objects change. Consequently, prior works from the literature cannot be applied, despite the fact that the dominance relation is still meaningful and valid. For this reason, in this work, we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries over distance-based dynamic attribute vectors, defined over a metric space.

Both structures organize data and index pages on the flash media using a sorted by timestamp file organization.

During the past decade the growth of Internet has fundamentally changed the ways that information is shared, and it has made clear that efficient methods for searching and exploring vast amounts of data should be put forward. The largest challenges associated with information retrieval are synonymy and high dimensionality. An elegant and accurate technique to solve both problems has been presented in the form of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSI). However, its high computational cost makes it infeasible for large databases. Therefore other models such as random projection have been proposed. A suggestion for combining these two approaches has also been proposed. However, best to our knowledge, no empirical results have been presented on this \u201chybrid\u201d method. In this paper we evaluate and compare these three approaches and discover that the seemingly promising combination of LSI and random projection does not always result in faster running time as expected.",

            "Abstract": "Bridging data analysis techniques with classic query processing has long been of interest in the database community. Most approaches, however, are usually developed with a specific domain in mind, eg relational, streaming etc., use their own query language, or focus on specific techniques. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective, extension to standard or commonly used declarative processing languages to support data mining. Our approach is independent of a particular domain, and by utilizing a query refactoring technique, optimization issues are taken care of by the underlying query processing engine, which is already in place and knows best the setting\u2019s particularities. Therefore, our approach promotes ease of programmability, development, and use of the data mining techniques, with minimal modifications in the query processing stack. We demonstrate our technique through an experimental evaluation, using our prototype system SNEE-A, that runs in-network data analysis given a sensor network deployment, a setting with several critical constraints.",

This problem is very relevant for in-network query processing over WSN, where query routing trees are decomposed into three sub-components that must be processed at query time, namely operator tree, operator placement assignment scheme and routing scheme. In particular, the operator placement assignment defines on which node of the network each (query) operator will be hosted and executed. Hence, operator placement plays a key role in the context of query optimization issues in WSN research. In line with this main motivation, in this paper we present an optimal distributed algorithm to adapt the placement of a single operator in high communication cost networks, such as a wireless sensor network. Our parameter-free algorithm finds the optimal node to host the operator with minimum \u2026",

There is recently increasing recognition of this fact, and support for time series as a different data type in commercial data bases management systems is increasing.

Using this framework, a dynamic programming method is proposed, called SMBGT, that, given a short query sequence Q and a large database, identifies in quadratic time the subsequence of the database that best matches Q. SMBGT is highly applicable to music retrieval. However, in Query-By-Humming applications, runtime is critical. Hence, we propose a novel embedding-based approach, called ISMBGT, for speeding up search under SMBGT. Using a set of reference sequences, ISMBGT maps both Q and each position of each database sequence into vectors. The database vectors closest to the query vector are identified, and SMBGT is then applied between Q \u2026",

Such an operation generates the desired result without pulling together all the distributed subsequences over the fundamentally expensive communication medium.

However, previous research works tackle the problem from an efficiency standpoint, ie, returning the skyline as fast as possible, leaving it to the user to manually inspect the entire skyline result. Clearly, this is impractical, even with a few dozen points. The techniques addressing this issue are computationally expensive, mapping to NP-Hard problems or having exponential complexity O (2d) with respect to data dimensionality d. Moreover, the result is a set, lacking any quality-based ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel IR-style ranking mechanism for skyline points, based on the renowned tf-idf weighting scheme. We present efficient algorithms to compute the quality of a skyline point according to our technique, and induce a total ordering of the skyline set. Finally, we empirically evaluate the efficiency of our method with real-life and synthetic data sets.",

It is not meaningful to look for clusters in high dimensional spaces as the average density of points anywhere in input space is likely to be low. As a consequence, distance functions that equally use all input features may be ineffective. We introduce an algorithm that discovers clusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions via local weightings of features. This approach avoids the risk of loss of information encountered in global dimensionality reduction techniques. Our method associates to each cluster a weight vector, whose values give information of the degree of relevance of features for each set in the partition. We formally prove that our algorithm converges, and experimentally demonstrate the gain in perfomance we achieve with our method.",

In this paper we consider the following problem: given a table of d attributes whose domain is the real numbers, and a query that specifies a range in each dimension, find a good approximation of the number of records in the table that satisfy the query.We present a new histogram technique that is designed to approximate the density of multi-dimensional datasets with real attributes. Our technique finds buckets of variable size, and allows the buckets to overlap. Overlapping buckets allow more efficient approximation of the density. The size of the cells is based on the local density of the data. This technique leads to a faster and more compact approximation of the data distribution. We also show how to generalize kernel density estimators, and \u2026",

In this work we tackle the issue of uncertainty in transportation systems stream reporting. The variety of existing data sources opens new opportunities for testing the validity of sensor reports and self-adapting the recognition of complex events as a result. We report on the use of a logic-based event reasoning tool to identify regions of uncertainty within a stream and demonstrate our method with a real-world use-case from the city of Dublin. Our empirical analysis shows the feasibility of the approach when dealing with voluminous and highly uncertain streams.",

In addition, we use the mined burstiness information toward an efficient document-search engine: given a user's query of terms, our engine returns a ranked list of documents discussing influential events with a strong spatiotemporal impact.

All of the methods we describe use sequences of this form and can be applied to time series data generally.

Utilizing the best Fourier coefficients and the energy of the omitted components, we improve upon the state-of-the-art in time-series similarity matching.

However, it is currently not straightforward for a remote user to discover relevant sensor networks, and integrate them into applications on-the-fly (even if the sensor network is accessible via the Internet) due to the heterogeneity of their interfaces to the outside world, and the inability to resolve semantic inconsistencies between the data attributes collected by sensor networks. The potential exists, but currently cannot be exploited, for sensor networks to be added to ad-hoc, lightweight applications or mashups, possibly generated on-the-fly, that can underpin decision support, eg in a disaster response scenario.The Semantic Sensor Grid Rapid Application Development for Environmental Management project (SemSorGrid4Env) aims to respond to the challenges alluded to in the previous paragraph by developing techniques to enable sensor networks to be easily discoverable, integrated with each other, and also integrated with other types of data sources (eg a relational database with historical data); and enabling mashups to be developed, in an impromptu manner, that combine independent sensor networks and other types of data sources.

The main concern with data-centric storage in sensor networks is the ability to provide reliable and load balanced storage. Energy and wireless range constraints make centralized approaches for storage impractical, and in-network data-centric solutions can be used to reduce the number of messages sent over the network. However, these solutions quickly become expensive when combined with fault- tolerance, load balancing and routing. In this paper, we present a novel data-centric storage and query routing mechanism for sensor networks. The routing mechanism is constructed upon the neighborhood information of individual sensors and is completely independent of geographical information.

A key idea behind MicroHash is to eliminate expensive random access deletions. We have implemented MicroHash in nesC, the programming language of the TinyOS [7] operating system.

The problem of answering large scale, ad-hoc analysis queries \u2015 e.g., aggregation queries \u2015 on these databases poses unique challenges. Exact solutions can be time consuming and difficult to implement given the distributed and dynamic nature of peer-to-peer databases. In this paper we present novel sampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad-hoc aggregation queries in such databases. Computing a high-quality random sample of the database efficiently in the P2P environment is complicated due to several factors \u2015 the data is distributed (usually in uneven quantities) across many peers, within each peer the data is often highly correlated, and moreover, even collecting a random sample of the peers is difficult to accomplish.

The vast majority of the proposed approaches represent each value with approximately equal fidelity, which may not be always desirable. For example, mobile devices and real time sensors have brought home the need for representations that can approximate the data with fidelity proportional to its age. We call such time-decaying representations amnesic.In this work, we introduce a novel representation of time series that can represent arbitrary, user-specified time-decaying functions. We propose online algorithms for our representation, and discuss their properties. The algorithms we describe are designed to work on both the entire stream of data, or on a sliding window of the data stream. Finally, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation on\u00a3\u00a5\u00a4 datasets, and show that our approach can efficiently maintain a high quality amnesic approximation.",

To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel approach in selecting the k most diverse skyline points, ie, the ones that best capture the different aspects of both the skyline and the dataset they belong to. We present a novel formulation of diversification which, in contrast to previous proposals, is intuitive, because it is based solely on the domination relationships among points.

It is an important metric providing information about infant health but it also measures the society's general health status. Despite the high level of prosperity in the U.S.A., the country's IMR is higher than that of many other developed countries. Additionally, the U.S.A. exhibits persistent inequalities in the IMR across different racial and ethnic groups. In this paper, we study the infant mortality prediction using features extracted from birth certificates. We are interested in training classification models to decide whether an infant will survive or not. We focus on exploring and understanding the importance of features in subsets of the population; we compare models trained for individual races to general models.

            "Abstract": "Data-driven animation has become the industry standard for computer games and many animated movies and special effects. In particular, motion capture data recorded from live actors, is the most promising approach offered thus far for animating realistic human characters. However, the manipulation of such data for general use and re-use is not yet a solved problem. Many of the existing techniques dealing with editing motion rely on indexing for annotation, segmentation, and re-ordering of the data. Euclidean distance is inappropriate for solving these indexing problems because of the inherent variability found in human motion. The limitations of Euclidean distance stems from the fact that it is very sensitive to distortions in the time axis. A partial solution to this problem, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), aligns the time axis before calculating the Euclidean distance. However, DTW can only address the problem of local scaling. As we demonstrate in this paper, global or uniform scaling is just as important in the indexing of human motion. We propose a novel technique to speed up similarity search under uniform scaling, based on bounding envelopes. Our technique is intuitive and simple to implement. We describe algorithms that make use of this technique, we perform an experimental analysis with real datasets, and we evaluate it in the context of a motion capture processing system. The results demonstrate the utility of our approach, and show that we can achieve orders of magnitude of speedup over the brute force approach, the only alternative solution currently available.",

We assume that the database consists of sequences of events, where an event occurs during a time-interval. The goal is to mine arrangements of event intervals that appear frequently in the database. There are many applications where these type of patterns can be useful, including data network, scientific, and financial applications. Efficient methods to find frequent arrangements of temporal intervals using both breadth first and depth first search techniques are described. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and compared with other approaches on real datasets (American sign language streams and network data) and large synthetic datasets.",

The work performed in this project can be grouped into three areas of activities aiming at the following:Activity I: Our goal is to develop a geospatial knowledge management framework to provide the syntax, context, and semantics for researching, understanding, and leveraging technical and human behaviors related to spatial understanding. More specifically, we are developing a semantic framework for describing relationships between systems, people and data used to create geospatial information products. This includes the design of an agent-based representation of semantic interoperability and exchange between components within a geospatial framework, tools to support the extraction of meaning or interpretation of complex spatio-temporal datasets, and tools for spatial data mining of datasets with many attribute dimensions.",

Users constantly post snippets of information regarding their actions, interests or perception of their surroundings, which is why they have been attributed the term Live Web. Nevertheless, research on such platforms has been quite limited when it comes to identifying events, but is rapidly gaining ground. Event identification is a key step to news reporting, proactive or reactive crisis management at multiple scales, efficient resource allocation, etc. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically identifying events as they occur, in such a user-driven, fast paced and voluminous setting. We propose a novel and natural way to address the issue using notions from emotional theories, combined with spatiotemporal information and employ online event detection mechanisms to solve it at large scale in a distributed fashion. We present a modular framework that incorporates these ideas and allows monitoring of the Twitter stream in real time.",

We compare our simple distributed algorithm against previous work and a centralized solution and show that for most network layouts it outperforms competition and achieves tree balance very close to the centralized algorithm. It also has the smallest energy overhead possible to construct the tree, increasing the lifetime of the network even more.",

As more GPS probe data has been collected to monitor urban traffic, GPS trajectories of the probe vehicles have been frequently used to predict path travel time. However, most trajectory-based methods rely on deploying GPS devices and collect real-time data on a large taxi fleet, which can be expensive and unreliable in smaller cities. This work deals with the problem of predicting path travel time when only a small number of cars are available. We propose an algorithm that learns local congestion patterns of a compact set of frequently shared paths from historical data. Given a travel time prediction query, we identify the current congestion patterns around the query path from recent trajectories, then infer its travel time in the near future. Driver identities are also used in predicting personalized travel time \u2026",

The algorithm works by leveraging off the multi-resolution property of wavelets. The dilemma of choosing the initial centers is mitigated by initializing the centers at each approximation level, using the final centers returned by the coarser representations. In addition to casting the clustering algorithms as anytime algorithms, this approach has two other very desirable properties. By working at lower dimensionalities we can efficiently avoid local minima. Therefore, the quality of the clustering is usually better than the batch algorithm. In addition, even if the algorithm is run to completion, our approach is much faster than its batch counterpart. We explain, and empirically demonstrate these surprising and desirable properties with comprehensive experiments on several publicly available real data sets \u2026",

In this paper we investigate the use of dynamic clustering and sampling techniques that allow us to significantly reduce utilization costs by clustering low-level streams of events based on their geo-spatial locations and then selectively retrieving the ones that depict the highest interest. Our experimental results illustrate that our approach is practical, efficient and depicts good performance.",

            "Abstract": "Applications such as autonomous driving or real-time route recommendations require up-to-date and accurate digital maps. However, manually creating and updating such maps is too costly to meet the rising demands. As large collections of GPS trajectories become widely available, constructing and updating maps using such trajectory collections can greatly reduce the cost of such maps. Unfortunately, due to GPS noise and varying trajectory sampling rates, inferring maps from GPS trajectories can be very challenging. In this paper, we present a framework to create up-to-date maps with rich knowledge from GPS trajectory collections. Starting from an unstructured GPS point cloud, we discover road segments using novel graph-based clustering techniques with prior knowledge on road design. Based on road segments, we develop a scale-and orientation-invariant traj-SIFT feature to localize and recognize \u2026",

Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications, mobility experiments, video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) model, that offers enhanced robustness, particularly for noisy data, which are encountered very often in real world applications. However, our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well, including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance, and the increasingly popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).

The contribution of this work is two-fold: (i) we develop a scheme that automatically identifies the topic of a post, specifically tweets, in real-time without human participation in the process, and then (ii) based on the topic of the tweet and prior related posts, we recommend appropriate structural properties to increase the popularity of the particular tweet.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams.Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries. A thorough experimental study evaluates the efficiency of the proposed technique.",

The latter property allows us to answer queries about the recent past with greater precision, since in many domains recent information is more useful than older information.

Locational information is of great significance since it can be used to map information from the online back to the physical world, to contextualize information, or to provide localized recommendations through Location-Based Services (LBS), and can be extended to trajectories and itineraries by adding a time-dimension. Despite all that, location extraction in social networks usually relies on GPS-enabled devices, that provide accurate geodetic coordinates. Nevertheless, most users provide general textual information about their surroundings, such as the city they live in, county or state (or equivalents), without using a GPS-enabled device, which is still valuable information for a number of applications.

The simplest approach to tackle this problem is to assume that the attributes are independent. More accurate estimators try to capture the joint data distribution of the attributes. In databases, such estimators include the construction of multidimensional histograms, random sampling, or the wavelet transform. In statistics, kernel estimation techniques are being used.

This work deals with the problem of predicting path travel time when only a small number of GPS floating cars are available. We developed an algorithm that learns local congestion patterns of a compact set of frequently shared paths from historical data.

One or more editing operations on a given motion are made to affect all similar matching motions. This general approach is applied to standard mocap editing operations such as timewarping, filtering or motion-warping. The style of interaction lies between automation and complete user control.

The embedding is computed by applying full dynamic time warping between reference objects and each database time series.

Our parameter-free algorithm finds the optimal node to host the operator with minimum communication cost overhead. Three techniques, proposed here, make this feature possible: 1) identifying the special, and most frequent case, where no flooding is needed, otherwise 2) limitation of the neighborhood to be flooded and 3) variable speed flooding and eves-dropping. When no flooding is needed the communication cost overhead for adapting the operator placement is negligible. In addition, our algorithm does not require any extra communication cost while the query is executed. In our experiments we show that for the rest of cases our algorithm saves 30%-85% of the energy compared to previously proposed techniques. To our knowledge this is the first \u2026",

The availability of online data along with the business interest to keep up with consumer feedback generates a constant demand for online analysis of user-generated content. A key role to this task plays the utilization of domain-specific lexicons of opinion words that enables algorithms to classify short snippets of text into sentiment classes (positive, negative). This process is known as dictionary-based sentiment analysis. The related work tends to solve this lexicon identification problem by either exploiting a corpus and a thesaurus or by manually defining a set of patterns that will extract opinion words. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for discovering patterns that will extract domain-specific dictionary.

Our interest lies on the data acquisition and storage problems that arise in this setting. We identify certain key issues behind the development of a general framework for knowledge acquisition and data storage in geosensor networks, namely: spatiotemporal object modeling; similarity metrics to compare spatiotemporal objects; storing and indexing spatiotemporal objects in a geosensor network; and network \u2026",

That is, the user need not worry about where, when, or how data is gathered, they need only state their data needs. Work Package 2 (WP2) aims to support this vision by providing an implementation of the streaming data service through which users can pose declarative queries in SNEEql. It is also intended to enhance the querying capabilities through data analysis functionality being made available directly in the query.Sensor networks fall into two different categories. The first type of sensor network has fixed functionality with a stream of data being generated at a fixed rate. In order to query this stream of data, the stream must be processed outwith of the sensor network, called out-of-network evaluation. The second type of sensor network has the ability to respond to user requests for data by performing in-network query evaluation. This is where the functionality of the sensor network, ie when and where readings are taken, is controlled by the queries, and requires the placement of query processing code directly in the sensor network.",

The second, the Intelligent Search mechanism, uses the past behavior of the P2P network to further improve the scalability of the search procedure. In this algorithm, each peer autonomously decides which of its peers are most likely to answer a given query.

Such systems can provide significant benefits particularly during crisis management and emergency situations. However, not only querying users can be extremely costly but also human sensors are mobile, subjective and their response delays can highly vary. In this paper we develop a social sensing system that performs sampling on mobile social sensors to achieve accurate and real-time detection of the state of emergency events. Our contributions are two-fold:(i) our approach can capture well emergencies even in large geographical regions, and (ii) our sampling approach considers the individual characteristics of the social sensors to maximize the probability of receiving accurate responses in a timely manner. We provide comprehensive experiments that indicate that our approach accurately identifies critical real-world events, has low overhead and reduces the classification error up to 90% compared to traditional approaches.",

TJA uses a non-uniform threshold on the queried attribute in order to minimize the number of tuples that have to be transferred towards the querying node. Additionally, TJA resolves queries in the network rather than in a centralized fashion, which minimizes even more the consumption of bandwidth and delay.

The performance of NB suffers in domains that involve correlated features. C4. 5 decision trees, on the other hand, typically perform better than the Naive Bayesian algorithm on such domains. This paper describes a Selective Bayesian classifier (SBC) that simply uses only those features that C4. 5 would use in its decision tree when learning a small example of a training set, a combination of the two different natures of classifiers. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets indicate that SBC performs reliably better than NB on all domains, and SBC outperforms C4. 5 on many datasets of which C4. 5 outperform NB. SBC also can eliminate, on most cases, more than half of the original attributes, which can greatly reduce the size of the training and test data, as well as the running time. Further, the SBC algorithm typically learns faster than both C4. 5 and NB, needing fewer training examples to reach high accuracy of classification. 1 Introduction Two of the most widely used and successful methods of classification are C4. 5 decision trees [9] and Naive Bayesian learning (NB)[2]. While C4. 5 constructs decision trees by using features to try and split the training set into positive and negative examples until it achieves high accuracy on the training set, NB represents each class with a probabilistic summary, and finds the most likely class for each example it is asked to classify.",

Data mining techniques have been applied to many real-life applications, and new applications continue to drive research in the area. To date, most data mining research considers relational and transactional data. Despite the importance and the proliferation of geospatial datasets, only recently has work appeared on mining spatial data. Examples of geospatial data include data that describe the evolution of natural phenomena, earth science data that describe spatiotemporal phenomena in the atmosphere, two-or three-dimensional sequences of images of geographical regions, or data that describe the location of individuals in the geographic space as a function of time. Typically, geospatial data contain geometric or topological information, in addition to new kinds of data such as environmental factors or data related to natural resource exploration [28, 15]. Such data represent a large proportion of the data that have been collected by various organizations. Observation systems, such as radar or satellites, can generate very large datasets. For example, the NASA Earth Observation System is expected to transmit 50GB of data per hour.Geospatial data (static or time-evolving) have important differences to OLAP data, general multidimensional data, traditional relational data, or transactional data. Geographical data represent an embedding to the Euclidean space, and therefore give distance information and topological information.

The constraints and the objective function are specified in terms of aggregate functions of relational attributes, and the parameter values identify the constants used in the aggregation constraints. Results indicate that the methodology is effective and can be deployed easily, utilizing index structures such as R \u2026",

The vast majority of research has concentrated on representations that are calculated in batch mode and represent each value with approximately equal fidelity. However, the increasing deployment of mobile devices and real time sensors has brought home the need for representations that can be incrementally updated, and can approximate the data with fidelity proportional to its age. The latter property allows us to answer queries about the recent past with greater precision, since in many domains recent information is more useful than older information. We call such representations amnesic. While there has been previous work on amnesic representations, the class of amnesic functions possible was dictated by the representation itself.

OLAP tools are used to summarize the measure attributes (eg, total sales) along a dimension hierarchy, and to characterize changes (eg, trends and anomalies) in a hierarchical summary over time. When thenumber of changes identified is large (eg, total sales in many stores differed from their expected values), a parsimonious explanation of the most significant changes is desirable. In this paper, we propose a natural model of parsimonious explanation, as a composition of node weights along the root-to-leaf paths in a dimension hierarchy, which permits changes to be aggregated with maximal generalization along the dimension hierarchy. We formalize this model of explaining changes in hierarchical summaries and investigate the problem of identifying optimally parsimonious \u2026",

The first one is the financial cost. Despite the abundance of information, it typically comes at a premium price, and only a fraction is provided free of charge. For example, Twitter, a predominant social media online service, grants researchers and practitioners free access to only a small proportion (1%) of its publicly available stream.

Such systems use specialized engines to find optimal means of transport between two geospatial endpoints to provide recommendations to citizens for short routes across the city. At the same time, alternative means of transportation, such as bike sharing systems, have enjoyed tremendous success since they offer a green and facile solution for daily commuters and tourists. However, one major challenge of the bike sharing systems is that the distribution of bikes among the stations can be quite uneven during rush hours or due to topography. This often results in shortage of bikes and increasing numbers of disappointed users.

Such transformations can reveal latent patterns and are very commonly used in datamining applications. However, when dealing with multidimensional time-series, which appear naturally in applications such as video-tracking, motion-capture etc, similar motion patterns can also be expressed at different orientations. It is therefore imperative to provide support for additional transformations, such as rotation. In this work, we transform the positional information of moving data, into a space that is translation, scale and rotation invariant. Our distance measure in the new space is able to detect elastic matches and can be efficiently lower bounded, thus being computationally tractable. The proposed methods are easy to \u2026",

In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach for completing traffic trajectories. Our method extracts a network of road junctions and estimates traffic flows across junctions.

We propose a locally adaptive nearest-neighbor classification method to try to minimize bias. We use a chi-squared distance analysis to compute a flexible metric for producing neighborhoods that are highly adaptive to query locations. Neighborhoods are elongated along less relevant feature dimensions and constricted along most influential ones. As a result, the class conditional probabilities are smoother in the modified neighborhoods, whereby better classification performance can be achieved.

            "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are emerging as a new computational platform consisting of small, low-power and inexpensive nodes used in a broad set of application areas including environmental monitoring, habitat monitoring and disaster recovery. Typically sensor nodes are deployed over a geographical area for the purpose of detecting, tracking and monitoring events of interest. Since sensor nodes are deployed in a large land region, the objective is to achieve complete coverage of the region, that is, every location in the region lies in the observation field of at least one sensor node. However the initial placement of sensors may not achieve this goal for various reasons: the number of original sensors may have been too low, the original placement may have been random (for example, sensors deployed from the air) leaving parts of the region uncovered, or, some of the sensors have malfunctioned, leaving coverage holes. In this paper we consider the coverage restoration problem in sensor networks. The goal is to find a minimal set of new sensors, and their locations, such that when they are added to an existing sensor field we can achieve complete coverage of the region under surveillance. The technique we propose is distributed, and minimizes the communication costs. The key idea of our technique is to use an efficient and yet very accurate representation of the uncovered area that uses techniques from discrepancy theory. By representing the uncovered area as a set of points, we can use efficient and simple algorithms for finding small sets of sensors to cover the uncovered areas. We partition the sensor network into cells, and run these \u2026",

We overcome these limitations, and at the same time make SVMs suitable for learning with data streams, by constructing incremental learning algorithms. We first introduce and compare different incremental learning techniques, and show that they are capable of producing performance results similar to the batch algorithm, and in some cases superior condensation properties. We then consider the problem of training SVMs using stream data. Our objective is to maintain an updated representation of recent batches of data. We apply incremental schemes to the problem and show that their accuracy is comparable to the batch algorithm.",

Our previous work was the first to study the spatiotemporal burstiness of terms. In this context, a burstiness pattern consists of both a timeframe and a set of streams, both of which need to be identified automatically.

Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications, mobility experiments, video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Such kind of data usually contain a great amount of noise, that makes all previously used metrics fail. Therefore, here we formalize non-metric similarity functions based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS), which are very robust to noise and furthermore provide an intuitive notion of similarity between trajectories by giving more weight to the similar portions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences in time is allowed, as well as global translating of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided \u2026",

Information spreads widely and rapidly in OSNs through the word-of-mouth effect. However, it is not uncommon for misinformation to propagate in the network. Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects, especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events. Therefore, it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation. Towards this goal, we suggest a novel propagation model, namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model, that effectively captures the way contradictory information, ie, misinformation and credible information, propagates in the network. The DLT model considers the probability of a user alternating between competing beliefs, assisting in either the propagation of misinformation or credible news \u2026",

Work Package 2 (WP2) aims to support this vision by providing an implementation of the streaming data service through which users can pose declarative queries in SNEEql. It is also intended to enhance the querying capabilities through data analysis functionality being made available directly in the query.Sensor networks fall into two different categories. The first type of sensor network has fixed functionality with a stream of data being generated at a fixed rate. In order to query this stream of data, the stream must be processed outwith of the sensor network, called out-of-network evaluation. The second type of sensor network has the ability to respond to user requests for data by performing in-network query evaluation. This is where the functionality of the sensor network, ie when and where readings are taken, is controlled by the queries, and requires the placement of query processing code directly in the sensor network.",

Spatial query execution has been extensively studied in the context of centralized spatial databases; however because of the energy and bandwidth limitation of sensor nodes these solutions are not directly applicable to the sensor network. In this paper we propose a scalable and distributed way of spatial query execution in sensor networks. We develop a distributed spatial index over the sensor nodes that is used in processing spatial queries in a distributed fashion. We evaluate the behavior of our approach and show that our mechanism provides an efficient and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Online Social Networks (OSNs) are widely utilized in viral marketing campaigns exploiting the word-of-mouth effect. Various propagation models have been proposed to describe the way cascades unfold in OSNs. Based on the existing propagation models, several studies address the problem of influence maximization, where the objective is to identify an appropriate subset of users to initiate the spread of a contagion. However, existing approaches ignore an important factor in the propagation process, i.e., the correlation of multiple contagions simultaneously cascading in the social network and how these affect the users' decisions regarding the adoption of a contagion. Although recent works look into either the competition or the complementarity among a pair of contagions, a uniform model that describes the propagation of multiple cascades with varying types and degrees of correlations is lacking.
