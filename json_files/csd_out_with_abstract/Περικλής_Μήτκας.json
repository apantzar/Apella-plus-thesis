            "Abstract": "Energy gives personal comfort to people, and is essential for the generation of commercial and societal wealth. Nevertheless, energy production and consumption place considerable pressures on the environment, such as the emission of green- house gases and air pollutants. They contribute to climate change, damage natural ecosystems and the man-made environment, and cause adverse effects to human health. Lately, novel market schemes emerge, such as the formation and operation of customer coalitions aiming to improve their market power through the pursuit of common benefits.  In this paper we present CASSANDRA, an open source 1 , expandable software platform for modelling the demand side of power systems, focusing on small scale consumers. The structural elements of the platform are a) the electrical installations (i.e. households, commercial stores, small industries etc.), b) the respective appliances installed, and c) the electrical consumption-related activities of the people residing in the installations.  CASSANDRA serves as a tool for simulation of real demand- side environments providing decision support for energy market stakeholders. The ultimate goal of the CASSANDRA simulation functionality is the identification of good practices that lead to energy efficiency, clustering electric energy consumers according to their consumption patterns, and the studying consumer change behaviour when presented with various demand response programs.",

Existing methods in the field of software engineering do not adequately address the unpredictable and complex nature of intelligent agents. We introduce a generic methodology for evaluating agent performance; the Agent Performance Evaluation (APE) methodology consists of representation tools, guidelines and techniques for organizing, categorizing and using metrics, measurements and aggregated characterizations of agent performance. The core of APE is the Metrics Representation Tree, a generic structure that enables efficient manipulation of evaluation-specific information. This paper provides a formal specification of the proposed methodology in Z notation and demonstrates how to apply it on an existing multi-agent system.",

Tunable generalization is possible based on non-linear (sigmoid) positive valuation functions; moreover, the FLR classifier can deal with missing data. Learning is carried out both incrementally and fast by computing disjunctions of join-lattice interval conjunctions, where a join-lattice interval conjunction corresponds to a hyperbox in RN. Our testbed in this work concerns the problem of estimating ambient ozone concentration from both meteorological and air-pollutant measurements. The results compare favorably with results obtained by C4.5 decision trees, fuzzy-ART as well as back-propagation neural networks. Novelties and advantages of classifier FLR are detailed extensively and in comparison with related work from the literature.",

Agent Academy is a framework under development, which uses data mining techniques for training intelligent agents. This framework generates software agents with an initial degree of intelligence and trains them to manipulate complex tasks. The agents, are further integrated into a simulation multi-agent environment capable of managing issues in a hazardous environment, as well as regulating the parameters of the safety management strategy to be deployed in order to control the hazards. The initially created agents take part in long agentto-agent transactions and their activities are formed into behavioural data, which are stored in a database. As soon as the amount of collected data increases sufficiently, a data mining process is initiated, in order to extract specific trends adapted by agents and improve their intelligence. The result of the overall procedure aims to improve the simulation environment of safety management. The communication of agents as well as the architectural characteristics of the simulation environment adheres to the set of specifications imposed by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA).",

Such systems are usually set up in order to serve environmental legislation needs and are tailored towards decision makers (for atmospheric quality problem abatement) and citizens (for early warning and information provision). The pluralism of forecasting methods that are available does not always lead to forecasting success, as the specific characteristics of each area of interest and the complicated, mostly chaotic relationships between air quality, meteorology, emissions and topography, limit the effectiveness of the methods used. On the other hand, the timescale of air quality problems dictate the usage of relatively \u201cfast\u201d methods, while the varying quality of input data calls for methods that have a low sensitivity in this factor and a high operational potential. For this reason, it is always interesting to perform a comparative study between various air quality forecasting methods and tools.

However, it is often difficult to obtain live music audience data to tackle this task. In this work, we investigate whether important venues can instead be inferred through social media data. Our approach consists of employing bipartite graph ranking algorithms to help discover important venues in artist-venue graphs mined from Facebook. We use both well-established algorithms, such as BiRank, and a modification of their common iterative scheme that avoids the impact of possibly erroneous heuristics to the ranking, which we call VenueRank. Resulting venue ranks are compared to those obtained from feature extraction for predicting the most listened artists and large listener increments in Spotify. This comparison yields high correlation between venue importance for listener prediction and bipartite graph ranking algorithms, with VenueRank found more robust against overfitting.",

In this context, quantitative data-driven decision support models are challenged by the difficulties in handling dynamic and uncertain features of real-world environmental systems. In addition, conditions for environmental management keep changing with time, demanding periodically updated decision support. These properties can be realized by learning from environmental data, using knowledge discovery techniques.

Inspired by previous research suggesting that the initialization phase of evolutionary algorithms may have a considerable impact on their convergence speed and the quality of the achieved solutions, we present an initialization method for the class of supervised Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) that extracts information about the structure of studied problems through a pre-training clustering phase and exploits this information by transforming it into rules suitable for the initialization of the learning process. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated through an extensive experimental phase, involving a variety of real-world classification \u2026",

The system is based on collecting information both from the environment and the behaviors of the acting agents and their related successes/failures to generate a body of data, stored in the Agent Use Repository, which is mined by the Data Miner module, in order to generate useful knowledge about the application domain. Knowledge extracted by the Data Miner is used by the Agent Training Module as to train new agents or to enhance the behavior of agents already running. In this paper the Agent Academy framework is introduced, and its overall architecture and functionality are presented. Training issues as well as agent ontologies are discussed. Finally, a scenario, which aims to provide environmental alerts to both individuals and public authorities, is described an AA-based use case.",

Word-of-mouth communication - the informal channels of daily interactions among friends, relatives, coworkers, neighbors, and acquaintances - plays a much more significant role in how consumer behavior is shaped, fashion is introduced, and product reputation is built. Macrolevel simulations that include this kind of social parameter are usually limited to generalized, often simplistic assumptions. In an effort to represent the phenomenon in a semantically coherent way and model it more realistically, we developed an influence-diffusion mechanism that follows agent-based social simulation primitives. The model is realized as a multiagent software platform, which we call Dawn (for distributed agents for water simulation).",

The biological action of proteins is traditionally identified by time consuming and expensive in-vitro experiments. However, recent developments in bioinformatics have enabled the use of computational tools and techniques towards this end [1]. Clustering algorithms [2], artificial neural networks [3], decision trees [4, 5] and statistical models [6] are few of the methods currently employed. Motifs that can be found in a protein chain have provided a higher level of abstraction to the problem, since protein properties are mainly defined by them. Motifs can be either patterns, which are short aminoacid chains with a specific order, or profiles, which are computational representations of multiple sequence alignments derived by the use of hidden Markov models.On the other hand, proteins can be assorted into families, each family \u2026",

Retraining aspires to improve agent intelligence/performance and can be applied periodically or on a needbased mode. Since there is no point in repeating the DM process on the same dataset, retraining requires either the existence of new application data (Case 1-Chapter 6)) the existence of new behavior data (Case 2-Chapter 7), or the application of an evolutionary DM technique (Case 3-Chapter 8).It is through retraining that we intent to show that certain DM techniques can be used to augment agent intelligence and therefore improve MAS overall performance. In this chapter we provide the formal retraining model for the four DM techniques presented and we appose a number of experimental results.",

In order to reduce the workload required and disengage environmental scientists from trivial tasks, as data transformation and reviewing, we developed an Agent-based Middleware for Environmental Information Management (AMEIM for short). Our approach, presented in this paper, utilizes software agents that undertake environmental data management tasks. Software agents in AMEIM are capable to fuse and preprocess environmental data. Taking under account the requirements of the application domain, AMEIM's core functionalities, the agent-based architecture and the platform developed in Java are detailed. The AMEIM system is fully customizable and follows an extendable architecture. Also, reasoning capabilities can be incorporated into AMEIM agents for supporting decision-support features.",

The root cause of these problems is the difficulty in modeling consumers' behavior, based on their everyday activities and personal comfort. If one were able to provide targeted incentives based on consumer profiles, the expected impact and market benefits would be significant.

For the evaluation of our agent, we compare its results with those of a random-acting agent and an agent that uses the SARSA RL algorithm.

Toward this goal, ASSIST provides the means for seamless integration and virtual unification of distributed and heterogeneous CxCa data repositories, and the underlying mechanisms to undertake the entire process of expressing and statistically evaluating medical hypotheses based on the collected data in order to generate medically important associations.

            "Abstract": "We present an integrated tool for preprocessing and analysis of genetic data through data mining. Our goal is the prediction of the functional behavior of proteins, a critical problem in functional genomics. During the last years, many programming approaches have been developed for the identification of short amino-acid chains, which are included in families of related proteins. These chains are called motifs and they are widely used for the prediction of the protein\u2019s behavior, since the latter is dependent on them. The idea to use data mining techniques stems from the sheer size of the problem. Since every protein consists of a specific number of motifs, some stronger than others, the identification of the properties of a protein requires the examination of immeasurable combinations. The presence or absence of stronger motifs affects the way in which a protein reacts. GenMiner is a preprocessing software tool that can receive data from three major protein databases and transform them in a form suitable for input to the WEKA data mining suite. A decision tree model was created using the derived training set and an efficiency test was conducted. Finally, the model was applied to unknown proteins. Our experiments have shown that the use of the decision tree model for mining protein data is an efficient and easy-to-implement solution, since it possesses a high degree of parameterization and therefore, it can be used in a plethora of cases.",

So far, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method for multiple sequence alignment has been proved competitive to the classical deterministic algorithms with respect to phylogenetic analysis; nevertheless, its stochastic nature does not help it cope with the existing dependence among the sequence elements. This paper deals with phylogenetic analysis of protein and gene data using multiple sequence alignments produced by fuzzy profile Hidden Markov Models. Fuzzy profile HMMs are a novel type of profile HMMs based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy integrals, which generalize the classical stochastic HMM by relaxing its independence assumptions. In this paper, alignments produced by the fuzzy HMM model are used in phylogenetic analysis of protein data, enhancing the quality of phylogenetic trees. The new methodology is implemented in HPV virus phylogenetic inference. The results of the analysis are compared against those obtained by the classical profile HMM model and depict the superiority of the fuzzy profile HMM in this field.",

In contrary with the previous works, which focus on air quality forecasting, this paper concentrates on near real time air quality assessment. Data uncertainty problems associated with environmental monitoring networks bring forth issues such as measurement validation and estimation of missing or erroneous values, which are critical for taking trustworthy decisions in a timely fashion. A remedy to these problems is proposed through knowledge discovery techniques. By employing classification techniques, an empirical approach is presented for supporting the decision making process involved in an environmental management system that monitors ambient air quality and triggers alerts when incidents occur. Specifically, exhaustive experiments with large, real world datasets have resulted to trustworthy predictive models, capable operational decision-making for measurement validation and estimation of missing or erroneous data. The outstanding performance of the induced predictive models signifies the added value of using data-driven approaches in operational air quality assessment.",

The first is that these robots are pre-programmed to perform specific tasks and usually their software is proprietary, thus not open to \"interventions\". The second is that even if their software is open source, low-cost robots usually lack sufficient resources such as CPU power or memory capabilities, thus forbidding advanced algorithms to be executed in-robot. Within the context of RAPP (Robotic Applications for Delivering Smart User Empowering Applications) we treat robots as platforms, where applications can be downloaded and automatically deployed. Furthermore, we propose and implement a novel multi-agent architecture, empowering robots to offload computations in entities denoted as Cloud Agents. This paper discusses the respective \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Scalable big data analysis frameworks are of paramount importance in the modern web society, which is characterized by a huge number of resources, including electronic text documents. Document clustering is an important field in text mining and is commonly used for document organization, browsing, summarization and classification. Hierarchical clustering methods construct a hierarchy structure that, combined with the produced clusters, can be useful in managing documents, thus making the browsing and navigation process easier and quicker, and providing only relevant information to the users\u2019 queries by leveraging the structure relationships. Nevertheless, the high computational cost and memory usage of baseline hierarchical clustering algorithms render them inappropriate for the vast number of documents that must be handled daily. In this paper, we propose a new scalable hierarchical clustering framework, which uses the frequency of the topics in the documents to overcome these limitations. Our work consists of a binary tree construction algorithm that creates a hierarchy of the documents using three metrics (Identity, Entropy, Bin Similarity), and a branch breaking algorithm which composes the final clusters by applying thresholds to each branch of the tree. The clustering algorithm is followed by a meta-clustering module which makes use of graph theory to obtain insights in the leaf clusters\u2019 connections. The feature vectors representing each document derive from topic modeling. At the implementation level, the clustering method has been dockerized in order to facilitate its deployment on cloud computing infrastructures. Finally, the \u2026",

The correlation between protein properties and their motifs is not always obvious, since more than one motifs can exist within a protein chain. Thus, the behavior of a protein is a function of many motifs, where some overpower others. In this paper a data-mining approach for motif-based classification of proteins is presented. A new classification rules inducing algorithm that exploits finite state automata is introduced. First, data are modeled by terms of prefix tree acceptors, which are later merged into finite state automata. Finally, we propose a new algorithm for the induction of protein classification rules from finite state automata. The data-mining model is trained and tested using various protein and protein class subsets, as well as the whole dataset of known proteins and protein classes. Results indicate the efficiency of our technique compared to other known data-mining algorithms.",

Following the more successful paradigm of artificial societies, coupled with multi-agent systems and other Artificial Intelligence primitives, and extending previous epidemiological research work, we have developed GeneCity: an extended agent community, where agents live and interact under the veil of a hereditary epidemic. The members of the community, which can be either healthy, carriers of a trait, or patients, exhibit a number of human-like social (and medical) characteristics: wealth, acceptance and influence, fear and knowledge, phenotype and reproduction ability. GeneCity provides a highly-configurable interface for simulating social environments and the way they are affected with the appearance of a hereditary disease, either Autosome or X-linked.

Ecology, environmental engineering and natural resource management comprise an excellent real-world testbed for IT system demonstration, while raising new challenges for computer science. Complexity, uncertainty and scaling issues of natural systems form a demanding application domain for sensor networks and earth observation systems; modelling, simulation and scientific workflows, data management and reporting, decision support and intelligent systems, distributed computing environments, geographical information systems, heterogeneous systems integration, software engineering, accounting systems and control systems. This books offers a collection of papers presented at the 4th International Symposium on Environmental Engineering, held in May 2009, in Thessaloniki, Greece. Recent success stories in ecoinformatics, promising ideas and new challenges are discussed among computer scientists, environmental engineers, economists and social scientists, demonstrating new paradigms for problem solving and decision making.",

            "Abstract": "In the field of sustainable development, the management of common-pool resources is an issue of major importance. Several models that attempt to address the problem can be found in the literature, especially in the case of irrigation management. In fact, the latter task represents a great challenge for researchers and decision makers, as it has to cope with various water-related activities and conflicting user perspectives within a specified geographic area. Simulation models, and particularly Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS), can facilitate overcoming these limitations: their inherent ability of integrating ecological and socio-economic dimensions, allows their effective use as tools for evaluating the possible effects of different management plans, as well as for communicating with stakeholders. This great potential has already been recognized in the irrigation management sector, where a great number of test cases have already adopted the modelling paradigm of multi-agent simulation. Our current study of agent-based models for irrigation management draws some interesting conclusions, regarding the geographic and representation scale of the reviewed models, as well as the degree of stakeholder involvement in the various development phases. Overall, we argue that ABMS tools have a great potential in representing dynamic processes in integrated assessment tools for irrigation management. Such tools, when effectively capturing social interactions and coupling them with environmental and economical models, can promote active involvement of interested parties and produce sustainable and approvable solutions to irrigation \u2026",

Once an agent has been designed within the framework, the agent developer can create a specific ontology that describes the historical data. In this way, agents become capable of having embedded rule-based reasoning. We call this procedure \u201cagent training\u201d and it is realized by the application of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques on the application-specific historical data. From this point of view, Agent Academy provides a tool for both creating multi-agent systems and embedding rule-based decision structures into one or more of the participating agents.",

            "Abstract": "In the recent years, we have witnessed the rapid adoption of social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, and their use as part of the everyday life of billions of people worldwide. Given the habit of people to use these platforms to share thoughts, daily activities and experiences it is not surprising that the amount of user generated content has reached unprecedented levels, with a substantial part of that content being related to real-world events, i.e. actions or occurrences taking place at a certain time and location. Given the key role of events in our life, the task of annotating and organizing social media content around them is of crucial importance for ensuring real-time and future access to multimedia content about an event of interest. In this chapter, we present several research efforts from recent years that tackle two main problems: a) event detection and b) event-based media retrieval and summarization. Given archived collections or live streams of social media items, the purpose of event detection methods is to identify previously unknown events in the form of sets of items that describe them. In general, the events could be of any type, but there are also approaches aiming at events of specific type. Given a target event the goal of event summarization is first to identify relevant content and then to represent it in a concise way, selecting the most appealing and representative content.",

A new classification algorithm that induces rules and exploits finite state automata is introduced. First, data are modeled by terms of prefix tree acceptors, which are later merged into finite state automata. Finally, a new algorithm is proposed, for the induction of protein classification rules from finite state automata.

            "Abstract": "The recent advent of Cloud Computing, inevitably gave rise to Cloud Robotics. Whilst the field is arguably still in its infancy, great promise is shown regarding the problem of limited computational power in Robotics. This is the most evident advantage of Cloud Robotics, but, other much more significant yet subtle advantages can now be identified. Moving away from traditional Robotics, and approaching Cloud Robotics through the prism of distributed systems or Swarm Intelligence offers quite an interesting composure; physical robots deployed across different areas, may delegate tasks to higher intelligence agents residing in the cloud. This design has certain distinct attributes, similar with the organisation of a Hive or bee colony. Such a parallelism is crucial for the foundations set hereinafter, as they express through the hive design, a new scheme of distributed robotic architectures. Delegation of agent intelligence, from the physical robot swarms to the cloud controllers, creates a unique type of Hive Intelligence, where the controllers residing in the cloud, may act as the brain of a ubiquitous group of robots, whilst the robots themselves act as proxies for the Hive Intelligence. The sensors of the hive system providing the input and output are the robots, yet the information processing may take place collectively, individually or on a central hub, thus offering the advantages of a hybrid swarm and cloud controller. The realisation that radical robotic architectures can be created and implemented with current Artificial Intelligence models, raises interesting questions, such as if robots belonging to a hive, can perform tasks and procedures better or faster \u2026",

The 3-D surface of the mesh is firstly divided into a number of discrete continuous regions, each of which is successively sampled and mapped onto oblate spheroids, using a novel surface parameterization scheme. The embedding is performed in the spheroidal harmonic coefficients of the spheroids, using a novel embedding scheme. Changes made to the transform domain are then reversed back to the spatial domain, thus forming the watermarked 3-D mesh. The embedding scheme presented herein resembles, in principal, the ones using the multiplicative embedding rule (inherently providing high imperceptibility). The watermark detection is blind and by far more powerful than the various correlators typically incorporated by multiplicative schemes.

            "Abstract": "Phylogenetic profiles express the presence or absence of genes and their homologs across a number of reference genomes. They have emerged as an elegant representation framework for comparative genomics and have been used for the genome-wide inference and discovery of functionally linked genes or metabolic pathways. As the number of reference genomes grows, there is an acute need for faster and more accurate methods for phylogenetic profile analysis with increased performance in speed and quality. We propose a novel, efficient method for the detection of genomic idiosyncrasies, i.e. sets of genes found in a specific genome with peculiar phylogenetic properties, such as intra-genome correlations or inter-genome relationships. Our algorithm is a four-step process where genome profiles are first defined as fuzzy vectors, then discretized to binary vectors, followed by a de-noising step, and finally a comparison step to generate intra- and inter-genome distances for each gene profile. The method is validated with a carefully selected benchmark set of five reference genomes, using a range of approaches regarding similarity metrics and pre-processing stages for noise reduction. We demonstrate that the fuzzy profile method consistently identifies the actual phylogenetic relationship and origin of the genes under consideration for the majority of the cases, while the detected outliers are found to be particular genes with peculiar phylogenetic patterns. The proposed method provides a time-efficient and highly scalable approach for phylogenetic stratification, with the detected groups of genes being either similar to their own genome \u2026",

In order to provide efficient solutions, the community is turning towards scalable approaches such as the utilization of cloud resources in addition to any existing local computational infrastructures. Although bioinformatics workflows are generally amenable to parallelization, the challenges involved are however not only computationally, but also data intensive. In this paper we propose a data management methodology for achieving parallelism in bioinformatics workflows, while simultaneously minimizing data-interdependent file transfers. We combine our methodology with a novel two-stage scheduling approach capable of performing load estimation and balancing across and within heterogeneous distributed computational resources. Beyond an exhaustive experimentation regime to validate the scalability and speed-up of our approach, we compare it against a state-of-the-art high performance computing framework and showcase its time and cost advantages.",

The T cell Receptor/Immunoglobulin Profiler (TRIP) tool offers the opportunity for an in-depth analysis based on the processing of the output files of the IMGT/HighV-Quest tool, a standard in NGS immunoprofiling, through a number of interoperable modules. These provide detailed information about antigen receptor gene rearrangements, including variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene usage, CDR3 amino acid and nucleotide composition and clonality of both T cell receptors (TR) and B cell receptor immunoglobulins (BcR IG), and characteristics of the somatic hypermutation within the BcR IG genes. TRIP is a web application implemented in R shiny. Two sets of experiments have been performed in order to evaluate the efficiency and performance of the TRIP tool. The first used a number of synthetic datasets, ranging from 250k to 1M sequences, and established the linear response time of the tool (about 6 h for 1M sequences processed through the entire BcR IG data pipeline). The reproducibility of the tool was tested comparing the results produced by the main TRIP workflow with the results from a previous pipeline used on the Galaxy platform. As expected, no significant differences were noted between the two tools; although the preselection process seems to be stricter within the TRIP pipeline, about 0.1% more rearrangements were filtered out, with no impact on the final results.

            "Abstract": "Knowledge extraction and acute forecasting are among the most challenging issues concerning the use of computational intelligence (CI) methods in real world applications. Both aspects are essential in cases where decision making is required, especially in domains directly related to the quality of life, like the quality of the atmospheric environment. In the present paper we emphasize on short term Air Quality (AQ) forecasting as a key constituent of every AQ management system, and we apply various CI methods and tools for assessing PMio concentration values. We report our experimental strategy and preliminary results that reveal interesting interrelations between AQ and various city operations, while performing satisfactory in predicting concentration values.",

            "Abstract": "Real-time systems can be defined as systems operating under specific timing constraints, either hard or soft ones. In principle, agent systems are considered inappropriate for such kinds of systems, due to the asynchronous nature of their communication protocols, which directly influences their temporal behavior. Nevertheless, multi-agent systems could be successfully employed for solving problems where failure to meet a deadline does not have serious consequences, given the existence of a fail-safe system mechanism. Current work focuses on the analysis of multi-agent systems behavior under such soft real-time constraints. To this end, ERMIS has been developed: an integrated framework that provides the agent developer with the ability to benchmark his/her own architecture and identify its limitations and its optimal timing behavior, under specific hardware/software constraints.

            "Abstract": "Supply Chain Management (SCM) has recently entered a new era, where the old-fashioned static, long-term relationships between involved actors are being replaced by new, dynamic negotiating schemas, established over virtual organizations and trading marketplaces. SCM environments now operate under strict policies that all interested parties (suppliers, manufacturers, customers) have to abide by, in order to participate. And, though such dynamic markets provide greater profit potential, they also conceal greater risks, since competition is tougher and request and demand may vary significantly in the quest for maximum benefit. The need for efficient SCM actors is thus implied, actors that may handle the deluge of (either complete or incomplete) information generated, perceive variations and exploit the full potential of the environments they inhabit. In this context, we introduce Mertacor, an agent that employs \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Changes in the natural environment affect our quality of life. Thus, government, industry, and the public call for integrated environmental management systems capable of supplying all parties with validated, accurate and timely information. The \u2018near real-time\u2019constraint reveals two critical problems in delivering such tasks: the low quality or absence of data, and the changing conditions over a long period. These problems are common in environmental monitoring networks and although harmless for off-line studies, they may be serious for near real-time systems. In this work, we discuss the problem space of near real-time reporting Environmental Management Systems and present a methodology for applying agent technology this area. The proposed methodology applies powerful tools from the IT sector, such as software agents and machine learning, and identifies the potential use for solving real-world problems. An experimental agent-based prototype developed for monitoring and assessing air-quality in near real time is presented. A community of software agents is assigned to monitor and validate measurements coming from several sensors, to assess air-quality, and, finally, to deliver air quality indicators and alarms to appropriate recipients, when needed, over the web. The architecture of the developed system is presented and the deployment of a real-world test case is demonstrated.",

            "Abstract": "The Meteorological Service of Cyprus operates a Doppler radar at the mountainous region of the island. Data-streams recorded by the radar are used for weather forecasting and, especially, for identifying oncoming precipitation incidents and issuing (potential) warnings. However, the continuous processing and evaluation of radar data requires significant efforts by the meteorologists, both for data processing, storage, and maintenance, as well as for data interpretation and visualization. To assist meteorologists and to automate a large part of these tasks, we have developed Abacus, a multi-agent system for managing radar data and providing decision support. Abacus' agents undertake data-management and visualization tasks, while they are also responsible for extracting statistical indicators and assessing current weather conditions. In addition, Abacus' agents can identify potentially hazardous incidents, disseminate preprocessed information over the web, and enable warning services are provided via email. In this paper, Abacus' agent architecture is detailed and agent communication for information diffusion is discussed. Focus is also given on the fully customizable logical rule-bases used for agent reasoning required in decision-support. The platform has been tested with real-world data from the Meteorological Service of Cyprus.",

International genetic evaluations computed by Interbull are based on the analysis of national genetic evaluation results.

The current method for data quality assurance is mainly determined by the consistency of consecutive evaluation results and is based on thorough statistical examination (Klei et al., 2002). In a separate project, national genetic evaluation programs are being tested on simulated datasets with known properties (T\u00e4ubert et al., 2002).Data-mining (DM) provides a different perspective on data quality control.

The ability of agents to estimate the next prices to be revealed in an auction, by applying forecasting, is a key element for efficient and successful bidding. In open outcry auctions, such as English and Dutch, information about bidders behavior is revealed at each round. This paper proposes a bid calculation function based on forecasting of the next price in English and Dutch auctions. The forecasting is based on two linear adaptive filters for stochastic estimation, whose parameters are calculated using a genetic algorithm. In order to test the efficiency of the two bidding methods and to benchmark the performance of the two filters, we conduct a set of experiments and present the results.",

Both the multiagent systems and the DM techniques are evolutionary. Interactions between the members of the system and the influence that some of them exert on others, play a significant role in the overall behavior of the system. We refer to such systems as agent communities, because the agents are faced with common problems (or goals), which they attempt to overcome (or reach) through either collaboration or competition.

            "Abstract": "The leap from decision support to autonomous systems has often raised a number of issues, namely system safety, soundness and security. Depending on the field of application, these issues can either be easily overcome or even hinder progress. In the case of Supply Chain Management (SCM), where system performance implies loss or profit, these issues are of high importance. SCM environments are often dy-namic markets providing incomplete information, therefore demanding intelligent solutions which can adhere to environment rules, perceive vari-ations, and act in order to achieve maximum revenue. Advancing on the way such autonomous solutions deal with the SCM process, we have built a robust, highly-adaptable and easily-configurable mechanism for efficiently dealing with all SCM facets, from material procurement and inventory management to goods production and shipment. Our agent has been crash-tested in one of the most challenging SCM environments, the trading agent competition SCM game and has proven capable of providing advanced SCM solutions on behalf of its owner. This paper introduces Mertacor and its main architectural primitives, provides an overview of the TAC SCM environment, and discusses Mertacor's performance.",

            "Abstract": "Lately there is a transition in water management: policy makers leave aside traditional methods focused on additional-supply policies and focus on water conservation using demand control methods. Water Agencies use water-pricing policies as an instrument for controlling residential water demand. However, design and evaluation of a water-pricing policy is a complex task, as economic, social and political constraints have to be incorporated. In order to support policy makers in their tasks, we developed DAWN, a software tool for evaluating water-pricing policies, implemented as a multi-agent system. DAWN simulates the residential water demand-supply chain and enables the design, creation, modification and execution of different scenarios. Software agents behave as water consumers, while econometric and social models are incorporated into them for estimating future consumptions. Scenarios and models can be parameterized through a friendly graphical user interface and software agents are instantiated at runtime. DAWN\u2019s main advantage is that it supports social interaction between consumers, which is activated using agent communication. Thus, variables affecting water consumption and associated with consumer\u2019s social behavior can be included into DAWN scenarios. In this paper, DAWN\u2019s agent architecture is detailed and agent communication using ontologies is discussed. Focus is given on the econometric and social simulation models used for agent reasoning. Finally, the platform developed is presented along with real-world results of its application at the region of Thessaloniki, Greece.",

            "Abstract": "The continuous expansion of Internet has enabled the development of a wide range of advanced digital services. Real-time data diffusion has eliminated processing bottlenecks and has led to fast, easy and no-cost communications. This primitive has been widely exploited in the process of job searching. Numerous systems have been developed offering job candidates with the opportunity to browse for vacancies, submit resumes, and even contact the most appealing of the employers. Although effective, most of these systems are characterized by their simplicity, acting more like an enhanced bulletin board, rather than an integrated, fully functional system. Even for the more advanced of these systems user interaction is obligatory, in order to couple job seekers with job providers, thus continuous supervising of the process is unavoidable. Advancing on the way primitive job recruitment techniques apply on Internet-based systems, and dealing with their lack of efficiency and interactivity, we have developed a robust software system that employs intelligent techniques for coupling candidates and jobs, according to the formers\u2019 skills and the latter\u2019s requirements. A thorough analysis of the system specifications has been conducted, and all issues concerning information retrieval and data filtering, coupling intelligence, storage, security, user interaction and ease-of-use have been integrated into one web-based job portal.",

Thus, one of the most characteristic agent features is its agency. In the rest of this book, the term agent is synonymous to a software agent. The difficulty in defining an agent arises from the fact that the various aspects of agency are weighted differently, with respect to the application domain at hand. Although, for example, agent learning is considered of pivotal importance in certain applications, for others it may be considered not only trivial, but even undesirable. Consequently, a number of definitions could be provided with respect to agent objectives.

Many experimental approaches exist, but few actually try to model the current behaviour of search engines, which is to crawl and refresh the sites they deem as important, much more frequently than others. BioCrawler mirrors this behaviour on the semantic web, by applying the learning strategies adopted in previous work on ecosystem simulation, called BioTope. BioCrawler employs the principles of BioTope\u2019s intelligent agents on the semantic web, learns which sites are rich in semantic content and which sites link to them and adjusts its crawling habits accordingly. In the end, it learns to behave much like the state of the art search engine crawlers do. However, BioCrawler reaches that behavior solely by exploiting on-page factors, rather \u2026",

Many workflow management systems (WMS) exist that undertake the task of scheduling workflows across distributed computational resources. In this work, we introduce a WMS that leverages machine learning to predict workflow task runtime and the probability of failure of task assignments to execution sites. The expected runtime of workflow tasks can be used to approximate the weight of the workflow graph branches in respect to the total workflow workload and the ability to anticipate task failures can discourage task assignments that are unlikely to succeed. We demonstrate that the proposed machine learning models can lead to significantly more informed scheduling decisions that minimize task failures and utilize execution sites more efficiently, thus leading to reduced workflow \u2026",

However, rule-based methods, and especially Learning Classifier Systems (LCS), for tackling such problems have only been sparsely studied. This is the motivation behind our current work that introduces a generalized multi-label rule format and uses it as a guide for further adapting the general Michigan-style LCS framework. The resulting LCS algorithm is thoroughly evaluated and found competitive to other state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods.",

HMMs are known to provide compelling performance among multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithms, yet their stochastic nature does not help them cope with the existing dependence among the sequence elements. Fuzzy HMMs are a novel type of HMMs based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy integrals which generalizes the classical stochastic HMM, by relaxing its independence assumptions. In this paper, the fuzzy HMM model for MSA is mathematically defined. New fuzzy algorithms are described for building and training fuzzy HMMs, as well as for their use in aligning multiple sequences. Fuzzy HMMs can also increase the model capability of aligning multiple sequences mainly in terms of computation time. Modeling the multiple sequence alignment procedure with fuzzy HMMs can yield a robust and time-effective solution that can be widely used in bioinformatics in various applications, such as protein classification, phylogenetic analysis and gene prediction, among others.",

From these proteins only a fraction has been experimentally analyzed in order to detect their structure and hence their function in the corresponding organism. The reason is that experimental determination of structure is labor-intensive and quite time-consuming. Therefore there is the need for automated tools that can classify new proteins to structural families. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of several algorithms that learn such classification models from data concerning patterns of proteins with known structure. In addition, several approaches that combine multiple learning algorithms to increase the accuracy of predictions are evaluated.

Most computational approaches are based on the similarity between sequences to infer gene function.

Phylogenetic profiles are vectors which indicate the presence or absence of a gene in other genomes.

In this paper, a multi-level clustering algorithm of phylogenetic profiles is presented, which aims to detect inter- and intra-genome gene clusters.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we redefine the concept of Conversation Web in the context of hyper-personalization. We argue that hyper-personalization in the WWW is only possible within a conversational web where websites and users continuously \u201cdiscuss\u201d(interact in any way). We present a modular system architecture for the conversational WWW, given that adapting to various user profiles and multivariate websites in terms of size and user traffic is necessary, especially in e-commerce. Obviously there cannot be a unique fit-to-all algorithm, but numerous complementary personalization algorithms and techniques are needed. In this context, we propose PRCW, a novel hybrid approach combining offline and online recommendations using RFMG, an extension of RFM modeling. We evaluate our approach against the results of a deep neural network in two datasets coming from different online retailers. Our evaluation indicates that a) the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-art methods in small-medium datasets and can improve performance in large datasets when combined with other methods, b) results can greatly vary in different datasets, depending on size and characteristics, thus locating the proper method for each dataset can be a rather complex task, and c) offline algorithms should be combined with online methods in order to get optimal results since offline algorithms tend to offer better performance but online algorithms are necessary for exploiting new users and trends that turn up.",

The presence of motifs in protein chains can make the prediction of the functional behavior of proteins possible. The correlation between protein properties and their motifs is not always obvious, since more than one motif may exist within a protein chain. Due to the complexity of this correlation most data mining algorithms are either non efficient or time consuming. In this paper a data mining methodology that utilizes grid technologies is presented. First, data are split into multiple sets while preserving the original data distribution in each set. Then, multiple models are created by using the data sets as independent training sets. Finally, the models are combined to produce the final classification rules, containing all the previously extracted information. The methodology is tested using various protein and protein class \u2026",

Water utility companies use water-pricing policies as an                 instrument for controlling residential water demand. To support policy makers in                 their decisions, the authors have developed DAWN, a hybrid model for evaluating                 water-pricing policies. DAWN integrates an agent-based social model for the consumer                 with conventional econometric models and simulates the residential water                 demand-supply chain, enabling the evaluation of different scenarios for policy                 making.

Environmental values are appreciated to a greater extent, as it has become evident that they are highly correlated with our quality of life. The aftermath of the growing societal interest in the environment and sustainable development was the emerging need for providing environmental information to the public. The challenge for Environmental Management and Assessment Information Systems is to provide efficient, accurate and timely electronic services to the public. In this work, we examine the applicability of software agent technology for automating the environmental quality assessment process. Software agents are best suited in systems that are modular, decentralized, changeable, ill-structured and complex, according to Van Dyke Parunak (1999). Environmental management and assessment systems are of this kind, and employing software agents to realize them makes possible the provision of advanced features. However, certain limitations may arise. Both advantages and limitations of agent-based applications for environmental monitoring and assessment systems are connected with real-world functionality. Environmental Management and Assessment Information Systems is a generic term that covers software systems responsible for 1. gathering environmental information from dissimilar data sources, 2. managing environmental data for supporting the decision making process involved in environmental assessment, and 3. post-processing data and facts for supplying citizens, industry, public institutions and government with information services related to the \u2026",

In this paper, we are using neuroevolution to evolve echo state networks on the source task and transfer the best performing reservoirs to be used as initial population on the target task. The idea is that any non-linear, temporal features, represented by the neurons of the reservoir and evolved on the source task, along with reservoir properties, will be a good starting point for a stochastic search on the target task. In a step towards full autonomy and by taking advantage of the random and fully connected nature of echo state networks, we examine a transfer method that renders any inter-task mappings of states and actions unnecessary.

Although sparsely studied in this context, Learning Classifier Systems are naturally well-suited to multi-label classification problems, whose search space typically involves multiple highly specific niches. This is the motivation behind our current work that introduces a generalized multi-label rule format -- allowing for flexible label-dependency modeling, with no need for explicit knowledge of which correlations to search for -- and uses it as a guide for further adapting the general Michigan-style supervised Learning Classifier System framework. The integration of the aforementioned rule format and framework adaptations results in a novel algorithm for multi-label classification whose behavior is studied through a set of properly defined artificial problems. The proposed algorithm is also thoroughly evaluated on a set of multi-label datasets and found competitive to other state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods.",

Formulating the process of rule induction for the latter task as a MMOP and inspired by corresponding findings in the field of function optimization, our current work proposes an evolutionary algorithm (EVADING) capable of discovering a set of accurate and diverse classification rules. The proposed algorithm uses a dynamic clustering technique as a parallel niching method to maintain rule population diversity and converge to the optimal rules for the attribute-space defined by the target dataset. To demonstrate its applicability and potential, EVADING is applied to a series of real-life classification problems and its prediction accuracy is compared to that of other popular non-evolutionary machine learning techniques. Results are encouraging, since EVADING manages to achieve the best overall average ranking and performs significantly better (at significance level a= 0.05) from three out of the eight rival algorithms used in this study. This work is concluded with some insights on the factors affecting the proposed algorithm\u2019s performance, along with the directions of our future research.",

This intersection leads to considerable advancements in the area of information technologies, drawing the increasing attention of both research and industrial communities. It can take two forms: a) the more mundane use of intelligent agents for improved data mining and; b) the use of data mining for smarter, more efficient agents. The second approach is the main focus of this volume. Knowledge, routinely created and maintained by today\u2019s applications, is hidden in voluminous data repositories that can be extracted by data mining. The next step is to transform this discovered knowledge into the inference mechanisms or simply the behavior of agents and multi-agent systems. AGENT INTELLIGENCE THROUGH DATA MINING addresses this issue, as well as the arguable challenge of generating intelligence from data while transferring it to a separate, possibly autonomous, software entity. Following a brief review of data mining and agent technology fields, this book presents a methodology for developing multi-agent systems, describes available open-source tools to support this process, and demonstrates the application of the methodology on three different cases. AGENT INTELLIGENCE THROUGH DATA MINING is designed for a professional audience composed of researchers and practitioners in industry.

            "Abstract": "Learning classifier systems (LCS) are machine learning systems designed to work for both multi-step and single-step decision tasks. The latter case presents an interesting challenge for such algorithms, especially when they are applied to real-world data mining (DM) problems. The present investigation departs from the popular approach of applying accuracy-based LCS to single-step classification and aims to uncover the potential of strength-based LCS in such tasks. Although the latter family of algorithms have often been associated with poor generalization and performance, we aim at alleviating these problems by defining appropriate extensions to the traditional strength-based LCS framework. These extensions are detailed and their effect on system performance is studied through the application of the proposed algorithm on a set of artificial problems, designed to challenge its scalability and generalization \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the era of Big Data in Life Sciences, efficient processing and analysis of vast amounts of sequence data is becoming an ever daunting challenge. Among such analyses, sequence alignment is one of the most commonly used procedures, as it provides useful insights on the functionality and relationship of the involved entities. Sequence alignment is one of the most common computational bottlenecks in several bioinformatics workflows. We have designed and implemented a time-efficient distributed modular application for sequence alignment, phylogenetic profiling and clustering of protein sequences, by utilizing the European Grid Infrastructure. The optimal utilization of the Grid with regards to the respective modules, allowed us to achieve significant speedups to the order of 1400%.",
