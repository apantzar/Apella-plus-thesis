            "Abstract": "Graph kernels have recently emerged as a promising approach for tackling the graph similarity and learning tasks at the same time. In this paper, we propose a general framework for designing graph kernels. The proposed framework capitalizes on the well-known message passing scheme on graphs. The kernels derived from the framework consist of two components. The first component is a kernel between vertices, while the second component is a kernel between graphs. The main idea behind the proposed framework is that the representations of the vertices are implicitly updated using an iterative procedure. Then, these representations serve as the building blocks of a kernel that compares pairs of graphs. We derive four instances of the proposed framework, and show through extensive experiments that these instances are competitive with state-of-the-art methods in various tasks.",

Typically, engagement refers to the degree that an individual participates (or is encouraged to participate) in a community and is closely related to the important property of nodes' departure dynamics, ie, the tendency of individuals to leave the community. In this paper, we build upon recent work in the field of game theory, where the behavior of individuals (nodes) is modeled by a technology adoption game. That is, the decision of a node to remain engaged in the graph is affected by the decision of its neighbors, and the\" best practice\" for each individual is captured by its core number-as arises from the k-core decomposition. After modeling and defining the engagement dynamics at node and graph level, we examine whether they depend on structural and \u2026",

The challenge was concerned with the analysis of a collection of administrative documents from the kingdom of the III Dynasty of Ur, which existed in the 21st century bC in Mesopotamia, located in present day southern Iraq. The water transport system of the era was very developed, undertaking a substantial part in the economic growth and development of the region. The task required that data mining techniques were applied on a collection of administrative documents, with the purpose of identifying and the dating the documents related to the water transport system. In the proposed solution, we have formulated the identification problem of the water transport-related documents as a semi-supervised clustering task. Our methodological approach was motivated by the fact that we could easily identify several documents that belonged in the water transport cluster, using simple keyword matching rules. These documents were consequently used as prior knowledge in the context of a 2-way semi-supervised clustering algorithm, where one cluster was defined as containing the water transport-related documents, while the other contained the rest of the documents. Concerning the document dating process, we have observed that the exact dating (defined through kingdom eras) could be extracted from the majority of the documents in the collection. This allowed us to train a Support Vector Machine and derive a document dating model that was consequently employed for dating the rest of the \u2026",

In this paper, we propose to replace the GCN encoder by a simple linear model w.r.t. the adjacency matrix of the graph. For the two aforementioned tasks, we empirically show that this approach consistently reaches competitive performances w.r.t. GCN-based models for numerous real-world graphs, including the widely used Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation networks that became the de facto benchmark datasets for evaluating graph AE and VAE.

Assuming each document is characterized by a sets of terms of an ontology, the similarity measure can compute a collective similarity between sets of terms seen as a whole, rather than between terms that would be independent.

Most existing methods for graph similarity focus either on local or on global properties of graphs. However, even if graphs seem very similar from a local or a global perspective, they may exhibit different structure at different scales. In this paper, we present a general framework for graph similarity which takes into account structure at multiple different scales. The proposed framework capitalizes on the wellknown k-core decomposition of graphs in order to build a hierarchy of nested subgraphs. We apply the framework to derive variants of four graph kernels, namely graphlet kernel, shortest-path kernel, Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel, and pyramid match graph kernel. The framework is not limited to graph kernels, but can be applied to any graph comparison algorithm. The proposed framework is evaluated on several benchmark datasets for graph classification. In most cases, the corebased kernels achieve significant improvements in terms of classification accuracy over the base kernels, while their time complexity remains very attractive.",

However, the lack of global knowledge in a vast and dynamically evolving environment like the Web presents a grand challenge for organizing content and providing efficient searching mechanisms. Semantic overlay networks (SONs) have been proposed as an approach to reduce cost and increase quality of results in unstructured P2P systems, and in this paper we present SOWES, an approach for distributed SON construction in unstructured P2P networks. Efficient searching strategies for web content based on the created semantic overlays are presented and the performance of our approach is evaluated through simulation experiments.",

Although the long and successful usage, bag-of-words ignores words' order and distance within the document--weakening thus the expressive power of the distance metrics. We propose graph-of-word, an alternative approach that capitalizes on a graph representation of documents and challenges the word independence assumption by taking into account words' order and distance. We applied graph-of-word in various tasks such as ad-hoc Information Retrieval, Single-Document Keyword Extraction, Text Categorization and Sub-event Detection in Textual Streams. In all cases the the graph of word approach, assisted by degeneracy at times, outperforms the state of the art base lines in \u2026",

Motivated by the recent criticism on diffusion models and the galloping advancements in influence learning, we propose IMINFECTOR (Influence Maximization with INFluencer vECTORs), a method that uses representations learned from diffusion cascades to perform model-independent influence maximization. The first part of our methodology is a multi-task neural network that learns embeddings of nodes that initiate cascades (influencer vectors) and embeddings of nodes that participate in them (susceptible vectors). The norm of an influencer vector captures a node's aptitude to initiate lengthy cascades and is used to reduce the number of candidate \u2026",

We show that taking into account edge directions greatly improves performance. We compare struc2vec++ against a recently proposed algorithm.

The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph problems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here, we focus on two such problems: influence estimation, a #P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We develop GLIE, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an upper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs. Experiments show that GLIE provides accurate influence estimation for real graphs up to 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly, it can be used for influence maximization on considerably larger graphs, as the predictions ranking is not effected by the drop of accuracy. We develop a version of Cost Effective Lazy Forward optimization with GLIE instead of simulated influence estimation, surpassing the benchmark for influence maximization, although with a computational overhead. To balance the time complexity and quality of influence, we propose two different approaches. The first is a Q-network that learns to choose seeds sequentially using GLIE's predictions. The second defines a provably submodular function based on GLIE's representations to rank nodes fast while building the seed set. The latter provides the best combination of time efficiency and influence spread, outperforming SOTA benchmarks.",

This paper describes the two medical information retrieval systems designed by the Athens University of Economics and Business for participation in the 2015 Clinical Decision Support track. The two systems share many common features. Both made use of bigrams along with unigrams for repesenting the documents. Both systems performed automatic query expansion using popular medical knowledge bases. However, the two systems employed different strategies to index the corpus which led to different retrieval methods. One utilized the vector space model with tf\u2212 idf term weighting, while the other the vector space model with tw\u2212 idf term weighting. The results showed that tf\u2212 idf outperformed tw\u2212 idf.",

In this paper, we propose a new novelty detection algorithm based on the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) scoring function.

Towards this end, in this paper, a novel distributed dimensionality reduction (DDR) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is compared with other effective centralized dimensionality reduction techniques and approximates the quality of FastMap, considered as one of the most effective algorithms, while its central execution outperforms FastMap.

In each semantic category peers are evaluated with regard to the quality of their services and products and are grouped into relevant quality categories. The advertising process starts at each semantic category of SON and at each quality category independently. The Ad-method is based on the combination of two reputation methods: the Eigentrust algorithm [10], and an incentive-based scheme [9]. Each peer has a dual role, act as advertiser (ie host advertisements on its web site) and as advertisee (\u201cpay\u201d for having an advertisement hosted).

Eigen-Clustering clusters the peers in quality categories (Low, Medium, High) according to their reputation in the market. The second version of EigenTrust, the Eigen-Test, is used periodically, evaluating the homogeneity of the quality categories. Similarly to",

In the eyes of privacy laws and directives, the set of personal data collected to achieve a service must be restricted to the minimum necessary. This reduces the impact of data breaches both in the interest of service providers and applicants. In this article, we study the problem of limiting data collection in those application forms, used to collect data and subsequently feed decision making processes. In practice, the set of data collected is far excessive because application forms are filled in without any means to know what data will really impact the decision. To overcome this problem, we propose a reverse approach, where the set of strictly required data items to fill in the application form can be computed on the user\u2019s side. We formalize the underlying NP Hard optimization problem, propose algorithms to compute a solution, and validate them with experiments.

Unfortunately, they cannot handle irregular data such as graphs. We address this challenge by using graph kernels to embed meaningful local neighborhoods of the graphs in a continuous vector space.

A graph kernel implicitly embedds graphs in a Hilbert space and computes the inner product between these representations. However, the inner product operation greatly limits the representational power of kernels between graphs. In this paper, we propose to perform a series of successive embeddings in order to improve the performance of existing graph kernels and derive more expressive kernels. We first embed the input graphs in a Hilbert space using a graph kernel and then we embed them into another space by employing popular kernels for vector data (eg, gaussian kernel). Our experiments on several datasets show that by composing kernels, we can achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy.",

For instance, identifying structurally equivalent nodes can provide insight into the structure of complex networks. Learning latent representations that capture such structural role information about nodes has recently gained a lot of attention. Existing techniques for learning such representations typically rely on manually engineered features or are very expensive in terms of time and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose SEGK, a powerful framework for computing structural node representations. SEGK learns node representations by generating (or approximating) and decomposing a kernel matrix that incorporates structural similarity between nodes. To compute the similarity between two nodes, the proposed framework builds on well-established concepts from graph mining. Specifically, it compares the neighborhood \u2026",

From the early days of the pandemic, it became clear that it is highly contagious and that human mobility contributes significantly to its spread. In this paper, we utilize graph representation learning to capitalize on the underlying relationship of population movement with the spread of COVID-19. Specifically, we create a graph where the nodes correspond to a country\u2019s regions, the features include the region\u2019s history of COVID-19, and the edge weights denote human mobility from one region to another. Subsequently, we employ graph neural networks to predict the number of future cases, encoding the underlying diffusion patterns that govern the spread into our learning model. Furthermore, to account for the limited amount of training data, we capitalize on the pandemic\u2019s asynchronous outbreaks across countries and use a model-agnostic meta-learning based method to transfer knowledge from one country\u2019s model to another\u2019s. We compare the proposed approach against simple baselines and more traditional forecasting techniques in 4 European countries. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the usefulness of GNNs in epidemiological prediction. Transfer learning provides the best model, highlighting its potential to improve the accuracy of the predictions in case of secondary waves, given data from past/parallel outbreaks.",

In this study, we introduce and examine different models for estimating the probability of a user converting, given their history of visited URLs. Inspired by natural language processing, we introduce three URL embedding models to compute semantically meaningful URL representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the different proposed representation and conversion prediction models, we have conducted experiments on real logged events collected from an advertising platform.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we analyze and describe the approach undertaken by the DB-NET research group for addressing the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 1. The Discovery Challenge was concerned with the construction of predictive models regarding several features of a user\u2019s browsing behavior. The training data consisted of attributes that described the users\u2019 browsing behavior (such as timestamp of visit and category-view paths) as well as information concerning their social and demographic profile (such as country, city, browser and operating system). The challenge that we faced in addressing this task, was the fact that the data resources, that could be employed for deriving the user behavior models, were heterogeneous. More precisely, for each user one could build predictive models based solely upon his personal browsing behavior, or incorporate features that described his social and demographic profile. In order to address this issue in a principled manner we have employed Stacking. Stacking was based on seven level-0 classifiers built upon seven heterogeneous datasets (constructed by the available training data). Consequently, for producing the user-specific models, we have compared the cross-validated accuracy of each level-0 and the level-1 classifiers (for each user), and finally selected the one that exhibited the highest accuracy estimate. The level-0 and level-1 classifiers were chosen after thorough experimentation to be C4 and Logistic Regression respectively. Apart from a detailed description and a discussion of the submitted model (which was solely for task 1 of the challenge), this paper contains our preliminary \u2026",

As mobile devices keep getting smaller, cheaper and more sophisticated, their use is becoming a commodity. We envision future scenarios that involve mobile devices acting not only as requestors, but as providers of data as well. In order to hide the heterogeneous nature of web data, service-oriented architectures are adopted. Nevertheless, existing service discovery mechanisms usually focus on exact or semantic matching of static attributes, thus ignoring contextual parameters. We argue that context for mobile web services plays an important role in service discovery by increasing the precision and effectiveness of the search. We explain our notion of context regarding web services, describe query evaluation and updates in a context-aware service directory, and show how the management of device profiles is exploited. Our prototype is fully implemented, as part of the MobiShare architecture, thus proving the feasibility of our approach as well as demonstrating its advantages.",

A particularly important point, which is rarely taken into account while developing community detection algorithms, is their sensitivity (or stability) to network uncertainty. In many cases, the input graph data is incomplete or noisy (e.g., due to noise introduced during the collection of the data or for privacy preserving reasons). Then, the following question arises: how stable are the results produced by an algorithm with respect to the uncertainty (i.e., noise level) of the input data? In this paper, we propose a quantitative way to address this problem. We have considered several graph perturbation models to introduce uncertainty to the graph. Then, we examine the sensitivity of an algorithm, with respect to functional and structural characteristics of the detected \u2026",

We propose a novel method to estimate polysemy, based on simple geometry in the contextual embedding space. Our approach is fully unsupervised and purely data-driven. We show through rigorous experiments that our rankings are well correlated (with strong statistical significance) with 6 different rankings derived from famous human-constructed resources such as WordNet, OntoNotes, Oxford, Wikipedia etc., for 6 different standard metrics. We also visualize and analyze the correlation between the human rankings. A valuable by-product of our method is the ability to sample, at no extra cost, sentences containing different senses of a given word. Finally, the fully unsupervised nature of our method makes it applicable to any language. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ksipos/polysemy-assessment .

In online setting, the exploration-exploitation dilemma should be addressed as we try to discover the optimal policy by using samples collected by ourselves. RBLSPI exploits the advantage of BLSTD to quantify our uncertainty about the value function. Inspired by Thompson sampling, RBLSPI first samples a value function from a posterior distribution over value functions, and then selects actions based on the sampled value function. The effectiveness and the exploration abilities of RBLSPI are demonstrated experimentally in several environments.",

In order to achieve the desired performance and scalability, as well as enhancing search quality relative to centralized search engines, semantic overlay networks (SONS) connecting peers storing semantically related information can be employed.

Moreover, ignoring the direction of the edges causes important information loss on the anonymized networks in the best case. In the worst case, the direction of the edges may be used for reidentification, if it is not considered in the anonymization process. Here, we propose two different models for k-degree anonymity on directed networks, and we also present algorithms to fulfill these k-degree anonymity models. Given a network G, we construct a k-degree anonymous network by the minimum number of edge additions.

            "Abstract": "In many domains data is currently represented as graphs and therefore, the graph representation of this data becomes increasingly important in machine learning. Network data is, implicitly or explicitly, always represented using a graph shift operator (GSO) with the most common choices being the adjacency, Laplacian matrices and their normalisations. In this paper, a novel parametrised GSO (PGSO) is proposed, where specific parameter values result in the most commonly used GSOs and message-passing operators in graph neural network (GNN) frameworks. The PGSO is suggested as a replacement of the standard GSOs that are used in state-of-the-art GNN architectures and the optimisation of the PGSO parameters is seamlessly included in the model training. It is proved that the PGSO has real eigenvalues and a set of real eigenvectors independent of the parameter values and spectral bounds on the PGSO are derived. PGSO parameters are shown to adapt to the sparsity of the graph structure in a study on stochastic blockmodel networks, where they are found to automatically replicate the GSO regularisation found in the literature. On several real-world datasets the accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN architectures is improved by the inclusion of the PGSO in both node- and graph-classification tasks.",

The proposed approach does not rely on arbitrary data movement, hence each peer joining the network autonomously stores its own data. We present SIMPEER, a novel framework that dynamically clusters peer data, in order to build distributed routing information at super-peer level. SIMPEER allows the evaluation of range and nearest neighbor queries in a distributed manner that reduces communication cost, network latency, bandwidth consumption and computational overhead at each individual peer. SIMPEER utilizes a set of distributed statistics and guarantees that all similar objects to the query are retrieved, without necessarily flooding the network during query processing. The statistics are employed for estimating an adequate query radius for k-nearest neighbor queries, and transform the query to a range query. Our experimental evaluation employs both real-world and synthetic data collections, and our results show that SIMPEER performs efficiently, even in the case of high degree of distribution.",

The paper surveys clustering methods and approaches available in the literature in a comparative way. It also presents the basic concepts, principles and assumptions upon which the clustering algorithms are based. Another important issue is the validity of the clustering schemes resulting from applying algorithms. This is also related to the inherent features of the data set under concern.

Most graph kernels are instances of the R-convolution framework. These kernels decompose graphs into their substructures and sum over all pairs of these substructures. A more promising family of kernels are the assignment kernels, which compute a matching between substructures of two objects such that the total similarity between the matched substructures is maximum. In this paper, we present a kernel which compares graphs by computing an assignment of their node embeddings. After embedding the vertices of all graphs in a vector space, we construct a hierarchy of the vertices using a clustering algorithm. Based on this hierarchy, we define a kernel that computes an optimal assignment of the vertices of two graphs. The proposed kernel is evaluated on several graph classification \u2026",

Moreover, we created a Greek version of WordSim353 corpora for a basic evaluation of word similarities. We tested seven word vector models and our evaluation showed that we are able to create meaningful representations.

Despite its practical importance, the task has not been explored in depth so far, mainly due to its challenging nature. In this paper, we propose a model that predicts the evolution of dynamic graphs. Specifically, we use a graph neural network along with a recurrent architecture to capture the temporal evolution patterns of dynamic graphs. Then, we employ a generative model which predicts the topology of the graph at the next time step and constructs a graph instance that corresponds to that topology.

In this work, we model the global capital ownership network across a hundred of millions of such entities with the goal of establishing a methodology for extracting and analysing meaningful patterns of capitalistic influence from the graph structure. To do so, we adapt and employ metrics from graph analytics and algorithms from the area of influence maximization. We characterize the relationships extracted and show that our analysis aligns with information from macro-economic studies; for example it recovers the presence of known tax heavens, which appear in dense subgraphs of countries. We also identify and quantify cases where capital is principally owned by others, corresponding to global influence. Beyond confirming known patterns and justifying our novel application of influence maximization methodology in this area, the outcome also offers new insight and metrics in this domain,  by highlighting the existence of strong communities of capitalistic property. We leverage influence maximization methods as a means to evaluate the impact of entities in these contexts. Finally we formulate the results of our study into recommendations for future analyses of this kind.",

Surprisingly, there are only a few studies that focus on generating edge representations or deal with edge-related tasks such as the problem of edge classification. In this paper, we propose a new model (in the form of an auto-encoder) to learn edge embeddings in (un)directed graphs. The encoder corresponds to a graph neural network followed by an aggregation function, while a multi-layer perceptron serves as our decoder.

A crucial part of the NAS pipeline is the encoding of the architecture that consists of the applied computational blocks, namely the operations and the links between them. Most of the existing approaches either fail to capture the structural properties of the architectures or use a hand-engineered vector to encode the operator information. In this paper, we propose the replacement of fixed operator encoding with learnable representations in the optimization process. This approach, which effectively captures the relations of different operations, leads to smoother and more accurate representations of the architectures and consequently to improved performance of the end task. Our extensive evaluation in ENAS benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed operation embeddings to the generation of highly accurate models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Finally, our method produces top-performing architectures that share similar operation and graph patterns, highlighting a strong correlation between architecture's structural properties and performance.",

We then select a tweet to best describe each sub-event using a simple yet effective heuristic. We evaluated our approach using humangenerated summaries containing the actual important sub-events within each event and compare it to two baseline approaches using several performance metrics such as DET curves and precision/recall performance. Extensive experiments on recent sporting event streams indicate that our approach outperforms the dominant sub-event detection methods and constructs a humanreadable event summary by aggregating the most representative tweets of each sub-event.",

The novelty feature in keyword extraction task results in meaningful news recommendations with regards to the web page the users currently visits. Moreover the extension offers a salient visualization of the terms corresponding to the users recent browsing history making thus the extension a comprehensive tool for real time news \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Markov models have been widely used for modelling users' navigational behaviour in the Web graph, using the transitional probabilities between web pages, as recorded in the web logs. The recorded users' navigation is used to extract popular web paths and predict current users' next steps. Such purely usage-based probabilistic models, however, present certain shortcomings. Since the prediction of users' navigational behaviour is based solely on the usage data, structural properties of the Web graph are ignored. Thus important-in terms of pagerank authority score-paths may be underrated. In this paper we present a hybrid probabilistic predictive model extending the properties of Markov models by incorporating link analysis methods. More specifically, we propose the use of a PageRank-style algorithm for assigning prior probabilities to the web pages based on their importance in the web site's graph. We prove \u2026",

By maintaining the core number sequence of a graph, its coreness, we retain most of the information contained in the network while allowing changes in the degree sequence, i. e. obfuscating the visible data an attacker has access to. We reach a better trade-off between data privacy and data utility than with existing methods by capitalizing on the slack between apparent degree (node degree) and true degree (node core number). Our extensive experiments on six diverse standard network datasets support this claim. Our framework compares our method to other that are used as proxies for privacy protection in the relevant literature. We demonstrate that our method leads to higher data utility preservation, especially in clustering, for the same levels of randomization and k \u2026",

Depending on data distribution on peers, the aggregation of the MBRs may lead to MRIs that exhibit extremely poor performance, which renders them ineffective. Thus, focusing on a hybrid unstructured P2P network, we analyze the parameters for building MRIs of high selectivity.

In this work, we explore measures defined on the citation graph that offer a more intuitive insight into the impact of a paper than the superficial count of citations. Our main argument is focused on the identification of influence as an expression of the citation density in the subgraph of citations built for each paper. We propose two measures that capitalize on the notion of density providing researchers alternative evaluations of their work.

            "Abstract": "The computation of relatedness between two fragments of text in an automated manner requires taking into account a wide range of factors pertaining to the meaning the two fragments convey, and the pairwise relations between their words. Without doubt, a measure of relatedness between text segments must take into account both the lexical and the semantic relatedness between words. Such a measure that captures well both aspects of text relatedness may help in many tasks, such as text retrieval, classification and clustering. In this paper we present a new approach for measuring the semantic relatedness between words based on their implicit semantic links. The approach exploits only a word thesaurus in order to devise implicit semantic links between words. Based on this approach, we introduce Omiotis, a new measure of semantic relatedness between texts which capitalizes on the word-to-word semantic relatedness measure (SR) and extends it to measure the relatedness between texts. We gradually validate our method: we first evaluate the performance of the semantic relatedness measure between individual words, covering word-to-word similarity and relatedness, synonym identification and word analogy; then, we proceed with evaluating the performance of our method in measuring text-to-text semantic relatedness in two tasks, namely sentence-to-sentence similarity and paraphrase recognition. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms every lexicon-based method of semantic relatedness in the selected tasks and the used data sets, and competes well against corpus-based and hybrid approaches.",

Most GNNs belong to the family of message passing neural networks (MPNNs). These models employ an iterative neighborhood aggregation scheme to update vertex representations. Then, to compute vector representations of graphs, they aggregate the representations of the vertices using some permutation invariant function. One would expect the hidden layers of a GNN to be composed of parameters that take the form of graphs. However, this is not the case for MPNNs since their update procedure is parameterized by fully-connected layers. In this paper, we propose a more intuitive and transparent architecture for graph-structured data, so-called Random Walk Graph Neural Network (RWNN). The first layer of the model consists of a number of trainable \u201chidden graphs\u201d which are compared against the input graphs using a random walk kernel to produce graph representations. These representations are then passed on to a fully-connected neural network which produces the output. The employed random walk kernel is differentiable, and therefore, the proposed model is end-to-end trainable. We demonstrate the model\u2019s transparency on synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate the model on graph classification datasets and show that it achieves competitive performance.",

The similarity between two graphs is then determined using the Earth Mover's Distance metric. These similarities do not yield a positive semidefinite matrix. To address for this, we employ an algorithm for SVM classification using indefinite kernels. We also present a graph kernel based on the Pyramid Match kernel that finds an approximate correspondence between the sets of vectors of the two graphs. We further improve the proposed kernel using the Weisfeiler-Lehman framework.

In this paper, we propose a new graph neural network model, so-called -GNN which learns a \"soft\" permutation (i.e., doubly stochastic) matrix for each graph, and thus projects all graphs into a common vector space. The learned matrices impose a \"soft\" ordering on the vertices of the input graphs, and based on this ordering, the adjacency matrices are mapped into vectors. These vectors can be fed into fully-connected or convolutional layers to deal with supervised learning tasks. In case of large graphs, to make the model more efficient in terms of running time and memory, we further relax the doubly stochastic matrices to row stochastic matrices. We empirically evaluate the model on graph classification and graph regression datasets and show that it achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art models.",

This approach takes better into account proximity between keywords and variability in the number of extracted keywords through the selection of more cohesive subsets of nodes than with existing graph-based approaches solely based on centrality. Experiments on two standard datasets show statistically significant improvements in F1-score and AUC of precision/recall curve compared to baseline results, in particular when weighting the edges of the graph with the number of co-occurrences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of graph degeneracy to natural language processing and information retrieval.",

The Challenge was concerned with the identification of individual user\u2019s spam emails based on a centrally collected training set. The task descriptions of the discovery challenge indicated that we should deviate from the classical supervised classification paradigm and attempt to utilize semi-supervised and transductive approaches. The format of the training data (bag-of-words providing only word IDs), did not allow either for the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches, or for the use of standard spam-recognition strategies. The submitted model, which achieved 5 th place on Task A of the challenge, was derived by Tri-Training, a recent development in Semi-supervised algorithms research. Given a standard classifier, Tri-Training initially uses bagging to produce three diverse training datasets-classifiers, which are used for classifying the unlabeled data and incorporating them into the training set in a theoretically sound way. The classifier we have used within Tri-Training was Support Vector Machines (SVM) and more precisely the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) implementation of WEKA. Moreover, we have used feature normalization and logistic regression models to produce continuous outputs. Apart from a detailed description and a discussion of the submitted model, this paper contains an extensive empirical evaluation of two popular semi-supervised classification algorithms: Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVM) and Tri-Training.",

From hiring committees in academic institutions to governmental agencies that distribute funding, an author's scientific success as measured by the h-index is a vital point to their career. The objective of this work is to investigate whether the collaboration patterns of an author are good predictors of the author's future -index. Although not directly related to each other, a more intense collaboration can result into increased productivity which can potentially have an impact on the author's future -index. In this paper, we capitalize on recent advances in graph neural networks and we examine the possibility of predicting the -index relying solely on the author's collaboration and the textual content of a subset of their papers. We perform our experiments on a large-scale network consisting of more than  million authors that have published papers in computer science venues and more than  million edges. The task is a six-months-ahead forecast, i.e. what the -index of each author will be after six months. Our experiments indicate that there is indeed some relationship between the future -index of an author and their structural role in the co-authorship network. Furthermore, we found that the proposed method outperforms standard machine learning techniques based on simple graph metrics along with node representations learned from the textual content of the author's papers.",

We conclude that some specific tasks do not benefit from generic language models pre-trained on large amounts of data. We explore the use of smaller architectures in domain-specific sub-languages and their benefits for French legal text.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a very appealing alternative, but processing graphs with CNNs is not trivial. To address this challenge, many sophisticated extensions of CNNs have recently been introduced. In this paper, we reverse the problem: rather than proposing yet another graph CNN model, we introduce a novel way to represent graphs as multi-channel image-like structures that allows them to be handled by vanilla 2D CNNs. Experiments reveal that our method is more accurate than state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph CNNs on 4 out of 6 real-world datasets (with and without continuous node attributes), and close elsewhere. Our approach is also preferable to graph kernels in terms of time complexity. Code and data are publicly available (                     https://github \u2026",

When authoring multimedia scenarios, and in particular scenarios with user interaction, where the sequence and time of occurrence of interactions is not predefined, it is difficult to guarantee the consistency of the resulting scenarios. As a consequence, the execution of the scenario may result in unexpected behavior or inconsistent use of media. The present paper proposes a methodology for checking the temporal integrity of interactive multimedia document (IMD) scenarios at authoring time at various levels. The IMD flow is mainly defined by the events occurring during the IMD session. Integrity checking consists of a set of discrete steps, during which we transform the scenario into temporal constraint networks representing the constraints linking the different possible events in the scenario. Temporal constraint verification techniques are applied to verify the integrity of the scenario \u2026",

As adaptive decision making is a time-critical task, a realistic feedback model has been considered, called myopic. In this direction, we propose the myopic adaptive greedy policy that is guaranteed to provide a (1 - 1/e) -approximation of the optimal policy under a variant of the independent cascade diffusion model. This strategy maximizes an alternative utility function that has been proven to be adaptive monotone and adaptive submodular. The proposed utility function considers the cumulative number of active nodes through the time, instead of the total number of the active nodes at the end of the diffusion. Our empirical analysis on real-world social networks reveals the benefits of the proposed myopic strategy, validating our theoretical results.",

A crucial part of the NAS pipeline is the encoding of the architecture that consists of the applied computational blocks, namely the operations and the links between them. Most of the existing approaches either fail to capture the structural properties of the architectures or use hand-engineered vector to encode the operator information. In this paper, we propose the replacement of fixed operator encoding with learnable representations in the optimization process. This approach, which effectively captures the relations of different operations, leads to smoother and more accurate representations of the architectures and consequently to improved performance of the end task. Our extensive evaluation in ENAS benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed operation embeddings to the generation of highly accurate models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Finally, our method produces top-performing architectures that share similar operation and graph patterns, highlighting a strong correlation between the structural properties of the architecture and its performance",

Our experiments over standard datasets indicate that the respective orders of composition chosen in the original papers for both TF-IDF and BM25 are the most effective ones. Moreover, since the order is different between the two models, they also demonstrated that the order is instrumental in the design of weighting models. In fact, while considering more complex scoring functions such as BM25+, we discovered a novel weighting \u2026",

In MPNNs the computations are split into three steps, Aggregation, Update and Readout. In this paper a series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update step is proposed. Specifically, the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform in the Update step, are proposed. In agreement with a growing trend in the relevant literature the sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained architectures. These novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution (SGC). The ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance on par with their vanilla counterparts on several down-stream graph prediction tasks, while containing exponentially fewer trainable parameters. In experiments with matching parameter numbers our benchmark models outperform the state-of-the-art GNNs models. These observations enable us to conclude that in practice the Update step often makes no positive contribution to the model performance.",

            "Abstract": "Novelty detection in text streams is a challenging task that emerges in quite a few different scenarios, ranging from email thread filtering to RSS news feed recommendation on a smartphone. An efficient novelty detection algorithm can save the user a great deal of time and resources when browsing through relevant yet usually previously-seen content. Most of the recent research on detection of novel documents in text streams has been building upon either geometric distances or distributional similarities, with the former typically performing better but being much slower due to the need of comparing an incoming document with all the previously-seen ones. In this paper, we propose a new approach to novelty detection in text streams. We describe a resource-aware mechanism that is able to handle massive text streams such as the ones present today thanks to the burst of social media and the emergence of the Web as the main source of information. We capitalize on the historical Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) that was known for capturing well term specificity and we show that it can be used successfully at the document level as a measure of document novelty. This enables us to avoid similarity comparisons with previous documents in the text stream, thus scaling better and leading to faster execution times. Moreover, as the collection of documents evolves over time, we use a temporal variant of IDF not only to maintain an efficient representation of what has already been seen but also to decay the document frequencies as the time goes by. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a real-world news articles dataset created \u2026",

The proposed measure takes into account both the terms contained in the documents and the relationships between them. By representing each document as a graph-of-words, we are able to model these relationships and then determine how similar two documents are by using a modified shortest-path graph kernel. We evaluate our approach on two tasks and compare it against several baseline approaches using various performance metrics such as DET curves and macro-average F1-score. Experimental results on a range of datasets showed that our proposed approach outperforms traditional techniques and is capable of measuring more accurately the similarity between two documents.",

Moreover, they may behave in a different way depending on the features of the data set and their input parameters values. Therefore, in most applications the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. In this paper a new validity index, CDbw, is defined based on well-known clustering criteria enabling: i. the finding of the optimal input parameters\u2019 values for a clustering algorithm that results in the optimal partitioning of a data set, ii. the selection of the algorithm that provides the optimal partitioning of a data set. CDbw puts emphasis on the geometric features of clusters, handling efficiently arbitrary shaped clusters. It achieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of clusters rather than a single center point. Our experimental results confirm the reliability of our index showing that it performs favorably in all cases selecting independently of clustering algorithm the scheme that best fits the data under consideration.",

The objective is to discover a group of users that are able to maximize the spread of influence across a network. The greedy algorithm gives a solution to the Influence Maximization problem while having a good approximation ratio. Nevertheless it does not scale well for large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose Matrix Influence, MATI, an efficient algorithm that can be used under both the Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade diffusion models. MATI is based on the precalculation of the influence by taking advantage of the simple paths in the node\u2019s neighborhood. An extensive empirical analysis has been performed on multiple real-world datasets showing that MATI has competitive performance when compared to other well-known algorithms with regards to running time and expected influence spread.",

However, the algorithms that have been developed so far for this problem are either not efficient or not exact. In this paper, we present a new algorithm which solves this equivalent formulation via semidefinite programming. Specifically, we show that the problem of determining whether the auxiliary graph contains a clique of specific order can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem, and can thus be (almost exactly) solved in polynomial time. Furthermore, we show that we can determine if the graph contains such a clique by rounding the optimal solution to the nearest integer. Our algorithm provides a significant complexity result in graph isomorphism testing, and also represents the first use of semidefinite programming for solving this problem.",

This concept is strongly related to the concept of graph degeneracy, which has a long history in graph theory. Although the core decomposition concept is extremely simple, there is an enormous interest in the topic from diverse application domains, mainly because it can be used to analyze a network in a simple and concise manner by quantifying the significance of graph nodes.

            "Abstract": "Recent work in Dialogue Act (DA) classification approaches the task as a sequence labeling problem, using neural network models coupled with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) as the last layer. CRF models the conditional probability of the target DA label sequence given the input utterance sequence. However, the task involves another important input sequence, that of speakers, which is ignored by previous work. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a simple modification of the CRF layer that takes speaker-change into account. Experiments on the SwDA corpus show that our modified CRF layer outperforms the original one, with very wide margins for some DA labels. Further, visualizations demonstrate that our CRF layer can learn meaningful, sophisticated transition patterns between DA label pairs conditioned on speaker-change in an end-to-end way.

As mobile devices keep getting smaller, cheaper and more sophisticated, their use is becoming a commodity. We envision future scenarios that involve mobile devices acting not only as requestors, but as providers of data as well. In order to hide the heterogeneous nature of web data, service-oriented architectures are adopted. Nevertheless, existing service discovery mechanisms usually focus on exact or semantic matching of static attributes, thus ignoring contextual parameters. We argue that context for mobile web services plays an important role in service discovery by increasing the precision and efficiency of the search.

Different approaches for exploiting the generated SONs for content retrieval have been proposed in the literature, which are examined in this chapter, with a particular focus on SON interconnections for efficient search.

Searching this content in mobile environments is challenging, since centralized approaches are not appropriate in a very dynamic environment with limited resources available for keeping a centralized index up-to-date. A more appropriate solution is to organize the mobile devices in an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The main challenge in the context of unstructured P2P is to determine the peers that might store documents matching a query, ie, peer selection. In this paper, we propose a summary caching method for increasing the efficiency and recall of peer selection during XML querying. Our approach is based on caching parts of XML schemas along the query path, to enable subsequent jumps to remote peers storing content relevant to the query.

The attack-types were: Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, LDAP Injection, XPATH Injection, Path traversal, Command execution and SSI. A challenge that we faced stemmed from the fact that the training data were provided in a preliminary HTTP protocol format, containing string representations of the HTTP packet fields (such as method, protocol, and uri). This information could not be directly incorporated in standard data mining algorithms, and significant preprocessing should be performed. In order to address this challenge we have identified several string patterns that could signify a malicious communication, and transformed the unstructured information to feature-vector format. This transformation allowed us to employ C4, a decision tree algorithm that exhibited an estimated accuracy of 77%.",

To this end, we first introduce the concept of Pattern-Base Management System; then, we provide the logical foundations of a general framework based on the notions of pattern types and pattern classes, which stand for the intensional and extensional description of pattern instances, respectively. The framework is general and extensible enough to cover a broad range of real-world patterns, each of which is characterized by its structure, the related underlying data, an expression that carries the semantics of the pattern, and measurements of how successful the \u2026",

Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks emerge as a promising solution to delve with these challenges. However, the lack of global content/topology knowledge in an unstructured P2P system demands unsupervised methods for content organization and necessitates efficient and high quality search mechanisms. Towards this end, Semantic Overlay Networks (SONs) have been proposed in the literature, and in this paper, an unsupervised method for decentralized and distributed generation of SONs, called DESENT, is proposed. We prove the feasibility of our approach through analytical cost models and we show through simulations that, when compared to flooding, our approach improves recall by more than 3-10 times, depending on the network topology.",

This paper focuses on the issue of defining models and metrics for reciprocity in signed graphs. In unsigned directed networks, reciprocity quantifies the predisposition of network members in creating mutual connections. On the other hand, this concept has not yet been investigated in the case of signed graphs. We capitalize on the graph degeneracy concept to identify subgraphs of the signed network in which reciprocity is more likely to occur. This enables us to assess reciprocity at a global level, rather than at an exclusively local one as in existing approaches. The large scale experiments we perform on real world data sets of trust networks lead to both interesting and intuitive results. We believe these reciprocity measures can be used in various social applications such as trust management \u2026",

We propose a model to capture this cascading effect, based on recent studies about the engagement dynamics of social networks. We introduce a new concept of vulnerability assessment under cascades triggered by the departure of nodes based on their engagement level. Our results indicate that social networks are robust under cascades triggered by randomly selected nodes but highly vulnerable in cascades caused by targeted departures of nodes with high engagement level.",

In this paper, we show that GCN encoders are actually unnecessarily complex for many applications. We propose to replace them by significantly simpler and more interpretable linear models w.r.t. the direct neighborhood (one-hop) adjacency matrix of the graph, involving fewer operations, fewer parameters and no activation function. For the two aforementioned tasks, we show that this simpler approach consistently reaches competitive performances w.r.t.

These interaction networks represent a rich, yet noisy, source of data that could be used to extract meaningful information, such as protein complexes. Several interaction network weighting schemes have been proposed so far in the literature in order to eliminate the noise inherent in interactome data. In this paper, we propose a novel weighting scheme and apply it to the S. cerevisiae interactome. Complex prediction rates are improved by up to 39%, depending on the clustering algorithm applied. We adopt a two step procedure. During the first step, by applying both novel and well established protein-protein interaction (PPI) weighting methods, weights are introduced to the original interactome graph based on the confidence level that a given interaction is a true-positive one. The second step applies clustering using established algorithms in the field of graph theory, as well as two variations of Spectral clustering. The clustered interactome networks are also cross-validated against the confirmed protein complexes present in the MIPS database. The results of our experimental work demonstrate that interactome graph weighting methods clearly improve the clustering results of several clustering algorithms. Moreover, our proposed weighting scheme outperforms other approaches of PPI graph weighting.",

Data management in high-dimensional spaces presents problems, such as the degradation of query processing performance, a phenomenon also known as the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction (DR) tackles this problem, by efficiently embedding data from high dimensional to lower dimensional spaces. However, the large scale and dynamism of generated data calls for methods of low time and space complexity, features that are hardly combined in the majority of existing DR algorithms. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we propose FEDRA, a fast and efficient dimensionality reduction algorithm that uses a set of landmark points to project data to a lower dimensional Euclidean space. FEDRA is both faster and requires less memory than other comparable algorithms, without compromising the projection's \u2026",

The principles of the evolving MPEG-7 standard have been adopted for the creation the data model used by the system, permitting efficient separation of database design, content description, business logic and presentation of query results. XML Schema is used in defining the data model, and XML in describing audiovisual content. Issues regarding problems that emerged during system design and their solutions are discussed, such as customization, deviations from the standard MPEG-7 DSs or even the design of entirely custom DSs. Although the system includes modules for digitization, annotation, archiving and intelligent data mining, the paper mainly focuses on the use of MPEG-7 as the information model.",

During the past 20 years, the considerable research activity that occurred in the field resulted in the development of dozens of graph kernels, each focusing on specific structural properties of graphs. Graph kernels have proven successful in a wide range of domains, ranging from social networks to bioinformatics. The goal of this survey is to provide a unifying view of the literature on graph kernels. In particular, we present a comprehensive overview of a wide range of graph kernels. Furthermore, we perform an experimental evaluation of several of those kernels on publicly available datasets, and provide a comparative study. Finally, we discuss key applications of graph kernels, and outline some challenges that remain to be addressed.",

Traditionally, the unigram bag-of-words representation is applied; that way, a document is represented as a multiset of its terms, disregarding dependencies between the terms. Although several variants and extensions of this modeling approach have been proposed, the main weakness comes from the underlying term independence assumption; the order of the terms within a document is completely disregarded and any relationship between terms is not taken into account in the final task. To deal with this problem, the research community has explored various representations, and to this direction, graphs constitute a well-developed model for text representation.

It reviews the state-of-the-art in uncertainty handling and discusses a framework for unveiling and handling uncertainty. Coverage of quality assessment begins with an introduction to cluster analysis and a comparison of the methods and approaches that may be used. The techniques and algorithms involved in other essential data mining tasks, such as classification and extraction of association rules, are also discussed together with a review of the quality criteria and techniques for evaluating the data mining results. This book presents a general framework for assessing quality and handling uncertainty which is based on tested concepts and theories. This framework forms the basis of an implementation tool,'Uminer'which is introduced to the reader for the first time. This tool supports the key data mining tasks while enhancing the traditional processes for handling uncertainty and assessing quality. Aimed at IT professionals involved with data mining and knowledge discovery, the work is supported with case studies from epidemiology and telecommunications that illustrate how the tool works in'real world'data mining projects. The book would also be of interest to final year undergraduates or post-graduate students looking at: databases, algorithms, artificial intelligence and information systems particularly with regard to uncertainty and quality assessment.",

We then evaluate the performance of our vectors against that of ones trained on a 100B-word corpus (Google News) within the framework of an injury report classification task. Without any parameter tuning, our embeddings give competitive results, and outperform the Google News vectors in many cases. Using a keyword-based compression of the reports also leads to a significant speed-up with only a limited loss in performance.

In order to leverage this relationship, a growing literature proposed latent representations that identify structurally equivalent nodes. However, most of the existing methods require high time and space complexity. In this paper, we propose VNEstruct, a simple approach for generating low-dimensional structural node embeddings, that is both time efficient and robust to perturbations of the graph structure. The proposed approach focuses on the local neighborhood of each node and employs the Von Neumann entropy, an information-theoretic tool, to extract features that capture the neighborhood's topology. Moreover, on graph classification tasks, we suggest the utilization of the generated structural embeddings for the transformation of an attributed graph structure into a set of augmented node attributes. Empirically, we observe that the proposed approach exhibits robustness on structural role identification tasks and state-of-the-art performance on graph classification tasks, while maintaining very high computational speed.",

            "Abstract": "Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), the most prominent Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, celebrate much success in the analysis of graph-structured data. Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network models attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this paper, we conduct a structured study of the effect of sparsification on the trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design a series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update step. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform in the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature, the sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained architectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance on par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks while containing significantly fewer trainable parameters. In experiments with matching parameter numbers, our benchmark models outperform the state-of-the-art GNN models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ChangminWu/ExpanderGNN.",

P2P systems in their basic unstructured form suffer high costs when it comes to efficiently locating content, mainly due to the lack of global knowledge. It is therefore crucial to organize content in an unsupervised way by creating groups of peers with similar content, in order to support efficient search mechanisms. In this paper, we discuss the need for content organization in unstructured P2P networks and present the requirements that must be fulfilled by any approach. We propose P2P clustering as a potential solution to Semantic Overlay Network (SON) generation for organizing P2P networks, and we present our unsupervised approach for decentralized SON creation towards this end.",

The reason is that typical data mining tasks, such as clustering, cannot produce high quality results when applied on high-dimensional and/or large (in terms of cardinality) datasets. Data preprocessing and in particular dimensionality reduction constitute promising tools to deal with this problem. However, most of the existing dimensionality reduction algorithms share also the same disadvantages with data mining algorithms, when applied on large datasets of high dimensionality.

Inspired by bagging in Machine Learning, we propose the first Perturb and Combine (P&C) procedure for networks. It (1) creates many perturbed versions of a given graph,(2) applies a node scoring function separately to each graph, and (3) combines the results. Experiments conducted on real-world networks of various sizes with the k-core, generalized k-core, and PageRank algorithms reveal that P&C brings substantial improvements. Moreover, this performance boost can be obtained at almost no extra cost through parallelization. Finally, a bias-variance analysis suggests that P&C works mainly by reducing bias, and that therefore, it should be capable of improving the performance of all vertex scoring functions, including stable ones.

            "Abstract": "Graph autoencoders (AE) and variational autoencoders (VAE) recently emerged as powerful node embedding methods. In particular, graph AE and VAE were successfully leveraged to tackle the challenging link prediction problem, aiming at figuring out whether some pairs of nodes from a graph are connected by unobserved edges. However, these models focus on undirected graphs and therefore ignore the potential direction of the link, which is limiting for numerous real-life applications. In this paper, we extend the graph AE and VAE frameworks to address link prediction in directed graphs. We present a new gravity-inspired decoder scheme that can effectively reconstruct directed graphs from a node embedding. We empirically evaluate our method on three different directed link prediction tasks, for which standard graph AE and VAE perform poorly. We achieve competitive results on three real-world graphs \u2026",

For this reason, Web archiving has become an issue for many national libraries. In this paper, we present a first attempt to archive the Greek Web. This project is divided in two parts; the first part concerns the collection of the majority of Greek Web pages. The second part focuses on the knowledge extraction from this archive, in order to classify it in semantically coherent clusters. Considerations concerning the criteria that should be set in order to characterize a Web page as \u201cGreek\u201d are discussed. A combination of IR and content mining techniques is applied in order to semantically characterize the collected content. We especially address the bilingualism issue arising because the content is written in both Greek and English. The collected Web pages are finally classified into meaningful clusters, facilitating the searching of the archive.",

Relying on a thresholding scheme, SPEERTO returns the exact results progressively to the user, while the number of queried super-peers and transferred data is minimized.

This paper focuses on the first challenge: we have created a data model for spatio-temporal compositions that allows us to define relative placement of objects in a virtual world by means of their geometric characteristics (Joints). Thus, we model spatial relationships of objects at a higher level of abstraction than simple co-ordinate system transformations. We also define the behavior of objects in a declarative way, by means of Event-Condition-Action rules. Events and Actions can be synthesized by a set of operators for the creation of really complex behavior. Our model has been realized in prototype form in Spatio-Temporal Descriptive Language (STEDEL) that demonstrates the validity and power of our approach in terms of re-usability and authorship effort.",

Many conventional machine learning algorithms are unable to process this kind of representations, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a meaningful ordering. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture, called RepSet, that can handle examples that are represented as sets of vectors. The proposed model computes the correspondences between an input set and some hidden sets by solving a series of network flow problems. This representation is then fed to a standard neural network architecture to produce the output. The architecture allows end-to-end gradient-based learning. We demonstrate RepSet on classification tasks, including text categorization, and graph classification, and we show that the proposed neural network achieves performance better or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

In order to address the non-linear case, we introduce D-Isomap, a novel distributed non linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, particularly applicable in large scale, structured peer-to-peer networks. Apart from unfolding a non linear manifold, our algorithm is capable of approximate reconstruction of the global dataset at peer level a very attractive feature for distributed data mining problems.

            "Abstract": "Graphs or networks have been widely used as modeling tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Mining (TM) and Information Retrieval (IR). Traditionally, the unigram bag-of-words representation is applied; that way, a document is represented as a multiset of its terms, disregarding dependencies between the terms. Although several variants and extensions of this modeling approach have been proposed (eg, the n-gram model), the main weakness comes from the underlying term independence assumption. The order of the terms within a document is completely disregarded and any relationship between terms is not taken into account in the final task (eg, text categorization). Nevertheless, as the heterogeneity of text collections is increasing (especially with respect to document length and vocabulary), the research community has started exploring different document representations aiming to capture more fine-grained contexts of co-occurrence between different terms, challenging the well-established unigram bag-of-words model. To this direction, graphs constitute a well-developed model that has been adopted for text representation. The goal of this tutorial is to offer a comprehensive presentation of recent methods that rely on graph-based text representations to deal with various tasks in NLP and IR. We will describe basic as well as novel graph theoretic concepts and we will examine how they can be applied in a wide range of text-related application domains.

In this article, we present CoreCluster, an efficient graph clustering framework based on the concept of graph degeneracy, that can be used along with any known graph clustering algorithm. Our approach capitalizes on processing the graph in an hierarchical manner provided by its core expansion sequence, an ordered partition of the graph into different levels according to the k-core decomposition. Such a partition provides an efficient way to process the graph in an incremental manner that preserves its clustering structure, while making the execution of the chosen clustering algorithm much faster due to the smaller size of the graph's partitions onto which the algorithm operates. An experimental analysis on a multitude of real and synthetic data demonstrates that our approach can be applied to any clustering algorithm accelerating the clustering process, while the quality of the clustering structure is preserved or even improved.",

In this framework, the principal components are computed by the sample covariance matrix containing the pairwise feature covariance estimates, thus indicating that the problem of Distributed PCA can be cast as a problem of statistical estimation.

In this paper, the random GCN is introduced for which a random matrix theory analysis is possible. This analysis suggests that if the graph is sufficiently perturbed, or in the extreme case random, then the GCN fails to benefit from the node features. It is furthermore observed that enhancing the message passing step in GCNs by adding the node feature kernel to the adjacency matrix of the graph structure solves this problem. An empirical study of a GCN utilised for node classification on six real datasets further confirms the theoretical findings and demonstrates that perturbations of the graph structure can result in GCNs performing significantly worse than Multi-Layer Perceptrons run on the node features alone.

            "Abstract": "Personal information about applicants is often requested by service providers to be used as an input of a classification process establishing the specific situation of each applicant. This is a prerequisite for the service provider to make an appropriate offer to the applicant. For example, the rate and duration of personal loans are usually adapted depending on the risk based on the income, the assets or past lines of credits of the borrower. In the eyes of privacy laws and directives, the set of exposed documents collected to achieve a service must be restricted to the minimum necessary. This Limited Data Collection principle reduces the impact of data breaches both in the interest of service providers and customers. In this article, we show that in practice, the data collected traditionally is excessive. We propose a new approach that we call Minimum Exposure, where the minimum set of documents required can be computed on the user's side. We formalize the underlying problem and show it is NP hard. We propose algorithms to compute a solution and validate them with experiments. The Minimum Exposure approach leads to a very significant reduction of the quantity of personal information exposed, therefore leading to important privacy gains for the applicant and large scale savings for service providers in the event of data breaches.",

In a co- authorship network, for instance, the fractional core index of an author intuitively reflects the degree of collaboration with equally or higher-ranked authors. Our system has been deployed on a real-world co-authorship network derived from DBLP, demonstrating that the idea of fractional cores can be applied even to large-scale networks. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to query for the fractional core index of an author, to see who the closest equally or higher-ranked co-authors are, and explore the entire co-authorship network in an incremental manner.",

            "Abstract": "An important open issue in KDD research is the reveal and the handling of uncertainty. The popular classification approaches do not take into account this feature while they do not exploit properly the significant amount of information included in the results of classification process (i.e., classification scheme), though it will be useful in decision-making. In this paper we present a framework that maintains uncertainty throughout the classification process by maintaining the classification belief and moreover enables assignment of an item to multiple classes with a different belief. Decision support tools are provided for decisions related to: i. relative importance of classes in a data set (i.e., \u201cyoung vs. old customers\u201d), ii. relative importance of classes across data sets iii. the information content of different data sets. Finally we provide a mechanism for evaluating classification schemes and select the scheme that best \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Web personalization is the process of customizing a web site to the needs of each specific user or set of users. Personalization of a web site may be performed by the provision of recommendations to the users, highlighting/adding links, creation of index pages, etc. Most of the research efforts in Web personalization correspond to the evolution of extensive research in Web usage mining, ie the exploitation of the navigational patterns of the web sites visitors. When a personalization system relies solely on usage-based results, however, valuable information conceptually related to what is finally recommended may be missed. The exploitation of the web pages semantics can considerably improve the results of web usage mining and personalization, since it provides a more abstract yet uniform and both machine and human understandable way of processing and analyzing the usage data. The underlying idea is to integrate usage data with content semantics, expressed in ontology terms, in order to produce semantically enhanced navigational patterns that can subsequently be used for producing valuable recommendations. In this talk we will present how a personalization system may benefit from incorporating semantics in the web usage mining and personalization process.",

            "Abstract": "Inductive transfer learning has taken the entire NLP field by storm, with models such as BERT and BART setting new state of the art on countless NLU tasks. However, most of the available models and research have been conducted for English. In this work, we introduce BARThez, the first large-scale pretrained seq2seq model for French. Being based on BART, BARThez is particularly well-suited for generative tasks. We evaluate BARThez on five discriminative tasks from the FLUE benchmark and two generative tasks from a novel summarization dataset, OrangeSum, that we created for this research. We show BARThez to be very competitive with state-of-the-art BERT-based French language models such as CamemBERT and FlauBERT. We also continue the pretraining of a multilingual BART on BARThez' corpus, and show our resulting model, mBARThez, to significantly boost BARThez' generative performance. Code, data and models are publicly available.",

            "Abstract": "Finding dense subgraphs in a graph is a fundamental graph mining task, with applications in several fields. Algorithms for identifying dense subgraphs are used in biology, in finance, in spam detection, etc. Standard formulations of this problem such as the problem of finding the maximum clique of a graph are hard to solve. However, some tractable formulations of the problem have also been proposed, focusing mainly on optimizing some density function, such as the degree density and the triangle density. However, maximization of degree density usually leads to large subgraphs with small density, while maximization of triangle density does not necessarily lead to subgraphs that are close to being cliques.In this paper, we introduce the k-clique-graph densest subgraph problem, , a novel formulation for the discovery of dense subgraphs. Given an input graph, its k-clique-graph is a new graph \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a general framework to scale graph autoencoders (AE) and graph variational autoencoders (VAE). This framework leverages graph degeneracy concepts to train models only from a dense subset of nodes instead of using the entire graph. Together with a simple yet effective propagation mechanism, our approach significantly improves scalability and training speed while preserving performance. We evaluate and discuss our method on several variants of existing graph AE and VAE, providing the first application of these models to large graphs with up to millions of nodes and edges. We achieve empirically competitive results w.r.t. several popular scalable node embedding methods, which emphasizes the relevance of pursuing further research towards more scalable graph AE and VAE.",

This is evident by the rapid spread of multimedia into all fields of information processing, resulting in a need to access (store, retrieve, transport, display, etc.) multimedia data in a flexible way. The growing interest in building multime-dia applications is creating a need for developing multimedia database man-agement systems (MM-DBMS) as tools for efficient organization, storage, and retrieval of multimedia objects.",

This book presents an integrated approach to interactive multimedia documents. After summarizing the prerequisites and background information, the author develops an IMD model taking into account interaction and spatiotemporal composition. Based on this model, the author develops an integrated framework covering most of the steps during the life cycle of an IMD, namely data modeling, authoring, verification and querying, execution and rendering, and indexing.",

It is simple to use and can be naturally combined with scikit-learn\u2019s modules to build a complete machine learning pipeline for tasks such as graph classification and clustering.

            "Abstract": "Skyline query processing has received considerable attention in the recent past. Mainly, the skyline query is used to find a set of non dominated data points in a multi-dimensional dataset. One of the major drawbacks of the skyline operator is the high cardinality of the result set. Providing the most interesting points of the skyline set (top-k) inherently involves the ranking of the skyline points. In this paper, we propose a method for ranking the skyline points and therefore for answering top-k skyline queries. First, we introduce the notion of the skyline graph which relies on the dominance relationship of the skyline points in all possible subspaces of the original data space. Using the aforementioned mapping, we can apply well-known link-based ranking algorithms on the skyline graph. Unlike most previously proposed ranking approaches we do not rely on user defined functions and do not impose arbitrary preferences on some dimensions. An experimental evaluation of the proposed method is presented illustrating the ranking ability of our framework.",

In mobile service discovery, it is often the case that implicit contextual information such as the location of the requestor, time the query was submitted, capabilities of the involved devices have a significant impact on query evaluation and the quality of the results. On the other hand, lack of scalability and the well-known single point of failure problem call for distribution of service directories into several peers. In this paper, we present an approach for context-aware service discovery where service directories reside in a P2P architecture. We explore the role and benefits of context-awareness and caching query results in the service discovery process. We conduct extensive experiments coming up with guidelines for service directory \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Recently, the problem of efficiently supporting advanced query operators, such as nearest neighbor or range queries, over multidimensional data in widely distributed environments has attracted much attention. In unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, peers store data in an autonomous manner, thus multidimensional routing indices (MRI) are required, in order to route user queries efficiently to only those peers that may contribute to the query result set. Focusing on a hybrid unstructured P2P network, in this paper, we analyze the parameters for building MRI of high selectivity. In the case where similar data are located at different parts of the network, MRI exhibit extremely poor performance, which renders them ineffective. We present algorithms that boost the query routing performance by detecting similar peers and reassigning these peers to other parts of the hybrid network in a distributed and scalable way \u2026",

Questioning the term independence assumption behind the traditional bag-of-word model, we propose a different representation of a document that captures the relationships between the terms using an unweighted directed graph of terms. From this graph, we extract at indexing time meaningful term weights (TW) that replace traditional term frequencies (TF) and from which we define a novel scoring function, namely TW-IDF, by analogy with TF-IDF. This approach leads to a retrieval model that consistently and significantly outperforms BM25 and in some cases its extension BM25+ on various standard TREC datasets. In particular, experiments show that counting the number of different contexts in which a term occurs inside a document is more effective and relevant to search than considering an \u2026",

The client design covers widely the issue of interaction with external and internal entities in terms of simple and complex events. Moreover it maintains the high-level spatial and temporal synchronization requirements of the application. The whole framework has been implemented in Java using the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) client server communication protocol and the JMF (Java Media Framework) for handling multimedia objects.
