This is because of the sparse, noisy, multilingual content that is posted on-line by Social Media users. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for capturing textual patterns that inherently supports this challenging type of content. In essence, it creates a graph whose nodes correspond to the character n-grams of a document, while its weighted edges denote the average distance between them. Multiple documents of the same polarity can be aggregated into a polarity class graph, which can be compared with individual documents in order to identify the category of their sentiment. To evaluate our approach, we conducted large scale experiments on a real-world data set stemming from a snapshot of Twitter activity. The outcomes of our \u2026",

In this chapter the state of the art of the Web service technology will be analysed, and their different communication mechanisms and the existing implementations will be compared. Firstly, the different standardisation bodies working on Web service specifications relevant to SOI will be introduced. The various approaches to implement Web services will be described followed by the Web service specifications and the middleware that make use of those specifications, including the description of the commercial interfaces and development tools to create services for the cloud. In the last part of the chapter, the interoperability problems present on the different frameworks and the existing solutions to minimize those interoperability problems will be explained.",

Nevertheless the applicability and adoption of computer vision approaches in large-scale industrial environments is limited mainly due to their computation requirements when focusing on real-time objects tracking or events identification.

Effective monitoring and workflow management mechanisms are also presented as the enablers for meeting the real-time requirements of the computer vision application. We evaluate the effectiveness of these mechanisms through a set of experiments that demonstrate their value for allowing cloud infrastructures to provide real-time guarantees.",

There is a large body of work on developing such theories, as they have important applications in viral marketing, recommendations, as well as information retrieval. Influence theories are typically evaluated through a manual process that cannot scale to data voluminous enough to draw safe, representative conclusions. To overcome this issue, we introduce in this paper a formalized framework for large-scale, automatic evaluation of topic-specific influence theories that are specialized in Twitter. Basically, it consists of five conjunctive conditions that are indicative of real influence exertion: the first three determine which influence theories are compatible with our framework, while the other two estimate their relative effectiveness. At the core of these two conditions lies a novel metric \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate the multiple points of innovation when combining blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT) and security frameworks. The deployment and use of IoT device networks in smart city environments has produced an enormous amount of data. The fact that those data are possessed by multiple sources that use independent systems for data collection, storage, and use impedes the exploitation of their value. Blockchains, as distributed ledgers, can be used for addressing the development of a universal system for data collection and distribution. Smart contracts can be used to automate all the processes of such a network, while at the same time, blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protect sensitive data through anonymity and distributed storage. An innovative and open IoT blockchain market of applications, data, and services is proposed that: (i) provides the framework upon which objects and people can exchange value in form of virtual currencies, for assets (data and services) received; (ii) defines the motivation incentives according to social and business context for humans and smart objects to interact. The specific marketplace is piloted through a cross-border trial between Santander and Fujisawa, in the context of the M-Sec project, validating thus the interoperability, efficiency, and data protection principles.",

Consumers perceive quality through the prism of their own experience and it is important to see how their evaluation of the quality provided is mapped to the specific quality parameters offered by the provider. In order to achieve that, this work suggests to use consumer ratings of the latter parameters so as to create a consumer quality profile and a provider reputation. By correlating this profile with others, it is possible to identify similarities in the service ratings that will lead to a prediction of which service might be the most appropriate for a specific consumer.

Each semantic class is modeled by a mixture of t distributions fitted to data provided by the system operators.

Among these, Amazon and Salesforce (with their offerings of Elastic Compute Cloud and force. com among other offerings) are the most prominent. Both companies understand how to charge for their services and how to enable commercial transactions on them. However, whether a wide-spread adoption of Cloud services will occur has to seen.

Under this new role, users are able to comment or rate a TV show and search for information regarding characters, facts, multimedia content or any other related material. This work describes a new approach on the description of media content assets focusing on the content and information linking aspects. In addition, it presents a novel media content enrichment and management framework, which uses the aforementioned media description approach to address the requirements of the modern, social and semantically enabled content production and delivery environments.

Such a practice is the use of architectural viewpoints and views. However, as systems change, these practices should also evolve. The increasing scale and complexity of systems resulting from an ever-growing pool of human needs and breakthroughs may lead, in some cases, to an increased gap between the abstraction activities attempting to capture the whole of a system, and the instantiation activities that produce concrete and detailed descriptions of a system\u2019s architecture. To address this issue, this article introduces a new notion, that of architectural glimpse statements, fundamental questions acting as the building blocks for architectural views and products. This notion can help architects ask the right questions in the right manner to create fundamental statements, the elaboration on which can lead directly to concrete architectural products. Working on top of standardized and common approaches, the article introduces a language for the creation of architectural glimpse statements using the 5W1H maxim. Based on this language, a tool and guidelines are also provided to facilitate the usage of glimpses. Finally, the overall methodology is demonstrated in two case studies.",

This level of computational power is well beyond the reach of any single computer system, whether a common PC or a massively parallel supercomputer. Various ad hoc implementations have already successfully illustrated the Grid\u2019s potential. However, its true global success requires the development of thoroughly specialized supporting technologies, especially for the management of the grid resources. Unfortunately, the Grid\u2019s apparent constitution as a combination of already well-developed and mature technologies is, in fact, quite misleading [2]. The Computational Grid is both (1) a way to share resources and (2) a way to do things faster than a single computer can do. The critical resources in the Grid are the computational power, memory, communication bandwidth, and devices of all kinds that have to be shared [1]. Clearly, it is these resources that will account for the largest fraction of its cost. The remaining cost, which is mainly the cost of the application software to be used, is expected to decrease (to be amortized) as the number of users increase\u2014and there is no great penalty in distributing this software everywhere in the grid. The true waste occurs when the computational and the communication resources that are shared are not efficiently used.

The formal expression of the individual Cohorts using a common formalism (Data Harmonization) is the means for producing valid and accurate results, especially for diseases affecting a small percentage of the population, such as is the primary Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome (pSS), in which case data analytics on an individual cohort may lead to results not easily generalizable and of low accuracy and trust-worthiness. In this work, the approach followed in the HarmonicSS project for bridging the gap among eight heterogeneous Cohorts from eight different Cohort providers is presented, which was based on the software-aided analysis of their individual data structure and terminology. One of the outcomes of this process was a number of reusable parameterizable correspondence patterns (named Mapping Scenarios) that were accordingly instantiated for the accurate and complete mapping of the Cohort data to the Reference Model elements. The mapping scenarios were incorporated in a Visual Mapping Tool, which was developed for facilitating their use from both ICT experts and non-expert users.",

In fact, the average cost per drug candidate exceeds 1 billion Euros and the time to market is still more than 10 years. One of the most important, yet still rather technologically and methodologically poorly supported, steps in clinical research lies in the generation and validation of the hypothesis; ie the research question the validity of which a set of clinical trials will aim at proving. Given the intensive searching and knowledge extraction required at this step of the clinical research lifecycle combined with the wealth and constant increase of the available information in literature, the complexity of this process is extremely high and leaves room for a variety of scientific errors and bottlenecks. This paper describes a novel methodology and a set of mechanisms developed within the PONTE project for facilitating the hypothesis generation and validation process.",

Following, we introduce a neural network-based readjustment mechanism that fits these fusion schemes and aims at dynamically correcting erroneous classification results for image sequences, thus improving the overall recognition rates. The proposed approaches are evaluated under complex real life activity recognition scenarios, and the acquired results are compared and discussed.",

MEQA3 manages QoS in two different points of the service activity, 1) the setup/initialisation period and 2) the service period. During the initialisation phase, the system performs an overall optimal QoS to application allocation considering the user requests, the estimated service requirements and the resource constraints. However, during the service time a resource overloading may occur either by bad initial estimation of application requirements or by some unexpected event that limits its performance. Thus, MEQA3 monitors the QoS of the applications in the user's side and if this exceeds the user specifications then dynamically adapts applications to the current situation. We demonstrate by a videoconference example that MEQA3 is an easy to implement low complexity architecture.",

While Storage Cloud solutions, such as Amazon S3, have already met with success, more fine-grained guarantees on the provided QoS need to be offered for their larger uptake. In this paper, we address the problem of managing SLAs in Storage Clouds by taking advantage of the content terms that pertain to the stored objects thus supporting more efficient capabilities, such as quicker search and retrieval operations. A system that better captures the content of the signed SLAs is very useful, as the benefits in terms of reducing the management overhead while offering better services are potentially significant.",

Furthermore, we thoroughly explain annotation and feature extraction and evaluate the collection based on new behavior-and workflowrecognition approaches.WR Dataset The WR dataset consists of video sequences from the production line of a major automobile manufacturer. We obtained footage of three separate workflow scenarios, resulting in three dataset segments: workflows 1, 2, and 3.(The full dataset is publicly available for download at www. scovis. eu.) The environment is similar in all the datasets. The most prominent elements are workers (usually two or three in the foreground) dressed in blue or black uniforms, blue racks filled with metallic spare parts, a welding cell onto which workers transfer the spare parts, welding tools surrounding the cell, and a robot that picks up the assembled car chassis at the end of a workflow execution. Because this is a real environment, not a laboratory, other elements are present in the sequences as well (mainly in the background), such as small red and green lights, yellow and gray colored pipes, other employees wearing clothes of various colors, and forklifts that remove empty racks and replace them with full ones.

            "Abstract": "The main goal of a recommender system is to provide suggestions, by predicting a set of items that might interest the users. In this paper, we will focus on the role that the popularity of the items can play in the recommendation process. The main idea behind this work is that if an item with a high predicted rating for a user is very popular, this information about its popularity can be effectively employed to select the items to recommend. Indeed, by merging a high predicted rating with a high popularity, the effectiveness of the produced recommendations would increase with respect to a case in which a less popular item is suggested. The proposed strategy aims to employ in the recommendation process new criteria based on the items' popularity, by measuring how much it is preferred by users. Through a post\u2010processing approach, we use this metric to extend one of the most performing state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art recommendation techniques, ie, SVD++. The effectiveness of this hybrid strategy of recommendation has been verified through a series of experiments, which show strong improvements in terms of accuracy wrt SVD++.",

Only rarely have SLAs been applied to real-time systems. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze different fields where SLAs are used, examine the proposed solutions, and investigate how these can be improved in order to better support the creation of real-time service-oriented architectures.",

Secondly, we handle the problem of limited visibility and occlusions by exploiting redundancies through the use of merged information from multiple cameras. Finally, we use the multivariate Student-t distribution as the observation likelihood of the employed Hidden Markov Models, in order to further enhance robustness.

The traditional approaches that create static multimedia indices are inappropriate. To address this problem, a new technique for indexing multimedia content in pervasive environments, is proposed. This technique is based on an innovative algorithm that indexes the multimedia content to a uniform representation (M-hyper rectangle), using a cell topology structure. Groups (clusters) with images that share common content are created using the aforementioned cell topology. The resulting representation is used in order to yield a significant reduction of the computational complexity and retrieval response time.

We present the mathematical basis of the methodology and show in real content that we can have reliable measurements. We also present the results obtained on a real network camera and show that our method can provide a much better estimation of the noise standard deviation compared to common practice but comparable inter-channel and spatial intra-channel correlation estimates. We also provide some guidelines for capturing datasets necessary to apply computer vision tasks.

In this paper we focus on the design and implementation of a highly scalable Trust and Reputation Model for the Internet of Things based on the social approach that the COSMOS project introduces, as part of its final results. We create our model by combining popular solutions proposed for Peer-to-Peer and mobile ad-hoc networks and adapting them on the Internet of Things concept. Each Thing can compute the Trust index of another Thing based on its own experiences, while it has the capability of determining its Reputation Index either by consulting its other \u201cfriends\u201d (Followees) or referring to the Platform, a management system used in COSMOS. The model is tested through simulations of the proposed social system, demonstrating the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This chapter describes schemes for adaptive routing and for adaptive wavelength assignment in an all-optical network, and examines the improvements these two kinds of adaptivity can offer on performance. For the specific adaptive routing scheme that we examine, we demonstrate that, for the hypercube and torus topologies considered, providing (at most) one alternate link at every hop gives a per-wavelength throughput that is close to that achieved by oblivious routing with twice the number of wavelengths per link. Also, we examine the effect of limited wavelength conversion in network performance and find that limited conversion to only one or two adjacent wavelengths can provide a considerable fraction of the improvement that full-wavelength conversion provides over no-wavelength conversion. These results clearly emphasize the need for network designers to investigate the tradeoffs between wavelength conversion, routing flexibility, and hardware cost when designing future optical networks.",

Grid comp-ing provides benefits not only for scientific computing (eg, SETI@ home, which interconnects one million computers across 226 countries with a total processing power of 711 TFLOPS) but also in a commercial environment. It is projected that computing Grids can lower the total IT costs of businesses by 30%.

We compare this method to an echo state network (ESN) approach, which is appropriate for general-purpose time-series classification. In addition, we explore the applicability of several fusion schemes for multicamera configuration in order to mitigate the problem of limited visibility and occlusions.

However, the quality of the produced scintigrams provides an often unreliable diagnostic tool because of a rather bad signal-to-noise ratio and the fact that in certain occasions the regions of interest are too concentrated making it difficult for physician evaluation. The goal of this paper is to achieve a more accurate production of the renal activity graph, by avoiding the inclusion of image artifacts in the detection process. This is achieved by treating pixels as points in a two-dimensional Euclidean space, and exploiting set-theoretic properties and morphological operators. The evaluation of the method in a number of real patient\u2019s scintigrams obtained in a depth of 5 years, showed that, in the majority of the cases, it is feasible to produce a more accurate renogram, for both kidneys and the renal pelvis region, that was helpful for the interpretation of the findings",

            "Abstract": "This article deals with the problem of quality provisioning in business service-oriented environments, examining the resource selection process as an initial matching of the provided to the demanded QoS. It investigates how the application and resource characteristics affect the provided level of QoS, a relationship that intuitively exists but has not yet being mapped. To do so, it focuses on identifying the application and resource parameters that affect the customer-defined QoS parameters. The article realistically centres upon modeling a data mining application and simple PC nodes in order to study how they affect response times. It moves on, by proving the existence of these specific relations and maps them using simple artificial neural networks so as to be able to wrap them in a single mechanism for resource selection based on customer QoS requirements and real time provider QoS capabilities.",

            "Abstract": "Enterprise blockchain solutions attempt to solve the crucial matter of user privacy, albeit that blockchain was initially directed towards full transparency. In the context of Know Your Customer (KYC) standardization, a decentralized schema that enables user privacy protection on enterprise blockchains is proposed with two types of developed smart contracts. Through the public KYC smart contract, a user registers and uploads their KYC information to the exploited IPFS storage, actions interpreted in blockchain transactions on the permissioned blockchain of Alastria Network. Furthermore, through the public KYC smart contract, an admin user approves or rejects the validity and expiration date of the initial user\u2019s KYC documents. Inside the private KYC smart contract, CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) operations for the KYC file repository occur. The presented system introduces effectiveness and time efficiency of operations through its schema simplicity and smart integration of the different technology modules and components. This developed scheme focuses on blockchain technology as the most important and critical part of the architecture and tends to accomplish an optimal schema clarity. View Full-Text",

The presented formal problem constitutes a probabilistic admission control test that may be run by a provider in order to decide whether or not it is worth to admit new workflows into the system, and to decide what the optimum allocation of the workflow to the available resources is. Various options are presented which may be plugged into the formal problem description, depending on the specific needs of individual workflows.",

To this end, a software middleware framework is presented that features a collection of flexible and reusable fault tolerance modules acting at different levels and coping with common fault tolerance requirements. The burden of ad hoc fault tolerance programming is removed from the application developer, while at the same time average fault tolerance support taken at operating system level is avoided.

The sequence of the words can be represented using graphs in which graph similarity metrics and classification algorithms can be applied to produce sentiment predictions. Experiments that were carried out with this method in a Twitter dataset validate the proposed model and allow us to further understand the metrics and the criteria that can be applied in words-graphs to predict the sentiment disposition of short, microblog documents.",

In silico oncology simulation models may be used for evaluating and comparing different therapeutic schemes, while at the same time considering different values of critical parameters which present substantial inter-patient variability. As the number of the involved parameters characterizing both the complex tumour biosystem and possible treatment schemes increases, the resulting exponential increase in computational requirements makes the use of a grid environment for the execution of the simulations a particularly attractive solution. In this paper, a grid-enabled simulation environment for the execution of in silico oncology radiotherapy simulations on grid infrastructures is \u2026",

For the specific adaptive routing scheme that we examine, we demonstrate that, for the hypercube and torus topologies considered, providing (at most) one alternate link at every hop gives a per-wavelength throughput that is close to that achieved by oblivious routing with twice the number of wavelengths per link. Also, we examine the effect of limited wavelength conversion in network performance and find that limited conversion to only one or two adjacent wavelengths can provide a considerable fraction of the improvement that full-wavelength conversion provides over no-wavelength conversion. These results clearly emphasize the need for network designers to investigate the tradeoffs between wavelength \u2026",

In order to model user behavior, we use deep learning algorithms i.e. a variation of Restricted Boltzmann machine and Autoencoders for user encoding and edge classification respectively.

As a result it can be considered as a promising platform for solving large scale intensive problems. For this reason, it can be considered as one of the hottest issues in the computer society. A computational intensive application which can be gained from such a Grid infrastructure is rendering, a process dealing with creating realistic computer-generated image and with many applications ranging from simulation to design and entertainment. To implement, however, a rendering process in a Grid infrastructure is to perform prediction of its computational complexity. This is addressed, in this paper, by using several neural network modules, each of which is appropriate for a given rendering process. For this reason, initially, a feature vector is constructed to describe with high efficiency the parameters affected the complexity of a rendering algorithm. The feature vector is estimated by parsing a file on a RIB format. Then, prediction is performed using a neural network model. Prediction of three types of rendering algorithms is examined; the Ray Tracing, the Radiosity and the Monte Carlo irradiance analysis.",

The network is capable of dynamically reconfiguring itself using (a) simple equations along with a set of welldefined switching rules or (b) a max-flow based algorithm. We describe the required hardware and the reconfiguration methods and we present the application of these methods in typical failure cases.",

Modeling and recognition are performed through the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Gaussian observation likelihoods. The problems of limited visibility and occlusions are addressed by showing how the framework can be extended for multiple cameras, both at the feature and at the state level. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the examined approaches under real-life visual behavior understanding scenarios and we discuss the obtained results.",

Far from being purely ad hoc technological implementations, biometric devices are now seen as being of strategic value and consequently of strategic importance. With the perception of better efficiency and effectiveness, governments are beginning to embrace biometric technologies. Industry is also geared up to sell the products, and all over the world businesses are looking to incorporate biometrics for many different uses ranging from access-control to e-commerce and entertainment.

Thus, MEQA monitors the QoS of the applications on the user's side and if this exceeds the user specifications then dynamically adapts applications to the current situation. We demonstrate by a videoconference example that MEQA is an easy to implement low complexity architecture.",

Fuzzy  c -means (FCM) clustering has also been successfully applied in several image segmentation applications. In this paper, we combine the benefits of these two approaches, by proposing a novel treatment of HMRF models, formulated on the basis of a fuzzy clustering principle. We approach the HMRF model treatment problem as an FCM-type clustering problem, effected by introducing the explicit assumptions of the HMRF model into the fuzzy clustering procedure. Our approach utilizes a fuzzy objective function regularized by Kullback--Leibler divergence information, and is facilitated by application of a mean-field-like approximation of the MRF prior.

The model maps this high level QoS description to quality requirements for the individual resources that compose the overall service. The implementation of the QoS of the overall service is done by providing probability of availability guarantees for certain levels of QoS. Given some constraints on the total assets available for the implementation of a specific service, the model optimally allocates these assets to the system resources in order to implement a specific user/application QoS profile.

The latter is implemented to achieve network-wide objectives such as reducing network congestion by balancing load among the servers.",

In order to be able to meet this requirement the software modules developed should be designed to meet the requisites for commercial business processes on the grid. In this paper we present a module for predicting computational workload of jobs assigned for execution on commercially exploited grid infrastructures. The module aims to identify the complexity of a given job and predict the workload that it is going to stress on the grid infrastructure. The prediction is achieved with the use of a trained artificial neural network, which has been implemented, with the use of the open source software package Joone.

Proper societal modelling for identifying the target groups that will effectively represent the society is usually a fault-prone procedure, while the compilation of the feedback acquisition process is itself slow and monolithic\u2013usually through Gallup polls. ICT is able to contribute to the efficient monitoring and improved prediction of the impact of government proposals, decisions and legislation in society on a large scale, aggregating and analyzing information through information systems. Artificial environments are needed, for enabling, or engendering mass participation under various contexts and for simulating specific aspects of human society and behaviour. These environments would serve as \u201csandboxes\u201d in which e-Government applications can be executed by applying appropriate transformations from real life rules to ICT mechanics. By stimulating this micro-society and observing the reaction of its members, Government may be able to extrapolate conclusions for the real societies.+ Spaces (dubbed Positive Spaces) is an FP7 project (call 4, Objective 7.3) aiming at policy making simulation in virtual spaces.

In Internet-based multimedia applications users with their activity (including social life) are both the source of data and the consumers of the applications, hence being involved in the creation of user-oriented business value. In this paper we present a model that blends video on demand technologies with social media into an innovative and practical distributed application to be used in situations whereby multimedia content needs to be reviewed by multiple individuals that may be geographically dispersed, and altered afterwards by other experts according to the received comments. The proposed system significantly speeds up such remote collaborations while at the same time significantly reducing their cost.",

The proposed architectures show a major advantage on using reduced resources for storing the structuring element (SE), lead to full resource utilization, and provide high processing rates. We concentrate on 1-dim structuring elements and present an improved architecture, that performs dilation and erosion in half the time compared to other architectures, using a workload partitioning technique.

The concept of grid computing is gaining popularity in the last decade due to the rapid growth of the Internet as a medium for global communication and the development of faster hardware and more sophisticated software. Grid computing clusters wide variety of geographically distributed computational resources, including supercomputers, PC's, PDA's and workstations, and presents them as a single unified integrated resource. Many computationally intensive problems can be solved within a more feasible/reasonable time and cost based on a grid infrastructure than using a single resource supercomputing scheme [2].A computationally intensive application, which can benefit from grid infrastructure, is rendering. Rendering is the process of creating realistic images from synthetic three-dimensional (3D) geometrical models and is an essential tool for many fields, ranging from simulation and design to education, entertainment and advertisement [3]. In order to implement a rendering algorithm to a grid infrastructure, two main issues should be addressed. The first refers to the parallelization of the rendering process, while the second to the way of allocating different tasks to the available resources. Parallelization of a rendering process can be performed in frame domain. In this case, each frame of the generated video sequence is handled independently from the previous frames and thus can be assigned to a different resource for processing. The second issue is solved by applying an appropriate scheduling scheme such as the Earliest Deadline \u2026",

In our days, the vast amounts of data being continuously produced add the big data dimension to the trajectory prediction problem, which we are trying to tackle by creating a \u03bb-Architecture based analytics platform. This platform performs both batch and stream analytics tasks and then combines them to perform analytical tasks that cannot be performed by analyzing any of these layers by itself. The biggest benefit of this platform is its context agnostic trait, which allows us to use it for any use case, as long as a time-stamped geo-location stream is provided. The experimental results presented prove that each part of the \u03bb-Architecture performs well at certain targets, making a combination of these parts a necessity in order to improve the overall accuracy and performance of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "While Cloud computing offers the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of software services through the commoditization of IT assets and on-demand usage patterns, one has to consider that Future Internet applications raise the need for environments that can facilitate real-time and interactivity and thus pose specific requirements to the underlying infrastructure. The latter, should be able to efficiently adapt resource provisioning to the dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) demands of such applications. To this direction, in this paper we present a monitoring system that facilitates on-the-fly self-configuration in terms of both the monitoring time intervals and the monitoring parameters. The proposed approach forms a multi-layered monitoring framework for measuring QoS at both application and infrastructure levels targeting trigger events for runtime adaptability of resource provisioning estimation and decision making \u2026",

The recently launched IST-1999-10589 project MKBEEM (Multilingual Knowledge Based European Electronic Marketplace, 1st Feb. 2000-1st Aug. 2002) is rightly in that direction and the work will address basically, written language technologies and its use in the key sector of global business and electronic commerce. In particular MKBEEM will focus on adding multilinguality to all stages of the information cycle, including multilingual content generation and maintenance, automated translation and interpretation and enhancing the natural interactivity and usability of the service with unconstrained language input. On the Knowledge engineering side, the MKBEEM Ontologies will provide a consensual representation of the electronic commerce field in three typical Domains (Tourism, Mail order, Retailers) allowing the exchanges independently of the language of the end user, the service, or the content provider. Ontologies will be used for classifying and indexing catalogues, for filtering user\u2019s query, for facilitating multilingual man-machine dialogues between user and software agent, and for inferring information that is relevant to the user\u2019s request. This paper concentrates on ontology issues, while the used human language processing approaches will be presented closely in our later papers.",

In the field of ambient assisted living, behavioral biometrics find an important niche. Individuals suffering from the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases (MCI, Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia) need supervision in their daily activities. In this context, an unobtrusive system to monitor subjects and alert formal and informal carers providing information on both physical and emotional status is of great importance and positively affects multiple stakeholders. The primary aim of this paper is to describe a methodology for recognizing the emotional status of a subject using facial expressions and to identify its uses, in conjunction with pre-existing risk-assessment methodologies, for its integration into the context of a smart monitoring system for subjects suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Paul Ekman\u2019s research provided the background on the universality of facial expressions as indicators of underlying emotions. The methodology then makes use of computational geometry, image processing and graph theory algorithms for the detection of regions of interest and then a neural network is used for the final classification. Findings are coupled with previous published work for risk assessment and alert generation in the context of an ambient assisted living environment based on Service oriented architecture principles, aimed at remote web-based estimation of the cognitive and physical status of MCI and dementia patients.",

The creation of the blockchain marks the time when we start building distributed peer-to-peer networks consisting of non-trusting members that interact with each other without a trusted intermediary but in a verifiable manner. In this paper, we propose a decentralized application (DApp) based on blockchain technology for sharing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors' data, and demonstrate various challenges addressed during the development process. This application combines blockchain technology with IoT and operates through smart contracts that are executed on the Ethereum blockchain. More specifically the application is a platform for sharing (buying and selling) measurements of IoT weather sensors and operates on the Ethereum blockchain, acting as a marketplace \u2026",

Both are language-neutral and noise-tolerant, guaranteeing high effectiveness and robustness in the settings we are considering. To ensure our approach can be integrated into practical applications with large volumes of data, we also aim at enhancing its time efficiency: we propose alternative sets of features with low extraction cost, explore dimensionality reduction and discretization techniques and experiment with multiple classification algorithms.

The objective is to minimize distribution costs while maximizing customer satisfaction and respecting the constraints concerning the vehicle capacity, the time windows for customer service and the driver working hours per day. A model describing all these requirements has been developed as well as a genetic algorithm to solve the problem. High Performance Computing has been used to allow the pursuit for a near-optimal solution in a sensible amount of time, as the parallel chromosome fitness evaluation counterbalances the increased size and complexity of the problem.",

            "Abstract": "The Grid computing concept, which allows users to integrate administratively and geographically dispersed computing resources, has been gaining traction in a number of application areas during the past few years. By interconnecting many\u2013heterogeneous, though usually virtualized\u2013computing resources, virtual computer centers or supercomputers can be created, providing a seamless supply of computing resources. Grid computing provides benefits not only for scientific computing (eg, SETI@ home, which interconnects one million computers across 226 countries with a total processing power of 711 TFLOPS) but also in a commercial environment. It is projected that computing Grids can lower the total IT costs of businesses by 30%. The report \u201cGrid Computing: A Vertical Market Perspective 2005\u20132010\u201d(by The Insight Research Corporation) estimates an increase of worldwide Grid spending from $714.9 million \u2026",

Different objective evaluations equal to different policy implementations/measures. This process infuses a notion of subjectivity into policy making which has to be appreciated by the citizens in order to achieve public acceptance and enhance transparency. In order to assist the citizens understand the policies, we propose a web-based game called Poliglob in which citizens learn the objectives and their tradeoffs through interactions and visualizations. This work focuses on the game score model which is counting in both the correlation of the user selection to the various optimal (pareto) solutions but also the user prioritization of objectives' importance.",

The library facilitates the integration of new algorithms and it evolves as new modular applications are built. The library components belong to the control objects layer of the open controller architecture and implement functionality for sensor interfacing, sensor modeling, pattern recognition, state estimation and state regulation. The validity of the approach is verified by composing real industrial applications. The experimental results indicate the high quality of the developed systems.",

Usable REST APIs are providing access to two valuable business assets: the users' generated content and social graph. The lack of standards and the antagonistic nature of the SNSs have resulted in the use of proprietary API specifications and-in turn-data models. Each SNS uses a different method to access and a different way to describe notions which are largely similar, eg \u201cfriends\u201d or shared \u201cmultimedia items\u201d. The conceptual similarity between entities \u201cliving\u201d in the SNS, creates a remarkable opportunity: The aggregation of the social functionality and data can provide the basis for a unique platform on top of which third parties can deploy new added value services, seamlessly using the underlying SNSs APIs.

The additional workload that is produced by the replication is handled by a resource management scheme which is based on the knapsack formulation and which aims to maximize the utilization and profit of the Grid infrastructure.

In that frame, we present a design pattern for monitoring and evaluating SLA terms on service-oriented architectures. This mechanism takes into account the actual capabilities of the service provider infrastructure and maps them to customer-centric Quality of Service terms, thus ensuring that agreements will not be validated. In this way it enables the estimation of the actual capability of the service to provide Quality of Service at a certain degree.",

Without a strict, fast, and deterministic method of exchanging data we cannot be sure about the performance and efficiency of transactions and applications. In the present work we propose an architecture for a Data as a Service (DaaS) Marketplace, hosted exclusively in a cloud environment. The architecture includes a storage management engine that ensures the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, a monitoring component that enables real time decisions about the resources used, and a resolution engine that provides semantic data discovery and ranking based on user queries. We show that the proposed system outperforms the classic ElasticSearch queries in data discovery use cases, providing more accurate results. Furthermore, the semantic enhancement of the process adds extra results which extend the user query with a more abstract definition to each notion. Finally, we show that the real-time scaling, provided by the data storage manager component, limits QoS requirements by decreasing the latency of the read and write data requests. View Full-Text",

Concatenative synthesis is one of the simplest methods for speech synthesis and at the same time bypasses most of the problems encountered by articulatory and formant synthesis techniques. The method relies on designing and creating the acoustic inventory of the language by taking real recorded speech, cutting it into segments and concatenating these segments back together during synthesis. The design and implementation of the acoustic database is a key factor for the performance of the synthesizer, since all the possible phone-to-phone transitions must be considered in order to minimize abrupt discontinuities and thus maximize the naturalness of the synthesized utterances.",

By observing these vectors we can determine when there is action in a particular ROI. The second part of the framework lies in examining whether the detected activity corresponds to a workflow related event. This is accomplished by HMM modeling.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for fair scheduling, and we compare it to other scheduling schemes such as the earliest deadline first (EDF) and the first come first served (FCFS) schemes. Our algorithm uses a max-min fair sharing approach for providing fair access to users. When there is no shortage of resources, the algorithm assigns to each task enough computational power for it to finish within its deadline. When there is congestion, the main idea is to fairly reduce the CPU rates assigned to the tasks so that the share of resources that each user gets is proportional to the users weight. The weight of a user may be defined as the users contribution to the infrastructure or the price he is willing to pay for services or any other socioeconomic consideration. In our algorithms, all tasks whose requirements are lower than their fair share CPU rate are served at their demanded CPU rates. However, the CPU rates \u2026",

In this paper we present a scheme for advancing and managing Quality of Service (QoS) attributes contained in Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts of Grids that follow the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). In order to achieve this, the execution environment of the Grid infrastructure establishes and exploits the synergies between the various modules of the architecture that participate in the management of the execution and the enforcement of the SLA contractual terms.

However, detecting their meaning may be rather difficult not only for software agents but also humans since a considerable amount of them is not accompanied by their long form (aka expansion), while, in general, every abbreviation has more than one possible meaning (aka sense) on average. Moreover, even in cases that the abbreviations are specified in the document, detecting their expansion may be still difficult due to partial or non-similarity among them. For this purpose a system has been developed for detecting the meaning of abbreviations used in clinical studies. In the background innovative algorithms and techniques have been used for both abbreviation recognition and suggestion purposes.

An emerging trend is the secondary use of such data (in most cases anonymized for privacy reasons), for purposes other than healthcare, such as for generating accurate disorder epidemiology datasets, real world treatment progress assessment and patient selection for clinical trials among others. The structure and purpose of the EHRs pose significant limitations in the richness and the complexity of the questions to be posed. In fact, the latter case introduces a greater challenge; it requires that two different domains (in terms of semantics) need to be interlinked-clinical research and healthcare.

The system under consideration is based on the method of concatenative synthesis and follows the Bell Labs approach to this technique. In order that the input text to the GRTTS is translated into continuous synthetic speech the following modules have already been studied and implemented:(i) module for the linguistic analysis of the input text;(ii) the acoustic inventory module. On the same time it is under development the duration module of the GRTTS, for the computation of the appropriate temporal structure of synthesized speech. The objectives of the above studies, in combination with the concatenative synthesis technique, which is one of the simplest methods for speech synthesis, are to bypass most of the problems encountered by other synthesis methods such as articulatory and formant synthesis systems. The major objective is to minimize abrupt discontinuities and thus maximize the naturalness of the synthesized utterances.",

Both issues are addressed in this paper. Descriptor organization is performed using a fuzzy classification scheme fragmented into multidimensional classes, instead of the previous works where fuzzy histograms were created in one dimension using, for example, the feature vector norm. Multidimensionality relates the descriptors with one another and thus allows a compact and meaningful visual representation by mapping the elements of the resulted feature vectors with a physical visual interpretation.

            "Abstract": "A prominent challenge in our information age is the classification over high frequency data streams. In this research, we propose an innovative and high-accurate text stream classification model that is designed in an elastic distributed way and is capable to service text load with fluctuated frequency. In this classification model, text is represented as N-Gram Graphs and the classification process takes place using text preprocessing, graph similarity and feature classification techniques following the supervised machine learning approach. The work involves the analysis of many variations of the proposed model and its parameters, such as various representations of text as N-Gram Graphs, graph comparisons metrics and classification methods in order to conclude to the most accurate setup. To deal with the scalability, the availability and the timely response in case of high frequency text we employ the Beam programming model. Using the Beam programming model the classification process occurs as a sequence of distinct tasks and facilitates the distributed implementation of the most computational demanding tasks of the inference stage. The proposed model and the various parameters that constitute it are evaluated experimentally and the high frequency stream emulated using two public datasets (20NewsGroup and Reuters-21578) that are commonly used in the literature for text classification",

The advancements in distributed computing have made it possible to follow a service oriented approach, taking advantage of the benefits this provides. In this context, applications consist of soft real-time critical application service components that interact with each other to provide the corresponding application functionality, forming application workflows. In this paper we present a new architectural design and implementation of a Workflow Management approach. This approach covers enacting soft real-time application service components according to a workflow description language, synchronizing the application components, monitoring the execution and reacting to events within a distributed virtualized \u2026",

We propose to use the produced summaries as training set for neural network based Evaluative Rectification. Evaluative Rectification is a method that exploits an expert user's feedback regarding the correctness of an activity recognition framework on part of the data in order to enhance future classification results. The size of the training sample set usually depends on the topology of the network and on the complexity of the environment and activities observed. However, as is shown by the experiments conducted in a real-world industrial activity recognition dataset, using a much smaller but representative sample stemming from our summarization technique leads to significantly higher accuracy rates than \u2026",

Current trends in the field move away from models of human managed networks and towards the self-manageable, cooperating Clouds. This goal is synonymous to building software that is able to make decisions required to reconfigure itself in a way that it resists failures and, at the same time, makes optimal use of the resources available to it. The heart of each decision making mechanism is always the data that is fed to it, which assigns a very central role to Monitoring mechanisms in federated and self-manageable Clouds.",

We propose a prediction model that leverages the time series characteristics of resource utilization employing an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN). To conclude to a close to optimal LSTM-RNN architecture we use a genetic algorithm.

Application adaptation arises as an appropriate solution for quality-of-service assurance in such dynamic service infrastructures. Application adaptation basically involves adapting application characteristics according to the network resource availability. We formulate the problem of adaptation of multimedia applications to network infrastructure as well as to user- and application-imposed constraints and preferences.

The coefficient of functional components are obtained using a training set of appropriate samples, the pairs of which are estimated based on a runtime estimation model relied on a least squares approximation scheme. The advantages of the proposed non-linear task workload prediction scheme is that (i) it is not constrained by analysis of source code (analytical methods), which is practically impossible to be implemented in complicated real-life applications or (ii) it does not exploit the variations of the workload statistics as the \u2026",

Some support is required by the Data Provider, who actively sets up the system. This means the Data Provider knows exactly how security is achieved and can therefore trust the system fully. Java security management is utilised and the system is made efficient through the hosting of a Mobile Agent platform. Each component of the system is given an appropriate security profile so that no unauthorised access to information is ever possible.

Further analysis of the recorded data indicated, amongst others, that there are considerable differences among abbreviations and their expansions or senses depending on the scientific domain in which they are used. Also, the abbreviations consisting of three and especially two characters are already highly ambiguous and their possible senses are going to be significantly increased in the following years.",

The objective is to minimize distribution costs while maximizing customer satisfaction and respecting certain constraints, like vehicle capacity, time windows for customer service, driver working hours per day, predetermined or non-compatible pairings amongst customers and vehicles and others. A significant feature of the problem is the fact that the demand of each customer is stochastic. A model describing all these requirements has been developed as well as a heuristic genetic algorithm to solve the problem. High Performance Computing has been used to allow the pursuit for a near-optimal solution in a sensible amount of time, as the parallelization counterbalances the increased size and complexity of the problem. The system solves complex logistics planning problems, optimizing for a non-homogenous fleet of trucks and multiple products. The nature of the operations involved in our genetic algorithm in combination with the use of dynamic population permits the asynchronous processing of individuals by sending newborn individuals to a pool from where they can be distributed over several processors for evaluation and then return to the population. Additionally a heuristic mechanism was engineered in order to preserve the generation of individuals that satisfy as many constraints as possible.",

A novel approach is proposed, in which high-level advance reservations, supporting flexible start and end time, are combined with low-level soft real-time scheduling, allowing for the concurrent deployment of multiple services on the same host while fulfilling their QoS requirements. By undertaking a stochastic approach, in which a-priori knowledge is leveraged about the probability of activation of the application workflows within the reserved time-frame, the proposed methodology allows for the achievement of various trade-offs between the need for respecting QoS constraints (user perspective) and the need for having good resource saturation levels (service provider perspective).",

The need for data sharing between heterogeneous sources paves the way for cohort harmonization; thus, fostering data integration and interdisciplinary research. Unmet needs in chronic diseases, as well as in other diseases, can be addressed based on the integration of patient health records and the sharing of information of the clinical picture and outcome. The stratification of patients, the determination of various clinical and outcome features, and the identification of novel biomarkers for the different phenotypes of the disease characterize the impact of cohort harmonization in patient-centered clinical research and in precision medicine. Subsequently, the establishment of matching techniques and ontologies for the creation of data schemas are also presented. The exploitation of web \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of selecting service instances to execute workflow processes by not only taking into consideration Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, posed by the end-users, but also the business relationships between different service providers. These business / strategic relationships, the providers have, may affect the parameters of the service instances regarding the offered QoS level, and therefore the relationships need to be modeled and expressed with specific metrics. In this paper we present an innovative algorithm that maps workflow processes to service instances by taking into account the aforementioned metrics during the selection process. We also demonstrate the operation of the implemented algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness using a scenario, based on a 3D image rendering application.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays the general interest on Cloud Computing as a technical and business solution is growing. The pool of available cloud applications, services and platforms is increasing leveraging new features for the cloud assets provisioned to the end user. This massive amount and divergence of cloud features across the cloud stack layers introduces considerable management overhead to the various stakeholders for the effective management of both the offered products and the system itself. In this paper we focus on the challenges arise for providing dynamic elasticity management as one the fundamental features of Clouds. To this direction, we introduce the concept of Elasticity as a Service and present a generic, service-oriented framework capable to fulfill, in a personalized manner, the elasticity management needs of any cloud environment and cloud-enabled application.",

The actual problem is a complex real-life vehicle routing problem regarding the distribution of products to customers. A non homogenous fleet of vehicles with limited capacity and allowed travel time is available to satisfy the stochastic demand of a set of different types of customers with earliest and latest time for servicing. The objective is to minimize distribution costs respecting the imposed constraints (vehicle capacity, customer time windows, driver working hours and so on). The approach for solving the problem was based on a \"cluster and route\" HGA. Several genetic operators, selection and replacement methods were tested until the HGA became efficient for optimization of a multi-extrema search space system (multi-modal optimization).

These parameters include allocation percentages, real-time scheduling decisions and co-placement of VMs when these are deployed concurrently on the same physical node, as dictated by the server consolidation trend and the recent advances in the Cloud computing systems. Different combinations of VM workload types are investigated in relation to the aforementioned factors in order to find the optimal allocation strategies. What is more, different levels of memory sharing are applied, based on the coupling of VMs to cores on a multi-core architecture. For all the aforementioned cases, the effect on the score of specific benchmarks running inside the VMs is measured.

It investigates the most popular document (\"tweet\") representation methods which feed sentiment evaluation mechanisms. In particular, we study the bag-of-words, n-grams and n-gram graphs approaches and for each of them we evaluate the performance of a lexicon-based and 7 learning-based classification algorithms (namely SVM, Na\\\"ive Bayesian Networks, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptrons, Best-First Trees, Functional Trees and C4.5) as well as their combinations, using a set of 4451 manually annotated tweets. The results demonstrate the superiority of learning-based methods and in particular of n-gram graphs approaches for predicting the sentiment of tweets. They also show that the combinatory approach has impressive effects on n-grams, raising the confidence up to 83.15% on the 5-Grams, using majority vote and a balanced dataset (equal number of positive, negative and neutral tweets for training). In the n-gram graph cases the improvement was small to none, reaching 94.52% on the 4-gram graphs, using Orthodromic distance and a threshold of 0.001.",

The latter can efficiently handle user queries which intend to elicit the appropriate information from data sources.

Consequently the information retrieval is a quite difficult process even for IT or DB experts, taking into account the limited contributions of relational databases from the conceptual point of view. Ontologies enable users to formally describe a domain of knowledge in terms of concepts and relations among them and hence they can be used for unambiguously specifying the information captured by the relational database.

            "Abstract": "This paper deals with a real-life vehicle routing problem concerning the distribution of products to customers with stochastic demands. The objective is to minimize distribution costs while maximizing customer satisfaction and respecting certain constraints, like vehicle capacity, time windows for customer service, driver working hours per day, predetermined or non-compatible pairings amongst customers and vehicles and others. A significant feature of the problem is the fact that the demand of each customer is stochastic. A model describing all these requirements has been developed as well as a heuristic genetic algorithm to solve the problem. High Performance Computing has been used to allow the pursuit for a near-optimal solution in a sensible amount of time, as the parallelization counterbalances the increased size and complexity of the problem. The system solves complex logistics planning problems \u2026",

This resulted in a continuously growing competition between service providers that struggle to win a greater share of the market. In this frame, the service providers have to come up with ways that will enable them to maximize their profits by optimizing their offering and negotiation protocols. This paper introduces the concept and the design pattern for a mechanism that enables service providers to refine their Service Level Agreement (SLA) offers, employing the Service Oriented Architectures\u2019(SOA) benefits. The mechanism estimates the near-optimal values for the SLA terms so as to avoid violations that will lead to money losses.

Student's-t mixture models have been proposed recently as a heavy-tailed, tolerant to outliers alternative to Gaussian mixture models. In this paper we exploit the robustness of student's-t mixture models in the context of hidden Markov models by introducing a new hidden Markov chain model where the hidden state distributions are student's-t mixture models.

In doing this we identify one section of the web page as the one containing the useful information and we proceed in extracting semantic tokens contained in this section by using clustering techniques and other tools of statistical origin.

However, due to the multi-layer nature of these environments, the QoS characteristics of the infrastructure are revealed to the service-consumer through a complex procedure, in which each layer maps its own QoS parameters to another. Most of these approaches are starting the delegation of QoS information from the service provider\u2019s side, resulting in delivering low-level terms to the service consumer. In this paper, we define the architecture of a mechanism that is able to provide application-oriented and user-specific QoS information in the internal layers of the Grid middleware.

However, in existing ontology-based systems the ontologies are tightly coupled with the rest of the system components. As a result, large parts of the system have to be developed in a logic programming language, typically used in describing ontologies, and adhere to the ontological knowledge model and representation. This eventually impedes the use of ontologies in industrial integrated systems. In this paper, we present an architecture that isolates the ontologybased components, waives the representation and programming language constraints and simplifies the knowledge model that components outside the ontology have to be aware of. The architecture makes it possible to access the ontological information and the federated data using exclusively object-oriented structures and interfaces \u2026",

These services mainly rely on the sincerity of users, who can spoof the location they report to them. For applications with higher security requirements, the user should be unable to report a location different than the real one. Proof of Location protocols provide a solution to secure localization by validating the device\u2019s location with the help of nearby nodes. We propose QuietPlace, a novel protocol that is based on ultrasound and provides strong identities, proving the location of the owner of a device, without exposing though their identity. QuietPlace provides unforgeable proof that is able to resist to various attacks while respecting the users\u2019 privacy. It can work regardless of certificate authority and location-based service and is able to support trust schemas that evaluate the participants\u2019 behavior. We implement and validate the protocol for Android devices, showing that ultrasound-based profiles offer a better performance in terms of maximum receiving distance than audible profiles, and discuss its strengths and weaknesses, making suggestions about future work.

On top of that, it enhances pre-existing threats by offering new means for accessing and exploiting Critical Infrastructures. As the kinds of potential threats evolve, the security, safety and resilience of these infrastructures must be updated accordingly, both at a prevention, as well as a real-time confrontation level. Our research approaches the security of these infrastructures with a focus on the data and utilization of every possible piece of information that derives from this ecosystem. Such a task is quite daunting, since the quantity of data that requires processing resides in the Big Dataspace. To address this, we introduce a new well-defined Information Life Cycle in order to properly model and optimise the way information flows through a modern security system. This life cycle covers all the possible stages, starting from the collection phase up until the exploitation of information intelligence. That ensures the efficiency of data processing and filtering while increasing both the veracity and validity of the final outcome. In addition, an agile Framework is introduced that is optimised to take full advantage of the Information Life Cycle. As a result, it exploits the generated knowledge taking the correct sequence of actions that will successfully address possible threats. This Framework leverages every possible data source that could provide vital information to Critical Infrastructures by performing analysis and data fusion being able to cope with data variety and variability.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for event detection on social media, which aims at clustering media items into groups of events based on their textural information as well as available metadata. Our approach is based on distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process (ddCRP), a clustering approach resembling Dirichlet process algorithm. Furthermore, we scrutinize the effectiveness of a series of pre-processing steps in improving the detection performance. We experimentally evaluated our method using the Social Event Detection (SED) dataset of MediaEval 2013 benchmarking workshop, which pertains to the discovery of social events and their grouping in event-specific clusters. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method attains very good performance rates compared to existing approaches. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Blockchains are attracting the attention of stakeholders in many industrial domains, including the logistics and supply chain industries. Blockchain technology can effectively contribute in recording every single asset throughout its flow on the supply chain, contribute in tracking orders, receipts, and payments, while track digital assets such as warranties and licenses in a unified and transparent way. The paper provides, through its methodology, a detailed analysis of the blockchain fit in the supply chain industry. It defines the specific elements of blockchain that affect supply chain such as scalability, performance, consensus mechanism, privacy considerations, location proof and cost, and details on the impact that blockchains will have in disrupting the supply chain industry. Discussing the tradeoff between consensus cost, throughput and validation time it proceeds with a suggested high-level architectural approach, and concludes as a result with a discussion on changes needed and challenges faced for an in-vivo deployment of blockchains in the supply chain industry. While the technological features of modern blockchains can effectively facilitate supply chain uses cases, the various challenges that still remain, bring in front of us a wide set of needed changes and further research efforts for achieving a global, production level blockchain for the supply chain industry.

In that frame, the customer comes against the problem of selecting a service from a plethora of available ones. This paper advocates that the large number of customers can provide the solution to this problem, by exploiting the experience of those that present similar behavior when they are asked to rate a provided service.",

            "Abstract": "The retrieval performance of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems is often disappointingly low, mainly due to the subjectivity of human perception. Relevance feedback (RF) has been widely considered as a powerful tool to enhance CBIR systems by incorporating human perception subjectivity into the retrieval procedure. However, usually, the obtained feedback logs are scarce and contain lots of outliers, undermining the RF adaptation effectiveness. In this paper, we tackle these shortcomings exploiting the inherent outlier downweighting capabilities mixtures of Student's t distributions offer. Each semantic class is modeled by a mixture of t distributions fitted to data provided by the system operators. Further, the semantic class models get personalized by application of a novel, efficient RF algorithm allowing for the robust adaptation of the semantic class models to the accumulated feedback of each user. The efficacy of our approach is validated through a series of experiments using objective performance criteria",

The discussion focuses on how such a problem may be mathematically formalized, in terms of both constraints and objective function to be optimized, which also accounts for possible business rules for regulating the deployment of the workflows. The presented formal problem constitutes a probabilistic admission control test that may be run by a provider in order to decide whether or not it is worth to admit new workflows into the system and to decide what the optimum allocation of the workflow to the available resources is. Various options are presented, which may be plugged into the formal problem description, depending on the specific needs of individual workflows.

            "Abstract": "Hidden Markov models using Gaussian mixture models as their hidden state distributions have been successfully applied in text-dependent speaker identification applications. Nevertheless, it is well-known that Gaussian mixture models are very vulnerable to the presence of outliers in the fitting set used for their estimation. Student's-t mixture models have been proposed recently as a heavy-tailed, tolerant to outliers alternative to Gaussian mixture models. In this paper we exploit the robustness of Student's-t mixture models in the context of hidden Markov models by introducing a new hidden Markov chain model where the hidden state distributions are Student' s-t mixture models. We experimentally show that our model outperforms competing text-dependent speaker identification techniques",

Taking into consideration the complexity of distributed environments, significant challenges exist in providing and managing the offered on-demand resources with the required level of Quality of Service (QoS), especially for real-time interactive multimedia applications. Monitoring mechanisms are a fundamental part in service-based platforms that support realtime QoS guarantees by providing coherent and consistent real-time attributes at various levels of the infrastructure (application, network, storage, processing). In this paper we present an architectural design and implementation of a complete monitoring framework for measuring QoS at both application and infrastructure levels targeting trigger events for runtime adaptability of resource provisioning \u2026",

Pixel regions with consistent color and motion properties are extracted from these 3D volumes by a space-time segmentation technique based on a novel machine learning algorithm. Each region is then described by a high-dimensional point whose components represent the average position, motion velocity and color of the region. Subsequently, the spatio-temporal relations of the regions are deduced and a concise, graph-based description of them is generated. This graph-based description of the video shot\u2019s content, along with the region centroids, comprises a concise yet powerful description of the video-shot and is used for retrieval applications. The retrieval problem is formulated as an inexact graph matching problem between the data video \u2026",
