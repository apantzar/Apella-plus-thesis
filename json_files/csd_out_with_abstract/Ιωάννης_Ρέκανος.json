In particular, the smoothed pseudo-Wigner distribution, the continuous wavelet transform and the Hilbert\u2013Huang transform are compared and evaluated in terms of their ability to analyse dispersive elastic waves. The waves under consideration are transient flexural ones generated by an impact in a beam. In view of the results of the comparative study, the advantages and shortcomings of each method are presented and discussed.",

The uniplanar EBG is particularly assessed, due to its fabrication simplicity and is found to exhibit a propagation mode that cancels the desired bandgap behaviour. Two new planar EBG structures, without such modes are presented, retaining the distinct feature of easy fabrication, since the metallic structures are exclusively on the interface layers, with no vertical connections. The EBGs are optimized to maximize the bandgap, making them suitable for the design of wideband microwave circuits and antennas.",

Second, to quantify the acoustic performance of the novel barriers both mathematically and experimentally in a standardized, well controlled process. The insertion loss of different types of barriers with modified edge shapes and acoustical conditions were investigated systematically in comparison with conventional ones using a method based on BEM. The comparison highlighted the influence of shape and edge configuration on barrier efficiency and allowed the design of novel barriers with optimal performance. The novel barriers were tested and their efficiency was quantified experimentally using the Maximum \u2026",

The construction of these networks is implemented by means of the orthogonal least squares algorithm. By applying this training algorithm we can calculate the values of the free parameters of the network and also define its structure. Thus a trial-and-error strategy concerning the definition of the network size is avoided. In particular, the network is constructed to perform the mapping from scattered-field measurements to electromagnetic and geometric properties of the scatterer. Although this approach can be applied to various inverse scattering applications, we focus on the reconstruction of cylindrical dielectric scatterers from simulated measurements of the scattered electric field, while transverse magnetic illuminations are used. The objective is to estimate the relative dielectric constant \u2026",

Therefore, in order to accurately predict the received signals, it is necessary to properly model the diffraction coefficient at the building edge and to accurately represent the shape and the electrical properties of the building near the corner. This paper compares ray-tracing predictions to measurements of received power and root mean square (rms) delay spread and shows the need for a diffraction coefficient having larger values than suggested by the commonly used heuristic diffraction coefficient. A new heuristic diffraction coefficient is proposed that has higher diffracted field strength in the deep shadow region and in the region between the two shadow boundaries. The proposed diffraction coefficient shows better agreement with measurements of both \u2026",

An augmented cost functional is defined taking into account the fulfillment of the Maxwell's curl equations by means of Lagrange multipliers.

The auxiliary differential equations are discretized by means of central differences and are further employed within a conventional FDTD scheme. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulating the propagation of a wideband Gaussian pulse that excites a one-dimensional Cole-Cole medium with two relaxation times.",

The contour of the obstacle is described by a parametric model utilizing cubic B-splines, while the obstacle boundary is considered acoustically either soft or hard.

Then the shape is updated iteratively by minimizing a cost function representing the discrepancy between the measured and the estimated field.

First, to optimize the performance of barriers by appropriately modifying both the shape and the acoustical conditions at the edge to suppress the sound pressure. Second, to quantify the acoustic performance of the novel barriers both mathematically and experimentally in a standardized, well controlled process. The insertion loss of different types of barriers with modified edge shapes and acoustical conditions were investigated systematically in comparison with conventional ones using a method based on BEM. The comparison highlighted the influence of shape and edge configuration on barrier efficiency and allowed the design of novel barriers with optimal performance. The novel barriers were tested and their efficiency was quantified experimentally using the Maximum Length Sequence (MLS) technique, which offers the advantage of in-situ measurements in the presence of extraneous noise. The experimental results are shown to be in good agreement with the experiments. Based on the aforementioned procedure, a unified framework was established, witch allows the design of potentially improved noise barriers.",

To circumvent this difficulty, the relative complex permittivity of the medium is approximated by Pad\u00e9 approximants resulting in auxiliary differential equations of integer order. Moreover, it is proven that under certain conditions the Pad\u00e9 approximation is equivalent to one given by a sum of Debye terms. Hence, an alternative set of auxiliary differential equations is derived. Over a wideband frequency domain, the comparisons between analytical and calculated values of the relative complex permittivity as well as of the transfer function inside the dispersive medium illustrate the \u2026",

In the present paper, a heuristic method for level change detection in time series is presented. The method uses higher-order statistics, namely, the skewness and the kurtosis, and can identify both the existence of a change in the level of the time series and the time instance when it has happened. The technique is straightforwardly applicable to the detection of outliers in time series and promises to have several applications.

Therefore, the purely static problem in the regions filled with silicon oxide is totally separated from the diffusion problem in the conducting regions. The latter one is solved by means of a simple and efficient DuFort-Frankel technique using finite differences, while the static problem is dealt with by means of a finite element method with coarse meshing, since outside the conductors the field variations are much less intense.

In an H-N medium, the time-domain polarization relation involves a fractional differential operator, whose analytical evaluation is troublesome. Moreover, if the fractional differential operator is approximated by a sum of fractional time derivatives, the numerical treatment of the polarization relation results in significant memory storage demands, because fractional derivatives are not local. However, by an appropriate approximation of the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov definition of fractional derivatives, an FDTD scheme with reasonable memory requirements is feasible. In particular, the coefficients that appear in the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov definition are approximated by sums of decaying exponentials.

A frequency mixing (inter-modulation) was observed between an ultrasound wave, propagating in the bone, and a low-frequency vibration applied directly to the bone specimens. The appearance of side frequencies, which are related to the vibrational excitation, around the fundamental ultrasound frequency manifests the modulation nonlinear phenomenon.

In such media, the time-domain representation of the polarization relation involves time derivatives of fractional orders. Hence, the direct application of the FDTD method meets significant difficulties. In the proposed method, an auxiliary differential equation of integer order that approximates the polarization relation is derived. This approximation is based on Pad\u00e9 approximants of the relative complex permittivity. As a result the auxiliary differential equation can be easily discretized by means of finite differences and then included within the standard FDTD scheme. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulating the propagation of wideband pulses.",

To this end, HOS have been applied to the design of advanced communications, sonar, radar, speech, biomedical, geophysical, and imaging systems.

The main difficulty in time-domain modeling of a Cole-Cole medium is that the polarization relation that describes its electromagnetic behavior is a differential equation of fractional order. By definition, the fractional derivative of a function is a nonlocal operator and its computation at a time instant involves all previous function values. Thus, the memory demands of a typical FDTD scheme for Cole-Cole media would be high. However, by an appropriate approximation of the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov definition of the fractional derivative, we can implement an FDTD scheme with reasonable memory demands. This is achieved by means of sums of decaying exponentials used to approximate the coefficients that appear in the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov definition. As a result, the FDTD scheme requires the \u2026",

Two different time-frequency representations, namely the continuous wavelet transform and the smoothed pseudo-Wigner distribution are employed. Simulated and measured flexural waves in a cracked beam are analysed and both the location and size of the crack are accurately determined. The location of the crack is estimated using the arrival time of reflected waves with different group velocities. The ratio of the reflected wave energy to the incident wave one is calculated and used as an indicator of the crack size. Wave experiments in a slender brass beam are in good agreement with predictions verifying the efficiency of the method. In view of the results obtained, the advantages and shortcomings of the time-frequency representations employed are presented and discussed.",

The proposed time-domain method is based on the very different nature of the electromagnetic problem in the conductors and semiconductors, compared to the insulating media that separate conducting regions and fill the intermediate volume. Therefore, the purely static problem in the regions filled with silicon oxide is totally separated from the diffusion problem in the conducting regions. The latter one is solved by means of a simple and efficient DuFort-Frankel technique using finite differences, while the static problem is dealt with by means of a finite element method with coarse meshing, since outside the conductors the field variations are much less intense. In each time step, the problems in the two regions are appropriately coupled by means of proper interface conditions.",

In the present paper a heuristic method for level change detection in non-stationary time series is presented. The method uses higher order statistics, namely the skewness and the kurtosis, and can identify both the existence of a change in the level of the time series as well as the time point it has happened. The technique is tested with both simulated and real world data and is straightforward applicable to the detection of outliers in time series.",

Lett., vol. 11, pp. 281-284, 2012). The scheme is based on the approximation of the fractional derivative, which appears in the polarization relation, by means of a semi-local method. This approach ends up to an approximate time-domain polarization relation given by a first-order differential equation with nonconstant coefficients. As a result, this scheme is very attractive because it has very limited storage demands compared to all the previously reported schemes. However, in this letter, it is shown that the proposed scheme is actually untrustworthy. This criticism is based on both analytical and numerical evidences and illustrates that the semi-local approximation of fractional derivatives is very poor.",

Analysis of the experimental results, when applying the KD to EBS recorded from patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction, justify an efficient performance of the KD to outwit the noise presence by accurately extracting the authentic structure of EBS. Since the KD removes the undesired signal from the EBS recordings, it can easily be used for data-volume reduction when long-term recordings are employed, e.g., in sleep laboratories, intensive care units, homecare telemedical devices. Due to its simplicity, the KD can be implemented in a real-time context and can be used for continuous EBS screening.",

Significant reduction of the computation time is obtained by introducing the adjoint state vector methodology.",

            "Abstract": "An adaptive learning method for recurrent fuzzy systems is proposed. The method modifies the SARPROP algorithm, originally developed for static neural models, in order to be applied to dynamic models. A comparative analysis with dynamic RPROP and back propagation through time is given, indicating the enhanced learning capabilities of the proposed algorithm",
