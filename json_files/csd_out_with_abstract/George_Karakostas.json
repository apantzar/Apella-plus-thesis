The customers are serviced by a set of flexible servers, i.e., a server is capable of serving more than one class of customers and the sets of classes that the servers are capable of serving may overlap. We would like to choose an assignment of servers that achieves the maximal capacity of the given queueing network, where the maximal capacity is \u03bb\u2217 if the network can be stabilized for all arrival rates \u03bb < \u03bb\u2217 and cannot possibly be stabilized for all \u03bb > \u03bb\u2217. We examine the situation where there is a restriction on the number of servers that are able to serve a class, and reduce the maximal capacity objective to a maximum throughput allocation problem of independent interest: the total discrete capacity constrained problem (TDCCP).

            "Abstract": "In network routing problems, assuming that packet transmission incurs costs, the optimal solution would chose to route all flow along shortest paths. Intermediate nodes will need to relay the flow in most cases and therefore will require some sort of payment, if the flow they are asked to relay does not bring any utility to them. We consider such a forwarding game on directed graphs where nodes need to send certain amount of flow (packets) to specific destinations, possibly through several relay nodes. All nodes in the network act selfishly and will forward packets only if it is to their benefit. The model assumes that each node receives some utility from sending its flow to the predetermined destinations and from receiving flow. However each node has to decide whether to relay flow as an intermediate node from other sources, as relaying has an associated cost. This model assumes that there is no payment scheme. Somewhat surprisingly, this game has possibly several strategies that allow a significant amount of the flow to be routed while all nodes have a positive outcome, which suggests that in this model the nodes have indeed incentives to relay flow even if payments are not explicitly allocated. Previous theoretical work establishes the existence of these strategies (Nash equilibrium solutions). In this work we simplify the original network model, and provide the first experimental evaluation of these equilibria for different classes of graphs. We provide clear evidence that these equilibrium solutions are indeed significant and establish how these equilibria depend on various properties of the network such as average degrees and flow demand \u2026",

In certain scenarios, vehicle locations can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy, and this information can be used to reduce downlink infrastructure-to-vehicle energy communication costs. Offline scheduling results are first presented that provide lower bounds on the energy needed to satisfy arriving vehicular communication requirements. We show that the packet-based scheduling case can be formulated as a generalization of the classical single-machine job scheduling problem with a tardiness penalty, which is referred to as \u03b1-Earliness-Tardiness. A proof is given that shows that even under a simple distance-dependent exponential radio path loss assumption, the problem is NP-complete.

A variety of graph algorithms have been developed to analyze the structure of social networks and to assess the roles or importance of the individual players.

The most popular of these centrality measures require the computation or enumeration of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph.

In this paper, we show that, by combining this with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) forwarding, downlink (DL) traffic schedules can be generated, whose energy costs are lower than that in the single-hop case. This is accomplished by having the roadside units (RSUs) dynamically forward packets through vehicles, which are in energy-favorable locations. This paper considers both constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) air-interface options. We first derive offline schedulers for the DL RSU energy usage when V2V forwarding is added to RSU-to-vehicle communication. Both in-channel and off-channel forwarding cases are considered. The CBR and VBR cases are obtained using integer linear programming (ILP) and time-expanded graph (TEG) formulations, respectively. These schedulers provide \u2026",

Hard deadlines are difficult to meet in conventional computation offloading due to the stochastic nature of the wireless channels involved. Rather than using binary offload decisions, we permit concurrent remote and local job execution when it is needed to ensure task completion deadlines. The paper addresses this problem for homogeneous Markovian wireless channel models. An online energy-optimal computation offloading algorithm, OnOpt, is proposed. Its energy optimality is shown by constructing a time-dilated absorbing Markov process and applying dynamic programming. Closed form results are derived for general Markovian processes, and the Gilbert-Elliott channel model is used to show how the particular structure of the Markov chain can be exploited in computing optimal offload \u2026",

The paper uses this mechanism to adapt to changes in channel conditions during the offload. Unlike the contiguous task offload case however, the upload initiation times of each part must be determined dynamically. This is done while ensuring that hard task deadlines are always satisfied.

            "Abstract": "Web caches can achieve high hit rates through exploitation of the properties of object access distribution, which is governed by Zipf\u2019s law, in general. Web caches need to store the most popular objects and typically employ the Least Frequently Used (LFU) replacement policy, which achieves high cache hit rates, and often the highest hit rate. Correct implementation of LFU requires that replacement decisions are made based on frequency access information (popularity), for all the objects accessed since the beginning of a cache\u2019s operation. The immensely large number of such objects renders the implementation of LFU impractical in many environments. In this paper, we introduce an alternative implementation of LFU, the Window-LFU policy, which makes replacement decisions based on access frequency measurements in a recent past, called time-window. Window-LFU achieves cache hit rates equivalent to those of LFU, but with access information from a shorter history, leading to high performance at a low cost (significantly lower than that of LFU). We provide analytical results which enable one to estimate the appropriate window size, in order to achieve the target cache hit rate of LFU. Furthermore, we present simulation results using actual traces, which indicate that the proposed Window-LFU policy behaves as expected and in some configurations it leads to better results than theoretically expected, due to dependencies between successive Web objects requests in real environments.

We study the traffic equilibria arising from selfish routing of individual users in networks with side constraints. For the problem without side constraints the classic Wardrop principle suggests that in equilibrium for each origin-destination pair the latency on all the used routes is equal or less to the latency on all unused routes. In this paper we use a natural extension of the Wardrop principle [13] in order to obtain results on selfish routing with side constraints. The extended Wardrop principle suggests that in equilibrium flow is routed along paths of minimal latency according to a modified function that essentially incorporates penalty terms for the side constraints. This approach provides a basis for the systematic application of relevant optimization theory to selfish routing problems.",

In particular, we use the existence of two big and well-separated sets of nodes in the solution of the semidefinite relaxation for balanced cut, proven in [2]. We observe that a solution of the semidefinite relaxation for vertex cover, when strengthened with the triangle inequalities, can be transformed into a solution of a balanced cut problem, and therefore the existence of big well-separated sets in the sense of [2] translates into the existence of a big independent set.",

Each node has to decide whether to relay flow as an intermediate node from other sources, as relaying incurs only costs. To induce nodes into acting as intermediaries, the model implements a reputation-based mechanism which punishes non-cooperative nodes by cutting off links to them, a decision that is made in a very local fashion. In our setting, the nodes know only the state of the network in their local neighborhood, and can only decide on the amount of the flow on their outgoing edges, unlike the previously considered models where users have full \u2026",

In order to execute jobs in the cloud, the user uploads must occur over a base station channel that is shared by all of the uploading users. Since the job completion times are subject to hard deadline constraints, this restricts the feasible set of jobs that can be processed. The system is modelled as a competitive game in which each user is interested in minimizing its own energy consumption. The game is subject to the real-time constraints imposed by the job execution deadlines, user specific channel bit rates, and the competition over the shared communication channel. The paper shows that for a wide range of parameters, a game where each user independently sets its offloading decisions always has a pure Nash equilibrium, and a Gauss-Seidel-like method for determining this equilibrium is introduced.

The issue of designing optimal tax vectors for selfish routing games has been studied extensively in the literature. We study for the first time taxation for networks with atomic users which have unsplittable traffic demands and are heterogeneous, i.e., have different sensitivities to taxes. On the positive side, we show the existence of weakly-optimal taxes for single-source network games.

While in the typical selfish routing setting the users follow a strategy that minimizes their individual cost by taking into account the (dynamic) congestion due to the current routing pattern, an oblivious user ignores congestion altogether. Instead, he decides his routing on the basis of cheapest routes on a network without any flow whatsoever. These cheapest routes can be, for example, the shortest paths in the network without any flow. This model tries to capture the fact that routing tables for at least a fraction of the flow in large scale networks such as the Internet may be based on the physical distances or hops between routers alone.

This paper considers both splittable RSU assignment (SRA) and unsplittable RSU asssignment (URA) scheduling. An offline integer linear programming bound is first derived for normalized min-max RSU energy usage. We then show that in the SRA case, there is a polynomial complexity 2-approximation bound for the normalized min-max energy schedule. This paper then proposes several online scheduling algorithms. The first is a greedy online algorithm that makes simple RSU selections, followed by minimum-energy time slot assignments. A normalized min-max algorithm is then proposed [2 \u2026",

We generalize previous results of Cole, Dodis and Roughgarden that held for a single origin-destination pair to the multicommodity setting. Our approach, which could be of independent interest, is based on the formulation of traffic equilibria as a nonlinear complementarity problem by Aashtiani and Magnanti [1]. We extend this formulation so that each of its solutions will give us a set of taxes that forces the network users to conform, at equilibrium, to a certain prescribed routing. We use the special nature of the prescribed minimum-latency flow in order to reduce the difficult nonlinear complementarity formulation to a pair of primal-dual linear programs. LP duality is then enough to derive our results.",

An integer linear program (ILP) formulation is first given that computes the minimum cost placement based on the input traffic traces and candidate locations.

We observe that a solution of the semidefinite relaxation for vertex cover, when strengthened with the triangle inequalities, can be transformed into a solution of a balanced cut problem, and therefore the existence of big well-separated sets in the sense of Arora et al.

Any traffic equilibrium reached by the selfish users who are conscious of both the travel latencies and the taxes will minimize the social cost, i.e., will minimize the total latency.Optimal taxes incur desirable behavior from the society point of view but they cause disutility to the network users since the users\u2019 total cost is in general increased [4]. Excessive disutility due to taxation may be undesirable from the societal perspective as well.

A treasure and an exit are located at unknown positions on the perimeter of a disk and at known arc distance. A team of two robots start from the center of the disk, and their goal is to fetch the treasure to the exit. At any time the robots can move anywhere they choose on the disk, independently of each other, with the same speed. A robot detects an interesting point (treasure or exit) only if it passes over the exact location of that point. We are interested in designing distributed algorithms that minimize the worst-case treasure-evacuation time, i.e. the time it takes for the treasure to be discovered and brought (fetched) to the exit by any of the robots.   The communication protocol between the robots is either wireless, where information is shared at any time, or face-to-face (i.e. non-wireless), where information can be shared only if the robots meet. For both models we obtain upper bounds for fetching the treasure to the exit. Our main technical contribution pertains to the face-to-face model. More specifically, we demonstrate how robots can exchange information without meeting, effectively achieving a highly efficient treasure-evacuation protocol which is minimally affected by the lack of distant communication. Finally, we complement our positive results above by providing a lower bound in the face-to-face model.",

We first derive an integer linear programming bound on the min-max energy usage of the roadside units for a given input sample function.

The first is a low complexity First-Come-First-Assigned (FCFA) scheduler that makes greedy RSU selections followed by a minimum energy time slot assignment.

One seeks to quantify the resulting price of anarchy, i.e., the ratio of the cost of the worst traffic equilibrium to the system optimum, as a function of \u03b1. It is well-known that for \u03b1=0 and linear latency functions the price of anarchy is at most 4/3 (J. ACM 49, 236\u2013259, 2002). If \u03b1 tends to 1, the price of anarchy should also tend to 1 for any reasonable algorithm used by the coordinator.  We analyze two such algorithms for Stackelberg routing, LLF and SCALE.

A stream of weighted items arrive one at a time at the entrance of a buffer with two holding locations. A processor (or observer) can process (observe) an item at the buffer location it chooses, deriving this way the weight of the observed item as profit. The main constraint is that the processor can only move synchronously with the item stream. Persistence is the online problem of scheduling the processor movements through the buffer so that its total derived value is maximized under this constraint. We study the performance of the straight-forward heuristic Threshold, i.e., forcing the processor to \u201cfollow\u201d an item through the whole buffer only if its value is above a threshold. We analyze both the optimal offline and Threshold algorithms in the cases where the \u2026",
