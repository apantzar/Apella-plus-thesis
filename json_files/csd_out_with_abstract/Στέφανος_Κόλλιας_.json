            "Abstract": "This paper describes  salienShrink , a method to denoise images based on computing a map of salient coefficients in the wavelet domain and use it to improve common denoising algorithms. By salient, we refer to those coefficients that correspond mostly to pure signal and should therefore be preserved throughout the denoising procedure. We use a computationally efficient model to detect salient regions in the bands of the multiresolution wavelet transform. These regions are used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the noise level, improving the performance of existing well known shrinkage methods. Extensive experimental results on the  BiShrink  method show that the proposed method effectively enhances PSNR and improves the visual quality of the denoised images.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we present a new approach towards the extraction of affine image regions based on detecting shape-stable boundaries from a multi-scale image representation. We construct an affine morphological scale space (AMSS) representation [1], which performs anisotropic diffusion while preserving boundaries and being invariant to affine transformations. We extract the transition boundaries of the diffusivity velocity map and track their evolution at each level of the scale-space. We then determine the stability of the boundary shape through a minimization process over different scales. Unlike most state of the art detectors which use the Gaussian scale space for multi-scale image representation, our approach is intrinsically affine invariant. We evaluate our detector by measuring repeatability of regions in transformed images of the same scene and comparing it to the state-of-the-art region detectors [2].",

More precisely, some applications deal with random information and events, others deal with imprecise and fuzzy knowledge, and still others deal with missing or distorted information - resulting in uncertainty. To deal with uncertainty in the semantic Web and its applications, many researchers have proposed extending OWL and the description logic (DL) formalisms with special mathematical frameworks. Researchers have proposed probabilistic, possibilistic, and fuzzy extensions, among others. Researchers have studied fuzzy extensions most extensively, providing impressive results on semantics, reasoning algorithms, and implementations.

From the comprehensive experimental evaluations in a real home environment,it is shown that the proposed fall detection method can detect different types of falls (falls in different orientations, falls with occlusions in a home environment) with high accuracy while achieving better performance than hand-crafted features based ones.",

Then for each of the foreground VOPs of a frame, a feature vector is constructed using low level features of the VOP, such as color and size. Afterwards, for a given shot, key-VOP poses are extracted for each VOP, using an optimization method for locating VOP poses of minimally correlated feature vectors. Finally an iterative process is performed to link each key VOP of a shot to another, according to a correlation measure.

By means of two-dimensional manifolds (surfaces), embedded into the unit cube, useful properties of the transform space are explored. The expressive power of the GLT is demonstrated by means of a global descriptor, called View Area Representation (VAR). VAR is an intuitive and physically meaningful shape descriptor which is robust to noise, captures curvature and leads to the introduction of novel and hybrid (global/local) shape features.

For this reason ontologies need to be brought into mutual agreement (aligned). One important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of class and property names of ontologies using string-distance metrics. Today quite a lot of such metrics exist in literature. But all of them have been initially developed for different applications and fields, resulting in poor performance when applied in this new domain.

A novel methodology is presented, in which deep neural architectures that have been trained to provide highly accurate predictions over existing datasets are adapted, in a consistent way, to make predictions over different contexts and datasets. Unified prediction is then achieved over the original and the new datasets. Successful application is illustrated through a large experimental study for prediction of Parkinson\u2019s disease from MRI and DaTScans, as well as for prediction of COVID-19 from CT scans and X-rays.",

Inside this ontology we will present MPEG\u20104 facial animation concepts and its relationship with emotion through expression profiles that utilize psychological models of emotions. The ontology allows storing, indexing and retrieving prerecorded synthetic facial animations that can express a given emotion. Also this ontology can be used a refined knowledge base in regards to the emotional facial animation creation.

While these features can be used for simple representation purposes, in our approach they are utilized to provide feedback on the users\u2019 emotional state, hoping to provide next-generation interfaces that are able to recognize the emotional states of their users.",

Nevertheless, the issue of selecting the regularization parameter as well as the smoothing filter still constitutes an open research topic. A model of regularized image restoration is introduced and analyzed in this paper. The proposed model assumes that wavelet filter banks replace the smoothing filter of conventional regularized restoration. Filter factorizations for the optimal design of wavelet filter banks using the generalized-cross-validation (GCV) criterion are presented, and novel expressions of the influence matrix, which is used to calculate the GCV error, are derived. The error of the GCV method is expressed in terms of the modulation matrix of the filter bank and the modulation vector of the degradation filter. The expressions are given in general form for optimal wavelet filter bank design upon arbitrary \u2026",

To achieve this goal we utilize both Facial Definition Parameters (FDPs) and Facial Animation Parameters (FAPs). We introduce a way for modeling the primary expressions using FAPs and we describe a rule-based technique for the synthesis of intermediate ones. Furthermore, a relation between FAPs and the activation parameter proposed in some classic psychological studies is established. In this way we try to get advantage of the extended work that have been done from psychologists and which covers much more expressions than the archetypal ones the computer society concentrated on. The overall scheme leads to a parameterized approach of synthesizing facial and can be used for the creation of MPEG-4 compatible synthetic video sequences.",

The retraining algorithm results in the minimization of a convex function subject to linear constraints, leading to very fast network weight adaptation. Current knowledge is unsupervisedly extracted using a face-body detector, based on Gaussian p.d.f models. A binary template matching technique is also incorporated, which imposes shape constraints to candidate face regions.

We then use the same method to encode planar curvature into the intensity of gray scale images and we demonstrate the effectiveness of this encoding by proposing a shape-based triple correlation invariant image classification scheme.

Recently, structure-guided feature detectors have been proposed, exploiting image edges to accurately capture local shape. Among them, the W\u03b1SH detector [Varytimidis et al., 2012] starts from sampling binary edges and exploits \u03b1-shapes, a computational geometry representation that describes local shape in different scales. In this work, we propose a novel image sampling method, based on dithering smooth image functions other than intensity. Samples are extracted on image contours representing the underlying shapes, with sampling density determined by image functions like the gradient or Hessian response, rather than being fixed. We thoroughly evaluate the parameters of the method, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a series of matching and retrieval experiments.",

            "Abstract": "Content analysis technologies give more and more emphasis on multimedia semantics. However most watermarking systems are frame-oriented and do not focus on the protection of semantic regions. As a result, they fail to protect semantic content, especially in case of the copy-paste attack. In this framework, a novel unsupervised semantic region watermark encoding scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme is applied to real and artwork human objects, localized by two different face and body detection methods. Next, an invariant method is designed, based on Hu moments, for properly encoding the watermark information into each semantic region, using a chaotic pseudo-random number generator. Finally, experiments are carried out, to illustrate the advantages of the proposed scheme, such as:(a) robustness to RST, copy-paste and other attacks, and (b) low overhead transmission.",

            "Abstract": "A neural network scheme is presented for modeling VBR MPEG-2 video sources. In particular, three nonlinear autoregressive models (NAR) are proposed to model the aggregate MPEG-2 video sequence, each of which corresponds to one of the three types of frames (I, P and B frames). Then, the optimal mean-squared error predictor of the NAR model is implemented using a feedforward neural network with a tapped delay line (TDL) filter. A novel algorithm is also introduced, which handles the significant effect of the correlation among the I, P and B frames on the estimation of network resources. Furthermore, a new mechanism is proposed to improve the modeling accuracy, especially at high bit rates, based on a generalized regression neural network. Experimental studies and computer simulations illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed model as predictor of the network resources compared to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An investigation into approaches to model and predict the costs, risks and outcomes, relating to a common failure mode within a large population of remotely monitored engines will be presented. This investigation will cover the relevant aspects of lifecycle management, customer operating cycle, visibility of classified issues remotely using low sample rate remote monitoring systems and identification of the most appropriate repair regime. Unlike previously identified studies, the datasets used are larger comprising sensor readings from over a 120 gas turbine units (distributed across the world) which total 100 million observations taken across 117 parameters. These are cross referenced with relevant service events (preventative, corrective, fault investigation and observational reports) and service execution data (spares and manpower required) gathered over a period of up-to 11 years. We have now succeeded in identifying behaviours in a particular problem domain using techniques such as K-means, that indicate non-optimal decisions may have been made (with the benefit of hindsight). This indicates that the intended outcome of the overall research to produce of quantitative models of the different strategies and applying them to optimise for the best outcome both in terms of and customer and supplier objectives in a justifiable form is possible.",

As the applications become more complex, the research for better visual features is still active. In this paper we present a feature detector that exploits the inherent geometry of sampled image edges using \u03b1-shapes. We propose a novel edge sampling scheme that exploits local shape and investigate different triangulations of sampled points. We also introduce a novel approach to represent the anisotropy in a triangulation along with different feature selection methods. Our detector provides a small number of distinctive features that is ideal for large scale applications, while achieving competitive performance in a series of matching and retrieval experiments.",

By leveraging signal and image pre-processing techniques, the high and low energy spectra of the signals were appropriated into a compatible format for CNN training. Firstly, a CNN was employed to unfold the signal into either twelve or forty-eight perturbation location sources, followed by a k-means clustering and k-Nearest Neighbour coarse-to-fine procedure, which significantly increases the unfolding resolution.

The new method takes advantage of the natural specifications of the specific Trace transform, such as noise robustness, translation invariance and scalability easiness and produces effective, simple and fast created features.

Although XML Schema provides the syntactic, structural, cardinality and datatyping constraints required by MPEG-7, it does not provide the semantic interoperability required to make MPEG-7 visual descriptors accessible by other domains. The knowledge representation provided by the ontology can be used to develop tools which perform knowledge-based reasoning. For the construction of the ontology we use the RDFS ontology language. We present the problems that occurred, mainly, due to the RDFS modelling limitations. Finally, we propose a way to apply reasoning using the VD ontology.",

The power of the noise is estimated from the variance of wavelet coefficients. The Wiener filter used in restoring the corrupted image is updated at each iteration step. Hard wavelet thresholding allows for appropriate selection of initial estimates of the restored image and the noise. The initial estimate of the restored image is then improved by updating these estimates iteratively. Conditions for convergence of the proposed procedure are derived. Experimental results for restoring images corrupted by colored noise are presented as well.

Considerable research has been carried out into salient region detection methods based either on models emulating human visual attention (VA) mechanisms or on computational approximations. Most of the proposed methods are bottom-up and their major goal is to filter out redundant visual information. In this paper, we propose and elaborate on a saliency detection model that treats a video sequence as a spatiotemporal volume and generates a local saliency measure for each visual unit (voxel). This computation involves an optimization process incorporating inter- and intra-feature competition at the voxel level. Perceptual decomposition of the input, spatiotemporal center-surround interactions and the integration of heterogeneous feature conspicuity values are described and an experimental framework for video classification is set up. This framework consists of a series of experiments that shows the effect of saliency in classification performance and let us draw conclusions on how well the detected salient regions represent the visual input. A comparison is attempted that shows the potential of the proposed method.",

Thus, given the range of applications that require random inputs and the cost of actual random number generating equipment, the establishment of reliable tests of randomness becomes necessary. To day, the spectral test seems to be the only reliable test for randomness, as it can examine the correlation between successive symbols in a sequence. The drawback of the spectral test is that its results can only be visualized when comparing for correlation between consecutive pairs or triplets of symbols, while larger groups of symbols can only be examined mechanistically. In this paper, after reviewing the main points of random number and chaotic functions theory, we introduce a 2-dimensional spectral test of randomness that is based on iterated function systems (IFSs) and use it to examine the quality of various chaotic functions as random number generators and to draw conclusions on the randomness of sequences produced by deterministic processes.",

We propose a framework for retrieving surgical videos and a protocol for evaluating the results. The method is composed of temporal shot segmentation and representation based on deep features, and the protocol introduces novel criteria to the field. The experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed method and highlight the path towards a more effective protocol for evaluating surgical videos.",

            "Abstract": "The property of transitivity is one of the most important for fuzzy binary relations, especially in the cases when they are used for the representation of real-life similarity or ordering information. As far as the algorithmic part of the actual calculation of the transitive closure of such relations is concerned, works in the literature mainly focus on crisp symmetric relations, paying little attention to the case of general fuzzy binary relations. Most works that deal with the algorithmic part of the transitive closure of fuzzy relations focus only on the case of max\u2013min transitivity, disregarding other types of transitivity. In this paper, after formalizing the notion of sparseness and providing a representation model for sparse relations that displays both computational and storage merits, we propose an algorithm for the incremental update of fuzzy sup-t transitive relations.

Still, plain hierarchical clustering does not provide a satisfactory framework for extracting meaningful results in such cases. Major drawbacks have to be tackled, such as curse of dimensionality and initial error propagation, as well as complexity and data set size issues.

In this paper, we use saliency for feature point detection in videos and incorporate color and motion apart from intensity. Our method uses a multi-scale volumetric representation of the video and involves spatiotemporal operations at the voxel level. Saliency is computed by a global minimization process constrained by pure volumetric constraints, each of them being related to an informative visual aspect, namely spatial proximity, scale and feature similarity (intensity, color, motion).

In this paper, we examine one of the most popular active contour models, snakes, and propose a snake model, modifying terms and introducing a model-based one that eliminates basic problems through the usage of prior shape knowledge in the model. A probabilistic rule-driven utilization of the proposed model follows, being able to handle (or cope with) objects of different shapes, contour complexities and motions; different environments, indoor and outdoor; cluttered sequences; and cases where background is complex (not smooth) and when moving objects get partially occluded.

After that a region classification process is employed to assign semantic labels using a confidence degree and simultaneously merge regions based on their semantic similarity. This information comprises the assertional component of a fuzzy knowledge base which is used for the refinement of mistakenly classified regions and also for the extraction of rich implicit knowledge used for global image classification. This semantic metadata of images is stored in a knowledge repository by the fuzzy reasoning engine, also permitting image retrieval and ranking.",

The SSRB interest operator detects stable boundary regions within the multi-scale morphological image representation [1]. To detect robust boundary regions, we perform multi-scale analysis via anisotropic diffusion operators to preserve boundaries and guarantee invariance to affine transformations. We extract the transition boundaries of the diffusivity velocity map and track their evolution at each level of the scale-space. The stability of the boundary shape is subsequently estimated through a minimization process over different scales. Unlike most state of the art detectors which use the Gaussian scale space for multi-scale image representation, our approach is intrinsically affine invariant [1].

However most cryptographic systems deal with multimedia files as binary large objects, without taking into consideration regions of semantic information. These regions may need better protection or can be the only regions that need protection, depending on the specific application. Towards this direction, in this paper we propose a human video object encryption system based on the chaotic logistic map. Initially face regions are efficiently detected and afterwards body regions are extracted, using geometric information of the location of face regions. Next the pixels of extracted human video objects are encrypted using an iterative cipher module, which is based on a feedback mechanism responsible for mixing the current encryption parameters with encrypted information of the previous step \u2026",

Then, for each feature, we construct a sparse spatial map of all remaining features, encoding their normalized position and appearance, typically vector quantized to visual word. An image is represented by a collection of such feature maps and RANSAC-like matching is reduced to a number of set intersections. The required index space is still quadratic in the number of features. To make it linear, we propose a novel feature selection model tailored to our feature map representation, replacing our earlier hashing approach. The resulting index space is \u2026",

The active research effort has been reflected in many special issues of leading journals dedicated to this topic [2],[3]. Some of these approaches are now in the first stage of commercial exploitation, such as the VisualSEEK and QBIC [4] prototypes.

Current effort extends previous work on profile extraction via clustering techniques and on integrated e-learning systems. It relies on the fundamental IEEE e-learning model, suitably adapted to reflect and focus on profiling aspects of the system.",

This reflects the globally accepted goals of teaching history courses. Such teaching goals can be greatly supported by computer-based applications, which can offer access to vast amounts of historical texts and data to be used next to the main scholar textbook and be analyzed by pupils. Still, existing applications seem to be quite inadequate for this purpose, as they require that the pupil be already informed on a matter, before the initiation of a quest for data.

As the amount of information available in the form of multimedia content continuously increases, the necessity for efficient methods for the retrieval of visual information becomes increasingly evident. Additionally, the continuously increasing number of people with access to such collections further dictates that more emphasis be put on attributes such as the user-friendliness and flexibility of any multimedia content retrieval scheme. These facts, along with the diversity of available content collections, varying from restricted, eg medical databases and satellite photo collections, to general purpose collections, which contain heterogeneous images and videos, and the diversity of requirements regarding the amount of knowledge about the content that should be used for indexing, have led to the development of a wide range of solutions. They have also triggered the development of relevant standards allowing object-based functionalities (MPEG-4), efficient access to content (MPEG-7) and supporting the whole multimedia chain (MPEG-21). Current indexing schemes employ descriptors ranging from low-level features to higher-level semantic concepts [1]. Low-level features are machine-oriented and can be automatically extracted (eg MPEG-7 compliant descriptors [2]), whereas high-level concepts require manual annotation of the medium or are restricted to specific domains.",

To achieve this goal, an adaptive two-dimensional Gaussian model of skin color distribution is initially used in order to detect face regions within the initial image. Next each face region is decomposed into three levels with ten subbands, using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and three pairs of subbands are formed (HL3, HL2),(LH3, LH2) and (HH3, HH2). Afterwards Qualified Significant Wavelet Trees (QSWTs), which are derived from the Embedded Zerotree Wavelet (EZW) algorithm and they are high-energy coefficient paths, are estimated for a pair of subbands. Finally visually recognizable watermark patterns are redundantly embedded to the coefficients of the highest energy QSWTs and the IDWT is applied to provide the watermarked face area. Performance of the proposed face region watermarking system is tested under various signal distortions such as JPEG lossy compression, sharpening and blurring. Experimental results on real life images indicate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme.",

In this paper, a fully automatic method for fast tracking of video objects in a video sequence using affine invariant normalization is proposed. Initially, the detection of a video object is achieved using a GVF snake. Next, a vector of the affine parameters of each contour of the extracted video object in two successive frames is computed using affine-invariant normalization. Under the hypothesis that these contours are similar, the affine transformation between the two contours is computed in a very fast way. Using this transformation to predict the position of the contour in the next frame allows initialization of the GVF snake very close to the real position.

The field is of great significance from economic, food safety and public health points of views. The paper focuses on effective food production, food maintenance energy management and food retail packaging labeling control, using recent advances in machine learning. Appropriate deep neural architectures are adopted and used for this purpose, including Fully Convolutional Networks, Long Short-Term Memories and Recurrent Neural Networks, Auto-Encoders and Attention mechanisms, Latent Variable extraction and clustering, as well as Domain Adaptation. Three experimental studies are presented, illustrating the ability of these AI methodologies to produce state-of-the-art performance in the whole food supply chain. In particular, these concern:(i) predicting plant growth and tomato yield in greenhouses, thus matching food production to market needs and reducing food waste or food unavailability;(ii) optimizing energy consumption across large networks of food retail refrigeration systems, through optimal selection of systems that can be shut-down and through prediction of the respective food de-freezing times, during peaks of power demand load;(iii) optical recognition and verification of food consumption expiry date in automatic inspection of retail packaged food, thus ensuring safety of food and people\u2019s health.

SandS is a complete ecosystem of users within a social network developing a collective intelligence and adapting its operation through appropriately processed feedback. In the research work discussed in this paper we will investigate SandS from the user perspective and how users can be modeled through a number of fuzzy knowledge formalism through stereotypical user profiles. Additionally, context modeling in pervasive computing systems and especially in the SandS smart home paradigm is examined through appropriate representation of context cues during overall interaction.",

            "Abstract": "Sparse fuzzy ordering and partial ordering relations have recently become of great importance in the field of knowledge systems. As the size of the relations utilized in such a framework is extremely large, efficient algorithms are needed for their handling. More specifically, when a part of such a relation is updated, the property of transitivity needs to be re-established in timely manner, as the knowledge system often becomes unusable until this process is completed. In this paper we propose two algorithms for the incremental update of fuzzy transitive relations. The first one focuses on the incremental update of a part of an already transitive relation, while the other tackles the complete transitive closure of any relation. For the average sparse relation, both of the proposed algorithms have considerably smaller computational complexity than the classical approach, which we also prove experimentally via application to \u2026",

An emotion recognition system based on facial cues is used to illustrate the performance of this approach. Although some archetypal emotions are considered to be universal, there is no doubt that the way they are expressed diversifies from one individual to the other. The initial generic system is adapted in order to meet the specific user\u2019s traits.",

            "Abstract": "Automatic content-based analysis and indexing of broadcast news recordings or digitized news archives is becoming an important tool in the framework of many multimedia interactive services such as news summarization, browsing, retrieval and news-on-demand (NoD) applications. Existing approaches have achieved high performance in such applications but heavily rely on textual cues such as closed caption tokens and teletext transcripts. We present an efficient technique for temporal segmentation and parsing of news recordings based on visual cues that can either be employed as a stand-alone application for non-closed captioned broadcasts or integrated with audio and textual cues of existing systems. The technique involves robust face detection by means of color segmentation, skin color matching and shape processing, and is able to identify typical news instances like anchor persons, reports and \u2026",

Self organizing feature maps are used to model spatiotemporal information extracted through image processing. Two models are built for each gesture category and, along with appropriate distance metrics, produce a validated classification mechanism that performs consistently during experiments on acted gestures video sequences. The main focus of current work is to tackle intra and inter user variability during gesture performance by adding flexibility to the decoding procedure and allowing the algorithm to perform an optimal trajectory search while the processing speed of both the feature extraction and the recognition process indicate that the proposed architecture is appropriate for real time and large scale lexicon applications.",

As there are, at present, no effective therapies, early diagnosis along with avoidance of misdiagnosis seem to be critical in ensuring a good quality of life for patients. In this sense, the adoption of computer-aided-diagnosis tools can offer significant assistance to clinicians. In the present paper, we provide in the first place a comprehensive recording of medical examinations relevant to those disorders. Then, a review is conducted concerning the use of Machine Learning techniques in supporting diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, with reference to at times used medical datasets. Special attention has been given to the field of Deep Learning. In addition to that, we communicate the launch of a newly created dataset for \u2026",

This work revisits one of the most popular deformable templates for shape modeling and object tracking, the Snakes, and proposes a modified snake model and a probabilistic utilization of it for object tracking. Special attention has been drawn to complex natural (indoor and outdoor) sequences, where temporal clutter, abrupt motion and external lighting changes are crucial for the accuracy of the results, also focusing on the ability of the proposed approach to handle specific HCI problems, such as face and facial feature tracking. A variety of image sequences are used to illustrate the method's capability, providing \u2026",

Firstly, a human video object detector is applied to the initial image. Zernike and the Hu moments of each human video object are estimated and an invariant function for watermarking is incorporated. Then, the watermark is generated modifying the moment values of each human video object. In the detection scheme, a neural network classifier is initially used in order to extract possible watermarked human video objects from each received input image. Then, a watermark detection procedure is applied for video object authentication. A full experiment confirms the promising performance of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the performances of the two types of moments are extensively investigated under several attacks, verifying the robustness of Zernike moments comparing to Hu moments.",

The approach includes two steps: in the first, a forward model analyzes the clinical and, possibly, non-clinical factors (explanatory variables), predicting whether positive decisions (response variables) should be given to the ambulance call, or not; in the second, a backward model analyzes the latent variables extracted from the forward model to infer the decision making procedure. The forward model is implemented through a machine, or deep learning technique, whilst the backward model is implemented through unsupervised learning. An experimental study is presented, which illustrates the obtained results, by investigating emergency ambulance calls to people in nursing and residential care homes, over a one-year period, using an anonymized data set provided by East Midlands Ambulance Service in United Kingdom.

            "Abstract": "In the framework of the MPEG-4 video-coding standard, an important innovation was made by the introduction of Video Objects (VOs) and Video Object Planes (VOPs), to improve coding efficiency and provide multimedia capabilities to future encoders. A VO corresponds to a semantically meaningful object, such as a human, a ship, a building etc., while a VOP is the projection of the VO onto an image plane [1]. Many applications can gain from VOP segmentation, like multimedia synthesis, sophisticated database query and retrieval, object-based transmission and robot navigation into unknown space [2].However although semantic entities can be identified almost effortlessly by humans, this remains a fundamental and one of the most challenging research problems in the fields of robot vision and image/video processing. During the last decade two directions were investigated:(A) The first direction assumes user interaction. The user initially sketches a contour around the video object of interest and then the video object is extracted by the machine and tracked through time.(B) The second direction considers unsupervised schemes, where the machine detects and extracts video objects automatically. Both directions have their advantages and disadvantages. For example schemes of the first category provide more accurate results, but it is difficult to be included into real time applications (eg videoconference, robot vision, emergency detection) as they generally demand considerable human effort. On the other hand unsupervised techniques provide effectual results only when the adopted homogeneity criterion is satisfied by the analyzed sequence \u2026",

However most watermarking systems are frame-oriented and do not focus on the protection of semantic regions.

The proposed scheme is applied to human objects, localized by a face and body detection method that is based on an adaptive two-dimensional Gaussian model of skin color distribution. Next, an invariant method is designed, based on Hu moments, for properly encoding the watermark information into each semantic region.

            "Abstract": "Affect recognition plays an important role in everyday life. This explains why researchers in the human\u2013computer and human\u2013robot interaction community have increasingly been addressing the issue of endowing machines with affect sensitivity. Affect sensitivity refers to the ability to analyse verbal and non-verbal behavioural cues displayed by the user in order to infer the underlying communicated affect.This chapter describes affect sensitivity as an important requirement for an affectively competent agent. An affectively competent agent should be able to exploit affect sensitivity abilities to successfully interact with human users. The perception and interpretation of affective states and expressions are important to enable such an agent to act more socially and engage with users in a truly natural interaction.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we investigate detection of high-level concepts in multimedia content through an integrated approach of visual thesaurus analysis and visual context. In the former, detection is based on model vectors that represent image composition in terms of region types, obtained through clustering over a large data set. The latter deals with two aspects, namely high-level concepts and region types of the thesaurus, employing a model of a priori specified semantic relations among concepts and automatically extracted topological relations among region types; thus it combines both conceptual and topological context. A set of algorithms is presented, which modify either the confidence values of detected concepts, or the model vectors based on which detection is performed. Visual context exploitation is evaluated on TRECVID and Corel data sets and compared to a number of related visual thesaurus approaches.",

For this aim MPEG-7 introduced description schemes representing users\u2019 preferences and tools supporting user interaction. In this paper, using a formal representation of user preferences and a semantic knowledge base, we expand the user profile representation introduced in MPEG-7 in order to acquire more semantic information about the user. Furthermore, using the notion of context, we identify the part of the profile that is related to the user\u2019s query, thus preventing irrelevant interests from affecting the process of content\u2013based retrieval.",

Afterwards Object Adapted Qualified Significant Wavelet Trees (OA-QSWTs) are estimated for a pair of subbands, provided by the SA-DWT. Finally visually recognizable watermark patterns are redundantly embedded to the coefficients of the highest energy OA-QSWTs and the invert SA-DWT is applied to provide the watermarked videoconference object.

The Michael platform supports interoperability in the schema, record and repository levels. The end user has the ability to make cross-lingual queries to all the archives through the controlled vocabularies embedded in the platform. Scalability of the platform is achieved through schema mapping techniques and metadata can be harvested using the OAI-PMH standard. However, since the Michael platform is based on XML, we can not ensure semantic interoperability. The future plan of the MichaelPlus project is to upgrade the platform using Semantic Web technologies. These technologies will provide declarative and procedural semantics of the metadata records aiming at semantic interoperability. We present two methods in which semantic interoperability can be achieved. The first method is through the use of the SKOS vocabularies. The second method is to apply ontology alignment techniques.",

            "Abstract": "Retail food packaging contains information which informs choice and can be vital to consumer health, including product name, ingredients list, nutritional information, allergens, preparation guidelines, pack weight, storage and shelf life information (use-by / best before dates). The presence and accuracy of such information is critical to ensure a detailed understanding of the product and to reduce the potential for health risks. Consequently, erroneous or illegible labeling has the potential to be highly detrimental to consumers and many other stakeholders in the supply chain. In this paper, a multi-source deep learning-based domain adaptation system is proposed and tested to identify and verify the presence and legibility of use-by date information from food packaging photos taken as part of the validation process as the products pass along the food production line. This was achieved by improving the generalization of the techniques via making use of multi-source datasets in order to extract domain-invariant representations for all domains and aligning distribution of all pairs of source and target domains in a common feature space, along with the class boundaries. The proposed system performed very well in the conducted experiments, for automating the verification process and reducing labeling errors that could otherwise threaten public health and contravene legal requirements for food packaging information and accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on our food packaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed multi-source deep domain adaptation method significantly improves the classification accuracy and therefore has great potential \u2026",

In this work, we provide alternative, variable-density sampling schemes on smooth functions of image intensity based on dithering. These methods are parameter-free and more invariant to geometric transformations than uniform sampling. The resulting detectors compare well to the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher performance in a series of matching and retrieval experiments.",

            "Abstract": "Semantic search of cultural content is of major importance in current cultural digital libraries, such as Europeana, or the evolving Digital Public Library of America. Content metadata accompanying the digitised items are analysed, mapped and used to interpret users' queries, so that the most appropriate content is selected and presented to them. Multimedia, especially automatic visual analysis, has not been a main component yet. This paper presents a semantic search methodology, including a query answering mechanism which meets the semantics of users' queries and enriches the answers by exploiting appropriate local (SURF) and global (MPEG-7) visual features and descriptors. An experimental study is presented, using content from the Europeana digital library, involving both thematic knowledge and visual analysis of cultural images, illustrating the improved content search performance.

            "Abstract": "Face detection is no longer necessarily correlated with face recognition. Instead it has been established as an important tool in the framework of many multimedia applications like indexing, scene classification and news summarization. Many face detection algorithms based on skin color characteristics have appeared in the literature. Most of them face generalization problems due to the skin color model they use. Moreover, their verification stage exclusively depends on simple shape features limiting the reliability of detection. In this work we present a Gaussian model of the skin color distribution whose parameters are re-estimated based on the current image I frame. In this way the generalization problem is limited. Furthermore the verification stage, applied in the detected skin segments, is based on a template matching variation providing a robust detection.",

As gaze indication, eye gaze in non-intrusive or non highly specialized environments is, most times, difficult to detect and, when possible, combination with head pose is necessary. Also, in order to successfully track the rotation angles of the head, a priori knowledge regarding the equipment setup parameters is needed, or specialized hardware, that can be intrusive is required. Here, we propose a novel facial feature tracker that uses Distance Vector Fields (DVFs) and, combined with a new technique for face tracking, successfully detects facial feature positions during an image sequence and estimates head pose parameters.

On the other hand, important problems are related to their application, such as susceptibility to errors in the initial steps that propagate all the way to the final output and high complexity. Finally, similarly to all other clustering techniques, their efficiency decreases as the dimensionality of their input increases. In this paper we propose a robust, generalized, quick and efficient extension to the generic agglomerative clustering process. Robust refers to the proposed approach\u2019s ability to overcome the classic algorithm\u2019s susceptibility to errors in the initial steps, generalized to its ability to simultaneously consider multiple distance metrics, quick to its suitability for application to larger datasets via the application of the computationally expensive components to only a subset of the available data samples and efficient to its ability to produce results that are comparable to those of trained classifiers, largely outperforming the generic agglomerative process.",

Taking advantage of the increased modelling capabilities of the extended programs, we then describe their connectionist representation and study the problem of adapting the rule weights in order to fit a provided dataset. The adaptation algorithm we develop is based on the subgradient descent method and hence is appropriate to be employed as a learning algorithm for the training of the connectionist representation of the programs.",

Even though efficient search algorithms have been developed for either media, there still exists the need for abstract data presentation and summarization.

In this paper, we present a number of solutions to these issues, giving an integrated architecture as an example, along with notions that can be smoothly integrated in MPEG-7 compatible multimedia database systems. Initially, video sequences are segmented into shots and they are classified in a number of predetermined categories, which are used as a basis for user profiles, enhanced by relevance feedback. Moreover, this clustering scheme assists the notion of\" lateral\" links that enable the user retrieve data of similar nature or content to those already returned. In addition to this, the system is able to\" predict\" information that is possibly relevant to specific users and present it along with the returned results.",

As a consequence, the necessity to detect more frequently occurring operational anomalies is of upmost interest. Here, noise diagnostics\u2014the analysis of small stationary deviations of local neutron flux around its time-averaged value\u2014is employed aiming to unfold from detector readings the nature and location of driving perturbations. Given that in-core instrumentation of western-type light-water reactors are scarce in number of detectors, rendering formal inversion of the reactor transfer function impossible, we propose to utilise advancements in Machine Learning and Deep Learning for the task of unfolding. This work presents an approach to such a task doing so in the presence of multiple and simultaneously occurring perturbations or anomalies. A voxel-wise semantic segmentation network is proposed to determine the nature and source location of multiple and simultaneously occurring perturbations in the frequency domain. A diffusion-based core simulation tool has been employed to provide simulated training data for two reactors. Additionally, we work towards the application of the aforementioned approach to real measurements, introducing a self-supervised domain adaptation procedure to align the representation distributions of simulated and real plant measurements.",

Instead, in each step of the algorithm we perform a soft feature selection, witch does not have to be shared among all input elements. The main goal is to correctly identify the patterns that underly in the data. The proposed algorithm is applied, with promising results, in a well known and widely studied set of medical data.",

            "Abstract": "A theoretical and experimental analysis related to the identification of vertices of unknown shapes is presented. Shapes are seen as real functions of their closed boundary. Unlike traditional approaches, which see curvature as the rate of change of the tangent to the curve, an alternative global perspective of curvature is examined providing insight into the process of noise-enabled vertex localization. The analysis leads to a paradox, that certain vertices can be localized better in the presence of noise. The concept of noising is thus considered and a relevant global method for localizing \"Global Vertices\" is investigated. Theoretical analysis reveals that induced noise can help localizing certain vertices if combined with global descriptors. Experiments with noise and a comparison to localized methods validate the theoretical results.",

Considerable research has been carried out into salient region detection methods based either on models emulating human visual attention (VA) mechanisms or on computational approximations. Most of the proposed methods are bottom-up and their major goal is to filter out redundant visual information. In this paper, we propose and elaborate on a saliency detection model that treats a video sequence as a spatiotemporal volume and generates a local saliency measure for each visual unit (voxel). This computation involves an optimization process incorporating inter- and intra-feature competition at the voxel level. Perceptual decomposition of the input, spatiotemporal center-surround interactions and the integration of heterogeneous feature conspicuity values are described and \u2026",

A recent trend in image analysis aims at incorporating symbolic knowledge representation systems and machine learning techniques. In this paper, we examine interweaving of neural network classifiers and fuzzy description logics for the adaptation of a knowledge base for semantic image analysis. The proposed approach includes a formal knowledge component, which, assisted by a reasoning engine, generates the a-priori knowledge for the image analysis problem. This knowledge is transferred to a kernel based connectionist system, which is then adapted to a specific application field through extraction and use of MPEG-7 image descriptors. Adaptation of the knowledge base can be achieved next. Combined segmentation and classification of images, or video frames, of summer holidays, is the field used to illustrate the good performance of the proposed approach.",

In this way, global context is also considered when routing capsules by introducing global latent variables that have direct influence on the objective function, and are updated discriminatively in accordance with the minimum description length (MDL) principle.

Human faces may act as visual interfaces that help users feel at home when interacting with a computer because they are accepted as the most expressive means for communicating and recognizing emotions. Thus, a lifelike human face can enhance interactive applications by providing straightforward feedback to and from the users and stimulating emotional responses from them. Thus, virtual environments can employ believable, expressive characters since such features significantly enhance the atmosphere of a virtual world and Communicate messages far more vividly than any textual or speech information. In this paper, we present an abstract means of description of facial expressions, by utilizing concepts included in the MPEG-4 standard. Furthermore, we exploit these concepts to synthesize a wide variety of expressions using a reduced representation, suitable for networked and lightweight applications.",

Recurrent neural networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were used to study signal sequences related to perturbations induced in the time domain, including the vibrations of fuel assemblies and the fluctuations of thermal-hydraulic parameters at the inlet of the reactor coolant loops. 512 dimensional representations were extracted from the -CNN and LSTM architectures, and used as \u2026",

Multimodality is a key issue in achieving more accurate results; however, fusing different modalities is a difficult issue in emotion analysis. Emotion recognition systems are generally either rule-based or extensively trained through emotionally colored HCI data sets. In either case, such systems need to take into account, i.e., adapt their knowledge to, the specific user or context of interaction. Neural networks fit well with the adaptation requirement, by collecting and analyzing data from specific environments. An effective approach is presented in this paper, which uses neural network architectures to both detect the need for adaptation of their knowledge, and adapt it through an efficient adaptation procedure.

            "Abstract": "By the end of the last century the question was not whether digital archives are technically and economically viable, but rather how digital archives would be efficient and informative. In this framework, different scientific fields such as, on the one hand, development of database management systems, and, on the other hand, processing and analysis of multimedia data, as well as artificial and computational intelligence methods, have observed a close cooperation with each other during the past few years. The attempt has been to develop intelligent and efficient human\u2013computer interaction systems, enabling the user to access vast amounts of heterogeneous information, stored in different sites and archives. It became clear among the research community dealing with content-based audiovisual data retrieval and new emerging related standards such as MPEG-21 that the results to be obtained from this process would be ineffective, unless major focus were given to the semantic information level, defining what most users desire to retrieve. It now seems that the extraction of semantic information from audiovisual-related data is tractable, taking into account the nature of useful queries that users may issue and the context determined by user profiles [1]. Additionally, projects and related activities supported under the R&D programmes of the European Commission have made significant contributions to developing: r new models, methods, technologies and systems for creating, processing, managing, networking, accessing and exploiting digital content, including audiovisual content; r new technological and business models for representing \u2026",

The concept of noising first appeared in \\cite{CVPR14}, in the context of curvature estimation and vertex localization on planar shapes. There are indications that noising can play for global methods the role smoothing plays for local methods in this task. This manuscript is about investigating this claim by introducing incremental noising, in a recursive deterministic manner, analogous to how smoothing is extended to progressive smoothing in similar tasks. As investigating the properties and behavior of incremental noising is the purpose of this manuscript, a surprising connection between incremental noising and progressive smoothing is revealed by the experiments. To explain this phenomenon, the fractal and the space filling properties of the two methods respectively, are considered in a unifying context.",

In the first module, unsupervised video object extraction is performed, by analyzing stereoscopic pairs of frames. Then each video object is decomposed into three levels with ten subbands, using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and three pairs of subbands are formed (HL/sub 3/, HL/sub 2/), (LH/sub 3/, LH/sub 2/) and (HH/sub 3/, HH/sub 2/). Next qualified significant wavelet trees (QSWTs) are estimated for the specific pair of subbands that contains the highest energy content compared to the other two pairs. QSWTs are derived from the embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) algorithm and they are high-energy coefficient paths within the selected pair of subbands. Finally, in the third module, visually recognizable watermark patterns are redundantly embedded \u2026",

Then for each frame, a feature vector is constructed, containing color and size characteristics of the foreground VOPs within the frame. Afterwards, for a given shot, key frames are extracted using an optimization method for locating minimally correlated feature vectors. Finally correlation links are generated between the extracted key frames to produce a graph-like structure of the video sequence. Experimental results on real life stereoscopic sequences indicate the promising performance of the proposed scheme.",

Both linguistics and technology have invested enormous efforts in understanding the first, explicit channel, but the second is not as well understood. Understanding the other party's emotions is one of the key tasks associated with the second, implicit channel. To tackle that task, signal processing and analysis techniques have to be developed, while, at the same time, consolidating psychological and linguistic analyses of emotion. This article examines basic issues in those areas. It is motivated by the PKYSTA project, in which we aim to develop a hybrid system capable of using information from faces and voices to recognize people's emotions.",

In this model adaptation is achieved through focusing to irregular patterns, so as to identify possible context switches, and adapting the behaviour goals accordingly.

            "Abstract": "Retail food packages contain various types of information such as food name, ingredients list and use by dates. Such information is critical to ensure proper distribution of products to the market and eliminate health risks due to erroneous mislabelling. The latter is considerably detrimental to both consumers and suppliers alike. In this paper, an adaptable deep learning based system is proposed and tested across various possible scenarios: a) for the identification of blurry images and/or missing information from food packaging photos. These were captured during the validation process in supply chains; b) for deep neural network adaptation. This was achieved through a novel methodology that utilises facets of the same convolutional neural network architecture. Latent variables were extracted from different datasets and used as input into a \u039b-means clustering and \u039b-nearest neighbour classification algorithm, to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The usefulness of the results of logic programming in real-life applications is sometimes limited due to the inability of this theory to model the uncertain and dynamic character of real environments. Fuzzy logic programming has been lately considered as an important framework for handling uncertainty in logic programming systems. Still, there is a need for modelling adaptation of logic programs and the progress in this area is rather slow. In the present paper, we first extend fuzzy logic programs in a direction that brings them closer to the connectionist approach: we introduce weighted fuzzy programs, which allow the association of significance weights with the atoms that make up the body of a logic rule. The weights add expressiveness to the programs and allow the determination of the degree with which an antecedent affects the value of the rule consequent. Then, we propose a neural network implementation of \u2026",

More particularly, the procedure includes:(A) A retraining algorithm for adapting neural network weights to current conditions and (B) An active contour module, which extracts the retraining set. The retraining algorithm takes into consideration both the former and the current network knowledge in order to achieve good generalization and reduce retraining time. The retrained network performs video object tracking to the rest of the frames within a shot. Retraining set extraction is accomplished by utilizing depth information, provided by stereoscopic video analysis and incorporating an active contour. Finally results are presented which illustrate the promising performance of the proposed approach in real life experiments.",

MPEG-4 FAPs and action units are combined in modeling the effects of appraisal checks on facial expressions and temporal evolution issues of facial expressions are investigated.

However, in a similar manner, holistic techniques require the face to be well aligned with the training data. This pre-assumes correct and accurate face tracking, which is also a challenging issue. Here, we propose a face tracker, adjusted to each person's face chrominance values, and learnt online. Based on the face bounding box, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed, in order to calculate face orientation. CNNs are ideal for cases where a lot of distortions exist in the data, and the proposed architecture only utilizes subsets of classifiers, excluding those corresponding to rotation angles far from the current.",

Recent developments in machine learning (ML) and, in particular, deep learning (DL) can provide powerful new analytical tools. The proposed study utilises ML and DL techniques to predict yield and plant growth variation across two different scenarios, tomato yield forecasting and Ficus benjamina stem growth, in controlled greenhouse environments. We deploy a new deep recurrent neural network (RNN), using the long short-term memory (LSTM) neuron model, in the prediction formulations.

More specifically, the image content is decomposed at different description levels, each of which represents the image at a different content scale.

The spatial relationship of the object extracted, at a given description level, is described by a graph structure scheme. In particular, for each object (segment) a graph node is constructed and includes several features of that object. The graph links indicate the spatial relationship of the object with its neighbors.

Three main modules are involved in the proposed scheme; extraction of reliable depth information, image partition into color and depth regions and a constrained fusion algorithm of color segments using information derived from the depth map. In the first module, each stereo pair is analyzed and the disparity field and depth map are estimated. Occlusion detection and compensation are also applied for improving the depth map estimation. In the following phase, color and depth regions are created using a novel complexity-reducing multiresolution implementation of the Recursive Shortest Spanning Tree algorithm (M-RSST).

The proposed framework operates at semantic level using possible semantic labels, formally represented as fuzzy sets, to make decisions on handling image regions instead of visual features used traditionally. In order to stress its independence of a specific image segmentation approach we have modified two well known region growing algorithms, i.e., watershed and recursive shortest spanning tree, and compared them to their traditional counterparts.

In this paper, we present a new video database that can be used for an objective comparison and evaluation of different motion analysis and classification methods. The database contains video clips that capture the 3D motion of individuals. To be more specific, the set consists of 8374 video clips, which contain 12 different types of tennis actions performed by 55 individuals, captured by Kinect. Kinect provides the depth map of motion data and helps to extract the 3D skeletal joint connections. Performing experiments using state of the art algorithms, the database shows to be very challenging. It contains very similar to each other actions, offering the opportunity to algorithms dedicated to gaming and athletics, to be developed and tested.

Certain artistic traditions born in the Byzantine Empire, particularly regarding icon painting and church architecture, have continued in Greece, Bulgaria, Russia, and other Eastern Orthodox countries up to the present. The icons usually depict sacred figures from the Christian faith, such as Jesus, the Virgin Mary, the apostles, and the saints. At the beginning of the 17th century, iconography manuals represented the most important source of inspiration for icon painters. The 16th-century monk Dionysios from Fourna is credited as the author of the prototypical manual, Interpretation of the Byzantine Art. 2 In it, he defines the rules and iconographic patterns that painters still use to create icons.Byzantine iconography follows a unique convention of painting. The artistic language of Byzantine painters is characterized by apparent simplicity, overemphasized flatness, unreal and symbolic colors, lack of perspective, and strange proportions. The sacred figures are set beyond real time and real space through the use of gold backgrounds. The most important figure in an icon is depicted frontally, focusing on the eyes, facial expression, and hands. Clarity is the rule, not only in describing shapes but also in arranging figures in balanced compositions so that the narrative\u2019s actions are clear. The figures have large eyes, enlarged ears, long, thin noses, and small mouths, each painted following specific rules.",

Human faces may act as visual interfaces that help users feel at home when interacting with a computer because they are accepted as the most expressive means for communicating and recognizing emotions. Thus, a lifelike human face can enhance interactive applications by providing straightforward feedback to and from the users and stimulating emotional responses from them. Thus, the gaming and entertainment industries can benefit from employing believable, expressive characters since such features significantly enhance the atmosphere of a virtual world and communicate messages far more vividly than any textual or speech information. In this paper, we present an abstract means of description of facial expressions, by utilizing concepts included in the MPEG-4 standard. Furthermore, we exploit these \u2026",

Since multimedia services and especially MPEG coded video streams are expected to be a major traffic component over these networks, modeling of such services and traffic prediction are useful for the reliable operation of the broadband based an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. In this paper, a recursive implementation of a Non linear AutoRegressive model (RNAR) is presented for on line traffic prediction of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) MPEG-2 video sources. This is accomplished by using an efficient weight adaptation algorithm so that the network provide good performance even in case of highly fluctuated traffic rates. In particular, the network weights are adapted so that the output is approximately equal to the current data while preserving the former knowledge of the network. Experimental results are \u2026",

Under this model the probabilistic locality of the Markovian state space translates to semantical locality of the corresponding keywords in a way that a clustering of the Markovian state space corresponds to a semantic clustering of the keyword space. Since the states represent keywords asked by the users, the state space can grow very large, but at the same time it is partitioned into disjoint subsets such that strong interactions among the states of the same subset exists but weak interactions among states of different subsets.

For this reason, support data, information and knowledge exchange have become key issues in current computer technology. The Semantic Web (SW) will provide intelligent access to heterogeneous, distributed information. In parallel to the SW advancements, the representation and management of uncertainty, imprecision and vague knowledge that exists in real-life applications has received considerable attention in the artificial intelligence (AI) community in an attempt to extend existing knowledge representation systems to deal with the imperfect nature of real-world information. Furthermore, a lot of work has been carried out on the development of reasoning engines that can interpret imprecise knowledge [1].New applications in the context of the SW and AI have renewed interest in the creation of knowledge-based systems that can represent and interpret imprecise and vague information. A knowledge-based system, as the name suggests, is a computer-based system that emulates the reasoning process of a human expert within a specific domain of knowledge. Knowledgebased systems are primarily built for the purpose of making the experience, understanding and problem solving capabilities of the expert in a particular subject area available to the non-expert in this area.

The study of the problem will be restricted to the case of non-rigid objects. The main problem with non-rigid motion is that it is not structured in a way that would allow its estimation with a few parameters, as in the case of rigid motion. That is why the main effort in most of the approaches is in representing deformable objects with suitable models that require only a small number of parameters for their description. In this work we perform a survey of algorithms proposed for the 3d motion and structure estimation of non-rigid objects, using the Finite Element Method.

Combining segmentation and the popular Bag-of-Words model, a visual vocabulary of the most common \u201cregion types\u201d is first constructed using the database images. The visual words are consistent image regions, extracted through a k-means clustering process. The regions are described with color and texture features, and a \u201dmodel vector\u201d is then formed to capture the association of a given image to the visual words. Opposite to other methods, we do not form the model vector based on all region types, but rather to a smaller subset. We show that the presented approach can be efficiently applied to image retrieval when the goal is to retrieve semantically similar rather than visually similar images. We show that our method outperforms the commonly used Bag-of-Words model based on local SIFT descriptors.",

            "Abstract": "In natural vision, we center our fixation on the most informative points in a scene in order to reduce our overall uncertainty about the scene and help interpret it. Even if we are looking for a specific stimulus around us, we face a great amount of uncertainty since that stimulus could be in any spatial location. Visual attention (VA) schemes have been proposed by researchers to account for the ability of the human eye to quickly fixate on informative regions. Recently, VA in images, and especially saliency-based VA, became an active research topic of the computer vision community. The proposed work provides an extension towards VA in video sequences by integrating spatiotemporal information. The potential applications include video classification, scene understanding, surveillance and segmentation",

The combination of facial expressions with prosody information allows us to capture the users' emotional state in an unintrusive manner, relying on the best performing modality in cases where one modality suffers from noise or bad sensing conditions. In this paper, we describe a multi-cue, dynamic approach to detect emotion in naturalistic video sequences, where input is taken from nearly real world situations, contrary to controlled recording conditions of audiovisual material. Recognition is performed via a recurrent neural network, whose short term memory and approximation capabilities cater for modeling dynamic events in facial and prosodic expressivity.

In particular, our approach adopts a combination of transfer learning, k-means clustering and k-Nearest Neighbour classification of deep neural network learned representations to provide enriched prediction of the disease based on MRI and/or DaT Scan data. A new loss function is introduced and used in the training of the DNNs, so as to perform adaptation of the generated learned representations between data from different medical environments. Results are presented using a recently published database of Parkinson's related information, which was generated and evaluated in a hospital environment.",

In this paper, we propose a block-based approach for watermarking image objects in a way that is invariant to RST distortions.

The message is embedded into the most significant wavelet coefficients of a cover image to provide invisibility and resistance against lossy transmission, compression or other distortion. The architecture consists of three modules. In the first module, the initial message is enciphered by an encryption algorithm. The enciphered message is imprinted onto a white-background image to construct the message-image to be hidden. In the second module, the cover image is decomposed into two levels with seven subbands, using the DWT. Next, qualified significant wavelet trees (QSWTs), which are paths of significant wavelet coefficients, are estimated for the highest energy pair of subbands. In the third module, the message-image is redundantly embedded to the coefficients of the best QSWTs and the IDWT is applied to provide the stego \u2026",

The proposed system is based on a multicue feature extraction and fusion technique, which provides MPEG-4-compatible features assorted with a confidence measure. This confidence measure is used to pinpoint cases where detection of individual features may be wrong and reduce their contribution to the training phase or their importance in deducing the observed facial expression, while the fusion process ensures that the final result regarding the features will be based on the \u2026",

Shapes are seen as real functions of their closed boundary. An alternative global perspective of curvature is examined providing insight into the process of noise-enabled vertex localization. The analysis reveals that noise facilitates in the localization of certain vertices. The concept of noising is thus considered and a relevant global method for localizing Global Vertices is investigated in relation to local methods under the presence of increasing noise. Theoretical analysis reveals that induced noise can indeed help localizing certain vertices if combined with global descriptors. Experiments with noise and a comparison to localized methods validate the theoretical results.",

Moreover, Plutchik concluded that emotion terms are unevenly distributed through the space defined by dimensions like Whissel's; instead they tend to form an approximately circular pattern, called 'emotion wheel,' modeled using an angular measure. The 'emotion wheel' can be defined as a reference for creating intermediate expressions from the universal ones, by interpolating the movement of dominant FDP points between neighboring basic expressions. By exploiting the relation between the movement of the basic FDP point and the activation and angular parameters we can model more emotions than the primary ones and achieve efficient \u2026",

In this framework, the automated extraction of learner profiles from such an e-learning system, in order to offer them personalized educational A/V content and e-courses, is a challenging and important problem. In this paper we present the design and development of an integrated distance learning system. Our approach relies on a suitable adaptation of fundamental e-learning models, such as the IEEE e-learning model, as well as a novel mechanism that creates, updates and uses learners' profiles, extracted directly from user preferences and their usage history. Such preferences are utilized towards the personalization of the multimedia educational content offering and retrieval process.",

Most of the systems are not adapting to the learner, so the learner has to spend a lot of time before reaching the learning goal that is suitable for him or her (Solomos & Avouris, 1999). This procedure may discourage the learner from continuing his or her studies (Bixler & Spotts, 2000; Fitzelle & Trochim, 2000). To overcome these difficulties, we have to design an e-learning system that will be adapted to the learner\u2019s ICT level and knowledge. In our proposal, we introduce an e-learning schema that has these characteristics.

Especially wireless communications, which can be easily intercepted, should be protected by eavesdroppers. Towards this direction, several encryption schemes have been proposed in literature, however most of them do not consider regions of interest (video objects). These regions may need better protection, may be the only regions that need protection, or should be accessed separately according to different privileges. For these reasons in this paper a video objects chaotic encryption system is proposed. Initially stereoscopic pairs are analyzed and video objects are automatically extracted using a color segments fusion approach. Next for each video object multiresolution decomposition is performed and the pixels of the lowest resolution level are encrypted using a chaotic cipher \u2026",

Numerous applications can benefit from employing believable, expressive characters since such features significantly enhance the atmosphere of a virtual world and communicate messages far more vividly than any textual or speech information. In this paper, we present an abstract means of description of expressions, by utilizing concepts included in the MPEG-4 standard.

In the following, several feature points are estimated on the initial object contour (ie depth object) and an M-GVF adapted MGS is created to determine the direction that a feature point is allowed to move to. In this framework, each feature point moves onto its MGS in order to locate the contour of the physical video object.

DeepMoCap explores motion capture by automatically localizing and labeling reflectors on depth images and, subsequently, on 3D space. Introducing a non-parametric representation to encode the temporal correlation among pairs of colorized depthmaps and 3D optical flow frames, a multi-stage Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture is proposed to jointly learn reflector locations and their temporal dependency among sequential frames. The extracted reflector 2D locations are spatially mapped in 3D space, resulting in robust 3D optical data extraction. The subject\u2019s motion is efficiently captured by applying a template-based fitting technique on the extracted optical data. Two datasets have been created and made publicly available for evaluation purposes; one comprising multi-view depth and 3D optical flow annotated images (DMC2. 5D), and a second, consisting of spatio-temporally aligned multi-view depth images along with skeleton, inertial and ground truth MoCap data (DMC3D). The FCN model outperforms its competitors on the DMC2. 5D dataset using 2D Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) metric, while the motion capture outcome is evaluated against RGB-D and inertial data fusion approaches on DMC3D, outperforming the next best method by 4.5% in total 3D PCK accuracy.

In capsule networks, scalar neurons are replaced with capsule vectors or matrices, whose entries represent different properties of objects. The relationships between objects and their parts are learned via trainable viewpoint-invariant transformation matrices, and the presence of a given object is decided by the level of agreement among votes from its parts. This interaction occurs between capsule layers and is a process called routing-by-agreement. In this paper, we propose a new capsule routing algorithm derived from Variational Bayes for fitting a mixture of transforming gaussians, and show it is possible transform our capsule network into a Capsule-VAE. Our Bayesian approach addresses some of the inherent weaknesses of MLE based models such as the variance-collapse by modelling uncertainty over capsule pose parameters. We outperform the state-of-the-art on smallNORB using\u2243 50% fewer capsules than previously reported, achieve competitive performances on CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and demonstrate significant improvement in MNIST to affNIST generalisation over previous works. 1",

CORTEX, which stands for CORe monitoring Techniques and EXperimental validation and demonstration, aims at developing an innovative core monitoring technique that allows detecting anomalies in nuclear reactors, such as excessive vibrations of core internals, flow blockage, coolant inlet perturbations, etc. The technique is based on primarily using the inherent fluctuations in neutron flux recorded by in-core and ex-core instrumentation (often referred to as neutron noise), from which the anomalies will be differentiated depending on their type, location and characteristics. In addition to be non-intrusive and not requiring any external perturbation of the system, the method allows the detection of operational problems at a very early stage. Proper actions could thus be taken by utilities before such problems have any adverse effect on plant safety and reliability.",

Computational visual attention (VA) schemes have been proposed to account for this important characteristic of the HVS. A video analysis framework based on a spatiotemporal VA model is presented. A novel scheme has been proposed for generating saliency in video sequences by taking into account both the spatial extent and dynamic evolution of regions. To achieve this goal, a common, image-oriented computational model of saliency-based visual attention is extended to handle spatiotemporal analysis of video in a volumetric framework. The main claim is that attention acts as an efficient preprocessing step to obtain a compact representation of the visual content in the form of salient events/objects.

Predicting the PD disease is critical as motor and non-motor manifestations occur many years after the onset of neurodegeneration, hence its early management of disease is a significant challenge in the field of PD therapeutics. While part of previous studies with respect to the prediction of Parkinson's Disease has been based mainly on brain images, dependencies between additional patients' information have not been taken into account. This observation suggests that prediction of Parkinson's Disease along with additional patients' data with a unified framework should outperform Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that treat different sources of patients' information separately. Our presented framework relies on Multi-Task Learning (MTL) implemented with Deep \u2026",

Fall detection, in particular, is quite critical, especially in households of lonely elderly people. However, the task of visually identifying a fall is challenging as there is a variety of daily activities that can be mistakenly characterized as falls. To tackle this issue, various feature extraction methods that aim to effectively distinguish unintentional falls from other everyday activities have been proposed. In this study, we examine the capability of the History Triple Features technique, based on the Trace transform, to provide noise robust and invariant to different variations features for the spatiotemporal representation of fall occurrences. The aim is to effectively detect falls among other household-related activities that usually take place indoors. For the evaluation of the algorithm the video \u2026",

We present an efficient technique for temporal segmentation and parsing of news recordings based on visual cues that can either be employed as a stand-alone application for non-closed captioned broadcasts or integrated with audio and textual cues of existing systems.

Applications of this technology are expected in educational environments, virtual collaborative workplaces, communities, and interactive entertainment. Facial animation has gained much interest within the MPEG-4 framework; with implementation details being an open research area (Tekalp, 1999). In this paper, we describe a method for enriching human computer interaction, focusing on analysis and synthesis of primary and intermediate facial expressions (Ekman and Friesen (1978)). To achieve this goal, we utilize facial animation parameters (FAPs) to model primary expressions and describe a rule-based technique for handling intermediate ones. A relation between FAPs and the activation parameter proposed in classical psychological studies is established, leading to parameterized facial expression analysis and synthesis notions, compatible with the MPEG-4 standard.",

The proposed approach is based on shape information since the watermark is embedded in image blocks, the location and orientation of which is defined by Eulerian tours that are appropriately arranged in layers, around the object's skeleton.

Each shot is then analyzed using stereo-imaging techniques, and the disparity field, occluded areas, and depth map are estimated.

For that purpose, many RDF tools capable of storing a knowledge base, and also performing queries on it, were constructed. Recently, fuzzy extensions to description logics have gained considerable attention especially for the purposes of handling vague information in many applications. In this paper we investigate on the issue of using classical RDF storing systems in order to provide persistent storing and querying over large-scale fuzzy information. To accomplish this we first propose a novel way for serializing fuzzy information into RDF triples thus classical storing systems can be used without any extensions. Additionally, we extend the existing query languages of RDF stores in order to support expressive fuzzy queries proposed in the literature. These extensions are implemented through the FiRE fuzzy reasoning engine, which is a fuzzy DL reasoner for fuzzy-SHIN. Finally, the proposed architecture is evaluated using an industrial application scenario about casting for TV commercials and spots.",

This structure can be seen as a tree structure, each level of which corresponds to a particular content resolution, while the tree-nodes contain viewing elements, representing the visual content of a segment of the sequence. The multiscale optimal video organization is performed by minimizing a cross correlation criterion so that the most representative shots (key-shots) from a video sequence or frames (key-frames) from a video shot are extracted. Experimental results on real-life video sequences show that the proposed multiscale video organization technique enables users to detect content of interest much faster, compared to the conventional sequential video scanning method, and thus it leads to significant reduction of the viewed/transmitted information.",

In this paper, we propose the utilization of a novel feature extraction scheme based on the newly formulated 3D Cylindrical Trace Transform, on spatio-temporal interest points, for the task of fall detection. Using this pipeline, we are able to produce features invariant to occlusion, viewpoint, camera placement and other distortions. Experimentation on two publicly available datasets, on a number of different conditions, proved the efficiency of the proposed methodology for the task at hand.",

It also demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating additional patients' contextual epidemiological information (i.e. their age and sex). Our aim is to investigate which are the patients' clinical data, that when joined with the primary task could perform best and thus provide an improved computational PD prediction model. Our proposed model architectures are evaluated on a new medical dataset, which is presently under development. Our preliminary results suggest the robustness of our proposed systems to analyze and provide an accurate estimate of the status of the disease.

Therefore, we propose an extended Deep Learning framework as part of the CORTEX Horizon 2020 EU project for the unfolding of reactor transfer functions from induced neutron noise sources. The unfolding allows for the identification and localisation of reactor core perturbation sources from neutron detector readings in Pressurised Water Reactors. A 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been presented, each to study the signals presented in frequency and time domain respectively. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results with the classification of perturbation type in the frequency domain reaching 99.89% accuracy and localisation of the classified perturbation source being regressed to 0.2902 Mean Absolute Error (MAE).",

The derived image segmentation is used to modify the rate control of MPEG schemes so as to allocate more bits to foreground objects than to background, while retaining compatibility with MPEG encoders.

            "Abstract": "The paper presents a novel deep learning approach, which extracts latent information from trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and derives concise representations that are analyzed in an effective, unified way for prediction purposes. It is well known that DNNs are capable of analyzing complex data; however, they lack transparency in their decision making, in the sense that it is not straightforward to justify their prediction, or to visualize the features on which the decision was based. Moreover, they generally require large amounts of data in order to learn and become able to adapt to different environments. This makes their use difficult in healthcare, where trust and personalization are key issues. Transparency combined with high prediction accuracy are the targeted goals of the proposed approach. It includes both supervised DNN training and unsupervised learning of latent variables extracted from the trained DNNs. Domain Adaptation from multiple sources is also presented as an extension, where the extracted latent variable representations are used to generate predictions in other, non-annotated, environments. Successful application is illustrated through a large experimental study in various fields: prediction of Parkinson's disease from MRI and DaTScans; prediction of COVID-19 and pneumonia from CT scans and X-rays; optical character verification in retail food packaging.",

In particular, vertices of the exterior medial axis directly provide the position and extent of negative minima of curvature, while a traversal of the interior medial axis directly provides a small set of candidate endpoints for part-cuts. The final selection follows a prioritized processing of candidate part-cuts according to a local convexity rule that can incorporate arbitrary salience measures.

Feature competition is used to produce a saliency distribution of the input implemented by constrained minimization. The proposed constraints are inspired by and associated with the Gestalt laws.

Off-the-shelf Optical Character Verification (OCV) systems are good solutions for automating food label quality assessments, but are known to under perform on complex data. This paper proposes a Deep Learning based system that can identify inadequate images for OCV, due to their poor label quality, by employing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, and practical Bayesian inference techniques for automatic self-annotation. We propose a practical domain adaptation procedure based on k-means clustering of CNN latent variables, followed by a k-Nearest Neighbour classification for handling high label variability between different dataset distributions. Moreover, Supervised Learning has proven useful in such systems but manual annotation of large amounts of data is usually required. This is practically intractable in most real world problems due to time/labour constraints. In an attempt to address this issue, we introduce a self-annotating prediction model based on Self-Training of a Bayesian CNN, that leverages modern variational inference methods of deep models. In this context, we propose a new inverse uncertainty weighting technique that encourages the Self-",

            "Abstract": "Emotional intelligence is an indispensable facet of human intelligence and one of the most important factors for a successful social life. Endowing machines with this kind of intelligence towards affective human\u2013machine interaction, however, is not an easy task. It becomes more complex with the fact that human beings use several modalities jointly to interpret affective states, since emotion affects almost all modes \u2013 audio-visual (facial expression, voice, gesture, posture, etc.), physiological (respiration, skin temperature, etc.), and contextual (goal, preference, environment, social situation, etc.) states. Compared to common unimodal approaches, many specific problems arise from the case of multimodal emotion recognition, especially concerning fusion architecture of the multimodal information. In this chapter, we firstly give a short review for the problems and then present research results of various \u2026",

            "Abstract": "One of the main challenges of recent years is to create Affective-aware Human Computer Interaction (HCI) systems and context-aware Affective Computing (AC) systems. But, what does it mean to create or advance such systems when incorporating context features and which should be the most appropriate type of such context features? Even though a number of studies have analyzed how different features, when incorporated into AC systems and particular into Sentiment Analysis (SA) systems, improve their performance; a complete picture of their effectiveness remains unexplored. So far, a wide range of context-aware features has been independently tested by a large number of research teams, mostly in constrained settings (Beineke et al. 2004, Pang et al. 2004, Pang et al. 2002, Turney 2002). Nevertheless, there is not a clear picture of the impact of every feature set and there is little to no evidence regarding how the combination of such context-aware features behaves with different in size and genre of information sources. In light of these observations, we attempt to extend the pool of the context-aware sentence features used into context-aware SA and to further provide the foundations for a comprehensive analysis of the relative importance of the various types of contextual features.",

            "Abstract": "This work presents the design and experimental verification of an original system architecture aiming at recognizing gestures based solely on the hand trajectory. Self organizing feature maps are used to model spatial information while Markov models encode the temporal aspect of hand position within a trajectory. A validated classification mechanism is produced through a set of models and a committee machine setup ensures robustness as indicated by the experimental results performed.",

            "Abstract": "When users of computer systems are given the opportunity to provide feedback on their preferences or interests in most cases they are presented with a questionnaire to be filled. However, this means of interaction requires an additional cognitive step, since the user is required to rationalize feelings and attitudes by answering predetermined questions; as a result, users often skip this part or answer hastily, depriving systems of valuable criticism from the field'. In this paper, we present a system which relates data extracted from the posture and movement of the user's head and eye gaze with states related to interest and engagement. This system is deployed in the context of human computer interaction, where users read documents from a computer screen and provides non-verbal input which, in turn, can be further processed.",

A novel fast, unsupervised semantic segmentation scheme is presented for stereoscopic sequences, which utilizes the provided depth information. Each stereo pair is first analyzed and the disparity field and occluded areas are estimated. Then a multiresolution implementation of the RSST segmentation algorithm is applied to the depth map for extracting the depth segments. For each depth segment, except the last, feature points are generated on its contour and a motion geometric space (MGS) for every initial point is defined. Afterwards one point per MGS is selected, which satisfies predefined intensity and curvature constraints so that the object boundaries are accurately extracted.

            "Abstract": "We propose a novel method for automatic annotation, indexing and annotation-based retrieval of images. The new method, that we call Markovian Semantic Indexing (MSI), is presented in the context of an online image retrieval system. Assuming such a system, the users' queries are used to construct an Aggregate Markov Chain (AMC) through which the relevance between the keywords seen by the system is defined. The users' queries are also used to automatically annotate the images. A stochastic distance between images, based on their annotation and the keyword relevance captured in the AMC, is then introduced. Geometric interpretations of the proposed distance are provided and its relation to a clustering in the keyword space is investigated. By means of a new measure of Markovian state similarity, the mean first cross passage time (CPT), optimality properties of the proposed distance are proved. Images \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, an affine invariant curve matching method using curvature scale-space and normalization is proposed. Prior to curve matching, curve normalization with respect to affine transformations is applied, allowing a lossless affine invariant curve representation. The maxima points of the curvature scale-space (CSS) image are then used to represent the normalized curve, while retaining the local properties of the curve. The matching algorithm that follows, matches the maxima sets of CSS images and the resulting matching cost provides a measure of similarity. The methodpsilas performance and robustness is evaluated through a variety of curves and affine transformations, obtaining precise shape similarity and retrieval.",

A large amount of data taken from actual video sequences is presented to evaluate the scene results. For each method, the percentage of false, as well as failed, scene detection is used as an indication of the performance of the method. The effect of the selected MPEG bit rate and resolution on the performance of the methods are further investigated, to evaluate the methods' robustness, especially in low bit rate applications. Conclusions on the appropriateness of the methodologies used in the framework of the targeted applications are finally derived.",

            "Abstract": "During the last decade, the cost of storage and wide area communication services has decreased, while their capacity increased dramatically. This fact, along with the increasing penetration of e-commerce applications, has made digital storage, annotation and access of multimedia information a mature and viable choice for content holding organizations and individuals. Numerous multimedia archives have, either totally or incrementally, turned to the utilization of digitized archive technologies. The content of these archives can be made accessible, depending upon copyright, policy and security decisions, over the Internet in a cost efficient, time efficient, anyplace, anytime fashion. However, one of the main problems of multimedia archiving has been inherited to their digital descendants. For traditional archives, where raw media were stored in the form of analog hard copies, search was not an easy task as a human had to either go through a separate annotation archive, or, ideally, search using keywords in a custom, proprietary, metadata database. Much similarly to the case of books in a library that have not been indexed, information stored in a multimedia archive that cannot be searched, identified and accessed easily is practically unavailable.",
