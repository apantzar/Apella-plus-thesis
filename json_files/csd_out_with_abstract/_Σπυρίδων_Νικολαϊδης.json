            "Abstract": "Pipeline networks have been a frequently used and safe way of transporting fluids (such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, water etc.) for many years. Some of the reasons which made the pipeline networks so popular are the relatively short period of time that they need to be constructed and the low cost of their construction and operation. However, a serious issue which causes problems in the normal operation of pipeline networks is the occurrence of leaks. Therefore, a large number of leak detection and localization methods have been developed over the years. In this paper a method is proposed for this purpose, which involves the use of acoustic sensors and a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system (in combination with a proper signal processing software) in order to identify the location of leaks in pipelines. The method is based on the estimation of the time delay between the signals obtained by two \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper an integer linear programming (ILP) model is proposed for identifying the optimal resources allocation and application partitioning on FPGA-based hybrid MPSoC, including the memory allocation for each processing unit and total BRAM usage on the device. The motivation behind this work is the reduction of the necessary exploration time for the identification of the optimal hybrid MPSoC architecture implementation for each particular application. Whilst many ILP model approaches have been proposed, none of the existing models presents an accurate calculation model for the BRAM usage on the FPGA device and can impose the memory usage and/or BRAM usage as a design constraint. Our work comes to fill this void, especially now that modern multimedia applications have an ever increasing need for memory space and data throughput.",

These effects cumulatively build up over prolonged periods, causing the circuit to age with time, resulting in performance degradations that may eventually lead to circuit failure. In this paper we tackle with the HC effects using a software tool that is able to quantify the HC induced degradation of the devices in a design, and furthermore predict the lifetime of the corresponding circuit. We present the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and we give examples of tool operation.",

            "Abstract": "The high performance multi-core 2D pixel clustering FPGA implementation used for the input system of the ATLAS Fast TracKer (FTK) processor is presented. The input system for the FTK processor will receive data from the Pixel and micro-strip detectors read out drivers (RODs) at 760Gbps, the full rate of level 1 triggers. Clustering is required as a method to reduce the high rate of the received data before further processing, as well as to determine the cluster centroid for obtaining obtain the best spatial measurement. Our implementation targets the pixel detectors and uses a 2D-clustering algorithm that takes advantage of a moving window technique to minimize the logic required for cluster identification. The design is fully generic and the cluster detection window size can be adjusted for optimizing the cluster identification process. \u03a4he implementation can be parallelized by instantiating multiple cores to identify different clusters independently thus exploiting more FPGA resources. This flexibility makes the implementation suitable for a variety of demanding image processing applications. The implementation is robust against bit errors in the input data stream and drops all data that cannot be identified. In the unlikely event of missing control words, the implementation will ensure stable data processing by inserting the missing control words in the data stream. The 2D pixel clustering implementation is developed and tested in both single flow and parallel versions. The first parallel version with 16 parallel cluster identification engines is presented. The input data from the RODs are received through S-Links and a single data stream is also required \u2026",

These alternatives present different characteristics in terms of speed and power dissipation, depending on the capacitance at the internal nodes, the fan-in requirements, the operating conditions and the structure itself. Speed and low power dissipation are in the most cases contradictory factors but there are also exceptions, where design for high speed results in low power circuits. Circuit designers have to be aware of this diversity of structures and the available possibilities that can be exploited to optimally correlate high speed and low power dissipation.",

We demonstrate the above issues using a set of benchmarks. Experimental results show an x2.9 average speedup in addition to potential energy reduction",

ARISE extends the micro-architecture of the processor with an interface to allow the coupling of the hardware units. Furthermore, the instruction set of the processor is extended with instructions which expose to the programmer/compiler the full control of the interface. This control includes the configuration of operations on the hardware units, execution of these operations, and communication of data between the processor and the units. The new instructions are incorporated without the need to redesign the processor instruction set architecture. To evaluate our proposal a model of an ARISE extended MIPS processor has been designed.

In this work, a cross-platform design framework for FSS structures is presented and evaluated by utilizing a recently introduced evolutionary optimization algorithm, namely, the Multi-Variant Differential Evolution (MVDE). To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first time that the MVDE algorithm is applied to a design problem in Electromagnetics. The proposed design framework is described in detail and the utilized evolutionary algorithm is assessed in terms of its performance by applying several benchmark functions. In this context, the MVDE is comparatively evaluated against other popular evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, it is applied to the design and optimization of two different representative examples of FSS structures based on three use cases of unit cell geometry. Optimization results indicate the efficacy of the proposed framework by quantifying the performance of the designed FSS structures in terms of several system metrics. The optimized FSS structures exhibit dual-band operation and quite acceptable results in the ISM frequency bands of 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz.",

The algorithm is split in two parts; the first part performs pattern recognition on a lower resolution representation of the detector data; the second part computes linear fits of the tracks found in the matched patterns, using the full resolution version of the detector hits. The Fast TracKer system comprises a set of boards, two of which implement the main functionality. One is called Associative Memory Board (AMB), and mounts 4 Local Associative Memory Boards (LAMB), which in turn feature 16 Associative Memory Chips each; the pattern matching operation is performed in that board [4]. To each AMB, another board called the Auxilliary Board (AUX) is connected. Its main components are 4 FPGA units, corresponding to one LAMB each. They perform functions of data storage and the Track Fitting computations. The goal is to integrate each Associative Memory Chip with its own FPGA device and an auxilliary RAM memory die into a single package which will be called AMSiP, essentially miniaturizing the FTK system. In that way, much more track fitting performance is available per pattern and much smaller latency figures are possible. The target of the upgraded system will be tracking to assist in first level (L1) trigger selection [5, 6]. As a first stage, the current FTK detector layout is chosen for the structural parameters of the architecture for reasons of practicality, but the resulting system will be parametric and possible to target to other applications \u2026",

The problem addressed is to measure the current variations of digital circuits (and especially of embedded processing circuits) and try to identify from these measurements the energy consumption variations associated with certain tasks performed by the system software. Accurate monitoring of the instantaneous variations of the power supply current may provide the appropriate information for the estimation of the power consumption at different operating situations of the processor (core) and of the overall processing system as well (consumption of peripheral units). The proposed instantaneous current measuring approach, along with the execution of special test programs for analysis of inter-instruction effects, is expected to provide clear information of the power behavior of \u2026",

The AM is the heart of the FTK and it finds track candidates at low resolution that are seeds for a full resolution track fitting. To solve the very challenging data traffic problems inside the FTK, multiple designs and tests have been performed. The currently proposed solution is named the \u201cSerial Link Processor\u201d and is based on an extremely powerful network of 2 Gb/s serial links. This paper reports on the design of the Serial Link Processor consisting of the AM chip, an ASIC designed and optimized to perform pattern matching, and two types of boards, the Local Associative Memory Board (LAMB), a mezzanine where the AM chips are mounted, and the Associative Memory Board (AMB), a 9U VME board which holds and exercises four LAMBs. Special relevance will be given to the AMchip design that includes two custom cells optimized for low consumption. We report also on the performance of a first prototype based on the use of a min@ sic AM chip, a small but complete version of the final AM chip, built to test the new and fully serialized I/O. A dedicated LAMB prototype, named miniLAMB, with reduced functionalities, has been produced to test the mini@ sic. The serialization of the AM chip I/O significantly simplified the LAMB design. We report on the characterization of the min@ sic chip, the tests and performance of the integrated system mini@ sic, miniLAMB and AMB.",

The performance characteristics (cycle time, chip area) of the proposed technique have been evaluated for FPGA target implementations of the synthesizable ByoRISC model. It is proved that, a full bypassing network is a viable solution for the elimination of data hazards when servicing instructions with multiple read and write operands.

However, a major problem in pipeline systems is the occurrence of leaks, which result in many environmental problems, dangerous accidents and financial loss. For this reason, many leak detection techniques have been developed over the past years. In this paper, an Acoustic Emission (AE) method for the detection and localization of a leak in a pipeline is presented. The AE method employs the use of acoustic sensors mounted on the external surface of the pipeline, which receive acoustic signals created due to the existence of a leak. The localization of the leak can be achieved by determining the time difference between the moments that such an acoustic signal arrives to two adjacent sensors. Two ways for calculating this time difference are presented in this paper: the Threshold \u2026",

In this paper, a simple and robust modelling technique for the basic pass transistor structure is presented, which offers the possibility of fast timing analysis for circuits that employ pass transistors as controlled switches.

            "Abstract": "In many cases transistor aging may lead to the failure of a digital system before its designated lifetime requirement. The continuous stressing of transistors during operation affects their operational characteristics, degrading the performance of the circuits. The threshold voltage gradually increases and thus provoking the decrease of the driving ability of the transistors. This leads to a gradual degradation of the operating frequency making the system impossible to meet hard real time requirements after a certain time. New architectures have to be proposed for circuits which are mostly exposed to the aging phenomenon. In this paper, an alternative architecture for the counter unit is proposed which balances the transition activity through the circuit. The number of transitions at critical nodes of the circuit is reduced and thus the rate of performance degradation decreases.",

The proposed solution includes the utilization of an electronic stylus device that the user can use to initially identify the waveform's shape and then measure its properties. While the identification process can be easily implemented with the combination of a photocell and a tone buzzer to indicate where there's light present on the screen, the measurement of the period and the amplitude can be more challenging and requires a certain degree of accuracy and reliability. A previous design involved the mechanical rotation of a wheel, which was not satisfactory enough. The present design and realization are based on the optical motion sensor which resolves many of the problems \u2026",

ByoRISCs, as vendor-independent cores, provide extensive architectural parameters over a baseline processor, which can be customized by application-specific hardware extensions (ASHEs). Such extensions realize multi-input multi-output (MIMO) custom instructions with local state and load/store accesses to the data memory. ByoRISCs incorporate a true multi-port register file, zero-overhead custom instruction decoding, and scalable data forwarding mechanisms. Given these design decisions, ByoRISCs provide a unique combination of features that allow their use as architectural testbeds and the seamless and rapid development of new high-performance ASIPs. The performance characteristics of ByoRISCs, implemented as vendor-independent cores, have been evaluated for both ASIC and FPGA implementations, and it is proved that they provide a viable solution in FPGA-based system-on-a-chip design. A case study of an image processing pipeline is also presented to highlight the process of utilizing a ByoRISC custom processor. A peak performance speedup of up to 8.5 can be observed, whereas an average performance speedup of 4.4 on Xilinx Virtex-4 targets is achieved. In addition, ByoRISC outperforms an experimental VLIW architecture named VEX even in its 16-wide configuration for a number of data-intensive application kernels.",

            "Abstract": "Pipeline networks are one of the most efficient and extensively used means for transporting fluid products. However, they suffer from a serious problem that threatens their normal and secure operation, which is the occurrence of leaks. In this article, an acoustic technique for the localization of leaks in pipelines placed in the high-noise environment of an oil refinery is described. This technique is based on the estimation of the time delay between the moments at which an acoustic signal produced by a leak reaches two sensors mounted on the external surface of the pipeline at a certain distance between them. For this reason, three different time delay estimation methods, based on the cross-correlation procedure, are studied in this article. These methods are tested for their accuracy in the estimation of the leak position, as well as for their ability to work with measurements of short duration and the results are compared. This is important because the acquisition duration affects directly the response time of the leak localization system, which is a crucial parameter for the targeted applications. Finally, an algorithm for fast and accurate identification of the leak point is proposed. View Full-Text",

The traditional multi-class or binary classification approaches depend on the fact that real training data are required. However, in real pipeline scenarios the data generation for the leak class relies on measurements of artificially generated leaks which are different in nature than actual ones. Also, some pipelines are not equipped with the components to generate these leaks and in some cases, it is difficult to acquire a large and balanced leak dataset. Thus, in this paper, a set of one class classification models are applied that do not require training with real leak data. In this study's case, four one class classification models are trained on a single class representing the pipeline's normal operating noise.

            "Abstract": "Processor power savings that can be obtained by the application of data-reuse transformations on multimedia applications are discussed in this paper. Data Transfer and Storage Exploration methodologies primarily aim at memory related power reduction by moving data accesses to smaller memories, which are less power costly. However, it is shown that the applied code transformations have also a significant effect on the processor power consumption. Physical measurements of the average current drawn by instruction sequences provide a way to evaluate the processor power consumption of alternative code implementations. Simulation results prove that code transformations based on memory hierarchy exploration can have a significantly larger impact on power than existing software energy optimizing methodologies.",

The targeted safe operation levels of this type of systems are fully defined by the international standards. Low safe-operation levels are met in most medical devices. In this paper, a decentralized design approach is proposed that mimics human body's nervous system structure. This approach allows the achievement of high safe-operation levels that were not targeted before due to the high design complexity and the significant cost increase. A microcontroller was developed and served as the evaluation vehicle of the proposed approach. It was embedded in a commercial volumetric pump as the main core, resulting in a 99.9% and a 98%, permanent and transient fault cover respectively. Furthermore, an extension of the device's autonomy by 36% was achieved.",

It has to be done early in the design process and it requires significant time effort. Both the leakage currents and the static power consumption depend on many parameters, such as: process, dimensions, temperature, cell\u2019s input state and power supply voltage. In order to speed up the evaluation procedure, the Power Contributors method has been introduced. According to this method, any cell for any input state can be split up into elementary sub-circuits. By modeling all the leakages flowing onto these sub-circuits, expressions can be derived by just adding each contribution from each sub-circuit. This method has been applied here on an OAI22_X1 complex CMOS cell from NanGate library. Results are promising, since the mean relative error between the derived models and the results \u2026",

The power contributor approach which is based on the separability of the power components can be used for this purpose. In this paper, parametric models for the power contributor currents are produced for the cells of an industry oriented library. Using these models, the power contributor method is evaluated for the estimation of the total static power consumption of the library cells. The models produced are expressed as a function of the power supply voltage, temperature and the transistor width. Results show that the proposed model estimations present an average error of about 0.4% while the maximum error remains less than 2% for all the design corners of the tested cells.",

The use of such a parallelized architecture for real-time event selection opens up a new, huge computing problem related to the analysis of the acquired samples.

The Canny edge detector is the most implemented edge detection algorithm because of its ability to detect edges even in images that are intensely contaminated by noise. However, this is a time consuming algorithm and therefore its implementations are difficult to reach real time response speeds. Especially nowadays where the demand for high resolution image processing is constantly increasing, the need for fast and efficient edge detector implementations is ever so present. A new parallel Canny edge detector FPGA implementation is proposed in this paper to answer this demand. This design takes advantage of 4-pixel parallel computations to achieve high throughput without increasing the on-chip memory demands.

            "Abstract": "One of the most serious problems occurring in a pipeline network is the appearance of leaks. The process of detecting and localizing leaks in pipeline systems concerns a very extensive field of signal processing methods employed for this matter. In this paper a leak localization method combining the segmentation of acoustic leak signals, both in the time and in the frequency domain, with a statistical algorithm needed for dealing with the non-deterministic (stochastic) nature of these signals is proposed. This algorithm involves the use of cross-correlation techniques along with the grouping of the time-delay data in a histogram and selecting the bin with the largest number of elements as the one that provides the correct answer. The successful detection of the leak position requires the knowledge of the acoustic wave velocity in the pipe. In the present paper the calculation of the acoustic velocity is performed by the \u2026",

A new model for the inverter has been developed using a simplified transistor current model which incorporates the nanoscale effects for the planar technology. Parametric expressions for the output voltage are provided as well as the values of the output and supply current to be compatible with the CCS technology. The model is parametric according the input signal slew, output load, transistor widths, supply voltage, temperature and process. The transistor widths of the equivalent inverter are determined by HSPICE simulations and parametric expressions are developed for that using a fitting procedure.

It follows a \u2018\u2018Vires in Numeris\u2019\u2019 approach, combining the resources of commodity personal computers. It has a full peer-to-peer model of operation; all participating nodes share the exact same privileges and obligations. Another significant feature of LEARNAE is its high degree of fault tolerance. All training data and metadata are propagated through the network using resilient gossip protocols. This robust approach is essential in environments with unreliable connections and frequently changing set of nodes. It is based on a versatile working scheme and supports different roles, depending on processing power and training data availability of each peer. In this way, it allows an expanded application scope, ranging from powerful workstations to online sensors. To maintain a decentralized architecture, all underlying tech should be fully distributed too. LEARNAE\u2019s coordinating algorithm is platform agnostic, but for the purpose of this research two novel projects have been used: (1) IPFS, a decentralized filesystem, as a means to distribute data in a permissionless environment and (2) IOTA, a decentralized network targeting the world of low energy \u2018\u2018Internet of Things\u2019\u2019 devices.

It is intended to use low frequencies to detect and characterize leakage in order to increase the range of sensors and thus to reduce cost.

The answer for this demand comes from MPSoC platforms implemented on powerful FPGA devices, where high performance and a vast system architecture design flexibility is offered. Whilst many groups are targeting their research on developing automated tools for reducing the total time needed from designing to implementing an MPSoC platform on an FPGA, there is insufficient information on how to explore and determine the optimum memory architecture for such systems. This paper presents a design space exploration for FPGA-based multiprocessing systems using the Powerstone JPEG decoding algorithm as a case study. We explore algorithm partitioning and system architectures for exploitation of both data and task-level parallelism and we include in our study the \u2026",

Furthermore, the architecture is supported by a flexible development framework. By allowing the definition of alternate architectural parameters, the framework can be used to explore the design space and fine-tune the architecture at design time. Initially, two architectural enhancements, namely partial predicated execution and virtual opcode are proposed and the extensions performed in the architecture and the framework to support them, are presented. To evaluate these issues, kernels from the multimedia domain are considered and an exploration to derive an appropriate instance of the architecture is performed. The efficiency of the derived instance and the proposed enhancements are evaluated using an MPEG-2 encoder application.",

In this paper, tradeoffs encountered in the design of application-specific processors targeting embedded applications are discussed. The exploration of the architecture design space is a crucial step to effective instruction set generation as well as micro-architecture design. In this context, we identify operation pattern matching and hardware module allocation possibilities that should be accounted in hardware generation frameworks. For this reason, such modifications are applied on a pipelined processor model and their effect on execution performance and energy dissipation is measured via cycle-accurate simulations. As proof-of-concept, a real application, namely the full-search motion estimation algorithm used in video coding, is investigated.",

This method is based on measuring the instantaneous current drawn by the processor during the execution of the instructions. An appropriate instrumentation set up was established for this purpose. According to the proposed method the energy costs (base and inter-instruction costs) are modeled in relation to a reference instruction (eg NOP). These costs incorporate inter-cycle energy components, which cancel each other when they are summed to produce the energy consumption of a program resulting in estimates with high accuracy. This is confirmed by the results. Also the dependencies of the energy consumption on the instruction parameters (eg operands, addresses) are studied and modeled in an efficient way.",

Certain modifications introduced to the typical crossbar topology permit the parallel creation of partial products for faster multiplication. High-radix to binary data conversion is performed via a network of comparators.

Exploiting the temporal locality of memory accesses in data-intensive applications a set of data-reuse transformations on a typical motion estimation algorithm is determined. The aim is to reduce data related power consumption by moving background memory accesses to smaller foreground memories, which are less power costly. The impact of these transformations on power, performance and area is evaluated both for application specific circuits and general purpose processors. The number of data and instruction memory accesses is analytically calculated, enabling a fast exploration of the design space by varying algorithmic parameters.",

An accurate polynomial approximation to the conditional entropy of the sign bits has been developed permitting the direct calculation of the switching activity. The propagation of signals through common data-path operators is studied. A triple-bit type (TBT) model is introduced to accurately describe the three activity regions of the multiplier output.

During Run 1, the LHC has performed exceptionally well, routinely exceeding the design luminosity. From 2015 the LHC is due to operate with higher still luminosities. This will place a significant load on the High Level Trigger system, both due to the need for more sophisticated algorithms to reject background, and from the larger data volumes that will need to be processed. The Fast TracKer is a hardware upgrade for Run 2, consisting of a custom electronics system that will operate at the full rate for Level-1 accepted events of 100 kHz and provide high quality tracks at the beginning of processing in the High Level Trigger. This will perform track reconstruction using hardware with massive parallelism using associative memories and FPGAs. The availability of the full tracking information will enable robust trigger selection within the affordable latency available at the High Level Trigger, with only a limited degradation in performance arising from the additional pileup from higher luminosity running.",

Ant lion optimizer (ALO) is a nature-inspired stochastic metaheuristic that mimics the hunting behavior of ant lions using steps of random walk of ants, building traps, entrapment of ants in traps, catching preys, and re-building traps. To extend the classical single-objective ALO, this paper proposes four multiobjective ALO (MOALO) approaches using crowding distance, dominance concept for selecting the elite, and tournament selection mechanism with different schemes to select the leader. Numerical results from a multiobjective constrained brushless direct current (DC) motor design problem show that some MOALO approaches present promising performance in terms of Pareto-optimal solutions.

            "Abstract": "The trigger system of a detector installed at a hadron collider must have high efficiency for the interesting physics processes and it must suppress the enormous QCD backgrounds. A multilevel trigger [1] is an effective solution for this task. The ATLAS trigger system [2, 3, 4] is organized in three levels. The hardware Level-1 Trigger quickly locates the regions of interest in the calorimeter and the muon system, operating with output event rates up to 100 KHz. The subsequent trigger levels, Level-2 and the Event Filter are collectively known as the high-level trigger. They consist of software algorithms running on a farm of commercial CPUs. In the current ATLAS trigger, the information that comes from the silicon detectors are not used at Level-1 and only late and locally at Level-2. Early reconstructed tracks increase the performance of the system. The Fast TracKer processor (FTK)[5] is a hardware-based system designed for track reconstruction in the silicon detectors with offline quality and in time for Level-2 selections.The FTK processor is highly parallel. The detector is segmented into \u03b7\u2212 \u03c6 towers, each one processed by its own tracking processor. Each processor covers one sixteenth of the detector in \u03c6 (22.5, plus 10 overlap to maintain high efficiency) while the \u03b7 range of each region is divided into four overlapping intervals, for a total of 64 \u03b7\u2212 \u03c6 towers. Consequently, a tower receives only a fraction of the silicon hits, and a track reconstruction processor has substantially fewer candidates to process. Within each tower, we distribute the silicon data on 12 parallel buses at the full 100 KHz Level-1 output rate.",

A CCU, hardwired or reconfigurable, can be utilized in a hybrid, tight and/or loose, model of computation. By selecting the appropriate model for each part of the application, the complete application space can be considered for acceleration, resulting to significant performance improvements. To support these features ARISE proposes: i) a machine organization, ii) a set of Instruction Set Extensions (ISEs), and iii) a micro-architecture. To evaluate our proposal, a MIPS processor is extended with the ARISE infrastructure and implemented on an FPGA. Results show that the ARISE infrastructure can easily fit into the timing model of the processor.

            "Abstract": "Capacitive sensor manufacturing processes are rarely compatible with CMOS technologies and, thus, monolithic integration of sensing device and signal-conditioning IC is often not possible. Multi-chip packaging and wire bonding is employed instead, to interconnect sensor and IC dies. In such cases, sensor capacitance is comparable or even smaller than the parasitic interconnection capacitance, while interconnection parasitic resistance inserts additional signal distortion. The signal-conditioning IC must be designed to compensate for these parasitic effects. Switched-capacitor ICs may fulfil such specifications but the use of several operational amplifiers and intricate clocking schemes increase design complexity, die-size, and power consumption, which is inappropriate for wireless applications. In this work a low-power switched-capacitor IC for sub-fF capacitance measurements is presented. The proposed \u2026",

An ASIP for multimedia applications, designed based on a complete methodology, and the ARM9TDMI are used to evaluate this effect.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we propose a simple method that modifies the mathematical structure of behavioral memristor models by inducing a voltage dependency in the window functions which are normally expressed as solely state dependent. This empirical method is based on the assumption that the resistive states of analog memristor devices saturate at well-defined resistive levels under constant bias voltage application, which is supported by corresponding experimental data extracted from a wide range of analog memristor devices. As the vast majority of the simplified models published to date are constructed to fit hysteretic current-voltage characteristics of practical devices, the proposed transformation is applied to render empirical models more suitable for memristor-based analog applications where the memristor resistance is configured multiple times.",

In this paper, a simple and very accurate technique for the timing analysis of gates that involve pass transistor logic is presented. This investigation offers for the first time the possibility of simulating pass transistor and CPL gates by partitioning the behaviour of complex structures into well defined subcircuits whose interaction is studied separately. Using the proposed analysis, which is validated by results for two submicron technologies, most pass-transistor logic styles can be modelled efficiently. Consequently, a significant speed advantage can be gained compared with simulation tools that employ numerical methods such as SPICE.",

This algorithm is intended to be implemented into an application for modern smartphones, where the user can measure the quality of a sample of olive oil, only by taking photos from the sample. The determination of the adulteration percentage is done by separating the captured image into two regions: one that contains only the oil sample and another one, which contains the rest of the image. The colour difference between these two regions, for known adulteration percentages is used to determine the appropriate model that combines these quantities. Then, any other mixture of these oils, can be identified using the derived model and the methodology that is described in this paper.",

In that way the number of the FPGAs' reconfigurations is reduced and the performance is improved. Also, the configuration of the FPGAs is hidden because it happens, if it is possible, in the time intervals that the FPGAs are idle. Thus, the execution time of the task mapped on the FPGA does not increase due to reconfiguration time and performance is improved.

The AM is the heart of the FTK and it finds track candidates at low resolution that are seeds for a full resolution track fitting. To solve the very challenging data traffic problem inside the FTK, multiple designs and tests have been performed. The currently proposed solution is named the \u201cSerial Link Processor\u201d and is based on an extremely powerful network of 2 Gb/s serial links. This paper reports on the design of the Serial Link Processor consisting of the AM chip, an ASIC designed and optimized to perform pattern matching, and two types of boards, the Local Associative Memory Board (LAMB), a mezzanine where the AM chips are mounted, and the Associative Memory Board (AMB), a 9U VME board which holds and exercises four LAMBs. We report also on the performance of a first prototype based on the use of a min@ sic AM chip, a small but complete version of the final AM chip, built to test the new and fully serialized I/O. Also a dedicated LAMB prototype, named miniLAMB, with reduced functionalities, has been produced to test the mini@ sic. The serialization of the AM chip I/O significantly simplified the LAMB design. We report on the tests and performance of the integrated system mini@ sic, miniLAMB and AMB.",

A key element of this algorithm is the possibility to instantiate multiple clustering cores working on different windows that can be used in parallel to increase performance exploiting more resources on the FPGA device. In addition to the offered parallelism, the algorithm is executed in a pipeline, thus allowing the cluster readout to be performed in parallel with the cluster identification and the data pre-processing. The algorithm is developed for the Fast Tracker processor for the trigger upgrade of the ATLAS experiment but is easily adjustable to other image processing \u2026",

However, the lack of supporting design automation tools has hindered the widespread application of pass transistors. In this paper, a simple and robust modeling technique for the timing analysis of the basic pass transistor structure is presented. The proposed methodology is based on the actual phenomena that govern the operation of the pass transistor and enables fast timing simulation of circuits that employ pass transistors as controlled switches without significant loss of accuracy, compared to SPICE simulation.",

This method is based on evaluating a single feature, the root mean square of the acquired acoustic signal of a pipeline and relies on defining updateable thresholds based on the previously acquired values. If at any point, these values increase above the active threshold, a check routine is performed to identify if that event was transient and short-term. The presence of a leak can be modeled through this procedure as a long-term increase in the acquired rms values. The algorithm behind the operation is associated with a set of parameters, that are adjustable in such a way that the system can adapt to the transient noise characteristics of the pipeline under inspection. These parameters can be fine-tuned based only on noise measurements without the need for a training phase with artificially generated leaks. The algorithm can begin \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The extended use of tracking information at the trigger level in the LHC is crucial for the trigger and data acquisition (TDAQ) system to fulfill its task. Precise and fast tracking is important to identify specific decay products of the Higgs boson or new phenomena, as well as to distinguish the contributions coming from the many collisions that occur at every bunch crossing. However, track reconstruction is among the most demanding tasks performed by the TDAQ computing farm; in fact, complete reconstruction at full Level-1 trigger accept rate (100 kHz) is not possible. In order to overcome this limitation, the ATLAS experiment is planning the installation of a dedicated processor, the Fast Tracker (FTK), which is aimed at achieving this goal. The FTK is a pipeline of high performance electronics, based on custom and commercial devices, which is expected to reconstruct, with high resolution, the trajectories of charged-particle tracks with a transverse momentum above 1 GeV, using the ATLAS inner tracker information. Pattern recognition and the track parameter extraction are expected to be performed in roughly 100 ms, allowing all the high level trigger selections to use the tracks provided by FTK in order to build high quality and robust triggering.",

The AM is designed for massive parallelism in data correlation searches. This system is implemented as a large array of custom VLSI chips (AM chips), based on Content Address Memory (CAM). All the chips are identical and each one of them stores a preset number of \u201cpatterns\u201d. All the patterns in all the chips are compared in parallel to the incoming data from the detector while the detector is being read out. Data are distributed to the AM chips through a huge network of high speed serial links. The complexity of the\" pattern matching\" problem is one that increases exponentially when CPU-based algorithms are used. With the proposed system the complexity increase is reduced to linear and the problem is solved by the time data are loaded in the system.",

However, due to its computational complexity, software and hardware implementations for real-time video processing are usually limited to low resolutions and frame rates. We propose a novel architecture that exploits modern FPGA inherent parallelism capabilities, combined with efficient resource utilization and deep pipelining to enable real-time processing of high resolution, high frame rate videos.",

This method is based on measuring the instantaneous current drawn by the processor during the execution of the instructions. An appropriate instrumentation set up was established for this purpose. According to the proposed method the energy costs (base and inter-instruction costs) are modeled in relation to a reference instruction (e.g. NOP). These costs incorporate inter-cycle energy components, which cancel each other when they are summed to produce the energy consumption of a program resulting in estimates with high accuracy. This is confirmed by the results. Also the dependencies of the energy consumption on the instruction parameters (e.g. operands, addresses) are studied and modeled in an efficient way.",

The proposed model is the simplest primitive that can be used in order to obtain the propagation delay and short-circuit power dissipation of CMOS gates.

The problem addressed is to measure the energy consumed by a digital system during a number of clock cycles and to assign this consumption to a specific group of instructions. This kind of energy measurement provides the information needed for determining the energy consumption of specific software routines that run on digital processing systems. The proposed configuration is expected to provide clear information about the power behavior of single-chip processing systems as it may monitor the energy consumption during different tasks of operation.

The pixel's main advantages are the fact that it can be designed by using entirely n- type or p-type TFTs meaning that all the organic TFTs technologies can be applied and the small settle time.

The method is developed for input signals, which can be described by a stationary Gaussian process. The transition activity per bit of a signal word is modeled according to the dual-bit-type (DBT) model and it is described as a function of the signal statistics. An efficient analytical method has been developed for the determination of the signal statistics at each node of the MAC architecture. It is based on the mathematical formulation of the multiplexing in time of signal sequences with known statistics. The effect of the multiplexing mechanism on the breakpoints of the DBT model, which influences significantly the accuracy of the method, is also determined. Several experiments both with synthetic and real data have been conducted. The numerical results produced by the proposed models are in very good agreement with the measured values of the transition activity.",
