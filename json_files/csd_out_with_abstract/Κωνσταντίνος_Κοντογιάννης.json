For such systems which have a large number of classes and are subject to frequent modifications, detection and correction of design defects is a complex task. The use of automatic detection and correction tools can be helpful for this task. Various research approaches have proposed transformations that improve the quality of an object-oriented systems while preserving its behavior This paper proposes a framework where a catalogue of object-oriented metrics can be used-as indicators for automatically detecting situations where a particular transformation can be applied to improve the quality of an object-oriented legacy system. The correction process is based on analyzing the impact of various meta-pattern transformations on these object-oriented metrics.",

The process was based on metric-based clone analysis that produced clone clusters. Clones in the same cluster were then compared using token-based dynamic programming (DP) matching. Token-based clone differences, which included insertions, deletions, and substitutions, were then projected on to the ASTs corresponding to clones. Re-factoring opportunities were evaluated using: (1) classification of differences involving superficial differences, signature changes, and type changes, (2) number of differences, and (3) size of candidate clones.

Moreover, a user should be able to access his/her personalized services any time, anywhere, on any type of device and with any type of wireless technology in a non-obtrusive environment. The complexities and problems associated with a mobile-wireless environment should be insulated from the user. This new type of computing is what we call pervasive computing.In this thesis, a framework for accessing location-aware services (service invocation) and the protocols involved for a user to be able to access services across different locations and networks (service roaming) are presented. Service advertisement, service registration, and service discovery need to be performed before service invocation. The proposed framework uses Web services to achieve these objectives. Specifically, Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) are used for service advertisement and registration, UDDI is used for service discovery, and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is used for service execution. In order to determine the particular services that a user is accessing and maintain information related to the task that the user is performing, a stateful protocol is required. In this context, in order to implement service-roaming capabilities the framework uses a proxy-based architecture. By doing so, the client, location, and transaction details can be kept and processed while the user roams in different locations, and accesses different services.",

Software architecture analysis and reconstruction is an area within the software architecture domain that refers to the techniques and tools for processing and recovering high-level information from a low-level software system representation such as the source code. The importance of architecture analysis and reconstruction of a large and complex software system stems from the need to perform continuous maintenance activities to keep a mission critical system operational. Such activities include adopting a new implementation technology, error correction, feature enhancement, and migration to a new platform, in which the architectural reconstruction constitutes the major part of these activities.

To enable systematic development and maintenance, related models need to be kept synchronized. In order to establish and maintain consistency, we need to precisely define what it means for two models to be synchronized. In this paper, we present our view of model synchronization as a problem of maximizing model dependencies. Our conceptual view of software models is as graphs, and model transformations are viewed in terms of basic graph transformations such as node insertions and deletions. Based on this view, a set of transformations applied to one model is traced and propagated to the other by choosing, from a set of possible transformation paths, a path that maximizes underlying model dependencies.",

Object orientation provides means for systems to be well-designed to meet numerous non-functional quality requirements. However mismanagement of the maintenance process and ill-planned modifications usually are amplified in an object-oriented context. The paper presents a re-engineering framework that defines and categorizes a collection of source code transformations that aim to introduce design patterns in an ill-structured object-oriented system due to excessive maintenance process. The framework allows for five categories of transformations to be defined and associated through soft-goal dependency graphs for the target system. A case study that illustrates the use of the framework for the restructuring and introducing of design patterns to the GNU AVL Library is presented.",

This makes XML to be a natural choice to be used as the external representation formats for program representations. Most of the XML representations proposed so far abstract the source code at the AST level. These AST representations are tightly coupled with the language grammar of the source code and hence require development of different tools for different programming languages to perform the same type of analysis.

When a failure occurs, developers usually have limited information and time in their disposal for localizing the root cause of the observed failure.

Once such an initial set of methods has been identified, other more elaborate, complex, and computationally expensive data flow analyses could be applied. In this paper, we present a technique which aims to identify such an initial set of suspicious methods by first, retrieving information from failure reports obtained from Bugzilla repositories, second by combining this information with graph models that denote actual dependencies obtained from the subject system\u2019s source code in order to create an hypothesis space and third, by applying a ranking score to identify methods that have high likelihood of containing the root cause.

            "Abstract": "Embedded systems provide means for enhancing the functionality delivered by small-sized electronic devices such as hand-held computers and cellular phones. Java is a programming language which incorporates a number of features that are useful for developing such embedded systems. However, the size and the complexity of the Java language and its libraries have slowed its adoption for embedded systems, due to the processing power and storage space limitations. A common approach to address storage space limitations is for the vendor to offer special versions of the libraries with reduced functionality and size to meet the constraints of embedded systems. However, such an approach will severely limit the type of applications that can be deployed. This paper presents a technique that is used for selecting, on an as needed basis, the subset of library entities that is exactly required for a given Java \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Goal models have been extensively utilized in requirements engineering as they provide an expressive and qualitative way to represent requirements, while recent extensions related to contextual variability have further increased the expressiveness of the models. In addition to their application in requirements engineering however, goal models have been also proposed in the literature as a formal way to define the internal design of agents in multi-agent systems. In this paper we adopt the idea of applying goal models with contextual elements, ie conditional goals, decompositions and contributions, as a mean to model the internal design of agents. Furthermore, we express the way those agents can interact with each other in terms of commitments, a recently introduced modeling concept that can be used for the definition of communication protocols in multi-agent systems. In this context, we introduce a transformation process that maps all conditional elements to commitments and contributions, and hence, reasoning techniques that exist for commitments can be applied to contextual models with no further changes.",

This paper proposes a framework whereby object\u2010oriented metrics can be used as indicators for automatically detecting situations for particular transformations to be applied in order to improve specific design quality characteristics.

For defect proneness classification in particular, the use of Machine Learning classifiers has been touted as a promising approach. As a consequence, a large volume of research works has been published in the related research literature, utilizing either proprietary data sets or the PROMISE data repository which, for the purposes of this study, focuses only on the use of source code metrics as defect prediction training features. It has been argued though by several researchers, that process metrics may provide a better option as training features than source code metrics. For this paper, we have conducted a detailed extraction of GitHub process metrics from 150 open source systems, and we report on the findings of experiments conducted by using different Machine Learning classification algorithms for defect proneness classification. The main purpose of the paper is not to propose yet another Machine Learning technique for defect proneness classification, but to present to the community a very large data set using process metrics as opposed to source code metrics, and draw some initial interesting conclusions from this statistically significant data set.",

The technologies to implement SOA will certainly evolve to address emerging needs, but its concepts will remain. To address those needs and concerns that SOA is potentially being stretched beyond its limits, a significant and coordinated research program is needed. The SEI has developed an SOA Research Agenda with participation from a broad cross-section of the research community. The core of the agenda is a taxonomy that classifies topics into the business, engineering, and operations aspects of service-oriented systems, along with a set of cross-cutting aspects. Based on this taxonomy, the agenda outlines research areas, each of which is identified with its rationale, overview of current research, and delineation of research challenges and gaps. This report outlines the SOA Research Agenda. It also provides detail on specific re-search challenges related to the maintenance and evolution of service-oriented systems. The report concludes with a discussion of next steps in the evolution of the research agenda.Descriptors:",

The models underlying this process are related and their elements are usually mutually dependent. To preserve consistency and enable synchronization when models are altered due to evolution, the underlying model dependencies need to be established and maintained. As there is a potentially large number of such relations, this process should be automated for suitable scenarios. This paper introduces a tractable approach to automating identification and encoding of model dependencies that can be used for model synchronization. The approach first uses association rules to map types between models and different levels of abstraction. It then makes use of formal concept analysis (FCA) on attributes of extracted models to identify clusters of model elements.",

A number of algorithms for the static construction of an object oriented program's call graph have been developed in the compiler optimization literature in recent years. We investigate the effect of three such algorithms on the automatic clustering of the Java Expert System Shell (JESS). Object oriented programs have an inherently richer structure than those written in procedural languages, and so even medium sized programs such as JESS produce large graphs. Existing tools that we are aware of are not able to process such graphs. Consequently, we have developed our own algorithm for \u2026",

Software maintenance can be seen from two major points of view. First, the classic view where software maintenance provides the necessary theories, techniques, methodologies, and tools for keeping software systems operational once they have been deployed to their operational environment. Most legacy systems subscribe to this view of software maintenance. The second view is a more modern emerging view, where maintenance is an integral part of the software development process and it should be applied from the early stages in the software life cycle. Regardless of the view by which we consider software maintenance, the fact is that it is the driving force behind software evolution, a very important aspect of a software system.

Because of their expressiveness, the graphs have been widely used for representing both the software system and its high-level view, known as the conceptual architecture. Modeling the recovery process as graph matching is an attempt to identify a sub-optimal transformation from a pattern graph, representing the high-level view of the system, onto a subgraph of the software system graph. A successful match yields a restructured system that conforms to the given pattern graph. A failed match indicates the points where the system violates specific constraints. The pattern graph generation and the incrementality of the recovery process are the important issues to be addressed. The approach is evaluated through case studies using a prototype toolkit that implements the proposed interactive recovery environment.",

            "Abstract": "Analyzing the run time behavior of large software systems is a difficult and challenging task. Log analysis has been proposed as a possible solution. However, such an analysis poses unique challenges, mostly due to the volume and diversity of the logged data that is collected, thus making this analysis often intractable for practical purposes. In this paper, we present a log analysis technique that aims to compute a smaller, compared to the original, collection of events that relate to a given analysis objective. The technique is based on computing a similarity score between the logged events and a collection of significant events that we refer to as beacons. The major novelties of the proposed technique are that it is domain independent and that it does not require the use of a pre-existing training data set. The technique has been evaluated against the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation 1999 and the KDD 1999 \u2026",

In this paper we present an approach that allows for the identification of plans in the form of actions that satisfy a goal model when the environment is constantly changing. The approach is based on sequences of mutations of an initial solution, using a local search algorithm. Experimental results indicate that even for medium size models, the approach outperforms in execution time the weighted Max-Sat algorithms, while it is able to achieve an almost optimal solution. The approach is demonstrated on an example scenario of re-configuring a dynamically provisioned system.",

However, although significant progress is being made on several fronts, current efforts seem to be evolving in many directions.

As a research community that has gone through a substantial\u2015growth spurt\u2016 we find ourselves facing a great opportunity and challenge: to better channel our research efforts, we should attempt to reflect upon our progress to date and recognize how our efforts and results build on each other, and to identify\u2014and potentially prioritize\u2014the areas that we still need to investigate. The purpose of this project is to provide a long-term consensus SOA research agenda, classified into research issues pertaining to the business, engineering, and operation aspects of service-oriented systems, plus a set of cross-cutting aspects. An additional goal is to assemble an international research group to analyze the current state of the practice and current research initiatives in SOA and create a community of interest around SOA research to share results and ideas on how to improve SOA adoption and the development of service-oriented systems.",

Consequently, a two-phase supervised clustering process is used to incrementally generate new clusters. The proposed architectural recovery process is hierarchical in the sense that the software system is first decomposed into subsystems of files and then each subsystem can be further decomposed into modules of system entities such as functions, datatypes, and global variables. An interactive environment provides evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the obtained clusters according to their cohesion and coupling properties.

However, their primary use is still associated with forward engineering and the design phase of the software life-cycle. In this paper, we examine design patterns from a different perspective namely, their classification and usage for software re-engineering and restructuring. Specifically, twenty three design patterns originally presented in the \"Gang of Four\" book are reclassified for re-engineering purposes into two major categories, primitive and complex. Moreover, their relationships and impacts to specific re-engineering objectives are presented in terms of a layered model that is denoted by six different relations namely: uses, refines, conflicts, is-similar-to, combines-with, and requires. The paper also discusses how the classification scheme can be applied for the re-engineering and \u2026",

The approach utilizes a similarity measure between features of the incoming events and a set of filtering features we refer to as beacons. The similarity measure is based on information theory principles and uses caching techniques so that infinite log data streams and log data schema alterations can be handled. The approach has been applied successfully on the KDD-99 intrusion detection benchmark data set.",

However, these benefits come at the cost of the user partially losing control over the deployed resources and the cost managing platforms and applications that are now provisioned at an unprecedented rate and interaction complexity.

In this paper, we present an approach to integration and interoperability of enterprise applications through grammar-based model synchronization. As part of the approach, component and subsystem interfaces are viewed as instances of corresponding domains formally defined through annotated domain model grammars. The automated mapping between source and target interfaces is performed via association grammars that represent associated productions of the two domains.",

In this paper, we propose a goal driven software migration framework that aims to identify and extract a quality object model from a procedural system and to generate quality object oriented code that produces a platform for network-centric application integration. The framework is composed of analysis tools, transformation rules, and non-functional requirement models for the target migrant system. Specifically, to facilitate the design and development of such goal driven migration framework, source code transformation rules are associated with a degree of belief that they contribute towards enhancing a desired property for the target system. The migration process applies a search algorithm that is guided by the source code analysis to select a transformation sequence that has the highest likelihood of yielding such a target system. The migration of a selected set of gnu AVL libraries to a new object oriented platform is presented as a proof of concept for the proposed technique.",

Such systems need to be dynamically reconfigured or evolve in order to continue to meet their functional and non-functional requirements, as load and computation need to change. Such reconfiguration and/or evolution actions may cause other requirements to fail.Objective: Given models that describe with a degree of confidence the requirements that should hold in a running software system, along with their inter-dependencies, our objective is to propose a framework that can process these models and estimate the degree requirements hold as the system is dynamically altered or adapted.Method: We present an approach where requirements and their inter-dependencies are modeled using conditional goal models with weighted \u2026",

To facilitate process and service integration, a complete and information rich service description language, is essential for server processes to be specified and for client processes to be able to locate services that are available in Web-enabled remote servers. Within the context of emerging technologies, such as XML, Internet, and Web-enabled application servers, we propose an architecture that allows for the migration of legacy services to distributed environments. The architecture is based on legacy component wrapping, a service description language that allows for the specification of services at higher levels of abstraction than the standard Interface Description Languages (IDLs), and on techniques that support service registration and dynamic service localization.",

The aim is to provide a better and more seamless integration of these systems with the resource-oriented nature of the Web's ecosystem. Nevertheless, existing enterprise computing service systems and assets that follow primarily the procedure-oriented design and the lack of mature models, tools, and methodologies in building RESTful systems expose a number of issues and challenges that pertain to the use of resource orientation in enterprise computing.

However, a number of researchers and practitioners have criticized the Service Oriented Architecture paradigm as too complex and rigid. Instead, they have proposed an alternative architectural style called REST for accessing services and data through a collection of URIs, which uniquely identify and denote services and data as\" resources\" over the Web. The result is that client applications can use light-weight HTTP requests to obtain access and manipulate such\" resources\".",

However, source code representation schemes must be compact, accessible by well defined application programming interfaces (APIs) and above all portable to different operating platforms and various CASE tools. This paper proposes a program representation technique that is based on language domain modes and the XML markup language. In this context, source code is represented as XML DOM trees that offer a higher level of openness and portability than custom-made tool specific abstract syntax trees. The DOM trees can be exchanged between tools in textual or binary form. Similarly the domain model allows for language entities to be associated with analysis services offered by various CASE tools, leading to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Software re-engineering projects such as migrating code from one platform to another or restructuring a monolithic system into a modular architecture are popular maintenance tasks. Usually, projects of this type have to conform to hard and soft quality constraints (or non-functional requirements) such as \"the migrant system must run as fast as the original\", or \"the new system should be more maintainable than the original\". This paper proposes a framework that allows for specific design and quality requirements (performance and maintainability) of the target migrant system to be considered during the re-engineering process. Quality requirements for the migrant system can be encoded using soft-goal interdependency graphs and can be associated with specific software transformations that need to be carried out for achieving the target quality requirement. These transformations can be applied as a series of iterative \u2026",

The component association measure is computed on the shared properties among groups of highly related system entities. In this approach, the software system is modeled as an attributed relational graph with the software constructs (entities) represented as nodes and data/control dependencies represented as edges. The application of data mining techniques on the system graph allows to generate a component graph where the edges are labeled by the association strength values among the components. An interactive partitioning technique and environment is used to partition a system into cohesive subsystems where the graph visuali\u00ebation aids and cluster quality evaluation metrics are applied to assess and fine tune the partition by the user.",

First, we present a mechanism to compose services from constituent workflows to form a new target workflow. Second, since the composition process may entail the compliance to certain compositional, structural, or behavioral constraints we present a quantitative technique that is based on tolerance thresholds similar to those used in constraint satisfaction problems to restrict the number of constraints violated during the composition \u2026",

However, in practice conforming to the REST's uniform interface constraint in Web-based services most often proves to be a difficult task, as identified by a number of researchers and practitioners. This implementation and conformance difficulty can be partly attributed to the lack of a systematic conceptual framework that could be used to interpret abstract architectural restrictions of interface uniformity to practical design decisions and strategies being generalized as interface design criteria. These criteria could be then mapped to domain-specific techniques that provide the context for guiding and/or examining the level of uniformity of a REST-based API. In this paper, we \u2026",

Such frameworks should be able to (a) handle large requirements models, (b) assess system compliance repeatedly and frequently using events from possibly high velocity and high frequency data streams, and (c) use models that can reflect the vagueness that inherently exists in big data event collection and in modeling dependencies between components of complex and dynamically re-configured \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a project data analytics framework where first, analytics objectives are represented as goal models with conditional contributions; second, goal models are transformed to rules that yield a Markov Logic Network (MLN) and third, goal models are assessed by an MLN probabilistic reasoner. This approach has been applied with promising results to a sizeable collection of software project data obtained by ISBSG repository, and can yield results even with incomplete or partial data.",

In our approach we combine these three techniques, aiming to gain on their individual strengths and overcoming their weaknesses.

            "Abstract": "Root cause determination for software failures that occurred due to intentional or unintentional third party activities is a difficult and challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new technique for identifying the root causes of system failures stemming from external interventions that is based first, on modeling the conditions by which a system delivers its functionality utilizing goal models, second on modeling the conditions by which system functionality can be compromised utilizing anti-goal models, third representing logged data as well as, goal and anti-goal models as rules and facts in a knowledge base and fourth, utilizing a probabilistic reasoning technique that is based on the use of Markov Logic Networks. The technique is evaluated in a medium size COTS based system and the DARPA 2000 Intrusion Detection data set.",

            "Abstract": "Recent works by J.F. Sowa (2000) and D. Rayside and G.T. Campbell (2000) demonstrate that there is a strong connection between object-oriented programming and the logical formalism of the syllogism, first set down by Aristotle in the Prior Analytics (1928). In this paper, we develop an understanding of polymorphic method invocations in terms of the syllogism, and apply this understanding to the design of a novel editor for object-oriented programs. This editor is able to display a polymorphic call graph, which is a substantially more difficult problem than displaying a non-polymorphic call graph. We also explore the design space of program analyses related to the syllogism, and find that this space includes Unique Name, Class Hierarchy Analysis, Class Hierarchy Slicing, Class Hierarchy Specialization, and Rapid Type Analysis.",

The basic idea behind model-driven techniques is that, design artifacts of large software applications can be represented as a collection of models which can be consequently transformed and evolved to generate specific design artifacts and even source code that complies with specific programmatic paradigms and patterns. Even though model-driven frameworks have caught the attention of the software engineering community as a way to increase programmers? productivity and overall system robustness through the disciplined manipulation and transformation of models and ultimately code generation, they have remained so far only in the form of\" guidelines\" or\" standard practices\" \u2026",

The use of the system is presented in the form of a sample e-commerce application that involves shopping in a virtual store. The framework allows for customers and service providers to be linked through XML/EDI with back-end applications and to trigger e-procurement orders which are sent using either XML or EDI messages. Invoice handling and order tracking are also discussed along with extensions to the proposed architecture that allow for business process logic to be encoded at the server side, in the form of Event Condition Action scripts.",

This is often a large, complex Web site that is difficult to understand and maintain. Here, we propose an approach that aims to restructure an existing Web site by adapting them to a controller-centric architecture. In particular, this approach is twofold. First, it defines a domain model to represent dependencies between Web pages in order to abstract current structure of the Web site. Second, it designs a system architecture as a reference model for restructuring the Web site to the new structure. These principles will be illustrated through a case study using a reengineering tool that implements the refactoring process for a JSP-based Web site.",

The migration process focuses on specifying the identified legacy components in XML, consequently wrapping them by CORBA objects, and finally deploying the distributed component into the application server. A scripting language that is encoded in an XML format can be used for allowing thin clients to communicate with legacy components.",
