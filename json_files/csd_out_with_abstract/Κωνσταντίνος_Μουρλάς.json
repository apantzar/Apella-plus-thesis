            "Abstract": "The past years have witnessed a heavy investment and research in the eHealth sector. The work of medical practitioners at all levels is becoming more information intensive as sophisticated medical equipment and computer applications are more widely used. At the same time, the demands of the patients/citizens are increasing due to the innovative medical and scientific advances. Digital technologies are becoming more important in health management aiming to reduce the cost and to deliver health care services at a distance. In addition, the Internet is increasingly used by citizens to obtain medical information, therefore it is critical that the Web-based eHealth content and services are developed efficiently, complying with the established quality criteria and being available for all in an adaptive and personalized manner delivered by multiple and ubiquitous delivery channels. In this context, the aim of this paper is to argue that in the face of the existing systems and platforms diversity and information sparsity, mobile agent technologies can provide the base for ubiquitous, transparent, secure, interoperable, and integrated eHealth information systems for the provision of adapted and personalized sustainable services to the citizens.",

A challenge is to design an expressive ontology that is composed of human factors that can be used in any application, whether that is the WWW or any other embedded information system. Based on that ontology, engineers will design and develop personalized and adaptive interfaces and software. This will enable easy access to any content while being sufficiently flexible to handle changes in users\u2019 context, perception and available resources, optimizing the content delivery while increasing their comprehension capabilities and satisfaction.

We present a set of language constructs suitable for the definition of the required QoS and the real-time dimension of the media that participate in a multimedia application. We propose a new modeling scheme where we can represent every different presentation by a periodic task and then we describe a method that provides low-level support to these language constructs. The emphasis of the proposed strategy is on deterministic guarantees and can be considered as a next step for the design and the implementation of predictable continuous media applications over a network.",

Ten university students participated in two identical experiments, with a mixed between-within experimental design (20 samples). According to the findings, heart rate was significantly correlated with trait and self-reported state anxiety (in the second experiment), but not with academic performance in an on-line exam. Skin conductance and blood volume pulse had only marginal variations, perhaps due to the absence of intense stimuli.",

Previous studies have shown that an interactive tool tends to educate users better than a pure textual source and it can be argued that in the educational field of perpetual learners such as students with mental retardation, game is a basic form of pedagogy. However, despite the theoretical connection of existing digital game design with accepted general pedagogy methodologies and practices, the important sector of Special Education has not yet been the objective of considerable research.This paper outlines various theories of Special Educational Needs (SEN) pedagogy with a special interest in mental retardation, in order to demonstrate how educational and commercial games are able to embody the fundamental elements of SEN educational methodologies. More precisely, the paper examines how commercial and educational games support various SEN methodologies and theories regarding mental retardation pedagogy such as those described by Christakis (2002), Kalantzis (1985) and Soulis (2002).",

Accordingly, a design of a human factors\u2019 ontology has been proposed, called UPPC (User Perceptual Preference Characteristics), and could be used in any Web-based application for returning an optimized adaptive result to the user. An existing commercial Web-site was filtered through an adaptive mechanism based on that ontology. This mechanism is described by a proposed Web browser extension set of custom xml tags for the imminent automatic transformation and enhancement of the Web-based content. The expected impact of the content reconstruction lies in the increase of users\u2019 satisfaction and efficiency of information processing (both in terms of accuracy and task completion time), while users navigating in the personalized condition rather than the original one.",

            "Abstract": "Early school leaving (ESL) is an urgent and serious problem, both for individuals and society as a whole. Factors such as learning difficulties, social problems or a lack of motivation, guidance or support all contribute to ESL, although the situation varies across EU countries. High rates of ESL are detrimental to making lifelong learning a reality and increase the risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. Since normally there is not a unique reason for leaving education or vocational training, answers are no easy. In response to these concerns, the Code RED project (http://www. coderedproject. eu) has been created to address the high proportion of drop out from Initial Vocational Education and Training (IVET) and ESL in the UK, Greece, Italy and Cyprus via the development of new games-based learning applications (both desktop and mobile) to inform young adults (aged 16+) of the issues surrounding ESL. Location-based gaming (LBG) applications represent a form of play that is designed to be undertaken on a device in motion which changes the game experience based on the location. The design of these products presents many challenges to developers surrounding user interfaces, processing power and the availability of space. The ARIS platform (Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling) covers a broad field of LBG design components such as geo-location data, location-sensitive informational objects, interactive dialogues and QR code input. As such, ARIS has been selected by Code RED researchers to teach LBG and mobile augmented reality design concepts and prototype new design ideas with young adults. This \u2026",

In this chapter, the authors discuss the lack of alignment between collaborative learning and assessment practices. They will argue that peer assessment is a form of collaborative learning and a mode of assessment that perfectly fits the purpose of collaborative learning. As such, the authors purposefully depart from the more traditional application of assessment as a summative tool and advocate the consideration of formative peer assessment in collaborative learning. This shift towards formative assessment they believe has the potential to enhance learning. Their goal in this chapter is to review both shortcomings of current peer assessment practice as well as its potential for collaborative learning. Interactivity is central to foster the alignment between assessment and collaborative learning and the authors present a set of guidelines derived from research for increasing interactivity through formative peer assessment among peers in collaborative learning contexts.",

            "Abstract": "Finding and presenting information on the World Wide Web (WWW) has been a challenging and urgent problem almost from the beginning of the proliferation of Web sites (Pitkow & Kehoe, 1996). The vast number of Web sites makes it hard, or indeed impossible, to find the appropriate site (Lawrence, Giles, & Bollacker, 1999). Similarly, the growing size and complexity of Web sites makes it very difficult to locate information within specific Web pages. The problem of finding and presenting information in a site has become an important area of research, with several solutions currently being pursued.This research has also provided a good basis for the developing notion of personalization and for the advent of adaptive hypermedia systems (Brusilovsky & Nejdl, 2004; Eklund & Sinclair, 2000) that take into account users\u2019 individual characteristics, aiming to provide tailor-suited information. Therefore, Web adaptation and personalization techniques and paradigms are employed in order to alleviate such problems by presenting information based on the needs and preferences of users, by dynamically adapting the user\u2019s view according to the task at hand. In parallel, Web-based educational applications have also proliferated throughout the extensive development of the Internet, along with a significant research interest on this channel of instruction. Individual differences in e-learning constitute an interdisciplinary research area, and most approaches derive from the fields of computer science and/or psychology, as a result of combined efforts to improve the effectiveness of Web-based education.",

It is also recognizable as an inhibited physiological process expressed by the human brain as induced or suppressed hormonal and neural stimulation that subsequently instigates a physical and mental level of attentiveness attractiveness or aversiveness. Physical reactions to emotion causing events and stimuli in affective computing are classified by direct mapping of facial and postural expressions to corresponding patterns, by using visual and postural observation methods. Despite the fact that physiological assessment is generally more reliable and less error-prone, a higher amount of research has been devoted to visual and postural methods due to the greater complexity and specific knowledge requirements of the former.

Since the user population is relatively diverse, such traditional static hypermedia applications suffer from an inability to satisfy the heterogeneous needs of the many users. Moreover, with the growth of mobile and wireless communication allowed service providers to develop for users new ways of interactions through a variety of channels in an anyhow, anytime and anywhere manner, but developing also more demanding requirements. This paper makes an extensive reference to user profiling considerations. It underpins the emergence of the mobile and wireless technology and the \u201cnew\u201d user profiling requirements that arise, with visual, emotional and cognitive processing parameters incorporated.

This integration of constraint solving into abductive reasoning facilitates a general form of constructive abduction and enables the application of abduction to computationally demanding problems. The paper studies the formal declarative and operational semantics of the ACLP framework together with its application to various problems. The general characteristics of the computation of ACLP and of its application to problems are also discussed.

Contemporary game theorists have gone further to suggest that there is a mapping between the model of learning motivation and the experience of playing digital games. However the question remains: What happens in an educational setting when games are introduced, are digital games able to become an agent of change, enhance self-determination and the willpower to learn for students with intellectual disability?

The development cited in this chapter circumvents the above constraints by using a proprietary real-time system. An algorithm assessing coinciding excitation of two important physiological quantities is used to evaluate classifiers indicative to focused attention and engagement. Experiments \u2026",

In recent years, there has been significant research and experimentation around the adaptation and personalization of the eLearning hypermedia that mainly concerns the timely delivery and adjustment of the content to user\u2019s needs and perceptual characteristics. This chapter provides a new comprehensive approach of reconstructing eLearning content; by creating a user profile based on specific metrics of cognitive processing parameters (such as cognitive style, cognitive processing speed efficiency, working memory factors and affective parameters) that have specific impact into the information space. Such approach may be proved to be very useful in assisting and facilitating a student to better understand eLearning content and therefore increase his/her academic performance. In view of that, an adaptation and personalization Web-based environment has been developed. It is detached into a number of interrelated components, each one representing a stand alone Web system. An evaluation of the proposed environment is presented with the results being highly promising and encouraging for the continuation of our research, since there has been identified significant increase of learners\u2019 academic performance when interacting with the personalized eLearning environment that is matched to their cognitive and affective parameters as well as visual working memory span capabilities.Adapting to user context, individual features and \u2026",

It is also recognizable as an inhibited physiological process expressed by the human brain as induced or suppressed hormonal and neural stimulation that subsequently instigates a physical and mental level of attentiveness attractiveness or aversiveness. Physical reactions to emotion causing events and stimuli in affective computing are classified by direct mapping of facial and postural expressions to corresponding patterns, by using visual and postural observation methods. Despite the fact that physiological assessment is generally more reliable and less error-prone, a higher amount of research has been devoted to visual and postural methods due to the greater complexity and specific knowledge requirements of the former. Concentrating more on the physiological aspect of assessing affect, we have developed a biofeedback device, sensing reactions instigated by emotion-causing events and results have been assessed in real-time using suitable visualization methods. In previous attempts to acquire this type of measurements, human subjects were physically and psychologically impaired by the electrodes and wiring attachments used for the acquisition of signals and therefore validity of data was to some extent in question. In order to achieve an uncompromising assessment environment we designed a system that acquires heart rate and stress measurements via an ordinarily looking computer mouse.

Our more recent experiments, explore how to improve learning process by adapting course content presentation to student cognitive styles and capabilities in mobile environments such as PDA phones. A framework has been developed to comprehensively model student\u2019s cognitive styles and visual working memory span and present the appropriate subject matter, including the content, format, guidance, etc. to suit an individual student by increasing efficiency during interaction. Main aim is to overcome constraints like small screen size and processing/memory capabilities for navigation enhancements that limit the presentation and guidance of the material. An increase on users\u2019 satisfaction as well as more efficient information processing (both in terms of accuracy and task completion time), has been observed in the personalized condition than the original one. Consequently, it is supported that human factors may be used in order to enhance the design of mobile hypertext (or hypermedia) environments in a measurable and meaningful way.",

The main objective of this paper is to introduce a framework for the automatic reconstruction of Web content based on human factors. Human factors and users\u2019 characteristics play the most important role during the entire design and implementation of the framework which has the inherent ability to interact with its environment and the user and transparently adapt its behaviour using intelligent techniques, reaching high levels of usability, user satisfaction, effectiveness and quality of service presentation. The initial results of the evaluation have proven that the proposed framework do not degrade the efficiency (in terms of speed and accuracy) during the Web content adaptation process.",

Over the course of time, a combination of developments in statistical know-how and the evolution of thought within psychology enabled the refinement of measures, and subsequently the assessment of more specific factors in the field of individual differences like different kinds of ability, affect and emotion. This knowledge has been used in many areas within psychology and at the same time the advancement of technology has enabled the development of web-based systems that measure specific factors relevant to specific situations. Our research focuses on the emotional mechanisms that drive human behaviour in general and how we can implement a set of rules to web design so that we can promote system adaptability on the very important field of human emotions which is at the same time extremely difficult to describe and define. In this paper we introduce our model of emotion regulation and we present our first experimental results that concern the concepts of emotional experience and emotional expression and their effect on decision making and problem solving styles. Furthermore, we present the implications that these theoretical and empirical representations can have in web applications and design. \u00a9 2011 IADIS.",

The human factors that were taken into consideration in the personalization process were cognitive style, visual working memory span, control/speed of processing and anxiety. With the exception of control/speed of processing, matching the instructional style to users\u2019 characteristics was revealed to be statistically significant in optimizing their performance (n=219). On the basis of this empirical assessment, this paper argues that individual differences at this intrinsic level are important, and their main effect can be manipulated by taking advantage of adaptive technologies.",

Previous work of the authors in the field has demonstrated that personalization on human factors, including the WM sub-component of visuospatial sketchpad, may assist learners in optimizing their performance. To that end, a deeper approach in WM has been carried out, both in terms of more accurate measurements and more elaborated adaptation techniques. This paper presents results from a sample of 80 university students, underpinning the importance of WM in the context of an e-learning application in a statistically robust way. In short, learners that have low WM span expectedly perform worse than learners with higher levels of WM span; however, through proper personalization techniques \u2026",

This strategy makes the timing properties and the quality of presentation of a set of media streams predictable. The proposed strategy provides deterministic guarantees and service reliability for each stream that can't be compromised by server contention. Our real-time scheduling approach exploits the performance of parallel environments and seems a promising method that brings the advantages of parallel computation in media servers. The proposed mechanism provides deterministic service for both constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) streams. We present an efficient placement strategy for data frames as well as an adaptability strategy that allows appropriate frames to be dropped without sacrificing the ability to present multimedia applications predictably in time.

Distance learning (or eLearning) is considered one of the most rapidly evolving application areas of the Web that improves the traditional educational processes and methodologies of knowledge transfer. In recent years, there has been significant research and experimentation around the adaptation and personalization of the eLearning hypermedia that mainly concerns the timely delivery and adjustment of the content to user\u2019s needs and perceptual characteristics. This paper provides a new comprehensive way of reconstructing eLearning content; by creating a user profile based on specific metrics of cognitive processing parameters (such as cognitive style, cognitive processing speed efficiency and working memory factors) that have specific impact into the information space. The combination of the cognitive user profile and the \u2018traditional\u2019user characteristics (eg age, gender, profession) could become the main personalization filter for eLearning environments. Such approach may be proved to be very useful in assisting and facilitating a student to better understand eLearning content.. In view of that, an adaptation and personalization Web-based environment, namely EKPAIDEION, has been developed. An evaluation with approximately 128 users has been conducted with the results being highly promising and encouraging, since there has been identified significant increase of learners\u2019 academic performance when interacting with our personalized \u2026",
