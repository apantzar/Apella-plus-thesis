All buffering needs are covered through electronic buffering, avoiding hard to implement and expensive optical buffering. 3D P-Torus can support, with no need for amplification, medium-sized-DCs up to 10k servers, making it an excellent candidate for Edge Data Centers, taking into account its excellent low end-to-end latency.",

A crucial component for a MDM transmission system is the mode multiplexer (MUX), which should be broadband enough to be used in a WDM context. A broadband all-fiber mode MUX based on cascaded FMF couplers is presented and numerically analyzed. The MUX combines modes LP 01 , LP 11a , LP 11b , LP 21a , LP 21b , and LP 02 , with an optimized performance over the C band.

Extensive numerical simulations illustrate that the feedback phase is of extreme importance as far as synchronization is concerned. The ability of an eavesdropper to attack the intensity-modulated message when a pseudorandom variation of the feedback phase is imposed at the transmitter's side is numerically quantified by bit-error-rate calculations. The analysis demonstrates that the eavesdropper is not able to synchronize and hence to extract the message when he is not aware of the phase variations even if he is equipped with an identical chaotic device.",

The block diagram of the simulation setup and simulation results are shown in Fig. 1.The transmitter and receiver block diagram of the proposed SFBC 2x1\u2013OFDM scheme is shown in Figure (1. a). The major difference between conventional OFDM transmitter and SFBC 2x1\u2013OFDM transmitter lies in the fact that before IDFT section there is a SFBC Encoder. It encodes the data vector stream S=[s0 s1 s2\u2026 sN-1] into two vectors S1=[s0\u2013s1*\u2026 sN-2-sN-1*] and S2=[s1 s0*\u2026 sN-1 sN-2*].

            "Abstract": "We develop a framework for estimating the quality of transmission (QoT) of a new lightpath before it is established, as well as for calculating the expected degradation it will cause to existing lightpaths. The framework correlates the QoT metrics of established lightpaths, which are readily available from coherent optical receivers that can be extended to serve as optical performance monitors. Past similar studies used only space (routing) information and thus neglected spectrum, while they focused on old-generation noncoherent networks. The proposed framework accounts for correlation in both the space and spectrum domains and can be applied to both fixed-grid wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and elastic optical networks. It is based on a graph transformation that exposes and models the interference between spectrum-neighboring channels. Our results indicate that our QoT estimates are very close to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The performance of future ultra-long haul communication systems exploiting phase-encoded signals is likely to be compromised by noise generated during signal transmission. One potential way to mitigate such noise is to use Phase Sensitive Amplifiers (PSAs) which have been demonstrated to help remove phase as well as amplitude noise from phase-encoded signals. Recently, we showed that a PSA-based signal regenerator based on degenerate four-wave mixing can be implemented in a network-compatible manner in which only the (noisy) signal is present at the device input (black-box operation). The developed regenerator was also able to perform simultaneous wavelength conversion and multicasting, details/analysis of which are presented herein. However, this scheme was tested only with artificial noise generated in the laboratory and with the regenerator placed in front of the receiver, rather than in \u2026",

The study is based on the RIN evaluation of the converted signal, under various operating conditions (input power levels and wavelength detuning) and input noise characteristics. A detailed numerical model is employed to simulate the FWM process, taking into account the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, the wavelength dependent gain, and the interaction of four waves in the SOA (two input waves and two product waves). It is shown that for low noise input signals, the output RIN is determined by the power levels of the pump and signal and the wavelength detuning. Operation under saturation allows reduction of the output RIN levels with respect to the input",

In this paper, we combine two unique properties of semiconductor lasers that operate at a chaotic regime: Their potential to become highly synchronized when optically coupled through appropriate configurations and their ability to seed ultrafast true random bit generators.

Traditional data center network architectures, through the use of electrical packet switches in a multi-tier topology, has fundamental weaknesses such as oversubscription and cabling complexity. Wireless intra-data center interconnection solutions have been proposed to deal with the cabling problem and can simultaneously address the over-provisioning problem by offering efficient topology re-configurability. In this work we introduce a novel free space optical interconnect solution for intra-data center networks that utilizes 2D optical beam steering for the transmitter, and high bandwidth wide-area photodiode arrays for the receiver. This new breed of free space optical interconnects can be developed on a photonic integrated circuit; offering ns switching at sub-\u03bcW consumption. The proposed interconnects together with a networking architecture that is suitable for utilizing those devices could support next generation intra-data center networks, fulfilling the requirements of seamless operation, high connectivity, and agility in terms of the reconfiguration time.

Noise and laser-mismatch induced instabilities cause short de-synchronization events within the overall generalized synchronization, influencing the pragmatism of using these signals in secure data exchange applications. However, such operation can be functional for user authentication and sensing applications by assessing a time-averaged performance of synchrony. Until now, this has not been examined either in large-scale laser network configurations or in large transmission coupling paths, as real network implementations oblige. Here we present the first implementation of a fully-coupled fiber network with up to 16 semiconductor lasers, independently controlled and coupled through long \u2026",

We find that below the threshold, the locking characteristics as locking range, shape and bandwidth, are different in comparison with those above threshold. In addition, we also investigate injection locking into longitudinal side modes of the slave laser apart by several longitudinal mode hops, and observe similar characteristics, however, with the potential to achieve higher relative intensity noise suppression.

The regenerator FP laser is injection locked to one of its longitudinal modes by the incoming intensity-modulated light carrying the microwave-frequency standard. The light of a local CW laser is also injected in the regenerator FP, locking it to an adjacent mode. The dual-injection locked laser reproduces the sinusoidal microwave-frequency standard on both wavelengths. The regenerated original signal is transmitted to the next node, whilst the local wavelength is fed back to the previous node for phase error extraction and link compensation. The performance of the proposed regenerator is demonstrated with Allan deviation and phase-noise measurements.",

The nonlinear medium used in the experiments is a bulk Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA). The measurements are carried out for different operating conditions (pumping level of the SOA, input power, input signals with different intensity noise characteristics, etc.). A complete numerical model is employed to simulate the FWM process, taking into account interaction of four waves in the SOA (two input waves and two product waves). The latter is used in order to obtain realistic behavior of the model, when operation at a wide range of input power is considered. The theoretical interpretation of the above results is based on the static transfer function of the FWM process where all waves interacting in the SOA are continuous waves (CW).",

Usually, only undemanding post-processing is needed to convert the acquired analog timeseries to digital sequences that pass all established tests of randomness. A novel architecture that can generate and exploit these true random sequences is through a fiber network in which the nodes are semiconductor lasers that are coupled and synchronized to central hub laser.

In this work we investigate a bidirectional coupling topology, with two or more SLs coupled with a common hub SL, which leads to an unprecedented level of synchronization. Cross-correlation (CC) values as high as 0.9961 are reported between SLs, when the latter operate at a fully chaotic regime and with spectral emission profiles that show minimized periodicities.

This mismatch creates asymmetric and shifted mode resonances (Fano resonances) inside the microcavity, extending the finesse of the system. So as to evaluate the proposed scheme, a transfer matrix and a numerical model have been utilized.

Semiconductor microring resonators have already been demonstrated as all-optical gates using two-photon absorption (TPA) as the switching mechanism. However free-carrier lifetime puts an upper limit in high-speed device applications. By using an ultra-fast non-linear process such as FWM, operation at bit rates up to 40 Gb/s is demonstrated for both non-return to zero (NRZ) and return to zero (RZ) modulation formats. The dependence of successful gate operation in terms of microring structural parameters and operating conditions is investigated.",

The sensing principle relies on the change of the laser repetition frequency that is induced by optical feedback from the object under measurement. It has been previously observed that, when a semiconductor passively mode locked laser receives a sufficient level of optical feedback from an external reflecting surface it exhibits a repetition frequency that is no more determined by the mode-locking rule of the free-running operation but is imposed by the length of the external cavity. Therefore measurement of the resulting laser repetition frequency under self-injection permits the accurate and straightforward determination of the relative position of the reflecting object. The system has an inherent wireless capability since the repetition rate of the laser can be wirelessly detected by \u2026",

A single-mode operation regime for these types of microring resonator is important since A III B V ring waveguides have a highly multimodal behaviour which can affect the functionality of microring resonator based devices. We have found that this problem can be solved by imposing a lateral offset (a misalignment between the ring and the bus waveguide) that allows the radiation carried in the bus waveguide to be coupled predominantly into the ring waveguide's fundamental mode. The coupling coefficient variation with the lateral offset is useful for assessing the fabrication tolerance. We have concluded that the use of the offset is effective for obtaining single-mode operating microring resonator devices.",

One interesting deployment scenario includes PUFs as random key generators. The deterministic nature of their operation alleviates the necessity to store the keys in non-volatile means. Along the same lines, blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data once stored while their overall security depends on the quality and secrecy of users' keys.

A polarization assisted-PSA, consisting of two orthogonally-polarized pumps and a phase-locked signal copolarized to one of them, was implemented in a low-birefringence silicon germanium (SiGe) waveguide. The strong TE/TM modal symmetry of the waveguide and its large nonlinear coefficient enabled the achievement of an extremely large phase sensitive extinction ratio of approximately 29 dB for a total input power of only 21.3 dBm. This SiGe-based PSA was used to demonstrate phase regeneration on a 20 Gb/s differential phase-shift keying signal, thereby reducing its error vector magnitude and phase error by three and six times respectively and enabling a bit-error ratio improvement of up to 2 dB.",

A polarization-dependent loss of just 0.42 dB was measured, and the conversion of 40-Gb/s differential phase-shift keying signals was demonstrated with 1.5-dB power penalty at a bit error ratio of 10 -9 .",

Our results and the corresponding theoretical explanations elucidate several aspects of the laser dynamics under self-injection including inherent properties of mode-locked lasers such as pulse intensity noise and timing jitter. We show that the dynamics of the laser exhibit a periodicity in the wavelength scale apparent only on integer multiples of the laser cavity and decays in the time scale of the pulse duration following the coherence of the mode-locked laser. The corresponding phenomena are dominant for external cavities that are shorter than the laser cavity and superimposed on the previously reported dynamics of the semiconductor mode-locked lasers for longer external delays.

It is shown that the notch spectral response of output ports is responsible for the intraband crosstalk appearing on the dropped signals in add/drop operation. The investigation of the filter performance is performed with modulated signals at both the input and the add port. The analysis highlights the strong competition between the levels of induced intraband crosstalk and the wavelength selectivity at high bit rate add/drop operation, even in higher order filters. Multistage add/drop topologies that address the inefficiencies of the single-stage add/drop filters are proposed, and successful operation at 40 Gbps nonreturn to zero and return to zero signals is numerically demonstrated.",

The concept allows for the integration of an active ring laser vertically coupled to a transparent bus waveguide. All necessary layers are grown in a single epitaxial run so that the critical coupling gap can be precisely controlled with the high degree of accuracy of epitaxial growth. One key challenge of the project was to establish a reliable wafer bonding technique using BCB as an intermediate layer. In intensive tests we investigated and quantified the effect of unavoidable shrinkage of the BCB on the overall device performance.

In our approach, the top mirror of the Fabry\u2013Perot cavity is an Au/SiO2 movable membrane, formed by anisotropic etching of (1 1 1)-oriented Si wafers. The Au layer provides a good reflectivity of the upper mirror. The air\u2013silicon surface acts as the lower mirror, as the anisotropic etching of (1 1 1)-oriented Si wafers provides very smooth surfaces.

Their filtering performance is limited by the existence of phase errors in the grating waveguides due to fabrication imperfections. In this paper, the statistical properties of the phase errors are related to the waveguide imperfections using a variation of the effective index method. The filtering quality of the AWG is then investigated by considering the behavior of its transfer function in the presence of random phase errors. The probability density function of the transfer function's sidelobes is evaluated numerically, and the results are justified using theoretical considerations. Finally, the behavior of the maximum sidelobe level is also analyzed numerically, and universal diagrams are presented that allow the estimation of its mean value, standard deviation, and cumulative distribution \u2026",

We present comprehensive investigations of the operation regimes under which the laser system behaves as an efficient sensor and demonstrate its dependence on critical parameters such as the coupling strength between the two lasers and their bias currents.

The mmwave signals undergo phase shifts imposed by optical true time delay networks, to provide squint free beams. Multicore fibers are used to transfer the phase shifted optical signals. However, the inter-core static skew of these fibers, if not compensated, distorts the radiation pattern. We propose an efficient method to compensate the differential delays, without full equalization of the transmission path lengths, reducing the power loss and complexity. Statistical analysis shows that regardless of the skew distribution, the frequency response can be estimated with respect to the rms skew delays. Simulation analysis of the complete Radio over Fiber and RF link validates the method.",

By using a straightforward configuration we experimentally prove that the amplified             spontaneous emission noise of an optical amplifier\u2014either an Er^+3-doped fiber             amplifier (EDFA) or an InGaAs semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)\u2014is an efficient             source for TRBS generation. A bit rate up to 560 Gb/s has been recorded, seeded by the             direct detection of the unfiltered spontaneous-spontaneous (sp-sp) optical intensity             beat noise on a broadband photoreceiver. The generation rate is practically limited only             by the detection bandwidth, the electronic digitization process and the post-processing             circuitry.

The detected intensity in TPEF and SHG depends quadratically on the pulse peak power and linearly on the pulse width and repetition rate. Quantum-dot (QD) based semiconductor pulse sources have shown to generate ultrashort pulses and high peak power [1]. QD semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) are very suitable to increase the power of these ultrashort pulses due to their high gain saturation characteristics, broad gain bandwidth and fast gain recovery. Such combined systems are compact, efficient and robust thus being promising alternatives to solid state pulsed lasers. Recently, an external cavity laser and amplifier combination \u2026",

The key issue in the proposed idea is the application of the modulation bitstream on the input pump wave. Detailed numerical simulation shows that it is possible to achieve a wavelength-converted output with extinction ratio of 20 dB when the extinction ratio of the input signal is 10.5 dB, while at the same time, the improvement in the Q-factor is almost 6 (from 6.5 at the input, it becomes more than 12 at the output).

The laser emission wavelength was controlled through a chirped volume Bragg grating which was used as an external cavity output coupler. An average power of 208.2 mW, pulse energy of 321 pJ, and peak power of 30.3 W were achieved. Preliminary nonlinear imaging investigations indicate that this system is promising as a high peak-power pulsed light source for nonlinear bio-imaging applications across the 1.0 \u03bcm - 1.3 \u03bcm spectral range.",

In order to prevent the need of accurate wavelength control the transfer function of the AWG should ideally have a rectangular shape.  Several techniques have been proposed in order to flatten the Gaussian-like transfer function of the conventional AWG.  In this paper we propose a new technique is based  on the modification of the arrayed waveguide lengths and their positions on the Free Propagation Regions.  The above technique is similar to the deterministic tapering technique used in the design of antenna arrays, since the spatial transfer function of the latter has the same characteristics as the spectral transfer function of an AWG.  Therefore, problem is reduced to that of matching the integral of a sinc function with a discrete step function and the optimal waveguide lengths are obtained by solving a set \u2026",

Systematic increase of the laser injection current, and the resulting increase in relaxation oscillation frequency, allowed the transition between the two regimes of operation to be observed. The system displayed a gradual transition from a dynamic dominated by regular pulse packages in the short-cavity regime to one dominated by broadband chaotic output when operating in the long-cavity regime. This suggests that the \u201cshort cavity\u201d regular pulse packages continue to co-exist with the \u201clong cavity\u201d broadband chaotic dynamic in the system studied.

In all cases, the receiver-which is directly connected to the transmitter-consists of a semiconductor laser similar to that of the transmitter subjected to the same optical feedback. The performance of this back to back configuration is numerically tested by calculating the  Q-factor of the eye diagram of the received data for different bit rates from 1 to 20 Gb/s.

In this paper, the encryption efficiency of the chaotic carrier, which is defined as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the encrypted message after filtering the combined signal of chaos and signal, is considered as the basic measure of the offered security. Hence, the lower the SNR of the filtered signal is, the higher the encryption efficiency of the system that is achieved.

The analysis is carried out by means of a rate equation model, which takes into account the various noise contributions and the injection of the master laser. The obtained results indicate that the locked slave laser may operate under reduced intensity noise levels compared with the free running operation. In addition, optimization of the locking process leads to further suppression of the intensity noise when the slave laser is biased close to the free-running threshold current. The main factors that significantly affect the locking process and the achievable noise levels are the injected optical power and the master-slave frequency detuning.",

            "Abstract": "Quantum cascade lasers are the most promising optical source for emission in the mid-infrared and THz region, and they are already used in a large number of applications such as free-space communications, absorption spectroscopy, sensing and so on. In all these applications, the noise properties of the optical sources are critical for the system performance. In this work, the authors present a theoretical study on the intensity noise characteristics of quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) under external non-coherent optical injection. The injection locking has been proven in the past beneficial for noise properties of bipolar lasers, and thus this technique is utilized here in quantum cascade lasers. With the help of various analytical and numerical models, it is shown that intensity noise reduction can be achieved in the operation of the so-called locked slave laser compared to its free-running values. The detailed analysis reveals the contribution of the various noise sources to the intensity noise of the laser and how they affect the injection locking process. Using different numerical models, two distinct schemes are investigated, analysed and discussed, injection on the lasing mode or on non-lasing residual modes of the slave laser cavity.",

A key feature in the proposed scheme, and contrary to the conventional approach, is application of the ON-OFF keying modulation on the pump wave. Measurement of the static transfer functions of the FWM process in a semiconductor optical amplifier shows that certain operating regimes exist, mainly related to the power levels \"one\" and \"zero\" of the modulated pump, where a significant improvement of the extinction ratio (ER) can be achieved. This conclusion has been confirmed by dynamic measurements at 2.4 Gb/s, where up to 3-dB improvement in the ER has been observed.",

The theoretical study takes into account the noise characteristics of the two pump waves that are considered to have parallel polarization states for gain maximization. It is shown that noisy pump waves degrade the amplifier's NF, especially when the amplifier is operating at high gain values and when the input signal is high. The theoretical observations are validated by Monte Carlo numerical simulations, and the agreement between them is excellent. Finally, a comparative study concerning the noise characteristics of dual-pump and single-pump FOPAs is performed.",

Measurements of the conversion efficiency and the signal to background noise ratio of the two replicas of the signal, for the cases of the signal polarisation being either parallel or orthogonal relative to the pump waves have been carried out. These measurements will reveal the polarisation sensitivity of this scheme which appears to be less than 1 dB when the wavelength spacing between the signal and its closest spaced pump is larger than 12 nm. The experimental results are supported in a satisfactory way by theoretical considerations. A simple theoretical expression describing the polarisation sensitivity have been derived and the theoretical results are in good agreement with those \u2026",

Wafer bonding allows the fabrication of ultra short couplers where the critical coupling gap can be epitaxially controlled. The microrings are operated above threshold and act as laser sources forming a coupled cavity system. Their respective radii are chosen to be slightly different, greatly extending the coupled cavity free spectral range (FSR) providing sufficiently high mode suppression ratio ( MSR > 30 dB). The isolation of adjacent rings allows an individual electrical control and enables a wavelength tuning with pm accuracy.

The analysis shows superior performance in terms of pulsewidth and peak power of devices based on the new geometry compared to devices based on the conventional geometry, where the saturable absorber is placed near the high reflectivity facet. The optimization relies on the enhanced bleaching of the saturable absorber when the latter is located near the output facet, which prevents the generation of colliding or self-colliding pulse effects.",
