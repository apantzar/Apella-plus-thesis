            "Abstract": "If speech analysis is to detect a speaker\u2019s emotional state, it needs to derive information from both linguistic information, i.e., the qualitative targets that the speaker has attained (or approximated), conforming to the rules of language; and paralinguistic information, i.e., allowed variations in the way that qualitative linguistic targets are realised. It also needs an appropriate representation of emotional states. The ERMIS project addresses the integration problem that those requirements pose. It mainly comprises a paralinguistic analysis and a robust speech recognition module. Descriptions of emotionality are derived from these modules following psychological and linguistic research that indicates the information likely to be available. We argue that progress in registering emotional states depends on establishing an overall framework of at least this level of complexity.",

            "Abstract": "There are multiple reasons to expect that detecting the word order errors in a text will be a difficult problem, and detection rates reported in the literature are in fact low. Although grammatical rules constructed by computer linguists improve the performance of grammar checker in word order diagnosis, the repairing task is still very difficult. This paper presents an approach for repairing word order errors in English text by reordering words in a sentence and choosing the version that maximizes the number of trigram hits according to a language model. The novelty of this method concerns the use of an efficient confusion matrix technique for reordering the words. The comparative advantage of this method is that works with a large set of words, and avoids the laborious and costly process of collecting word order errors for creating error patterns.",

The entities collaborating in IMUTUS are ILSP (coordinator), EXODUS, SYSTEMA, DSI, SMF, GRAME, and KTH. The IMUTUS effectiveness is enhanced via an advanced user interface incorporating multimedia techniques. Internet plays a pivotal role during training, the student receiving guidance over the net from a specially created teacher group. Interactiveness is emphasized via automatic\u2010scoring tools, which provide fast yet accurate feedback to the user, while virtual reality methods assist the student in perfecting his technique. IMUTUS incorporates specialized recognition technology for the transformation of acoustic signals and music scores to MIDI format and incorporation in the training process \u2026",

Based on the principles of adaptive modeling and fundamental frequency variations (jitter) as well as speech analysis by means of acoustic models, the proposed technique achieves an efficient classification of patients from uttered speech using a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm. A Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based iterative approach is used for the accurate estimation of the jitter and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are implemented to model the 32 phonemes. The final decision is derived by optimally combining the individual estimates to form vectors that are processed by an LDA based iterative algorithm providing better clustering of healthy and allergic subjects.",

            "Abstract": "This paper deals with the impact of a signal enhancement method on speech recognition confidence scores, in the presence of noise. The speech recognition confidence score reflects the reliability of correctness of the recogniser\u2019s output. This is important since errors in the presence of noise are more frequent and tend to make applications, such as spoken dialogue systems, too cumbersome to use. By recognising enhanced signals not only the word error rate decreases but also the word-based confidence scores decline. Therefore, the role of speech recognition in spoken dialogue systems weakens. The experimentation involves input signal corrupted by coloured noise and cocktail party noise with varying Signal-to-Noise Ratio. A non-linear spectral subtraction method (NSS) will be used in conjunction with the Continuous Speech Recognition system developed for the ERMIS project (IST-2000-29319) to quantify the impact of speech enhancement on confidence score accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "Emotional speech recognition rates reported in the literature are in fact low. Although knowledge in the area has been developing rapidly, it is still limited in fundamental ways. The first issue concerns that not much of the spectrum of emotionally coloured expressions has been studied. The second issue is that most research on speech and emotion has focused on recognising the emotion being expressed and not on the classic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) problem of recovering the verbal content of the speech. Read speech and non-read speech in a \u2018careful\u2019style can be recognized with accuracy higher than 95% using the state-of-the-art speech recognition technology. This paper investigates the recognition performance using spontaneous emotionally colored speech, produced by people holding conversations with Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL), a simulated \u2018chatbot\u2019system.",

            "Abstract": "Recognising the verbal content of emotional speech is a difficult problem, and recognition rates reported in the literature are in fact low. Although knowledge in the area has been developing rapidly, it is still limited in fundamental ways. The first issue concerns that not much of the spectrum of emotionally coloured expressions has been studied. The second issue is that most research on speech and emotion has focused on recognising the emotion being expressed and not on the classic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) problem of recovering the verbal content of the speech. Read speech and non-read speech in a `careful' style can be recognized with accuracy higher than 95% using the state-of-the-art speech recognition technology. Including information about prosody improves recognition rate for emotions simulated by actors, but its relevance to the freer patterns of spontaneous speech is unproven. This \u2026",

An SVD\u2013based technique (ISE) and a non-linear spectral subtraction method (NSS), have been evaluated by means of the Continuous Speech Recognition system that is used in the ERMIS project. The input signal is corrupted with coloured noise with variable signal-to-noise ratio. It was found that fine-tuning of the various parameters of the enhancement techniques is crucial for efficient optimisation of their performance. Both methods provide significant improvement of the speech recogniser performance in the presence of coloured noise, with the NSS method being slightly better.",

The novelty of this method concerns the use of an efficient confusion matrix technique for reordering the words. The confusion matrix technique has been designed in order to reduce the search space among permuted sentences. The limitation of search space is succeeded using the statistical inference of N-grams. The results of this technique are very interesting and prove that the number of permuted sentences can be reduced by 98, 16%.

            "Abstract": "This paper discusses the improvement of speech recognition time stamping accuracy in the presence of noise, when a parametric method of signal enhancement is used. The more accurate time stamp of each recognised word enhances the performance of multimodal systems. The recognised word\u2019s time stamp reflects how accurate the word\u2019s boundaries are, along the recognised utterance. This is important since errors in the presence of noise are more frequent and tend to make applications, such as spoken dialogue systems, too cumbersome to use. The input signal is corrupted with coloured noise with varying signal-to-noise ratio. As noise levels increase not only the WER rises but also the word\u2019s time stamp deteriorates. A non-linear spectral subtraction method (NSS) will be used in conjunction with the Continuous Speech Recognition system of the ERMIS project to quantify the impact of speech \u2026",

The new method, called CSE (companion matrix based spectral estimation), is compared against a previously proposed method called HTLS which is based on the use of total least squares. The latter lies among the most promising methods in the field of spectroscopy where accuracy of parameter estimation is of utmost importance. Experiments performed on a simulated NMR signal prove CSE to be more robust in terms of failure rate, especially for low signal to noise ratio.",

By recognising noisy signals not only the word error rate (WER) increases but also the word-based confidence scores decline. Therefore, the role of speech recognition in multimodal systems weakens.

This paper describes a method to repair any sentence with wrong word order using a statistical language model (LM). A good indicator of whether a person really knows a language is the ability to use the appropriate words in a sentence in correct word order. The \"scrambled\" words in a sentence produce a meaningless sentence. Most languages have a fairly fixed word order.

Specifically, the scheme is based on decimative spectral estimation that uses Eigenanalysis and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). The underlying model assumes a decomposition of the processed signal into complex damped sinusoids. In the case of formant tracking, the algorithm is applied on a small amount of the autocorrelation coefficients of a speech frame. The proposed scheme is evaluated on both artificial and real speech utterances from the TIMIT database. For the first case, comparative results to standard methods are provided which indicate that the proposed methodology successfully estimates formant trajectories.",

Consequently it requires no overhead for customisation and/or installation and maintenance. More precisely, the system does not use any lexicon or database that will become outdated and need updating. Furthermore, it can cope with all kinds of words and terminology regardless of their frequency of use. The system has a very user-friendly interface with a comprehensive menu even for non-professionals. It can process all of the following formats: wav, wmv, wma, mp3, mpg, asf and avi.",

The emotional speech recognition confidence score reflects the reliability of correctness of the recogniser\u2019s output. This is important since errors in the presence of noise are more frequent and tend to make applications, such as spoken dialogue systems, too cumbersome to use. By recognising impaired signals not only the word error rate decreases but also the word-based confidence scores decline. Therefore, the role of speech recognition in spoken dialogue systems weakens. The experimentation involves input signal corrupted by coloured noise and cocktail party noise with varying Signal-to-Noise Ratio. A non-linear spectral subtraction method (NSS) will be used in conjunction with the Continuous Speech Recognition system developed for the ERMIS project (IST \u2026",

The method is based on Eigenanalysis and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and performs artificial decimation for increased accuracy while it exploits the full set of data samples. The underlying model decomposes a signal into complex damped sinusoids whose frequencies, amplitudes, phases and damping factors are estimated. Correct estimation of Formant/Bandwidth values depend on the model order, thus the requested number of poles. Additionally, some selection criteria are applied regarding finer tracking and estimation of speech formants and their relevant bandwidths.",

The signal is split into a low frequency image and its high frequency complement. The first is compressed conventionally or by using adaptive sinusoidal models. The high frequency component is treated via a non-linear transformation that leads to a binary image and its complement that can be brought to lower resolution via filtering. The process is iterative and the number of iterations depends on the size of the image and the desired compression rate.",

In spite of the remarkable recent progress in Large Vocabulary Recognition (LVR), it is still far behind the ultimate goal of recognising free conversational speech uttered by any speaker in any environment. Current experimental tests prove that using state of the art large vocabulary recognition systems the error rate increases substantially when applied to spontaneous/emotional speech. This paper shows that recognition rate for emotionally coloured speech can be improved by using a language model based on increased representation of emotional utterances.",

The new method, called DESE D, makes use of the full set of data and brings further apart the poles under consideration, while it imposes almost no constraints to the dimensions of the Hankel matrix, as decimation increases. It is compared against two previously proposed techniques for spectral estimation (along with derived decimative versions), that lie among the most promising methods in the field of spectroscopy, where accuracy of parameter estimation is of utmost importance. Moreover, it is compared against a state-of-the-art purely decimative method proposed in literature.

A good indicator of whether a person really knows a language is the ability to use the appropriate words in a sentence in correct word order. The \u201cscrambled\u201d words in a sentence produce a meaningless sentence. Most languages have a fairly fixed word order.

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes a new low rate speech coding algorithm, based on a subband approach. At first, a frame of the incoming signal is fed to a low pass filter, thus yielding the low frequency (LF) part. By subtracting the latter from the incoming signal the high frequency (HF), non-smoothed part is obtained. The HF part is modeled using waveform vector quantisation (VQ), while the LF part is modeled using a spectral estimation method based on a Hankel matrix, its shift invariant property and SVD, called CSE. At the receiver side an adaptive postfiltering based on SVD is performed for the HF part, a simple resynthesis for the LF part, before the two components are added in order to produce the reconstructed signal. Progressive speech compression (variable degree of analysis/synthesis at transmitter/receiver) is thus possible resulting in a variable bit rate scheme. The new method is compared to the CELP algorithm at 4800 bps and is proven of similar quality, in terms of intelligibility and segmental SNR. Moreover, perceptual evaluation tests of the new method were conducted for different bit rates up to 1200 bps and the majority of the evaluators indicated that the technique provides intelligible reconstruction.",
