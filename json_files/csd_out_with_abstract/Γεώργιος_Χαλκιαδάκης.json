            "Abstract": "Research in cooperative games often assumes that agents know the coalitional values with certainty, and that they can belong to one coalition only. By contrast, this work assumes that the value of a coalition is based on an underlying collaboration structure emerging due to existing but unknown relations among the agents; and that agents can form overlapping coalitions. Specifically, we first propose Relational Rules, a novel representation scheme for cooperative games with overlapping coalitions, which encodes the aforementioned relations, and which extends the well-known MC-nets representation to this setting. We then present a novel decision-making method for decentralized overlapping coalition formation, which exploits probabilistic topic modeling, and in particular, online Latent Dirichlet Allocation. By interpreting formed coalitions as documents, agents can effectively learn topics that correspond to profitable collaboration structures.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, we develop a generic agent-based model (ABM) for simulating ancient societies. Agents in our model are completely autonomous, in contrast to most existing ABMs used in archaeology. We employ this model to evaluate the impact of different social organization paradigms and agricultural strategies on population viability and evolving spatial distribution of settlement locations, at a particular region of the island of Crete during the Early Bronze Age (early Minoan civilization). Model parameter choices are based on archaeological studies, but are not biased towards any specific assumption. Interestingly, one of the social models examined is inspired by a recent framework for self-organizing agent organizations. Results over a number of different simulation scenarios demonstrate an impressive sustainability for settlements adopting a socio-economic organization model based on self-organization; while the emerging \u201cstratified\u201d populations are larger than their egalitarian counterparts. This provides support for archaeological theories proposing the existence of different social strata in Early Bronze Age Crete, considering them a pre-requisite for the emergence of the complex social structure evident in later periods. Moreover, observed population dispersion agrees with existing archaeological evidence.",

To this end, agents participate in repeated games by means of which they exchange utility (corresponding to resources) with others. The results of the games contribute to both the continuous re-organization of the social structure, and the progressive adoption of the most successful agent strategies.

In such games, each agent has a weight (intuitively corresponding to resources he can contribute), and a coalition of agents wins if its total weight meets or exceeds a given threshold. Even though coalitional stability in such games is important, existing research has nonetheless only considered the stability of the grand coalition. In this paper, we introduce a model for weighted voting games with coalition structures. This is a natural extension in the context of multiagent systems, as several groups of agents may be simultaneously at work, each serving a different task. We then proceed to study stability in this context. First, we define the CS-core, a notion of the core for such settings, discuss its non-emptiness, and relate it to the traditional notion of the core in weighted voting games. We then investigate its computational properties. We show that, in contrast with the traditional setting, it is computationally hard to decide whether a game has a non-empty CS-core, or whether a given outcome is in the CS-core. However, we then provide an efficient algorithm that verifies whether an outcome is in the CS-core if all weights are small (polynomially bounded). Finally, we also suggest heuristic algorithms for checking the non-emptiness of the CS-core.",

Then, under some quite general conditions, we characterize the elements of the core, and show that any element of the core maximizes the social welfare. We also introduce a concept of balancedness for overlapping coalitional games, and use it to characterize coalition structures that can be extended to elements of the core. Finally, we generalize the notion of convexity to our setting, and show that under some natural assumptions convex games have a non-empty core. Moreover, we introduce two alternative notions of stability in OCF that allow a wider range of deviations, and explore the relationships among the corresponding definitions of the core, as well as the classic (non-overlapping) core and the Aubin core. We illustrate the general properties of the three cores, and also study them from a computational perspective, thus obtaining additional insights into their fundamental structure.",

REScoops do not only collectively own renewable energy production facilities and supply this to their members, they also use their specific position as energy suppliers to take several actions to persuade their members to save energy. Although the activities that REScoops undertake to some extent resemble those of other organizations, because of their particular organisational and business model as citizens initiatives, the cooperative model, REScoops are supposed to be very well positioned for activities to influence and help their members to save energy. The paper discusses arguments why the REScoop model in energy supply can be an important contributor to reduce energy use by their members. Further this paper discusses measures that have been undertaken by REScoops studied in the REScoop Plus project. We use some illustrative examples to discuss if REScoops are in a relatively good position to take certain measures and succeed in persuading customers to lower their energy consumption level and elaborate on future experiments to explore the proposition that REScoop members save more energy due to actions of these REScoops towards their members.",

            "Abstract": "Optimizing the heating ventilation and air condition (HVAC) control process generally considers a trade-off between thermal discomfort and energy cost. Technically, this can be represented as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the occupants\u2019 thermal preferences and the cost of energy consumed are two conflicting objectives. When the occupancy schedule is known in advance this problem typically reduces to minimizing the energy cost while meeting the thermal comfort constraint set by a user, typically defined as a setpoint-temperature-based comfort band. However, this approach is inadequate in dynamic occupancy settings where the optimization process is driven by occupancy estimates that are inherently uncertain. In particular, ensuring that the room temperature lays within a typically narrow comfort band, even when there is small probability of occupancy, significantly increases HVAC energy usage. In this case, accepting some probability of discomfort, is essential to reduce energy cost. We investigate three optimization HVAC control algorithms that deal with dynamic occupancy and we provide a comparative analysis to show the advantages and disadvantages of each approach with respect to their efficiency, effectiveness, applicability and usability in different settings.",

Considering agriculture as the main production activity sustaining the human population, we evaluate the volcanic eruption impact on different social organization models, focusing on the wider area of Malia in the island of Crete. The social organization paradigms examined are inspired by a framework for self-organizing agent organizations, and ideas from evolutionary game theory. Model parameter choices are based on archaeological theories and finds, but are not biased towards any specific assumption. Results over a number of different simulation scenarios demonstrate an impressive sustainability of household agents. However, in some scenarios we observe noticeable changes in the settlements' distribution, relating to significantly higher migration rates immediately after the eruption. Moreover, the eruption appears to have had a strong impact on social behaviour, transforming the initially cooperative agents' behaviour to a noncooperative one. This provides support for archaeological theories suggesting that the Theran eruption led to a gradual (and not immediate) breakdown of the Minoan socio-economic system, partly due to inner community competition and conflicts.",

            "Abstract": "We put forward an innovative use of probabilistic topic modeling (PTM) intertwined with reinforcement learning (RL), to provide personalized recommendations. Specifically, we model items under recommendation as mixtures of latent topics following a distribution with Dirichlet priors; this can be achieved via the exploitation of crowdsourced information for each item. Similarly, we model the user herself as an \u201cevolving\u201d document represented by its respective mixture of latent topics. The user\u2019s topic distribution is appropriately updated each time she consumes an item. Recommendations are subsequently based on the divergence between the topic distributions of the user and available items. However, to tackle the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, we apply RL to vary the user\u2019s topic distribution update rate. Our method is immune to the notorious \u201ccold start\u201d problem, and it can effectively cope with \u2026",

In our model, the analyzer performs an action on the system to trigger the malware into showing a malicious behavior, ie, by activating its payload. The formalization is built upon the link between malware families and the notion of types in Bayesian games. A key point is the design of the utility function, which reflects the amount of uncertainty on the type of the adversary after the execution of an analyzer action. This allows us to devise an algorithm to play the game with the aim of minimizing the entropy of the analyzer\u2019s belief at every stage of the game in a myopic fashion. Empirical evaluation indicates that our approach results in a significant improvement both in terms of learning speed and classification score when compared to other state-of-the-art AMA techniques.",

The scheme can employ the services of either individual or cooperating consumer agents alike. Agents participating in the scheme, however, are motivated to form cooperatives, in order to reduce their electricity bills via lower group prices granted for sizable consumption shifting from high to low demand time intervals. The scheme takes into account individual costs, and uses a strictly proper scoring rule to reward contributors according to efficiency. Cooperative members, in particular, can attain variable reduced electricity price rates, given their different load shifting capabilities. This allows even agents with initially forbidding shifting costs to participate in the scheme, and is achieved by a weakly budget-balanced, truthful reward sharing mechanism. We provide four variants of this approach, and evaluate it experimentally.",

Reinforcement Learning (RL)[KLM96, SB98], from a computer science point of view, is the problem that an agent faces when trying to learn to act by trial and error through interactions with a dynamic environment. This is different from supervised learning, which is learning from examples provided by an external supervisor; it also contrasts with classical planning, in that agents do not know a priori how their actions will affect the world. An RL agent is a goal-seeking agent that can sense aspects of its environment and can choose actions to influence this environment, so as to maximize a numerical reward signal.

Considering farming as the main activity for sustaining the early Minoan civilization, we evaluate the impact of different social organization models and agricultural strategies on population viability and spatial distribution of settlement locations over a 2000 year period. Interestingly, one of the social models examined promotes the targeted redistribution of wealth, and is inspired by a recent framework for self-organizing agent organizations. Model parameters are based on archaeological studies, but are not biased towards any specific assumption. Results over a number of different simulation scenarios demonstrate an impressive sustainability for settlements adopting a socio-economic organization model based on self-organization; while the emerging \u201cstratified\u201d populations are larger than their egalitarian counterparts. This provides support for theories proposing the existence of different social strata in early Bronze Age Crete, considering them a pre-requisite for the emergence of the complex social structure evident in later periods. Moreover, observed population dispersion agrees with existing archaeological evidence.",

We model the game of football as a multi-stage game which is made up from a Bayesian game to model the pre-match decisions and a stochastic game to model the in-match state transitions and decisions. Using this formulation, we propose a method to predict the probability of game outcomes and the payoffs of team actions. Building upon this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with different objectives. Empirical evaluation of our approach on real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics from our Bayesian and stochastic games, we can increase a team chances of winning by up to 16.1\\% and 3.4\\% respectively.",

According to the Federation of REScoops in Europe (REScoop. eu), there are currently more than 2,397 REScoops, collectively having more than 650,000 members. As such, their emergence highlights the importance of producing and consuming green energy, and simultaneously puts forward principles such as energy democracy and self-consumption, assists the fight against energy poverty, and reduces Greenhouse Gas emissions. A core objective of the H2020 REScoop Plus project is to promote a better understanding and cultivate the behavioural change of the cooperatives\u2019 engagement. In order for this goal to be met, it was essential to conduct a careful logging of and statistical analysis over the energy data stored by the REScoops, as well as the current state of their engagement in energy efficiency. Such tasks are imperative in order to support the claim that REScoop engagement promotes energy sobriety; and associate consumption reduction with specific behaviours, ICT tools, and Energy Efficiency practices. In this paper, we present the logging and statistical analysis conducted in REScoop Plus, and their results. Specifically, we outline the methodology used for formulating a comprehensive format for collecting the datasets for statistical analysis, a process that involved a lengthy and fruitful interaction with REScoops and their data experts; the extracted requirements for that common format; and the detailed guidelines communicated to the REScoops in order to enable data acquisition and \u2026",

However, research to date in both AI and economics has largely ignored the potential presence of uncertainty when studying either coalitional stability or coalitional bargaining. This paper is the first to relate a (cooperative) stability concept under uncertainty, the Bayesian core (BC), with (non-cooperative) equilibrium concepts of coalitional bargaining games. We prove that if the BC of a coalitional game (and of each subgame) is non-empty, then there exists an equilibrium of the corresponding bargaining game that produces a BC element; and conversely, if there exists a coalitional bargaining equilibrium (with \u2026",

To quantify this loss, we introduce the notion of the Price of Democracy (PoD), which measures the amount of resources needlessly committed to the task(s) at hand. After defining this concept for general coalitional games, we instantiate it in the setting of weighted voting games, a simple but expressive class of coalitional games that can be used to model resource allocation in multiagent scenarios. We approach the problem of forming winning coalitions in this setting from a non-cooperative perspective, and put forward an intuitive deterministic bargaining process, which exhibits no delay of agreement (i.e., the agents are guaranteed to form a winning coalition in round one) and allows for efficient computation of bargaining strategies. We show a tight bound of 3/2 on the PoD of our process if two rounds of bargaining are allowed, and demonstrate that this bound cannot improve with more rounds. We then generalize our bargaining process to settings where multiple coalitions are allowed to be formed, show that this generalization also exhibits no delay of agreement, and discuss the PoD in such settings.",

Individuals, represented by rational agents, form cooperatives to offer demand shifting from peak to non-peak intervals, incentivized by the provision of a better electricity price for the consumption of the shifted peak load, similar to economy of scale schemes. We equip the cooperatives with a novel, directly applicable, and effective consumption shifting scheme, that allows for the proactive balancing of electricity supply and demand. Our scheme employs several algorithms to promote the formation of the most effective shifting coalitions. It takes into account the shifting costs of the individuals, and rewards them according to their shifting efficiency. In addition, it employs internal pricing methods that guarantee individual rationality, and allow \u2026",

Our approach models the evolution of social behaviours in a population of strategically interacting agents corresponding to households in the early Minoan era. To this end, agents participate in repeated games by means of which they exchange utility (corresponding to resources) with others. The results of the games contribute to both the continuous re-organization of the social structure, and the progressive adoption of the most successful agent strategies. Agent population is not fixed, but fluctuates over time. The particularity of the domain necessitates that agents in our games receive non-static payoffs, in contrast to most games studied in the literature; and that the evolutionary dynamics are formulated via assessing the perceived fitness of the agents, defined in terms of how successful they are in accumulating utility. We present a systematic evaluation of the performance of the various strategies, assuming several variations in the way agent fitness and agent organization fitness are defined, as well as in the way agents adopt new strategies. Overall, our results show that societies of strategic agents that self-organize via adopting the aforementioned evolutionary approach, demonstrate a sustainability that largely matches that of self-organizing societies of more cooperative agents; and that strategic cooperation is in fact, in many instances, an emergent behaviour in this domain.

We then interpret these ratings in an innovative way, using them to guide a Bayesian updating process that helps us both capture a user's current mood, and maintain her overall user type.

            "Abstract": "Solving complex but structured problems in a decentralized manner via multiagent collaboration has received much attention in recent years. This is natural, as on one hand, multiagent systems usually possess a structure that determines the allowable interactions among the agents; and on the other hand, the single most pressing need in a cooperative multiagent system is to coordinate the local policies of autonomous agents with restricted capabilities to serve a system-wide goal. The presence of uncertainty makes this even more challenging, as the agents face the additional need to learn the unknown environment parameters while forming (and following) local policies in an online fashion. In this paper, we provide the first Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) approach for distributed coordination and learning in a cooperative multiagent system by devising two solutions to this type of problem. More specifically, we show how the Value of Perfect Information (VPI) can be used to perform efficient decentralised exploration in both model-based and model-free BRL, and in the latter case, provide a closed form solution for VPI, correcting a decade old result by Dearden, Friedman and Russell. To evaluate these solutions, we present experimental results comparing their relative merits, and demonstrate empirically that both solutions outperform an existing multiagent learning method, representative of the state-of-the-art.",

Moreover, our methods are shown to scale to dozens of thousands of agents within fractions of a second; with one of them scaling to even millions of agents within seconds. We apply our approach to the problem of forming coalitions to provide (electric) vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. Ours is the first approach able to deal with large-scale, realtime coalition formation for the V2G problem, while taking multiple criteria into account for creating electric vehicle coalitions.",

            "Abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of collaborative multi-agent autonomous driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in lane-free highway scenarios. We eliminate the lane-changing task, ie, CAVs may be located in any arbitrary lateral position within the road boundaries, hence allowing for better utilization of the available road capacity. As a consequence, vehicles operate in a much more complex environment, and the need for the individual CAVs to select actions that are efficient for the group as a whole is highly desired. We formulate this environment as a multiagent collaboration problem represented via a coordination graph, thus decomposing the problem with local utility functions, based on the interactions between vehicles. We produce a tractable and scalable solution by estimating the joint action of all vehicles via the anytime max-plus algorithm, with local utility functions provided by potential fields, designed to promote collision avoidance. Specifically, the fields have an ellipsoid form that is most suitable for lane-free highway environments. This novel use of max-plus with potential fields gives rise to a coordinated control policy that exploits only local information specific to each CAV. Our experimental evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our approach: lane-free movement allows for increased traffic flow rates, and vehicles are able to achieve speeds that are both high and close to their desired ones, even in demanding environments with high traffic flow.",

Agents have no knowledge of the amount of resources others possess; and hold private Bayesian beliefs regarding the potential resource investment of every other agent. Our methods allow agents to demand that certain confidence levels are reached, regarding the resource contributions of the various coalitions. In order to tackle real-world scenarios, we allow agents to form overlapping coalitions, so that one can simultaneously be part of a number of coalitions. We thus present a protocol for iterated overlapping coalition formation (OCF), through which agents can complete tasks that grant them utility. Agents lie on a social network and their distance affects their likelihood of cooperation towards the completion of a task. We confirm our methods\u2019 effectiveness by testing them on both a random graph of 300 nodes and a real-world social network of 4039 nodes.",

Specifically, we introduce a notion of the core for CGBs, both with and without coalition structures. For simple games without coalition structures, we then provide a characterization of the core that matches the one for the full information case, and use it to derive a polynomial-time algorithm to check core nonemptiness. In contrast, we demonstrate that in games with coalition structures allowing beliefs increases the computational complexity of stability-related problems. In doing so, we introduce and analyze weighted voting games with beliefs, which may be of independent interest.

Then we exploit three well-known supervised learning models, linear regression, linear regression with basis function, and feed forward neural networks, in order to (approximately) extract the unknown hedonic preference relations over partitions. We conduct a systematic evaluation to compare the performance of these models on PFF-HGs; and, in the process, we develop an evaluation metric specifically designed for our problem. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our work.",

In this thesis, we provide an algorithmic framework, along with an interactive web-based tool, to enable short-tomiddle term forecasts of Photovoltaic Systems (PVS) and Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) power output. Importantly, we propose a generic PVS power output estimation method, the backbone of which is a non-linear solar irradiance approximation model that incorporates free-to-use, readily available weather forecasting reports coming from online providers. We present a thorough evaluation of different approaches of the respective model, as well as aa thorough evaluation of our PVS power output estimation method. We show that our PVS power output estimation method can be successfully employed within a broad geographical region (the Mediterranean belt) and come with specific performance guarantees. Crucially, our methods do not rely on complex and expensive weather models and data, and our web-based tool can be of immediate use to the scientific community and society at large. iii",

Automating the negotiations underlying coalition formation is, naturally, of special concern. However, research to date in both AI and economics has largely ignored the potential presence of uncertainty in coalitional bargaining. We present a model of discounted coalitional bargaining where agents are uncertain about the types (or capabilities) of potential partners, and hence the value of a coalition. We cast the problem as a Bayesian game in extensive form, and describe its Perfect Bayesian Equilibria as the solutions to a polynomial program. We then present a heuristic algorithm using iterative coalition formation to approximate the optimal solution, and evaluate its performance.",

We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo and deep learning-based algorithms that make use of the fluent objectives in order to learn from prior games and other games in the environment and increase the teams' long-term performance. Simulations of our approach using real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics with our fluent objective and prior games, we can on average increase teams mean expected finishing distribution in the league by up to 35.6%.",

We present novel, non-myopic learning algorithms to approximate the optimal Bayesian solution, providing tractable means to ensure good sequential performance.

In this work we put forward a novel agent-based trading model, for simulating the exchange and distribution of resources across settlements in past societies.

In this work, we contribute to the development of VPPs by offering a game-theoretic perspective to the problem. Specifically, we design cooperatives (or \u201ccooperative VPPs\u201d\u2014CVPPs) of rational autonomous DER-agents representing small-to-medium size renewable electricity producers, which coalesce to profitably sell their energy to the electricity grid. By so doing, we help to counter the fact that individual DERs are often excluded from the wholesale energy market due to their perceived inefficiency and unreliability. We discuss the issues surrounding the emergence of such cooperatives, and propose a pricing mechanism with certain desirable properties. Specifically, our mechanism guarantees that CVPPs have the incentive to truthfully report to the grid accurate estimates of their electricity production, and that larger rather than smaller CVPPs form; this promotes CVPP efficiency and reliability. In addition, we propose a scheme to allocate payments within the cooperative, and show that, given this scheme and the pricing mechanism, the allocation is in the core and, as such, no subset of members has a financial incentive to break away from the CVPP. Moreover, we develop an analytical tool for quantifying the uncertainty about DER production estimates, and distinguishing among different types of errors regarding such estimates. We then utilize this tool to devise protocols to manage CVPP membership. Finally \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a policy iteration method (along with specialized variants), which is able to calculate near-optimal trajectories for effective and efficient day-ahead solar tracking, based on weather forecasts coming from on-line providers. To account for the energy needs of the tracking system, the technique employs a novel and generic consumption model.

We show that individual optimization with respect to electricity prices does not always lead to minimized costs, thus necessitating a cooperative approach. A prosumer cooperative employs an internal cryptocurrency mechanism for coordinating members decisions and distributing the collectively generated profits. The mechanism generates cryptocoins in a distributed fashion, and awards them to participants according to various criteria, such as contribution impact and accuracy between stated and final shifting actions. In particular, when a scoring rulesbased distribution method is employed, participants are incentivized to be accurate. When tested on a large dataset with real-world production and consumption data, our approach is shown to provide incentives for accurate statements and increased economic profits for the cooperative.",

            "Abstract": "In many real-world settings, the structure of the environment constrains the formation of coalitions among agents. Therefore, examining the stability of formed coalition structures in such settings is of natural interest. We address this by considering corestability within various models of cooperative games with structure. First, we focus on characteristic function games defined on graphs that determine feasible coalitions. In particular, a coalition S can emerge only if S is a connected set in the graph. We study the (now modified) core, in which it suffices to check only feasible deviations. Specifically, we investigate core non-emptiness as well as the complexity of computing stable configurations. We then move on to the more general class of (graph-restricted) partition function games, where the value of a coalition depends on which other coalitions are present, and provide the first stability results in this domain. Finally, we propose a \u201cBayesian\u201d extension of partition function games, in which information regarding the success of a deviation is provided in the form of a probability distribution describing the possible reactions of non-deviating agents, and provide the first core-stability results in this model also.",

            "Abstract": "Online planning methods for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have recently gained much interest. In this paper, we propose the introduction of prior knowledge in the form of (probabilistic) relationships among discrete state-variables, for online planning based on the well-known POMCP algorithm. In particular, we propose the use of hard constraint networks and probabilistic Markov random fields to formalize state-variable constraints and we extend the POMCP algorithm to take advantage of these constraints. Results on a case study based on Rocksample show that the usage of this knowledge provides significant improvements to the performance of the algorithm. The extent of this improvement depends on the amount of knowledge encoded in the constraints and reaches the 50% of the average discounted return in the most favorable cases that we analyzed.",

            "Abstract": "Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are fast emerging as a suitable means of integrating small and distributed energy resources (DERs), like wind and solar, into the electricity supply network (Grid). VPPs are formed via the aggregation of a large number of such DERs, so that they exhibit the characteristics of a traditional generator in terms of predictability and robustness. In this work, we promote the formation of such\" cooperative''VPPs (CVPPs) using multi-agent technology. In particular, we design a payment mechanism that encourages DERs to join CVPPs with large overall production. Our method is based on strictly proper scoring rules and incentivises the provision of accurate predictions from the CVPPs---and in turn, the member DERs---which aids in the planning of the supply schedule at the Grid. We empirically evaluate our approach using the real-world setting of 16 commercial wind farms in the UK. We show that our mechanism incentivises real DERs to form CVPPs, and outperforms the current state of the art payment mechanism developed for this problem.",

Agents, representing flights, have limited information about others' payoffs and preferences, and need to coordinate to achieve their tasks while adhering to operational constraints. We formalize the problem as a multiagent Markov decision process (MDP) towards deciding flight delays to resolve demand and capacity balance (DCB) problems in ATM. To this end, we present multiagent reinforcement learning methods that allow agents to interact and form own policies in coordination with others. Experimental study on real-world cases, confirms the effectiveness of our approach in resolving the demand-capacity balance problem.",

Further, agents have to constantly struggle to find the right balance between exploiting current information regarding the environment and the rest of its inhabitants, and exploring so that they acquire additional information. Moreover, they need to profitably trade off short-term rewards with anticipated long-term ones, while learning through interaction about the environment and others\u2014employing techniques from reinforcement learning (RL), a fundamental area of study within artificial intelligence (AI).Coalition formation is a problem of great interest within game theory and AI, allowing autonomous individually rational agents to form stable or transient teams (or coalitions) to tackle an underlying task. Agents participating in realistic scenarios of repeated coalition formation under uncertainty face the issues identified above, and need to bargain to succesfully negotiate the terms of their participation in coalitions\u2014often having to compromise individual with team welfare effectively.",

            "Abstract": "The PowerTAC competition provides a multi-agent simulation platform for electricity markets, in which intelligent agents acting as electricity brokers compete with each other aiming to maximize their profits. Typically, the gains of agents increase as the number of their customers rises, but in parallel, costs also increase as a result of higher transmission fees that need to be paid by the electricity broker. Thus, agents that aim to take over a disproportionately high share of the market, often end up with losses due to being obliged to pay huge transmission capacity fees. In this paper, we present a novel trading strategy that, based on this observation, aims to balance gains against costs; and was utilized by the champion of the PowerTAC-2020 tournament, TUC-TAC. The approach also incorporates a wholesale market strategy that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to determine TUC-TAC\u2019s best course of action when participating in the market\u2019s double auctions. The strategy is improved by making effective use of a forecasting module that seeks to predict upcoming peaks in demand, since in such intervals incurred costs significantly increase. A post-tournament analysis is also included in this paper, to help draw important lessons regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the various strategies used in the PowerTAC-2020 competition.",

            "Abstract": "In multiagent systems, it is often the case that agents need to form teams in order to achieve their goals. This may happen even if the agents are controlled by different parties: while in this case the agents do not necessarily share the same set of goals and priorities, they still need to cooperate, as individual agents may not possess sufficient resources to perform their tasks independently. In such scenarios, a natural tool for modeling agent collaboration is coalitional game theory [Branzei et al. 2008], a research area that studies collaboration and team formation among rational entities.The two main questions studied by coalitional game theory are:(1) What teams, or coalitions, of agents are likely to arise? and (2) How are the agents going to share the benefits of cooperation? To answer these questions, it is usually assumed that the game ends with the agents forming the grand coalition, ie, the coalition that includes \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Learning through interaction is a fundamental idea underlying many theories of learning and intelligence. Reinforcement Learning (RL)[26, 49], from a computer science point of view, is the problem that an agent faces when trying to learn behavior by trial and error through interactions with a dynamic environment. This is different from supervised learning, which is learning from examples provided by a knowledgable external supervisor. A reinforcement learning agent is a goal-seeking agent that can sense aspects of its environment and can choose actions to influence this environment, so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. Reinforcement learning is a highly active research area, and is strongly interconnected not only with research in machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks, but neuroscience, psychology, and statistics, as well. The reinforcement learning problem becomes even more interesting when studied in the context of multiple reinforcement learning agents co-existing in the same environment. This situation constitutes the Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. The presence of multiple reinforcement learning agents creates new opportunities for them to seize or obstacles to overcome so that they enhance their learning capabilities; it also raises important questions1 regarding the value of employing\" social behaviors\" like co-operation and co-ordination. Other particularly interesting issues arise given that learning in a multiagent world of this kind can be viewed as learning in a game with multiple players.The objective of this paper is to present a review of research done in this area, focusing \u2026",

ABM\u2019s emerging popularity is due to its ability to model individuals and societies, readily incorporate any geospatial data available, and encompass uncertainty inherent in archaeological theories or findings. Indeed, the unpredictability of interaction patterns within a simulated agent society, along with the strong possibility of emergent behavior, can help researchers gain new insights into existing theories; or even come up with completely novel explanations and paradigms regarding the ancient societies being studied. Agent-based modeling is thus a potentially powerful tool, which can be used to assess the plausibility of alternative hypotheses regarding ancient civilizations, their social organization, and social and environmental processes which might have existed. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview on ABM and corresponding methodologies, and present examples of recent work that has applied geospatial agent-based models in archaeology.",

The goal of this work is to initiate a systematic investigation of algorithmic aspects of OCF games. We propose a discretized model of overlapping coalition formation, where each agent i\u2208 N has a weight wi\u2208 N and may allocate an integer amount of weight to any task. Within this framework, we focus on the computation of outcomes that are socially optimal and/or stable. We discover that the algorithmic complexity of the associated problems crucially depends on the amount of resources that each agent possesses, the maximum coalition size, and the pattern of interaction among the agents. We identify several constraints that lead to tractable subclasses of OCF games, and provide efficient algorithms for games that belong to these subclasses. We supplement our tractability results by hardness proofs, which clarify the role of our constraints.",
