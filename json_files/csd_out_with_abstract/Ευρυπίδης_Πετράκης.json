            "Abstract": "Both medical professionals and laypersons have an interest in current medical information now largely available in electronic form, including electronic newspapers. Many health organizations, including hospitals, universities and government departments, are now providing validated medical information for use. Overall, there has been a growing mass of medical information and news and related data that users of all levels of sophistication can access. One of the most commonly used medical databases is MedLine MedLine 1 (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), which constitutes the primary medical repository of the US National Library of Medicine (NLM), including (as of today) approximately 20 million computer-readable records, rapidly expanding. It is a rich resource of medical, biological and biomedical information, requiring efficient management and retrieval, therefore it poses new challenges to information and knowledge management.Typically, medical information systems such as MedLine are designed to serve health care professional users (expert users in general such as clinical doctors, medical researchers). Generally, expert users are familiar with the type and content of the medical resources (such as the NLM dictionaries and databases) they are using and use medical terminology for their searches. However, the spread and availability of medical information on the Web have made this information available to consumer (ie naive) users as well. Unlike expert users, consumers are usually unfamiliar with the content and type of specialized medical resources, and typically use the Web for their searches using \u2026",

Before 2001, the series was devoted solely to spatial database management, and called SSD. From 2001, the scope was extended in order to also accommodate temporal database management, in part due to the increasing importance of research that considers spatial and temporal aspects jointly. SSTD 2009 introduced several innovative aspects compared to previous events. There was a demonstrations track which included ten presentations of systems related to the topics of interest.

            "Abstract": "Semantic Similarity relates to computing the similarity between concepts, having the same meaning or related information, which are not lexicographically similar. This is an important problem in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval Research and has received considerable attention in the literature. Several algorithmic approaches for computing semantic similarity have been proposed. We investigate approaches for computing semantic similarity by mapping terms or concepts to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that ontology. Comparing concepts that belong to different ontologies is far more difficult problem. Some of the most popular semantic similarity approaches are implemented and evaluated based on WordNet 1 as the underlying reference ontology. We also propose a method for comparing terms in different ontologies. In this work we examined similarity between terms basically from MeSH 2 (medical) and WordNet ontologies. Building upon the idea of semantic similarity we also propose an information retrieval methodology capable of detecting similarities between documents containing semantically similar but not necessarily identical terms. Our proposed Information Retrieval model has been evaluated for retrieval of documents in Medline 3 database. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed model (although slower) achieves significant performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art approach based on the Vector Space Model.",

Since the first edition in 1995, the NLDB conference has been aiming at bringing together resear-ers, people working in industry and potential users interested in various applications of natural language in the database and information system area. However, in order to reflect the growing importance of accessing information from a diverse collection of sources (Web, Databases, Sensors, Cloud) in an equally wide range of contexts (-cluding mobile and tethered), the theme of the 15th International Conference on-plications of Natural Language to Information Systems 2010 was\" Communicating with Anything, Anywhere in Natural Language.\" Natural languages and databases are core components in the development of inf-mation systems. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques may substantially enhance most phases of the information system lifecycle, starting with requirement analysis, specification and validation, and going up to conflict resolution, result pr-essing and presentation. Furthermore, natural language-based query languages and user interfaces facilitate the access to information for all and allow for new paradigms in the usage of computerized services. Hot topics such as information retrieval (IR), software engineering applications, hidden Markov models, natural language interfaces and semantic networks and graphs imply a complete fusion of databases, IR and NLP techniques.",

The most powerful approaches of spatial image content representation and matching are attributed relational graphs (ARGs) and symbolic projections (e.g. two-dimensional 2D strings). A framework is proposed for studying the performance of spatial similarity approaches in image databases (IDBs). The classical ARG and 2D string matching methods are evaluated. Several variants of ARG and 2D string methods for improving their accuracy and speeding-up their time responses are also proposed and evaluated. A critical analysis of the performance of all these methods is presented. The analysis indicates that in retrieving images by spatial content, retrieval response time and accuracy are traded-off.",

More specifically, the purpose of the current work is to provide a new non-intrusive way to estimate the suspended sediment (SS) distribution. The proposed methodology uses the color characteristics of river flow images and provides a high correlation factor with the suspended sediment measurements. In our opinion, the importance of the current work derives from the fact that it provides an alternative and effective way of estimating SS distribution rather as opposed to the conventional method that requires human presence, especially if we consider the difficulty of taking measurements of the river pollution during flush flood events when the sediment distribution is increased and is directly related to water quality.",

Temporal relations are in fact ternary (i.e., properties of objects that change in time involve also a temporal value in addition to the object and the subject) and cannot be handled directly by OWL. The standard solution to this problem is to map all temporal relations to a set of binary ones with new (intermediate) classes introduced by the temporal model applied. Nevertheless, ontologies then become complicated and difficult to handle by standard editors such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (e.g., property restrictions of temporal classes might refer to the new classes rather than to the classes on which they were meant to be defined). It also requires that the user be familiar with the peculiarities of the temporal representation. This is exactly the problem this work is dealing with.

Leveraging work for IoT Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design in the cloud, and recent recommendations and standards of the Semantic Web community, iSWoT\u2019s ambition is to combine existing and new ideas into a single framework and make a step towards the realization of the SWoT vision. iSWoT design is novel and deals with the challenges of security, openness and interoperability. Relying on a SOA design, iSWoT is implemented as a composition of RESTful microservices, it is expandable (ie services can be added or removed) while being secure by design: access to services is granted only to authorized users (or other services) based on user roles and access policies. The experimental results are a good support to the claims of efficiency and proved that iSWoT responds in real-time under heavy workloads in a realistic smart home and smart city use case.",

The finite element method is used for the modeling of the interaction between the stent, balloon, arterial wall and plaque. Appropriate material properties and boundary conditions are applied in order to represent the realistic behavior of each component. We observe that stresses are increased at the region of the first contact between the stent and the wall, which may be considered crucial for plaque rupture. Furthermore, the average calculated stress on the plaque is higher than the average stress on the arterial wall. Thus, stent positioning and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The availability of large medical online collections, such as MEDLINE [1], poses new challenges to information and knowledge management. MEDLINE documents are currently indexed by human experts, based on the MeSH thesaurus [2]. The automatic mapping of biomedical documents to UMLS [3] term concepts has been undertaken by MMTx [4]. MMTx was originally developed to improve retrieval of bibliographic material [5]. The limitations of MMTx in term extraction and in the UMLS Metathesaurus mapping have been analysed in detail in [6] and [7]. Our experiments in a pilot study of MMTx and AMTEx on a small MEDLINE corpus showed that MMTx performance was low in precision and that its output greatly suffers by over-generating terms, which diffuse the document concept leading to inaccurate indexing of MEDLINE documents [8]. This reflects a design choice in MMTx, which attempts to favour recall by not focusing on MeSH, whereupon MEDLINE indexing has been based, and by incorporating a variant generation process which leads to term overgeneration.In this paper, we briefly review the MMTx approach and we present our alternative method, the Automatic MeSH Term Extraction method (AMTEx). AMTEx aims at improving the efficiency of automatic term extraction, using a hybrid linguistic/statistical term extraction method, the C/NC value method [9]. Additionally, AMTEx aims at improving efficiency and accuracy in indexing of MEDLINE documents, based on the extraction and mapping of document terms to the MeSH Thesaurus, rather than the full UMLS Metathesaurus mapping of MMTx.",

            "Abstract": "Semantic Similarity relates to computing the similarity between concepts, having the same meaning or related information, which are not lexicographically similar. This is an important problem in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval Research and has received considerable attention in the literature. Several algorithmic approaches for computing semantic similarity have been proposed. We investigate approaches for computing semantic similarity by mapping terms or concepts to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that ontology. Comparing concepts that belong to different ontologies is far more difficult problem. Some of the most popular semantic similarity approaches are implemented and evaluated based on WordNet 1 as the underlying reference ontology. We also propose a method for comparing terms in different ontologies. In this work we examined similarity between terms basically from MeSH 2 (medical) and WordNet ontologies. Building upon the idea of semantic similarity we also propose an information retrieval methodology capable of detecting similarities between documents containing semantically similar but not necessarily identical terms. Our proposed Information Retrieval model has been evaluated for retrieval of documents in Medline 3 database. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed model (although slower) achieves significant performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art approach based on the Vector Space Model.",

Temporal relations are in fact ternary (i.e., properties of objects that change in time involve also a temporal value in addition to the object and the subject) and cannot be handled directly by OWL. The standard solution to this problem is to map all temporal relations to a set of binary ones with new (intermediate) classes introduced by the temporal model applied. Nevertheless, ontologies then become complicated and difficult to handle by standard editors such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (e.g., property restrictions of temporal classes might refer to the new classes rather than to the classes on which they were meant to be defined). It also requires that the user be familiar with the peculiarities of the temporal representation. This is exactly the problem this work is dealing with.

The Web Thing Model service (WTMs) is a novel implementation of the model and is compared against existing implementations selected from the Web. JSON Thing Descriptions (TD) and the operations supported by the REST API are the criteria to determine whether an implementation of Web Thing Model is according to the W3C model. We show that WTMs is the most complete implementation based on the requirements of the model. As a proof of concept, we show how WTMs can be integrated within a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) for the IoT in order to support full-fledged Web Thing Model functionality.",

Rewiring proceeds by establishing new connections to similar peers, and by discarding connections that are outdated or pointing to dissimilar peers. This process aims at improving cluster quality (how well peers with similar content are clustered together) and by this, at improving the flow of information in the network by reducing the number of messages that are exchanged. Therefore, measuring the quality of clustering is an important issue by itself. This is exactly the issue this work is dealing with. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering measure that takes into account the whole neighborhood of a peer (rather than its direct neighbors) thus, providing better insight on the quality of the underlying clustered organisation.

            "Abstract": "The availability of large medical online collections, such as MEDLINE [1], poses new challenges to information and knowledge management. MEDLINE documents are currently indexed by human experts, based on the MeSH thesaurus [2]. The automatic mapping of biomedical documents to UMLS [3] term concepts has been undertaken by MMTx [4]. MMTx was originally developed to improve retrieval of bibliographic material [5]. The limitations of MMTx in term extraction and in the UMLS Metathesaurus mapping have been analysed in detail in [6] and [7]. Our experiments in a pilot study of MMTx and AMTEx on a small MEDLINE corpus showed that MMTx performance was low in precision and that its output greatly suffers by over-generating terms, which diffuse the document concept leading to inaccurate indexing of MEDLINE documents [8]. This reflects a design choice in MMTx, which attempts to favour recall by not focusing on MeSH, whereupon MEDLINE indexing has been based, and by incorporating a variant generation process which leads to term overgeneration.In this paper, we briefly review the MMTx approach and we present our alternative method, the Automatic MeSH Term Extraction method (AMTEx). AMTEx aims at improving the efficiency of automatic term extraction, using a hybrid linguistic/statistical term extraction method, the C/NC value method [9]. Additionally, AMTEx aims at improving efficiency and accuracy in indexing of MEDLINE documents, based on the extraction and mapping of document terms to the MeSH Thesaurus, rather than the full UMLS Metathesaurus mapping of MMTx.",

The service addresses the need of users to monitor and control their homes remotely provided that the home devices are \u201csmart\u201d themselves (ie they can be connected to the internet and operated remotely). Home devices transmit their identifier, measurements and status to a fog node and from there to the cloud. To mitigate concerns in regards to data protection, response time and communication delays in delivering large amounts of data to the cloud, all services for the home are realized within a fog node installed at home. This information becomes available to registered users in the cloud based on subscriptions (ie to users authorized to review and respond to this information). User access rights are defined based on user roles (ie cloud administrators, home moderators and residents). Besides data publication and subscription services, an innovative feature of iHome, is a rule-based event management service which forwards alerts to subscribed users for responding to critical events (ie incidents of fire, malfunctioning appliances at home). iHome is implemented based on principles of Service Oriented Architecture design as a composition of RESTful services.",

The proposed approach extends the existing framework of indexing using SAMs to treat image content in conjunction with two well-known image-matching methods, namely the editing distance on Attributed Relational Graphs (ARGs) and the Hungarian method for graph matching. It provides index support for the two most common types of similarity queries, referred to as range andnearest-neighbor queries and has many desirable properties.

It is used in image retrieval systems to organize and locate images of interest from a database. The use of ontologies in image annotation is meant to make the assigned metadata conseptually motivated ie that can be used to express the intended meaning of things, and not just words as textual strings. In this work, we present a complete framework that is capable of manual and automatic image annotation for a domain specified by an ontology. In order to make succesfull recognition of the image's class, we use the LIRE library and machine learning with decision trees. In the next paragraph, we present the key points of our work. First, an ontology is created that contains all the information that describe the domain of interest (for example in our domain specific example, we create a dog's ontology). Then, using LIRE library, we extract a set of low level characteristics and assign them to each respective class of the ontology. Image annotation is implemented as a retrieval process by comparing vectors of lowlevel descriptors extracted from the input (unkown) image and representative images of each class in the ontology respectively. Two similarity measures are used to compute the similarity between the unknown image and representative images of each class in the ontology: LIRE similarity measure which is a sum of the LIRE descriptors and DOGi similarity measure which is a weighted similarity measure of LIRE features measure with weights determined by decision trees.

The need for standardizing technologies for service publishing and discovery is of crucial importance for their adoption and market success. Web services need to be described in a way that eliminates ambiguities so that they can be uniquely identified by users or machines. OpenAPI Specification is a powerful framework for the description of REST APIs. OpenAPI standard aims to provide service descriptions which are understandable by both humans and machines. Despite its rigorous service language format, OpenAPI service descriptions can be vague. In our previous work we identified the causes of ambiguity in service descriptions and showed that ambiguities can be eliminated by associating ambiguous OpenAPI properties to concepts in a \u2026",

In cases of digital handling of personal data, GDPR compliance must be proven by analyzing the actions that a system applies in order to gather, process and safeguard the data. We advocate that compliance must be considered in the design phase of the system, by analyzing the dependencies between system entities (e.g. personal data, users etc.) and the processes enacted upon them. Then, it is possible to generate a series of data reports that can be assessed by regulators who inspect the system for GDPR compliance. However, there can not be a universal methodology that covers all application domains and systems. To show proof of concept, we apply the methodology to a remote patient monitoring service that runs in the cloud.",

An ontology is constructed holding characteristics from multiple information sources including text descriptions and low-level image features. Image annotation is implemented as a retrieval process by comparing an input (query) image with representative images of all classes. Handling uncertainty in class descriptions is a distinctive feature of SIA. Average Retrieval Rank (AVR) is applied to compute the likelihood of the input image to belong to each one of the ontology classes. Evaluation results of the method are realized using images of 30 dog breeds collected from the Web. The results demonstrated that almost 89% of the test images are correctly annotated (i.e., the method identified their class correctly).",

Nevertheless, the mechanics that enable vision are not obvious even for the experienced researcher. How do we understand shape? How do we understand the objects\u2019 movement? Looking around and recognizing a face or admiring details of a landscape is an amazing accomplishment that is more difficult to achieve than eg the mind processing needed to play chess.Until recently, the function of the human vision was compared to that of a photocamera [Kandel et al., 1995]: The crystalline eye lens focalize an inverse object\u2019s image on the retina, exactly as the lens of a photo-camera. This theory is easily understood to be unsatisfactory, by realizing that under this model assumption a central vision function cannot be explained, namely the depth (3-D) understanding of the surroundings. Additionally, the image projected to the retina is not informative enough to justify our ability to recognize objects under varying illumination conditions. Even the state of the art vision systems are not able to imitate the human vision. Most of them are nearly efficient in controlled environments or require human interaction. In this thesis, we consider and discuss the concept of motion. The ability to understand the moving world is essential to our survival and is taken as granted for us. If we want to create autonomous platforms (robots) that interact with their environment in an intelligent way, then we have to make them understand motion. This chapter outlines concepts related to motion in computer vision and gives a brief overview of our approach. We attempt to represent motion \u2026",

Large amounts of data are daily produced at an ever increasing rate. In many cases, data once stored is often never accessed again. Although we can imagine larger and more powerful databases and data warehouses in which to store data, humans and programs can access only a small portion of it. Wherefore, the existing technology offers the means to store and access data over the Web based on its simple form, but it seems to lack the ability to discover and extract knowledge from it, and to transform raw data into useful information.A popular way for discovering data in the Web is the method of information retrieval. The user sends a query expressing his information needs and the query is suitably propagated in the net to meet the appropriate data source (s). Information is then retrieved and send back to the user. Depending on the way user expresses his information needs and the way resources in various data sources are described, special mechanisms need to be used in order the query to meet the appropriate data sources, to extract knowledge from the data and to match the query against the data. Our intuition says that if data is described in an \u201celegant\u201d way, the knowledge extraction and therefore the retrieval of reliable results becomes more efficient.",

Image annotation is implemented as a retrieval process by comparing an input (query) image with representative images of all classes. Handling uncertainty in class descriptions is a distinctive feature of SIA. Average Retrieval Rank (AVR) is applied to compute the likelihood of the input image to belong to each one of the ontology classes. Evaluation results of the method are realized using images of 30 dog breeds collected from the Web. The results demonstrated that almost 89% of the test images are correctly annotated (i.e., the method identified their class correctly).",

Home devices transmit their identifier, measurements and status to a fog node and from there to the cloud. To mitigate concerns in regards to data protection, response time and communication delays in delivering large amounts of data to the cloud, all services for the home are realized within a fog node installed at home. This information becomes available to registered users in the cloud based on subscriptions (ie to users authorized to review and respond to this information). User access rights are defined based on user roles (ie cloud administrators, home moderators and residents). Besides data publication and subscription services, an innovative feature of iHome, is a rule-based event management service which forwards alerts to subscribed users for responding to critical events (ie incidents of fire, malfunctioning appliances at home). iHome is implemented based on principles of Service Oriented Architecture design as a composition of RESTful services.",

While this development brings with it great opportunities for many fields of science, engineering, business and everyday life, it also presents challenges such as an architectural bottleneck\u2013with a very large number of IoT devices connected to a rather small number of servers in Cloud data centers\u2013and the problem of data deluge. Edge computing aims to alleviate the computational burden of the IoT for the Cloud by pushing some of the computations and logics of processing from the Cloud to the Edge of the Internet. It is becoming commonplace to allocate tasks and applications such as data filtering, classification, semantic enrichment and data aggregation to this layer, but to prevent this new layer from itself becoming another bottleneck for the whole computing stack from IoT to the Cloud, the Edge computing layer needs to be capable of implementing massively parallel and distributed algorithms efficiently. This book, Advances in Edge Computing: Massive Parallel Processing and Applications, addresses these challenges in 11 chapters. Subjects covered include: Fog storage software architecture; IoT-based crowdsourcing; the industrial Internet of Things; privacy issues; smart home management in the Cloud and the Fog; and a cloud robotic solution to assist medical applications. Providing an overview of developments in the field, the book will be of interest to all those working with the Internet of Things and Edge computing.",

Image-based summarization of a Web site is the process of extracting the most characteristic images from it. The criteria for measuring the importance of images in Web sites are based on their frequency of occurrence, characteristics of their content and Web link information. This project focuses on logo and trademark images. Most of the corporate Web sites are characterized by their logos and trade mark. Our system first retrieves the images of a keyword query, clusters the results based on extracted image features and then the most important logos and trademarks are finally selected to form the image-based summary of a Web site that is inferred to be the most relevant to the search query.The proposed system is used to support fast and accurate responses to queries addressing text and images in Web pages by incorporating state of-the-art text and Web link information indexing and retrieval methods in conjunction with efficient ranking of Web pages and images by importance.",

A hypothetical cohort of patients was modeled and used to simulate the patient's progression through the treatment of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). A Markov health state-based model was implemented, based on clinical and economic parameters derived from the literature and clinicians' feedback. The health-economic analysis allowed quantitative estimation of the economic and clinical advantages related to the implementation of the clinical software.

Several variants of state-of-the-art crawlers relying on web page content and link information for estimating the relevance of web pages to a given topic are proposed. Particular emphasis is given to crawlers capable of learning not only the content of relevant pages (as classic crawlers do) but also paths leading to relevant pages. A novel learning crawler inspired by a previously proposed Hidden Markov Model (HMM) crawler is described as well. The crawlers have been implemented using the same baseline implementation (only the priority assignment function differs in each crawler) providing an unbiased evaluation framework for a comparative analysis of their performance. All crawlers achieve their maximum performance when a combination of web page content and (link) anchor text is used for assigning download \u2026",

In this work, we design an automated access control management system as a Cloud service for large residential areas for manage navigation and access control. The solution is based on beacon Bluetooth radio transmitters that broadcast an identifier to nearby devices. The service monitors people\u2019s movements and overall traffic in large residential infrastructures in order to have prompt response on cases of disaster management and evacuation. The solution offers a variety of services aiming to inform the residential infrastructure manager for possible increase of user\u2019s activities and use of certain facilities that is provided as access permissions via subscriptions of varying time lengths. The services, that are deployed over secure private Clouds, make use of users\u2019 smart devices that connect to beacon sensors associated with specific areas. We design our solution to control access via a private Cloud per residential area for managing safely sensitive data. Collectively, a public Cloud could evaluate data (anonymous or not) associated to separate private Clouds. In this way, we will be able to evaluate users\u2019 preferences and habits to further improve the quality of their navigation in residential areas, while at the same time response promptly in cases of disasters.",

Building upon path consistency, the new reasoner design, referred to as CHOROS 2, suggests several optimizations for reducing the number of compositions of basic relations and for speeding-up its run-time performance. CHOROS 2 serves also as a framework for a realistic evaluation of several alternative reasoner designs discussed in this paper. Perhaps, one of the most interesting alternatives that deserves further investigation relies on the idea of decomposing directional relations into two smaller sets of basic relations yielding fewer compositions. CHOROS 2 infers all implied relations and detects inconsistencies while retaining soundness, completeness and tractability over the supported relations sets. Experimental results demonstrate that all variants of CHOROS 2 run up to several \u2026",

            "Abstract": "iHome is a smart home management service that runs in the cloud. The service addresses the need of users to monitor and control their homes remotely provided that the home devices are \u201csmart\u201d themselves (ie they can be connected to the internet and operated remotely). Home devices transmit their identifier, measurements and status to a fog node and from there to the cloud. To mitigate concerns in regards to data protection, response time and communication delays in delivering large amounts of data to the cloud, all services for the home are realized within a fog node installed at home. This information becomes available to registered users in the cloud based on subscriptions (ie to users authorized to review and respond to this information). User access rights are defined based on user roles (ie cloud administrators, home moderators and residents). Besides data publication and subscription services, an innovative feature of iHome, is a rule-based event management service which forwards alerts to subscribed users for responding to critical events (ie incidents of fire, malfunctioning appliances at home). iHome is implemented based on principles of Service Oriented Architecture design as a composition of RESTful services.",

SOWL QL extends SPARQL with a powerful set of temporal and spatial operators, including temporal Allen topological, spatial directional and topological operations or combinations of the above. SOWL QL maintains simplicity of expression, and also upward and downward compatibility with SPARQL. Query translation in SOWL QL yields SPARQL queries, implying that querying spatio-temporal ontologies using SPARQL is still feasible but suffers from several drawbacks \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Dealing with information that changes with time is a critical issue in Knowledge Representation. Existing research efforts limit to temporal information representation and querying in temporal databases. However, the advent of the semantic web over the last few years calls for the representation of temporal information based on temporal ontologies and for querying this information using temporal query languages such as TOQL [7]. However, even the most elaborate querying approaches (such as those referred to above) only support temporal queries that is explicitly represented in a temporal ontology. They cannot provide answers cencerning information that can be influenced from existing information. For example, if the price of a product at time \u2018t\u2019is \u2018p\u2019a temporal query language should be able to inference that the price of the product (unless changed) will still be \u2018p\u2019at later time. This is exactly the problem this work is dealing with. We extent \u201cTOQL\u201d(the Temporal Ontology Query Language developed at the Intelligence Systems Laboratory of TUC) with reasoning capillarities so that TOQL can answer queries for information that that can be inferenced from information represented in the underlying temporal ontology. The reasoner developed to support TOQL implements an action theory based on \u201cEvent Calculus\u201d in Prolog.",

Building upon well established standards of the semantic web (OWL 2.0, SWRL) SOWL enables representation of static as well as of dynamic information, such as objects whose position evolves in time and space. The 4D fluents mechanism forms the basis of the proposed ontology representation in SOWL. Both RCC-8 topologic relations and cone shaped directional relations are supported and integrated in SOWL. Representing both qualitative temporal and spatial information (ie, information whose temporal or spatial extents are unknown such as \u201cleft-of\u201d,\u201cabove\u201d for spatial and \u201cbefore\u201d,\u201cafter\u201d for temporal relations) in addition to quantitative information (ie, where temporal and spatial information is defined precisely) is a distinctive feature of SOWL. Qualitative representations are very common in natural language expressions such in free text or speech and can be proven to be valuable in the Semantic Web. The SOWL spatio-temporal reasoner offers capabilities for inferring new relations over spatio-temporal information and is another distinctive feature of our approach. Building upon tractable sets of temporal and spatial relations the SOWL reasoner also enforces path consistency and retains soundness, completness and tractability over the supported sets of relations.Ontologies offer the means for representing high level concepts, their properties and their interrelationships.

Classic focused crawlers estimate the relevance of Web pages with the topic by computing the similarity of Web pages with a user provided list of keywords that describe the topic of interest. Semantic Crawlers are a variation of classic focused crawlers that use conceptual relations between terms (eg retrieved from an ontology) for estimating the relevance of the Web page with the topic. Learning crawlers employ a training process that guide the crawler towards pages related to the topic.This work address issues related to the design and implementation of classic, semantic and learning focused crawlers. Several variants of classic focused crawlers relying up on web page content and link anchor text for estimating the relevance of web pages to a given topic are examined and implemented.

Our implementation is referred to as CHOROS 2.0 and inherits all features of CHOROS v1 and suggests certain improvements to the basic path-consistency algorithm enhancing its run-time performance. In addition CHOROS 2.0 handles information referring to the relevant position of objects expressed in numerical values, and also updates the ontology with inferred facts. These features are not supported by its predecessor. Finally, we discuss on further improvements to the reasoning engine (ie, based on reducing the size of compositions of basic relations) and we compare their performance to that of CHOROS v1 as well as to that of SOWL, a spatial reasoner implemented in SWRL and runs under Prot\u00e9g\u00e9.",

Queries are issued as SQL-like statements involving time (i.e., time points or intervals) or high-level ontology concepts that vary in time. Although independent from TOQL, this work suggests a mechanism for representing time evolving concepts in ontologies based on the four-dimensional perdurantist mechanism. However, TOQL prevents users from being familiar with the representation of time in ontologies. To show proof of concept, an application has been developed that supports translation and execution of TOQL queries on temporal ontologies combined with a reasoning mechanism based on event calculus. A real world temporal ontology is also implemented on which several TOQL example queries are processed and \u2026",

The service addresses the need of users to monitor and control their homes remotely provided that the home devices are \u201csmart\u201d themselves (ie they can be connected to the internet and operated remotely). Home devices transmit their identifier, measurements and status to a fog node and from there to the cloud. To mitigate concerns in regards to data protection, response time and communication delays in delivering large amounts of data to the cloud, all services for the home are realized within a fog node installed at home. This information becomes available to registered users in the cloud based on subscriptions (ie to users authorized to review and respond to this information). User access rights are defined based on user roles (ie cloud administrators, home moderators and residents). Besides data publication and subscription services, an innovative feature of iHome, is a rule-based event management service which forwards alerts to subscribed users for responding to critical events (ie incidents of fire, malfunctioning appliances at home). iHome is implemented based on principles of Service Oriented Architecture design as a composition of RESTful services.",

In partitional hierarchical clustering, which is more efficient than its agglomerative counterpart, the entire collection is split into clusters and the individual clusters are further split until a heuristicallymotivated termination criterion is met. In this paper, we define the BIC-means algorithm, which applies the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as a domain independent termination criterion for partitional hierarchical clustering. We evaluate the effectiveness of BIC-means in clustering and retrieval on medical document collections and we propose a dynamic version of the BIC-Means algorithm for adapting an existing clustering solution to document additions.",

            "Abstract": "The availability of large volumes of digital content in modern applications (eg, digital libraries and organization intranets) and the on internet has generated additional interest in methods and tools for effective management of shared content. Data clustering is a means for achieving better organization of the information by partitioning the data space into groups of entities with similar content. Clustering of large document collections is the problem this thesis is dealing with. State of the art clustering algorithms are reviewed first (eg partitional and hierarchical algorithms). Initially, we focus on partitional clustering methods due to their low time complexity (ie, linear on the number of documents). Hierarchical clustering methods are considered as well. We examine several variants of the original K-Means algorithm and we propose the so-called \u201cIncremental K-Means\u201d which differs from K-Means in the way the centroids are updated during each clustering iteration. However, both K-Means and its variants produce a flat partition of the data collection. Efficient methods which are able to provide effective organization of information (like hierarchical clustering) are preferred. We propose a novel hierarchical clustering approach, which we call \u201cBIC-Means\u201d. BIC-Means produces a hierarchy of clusters by recursively applying the Incremental K-Means on a document collection. BIC-Means combines the strengths of partitional and hierarchical clustering methods. The main advantage of BIC-Means is that it does not terminate when singleton clusters are reached at the bottom of the hierarchy. To prevent over-splitting of clusters, BIC-Means incorporates the use of \u2026",

Ontologies enable more effective querying, reasoning, and general use of content and allow for standardizing the quality and delivery of information across communicating information sources.

In this preliminary meta-data-study, we propose an analytic framework for biomarker identification aiming at prediction of bipolar disorder, by considering peripheral gene expression differences between bipolar patients and healthy controls.

In this work, we present DS4, a Distributed Social and Semantic Search System that allows users to share and search for content among friends and clusters of users that specialise on the query topic. In DS4, nodes that are semantically, thematically, or socially similar are automatically discovered and logically organised into groups. Content retrieval is then performed by routing queries towards social friends and clusters of nodes that are likely to answer them. In this way, search receives two facets: the social facet, addressing friends, and the semantic facet, addressing nodes that are semantically close to the queries. Our experiments demonstrate that searching only among friends is not effective in distributed social networks, and showcase the necessity and importance of semantic friendship.",

Qualitative representations are very common in natural language expressions such as in free text or speech and can be proven to be valuable in the Semantic Web. Reasoning rules applying over temporal relations, infer implied relations, detect inconsistencies and retain soundness, completeness and tractability over the supported sets of relations using path consistency.

This procedure establishes new connections to similar peers and disregards connections to peers that are dissimilar. Retrieval effectiveness is then improved by exploiting this information at query time (as queries may address clusters of similar peers). Although all systems based on semantic overlay networks apply some rewiring technique, there is no comprehensive study showing the effect of rewiring on system\u2019s performance. In this work, a framework for studying the attribution of rewiring strategies in semantic overlay networks is proposed. A generic approach to rewiring is presented and several variants of this approach are reviewed and evaluated. We show how peer organisation is affected by the different design choices \u2026",

A method is successful if it retrieves the images that the user expects to see in the answers with as few errors as possible. This is a highly subjective processes, ie, the same results may be judged differently by different users. Query uncertainty and user subjectivity may have a disastrous impact on the quality of the results. Query uncertainty depends on users\u2019 level of expertise or familiarity with the system and system functions. Most commonly, users perceive image content in terms of high or semantic level concepts while, in the system, image content is represented in terms of low level image features, eg, color, texture features. Consequently, users cannot express their information needs in queries or, even worst, there may exist a degree of uncertainty in queries as to what the users are really \u2026",

The last two decades, the processing of mathematical formulas has received more attention and a number of research efforts have focused on their syntactic analysis and recognition. This paper focuses on the methodologies used to process mathematical formulas in documents, specifically on the parsing methods. Initially, we offer a short overview of the parsing methods selected and classified into two categories (Top-down and Bottom-up). Then, these methods are individually evaluated using a set of features associated with the efficiency, originality and complexity, etc. by introducing an overall maturity score of each methodology and giving us a general idea about the progress in the field.",

The focus of this paper is on the perceptions of all parties involved (students, workplace supervisor, academic supervisor) with the WPL at the Department of Electronic Engineering-Technological Educational Institute of Crete (DoEE/TEIoC). In particular, based on quantitative data collected at the end of the WPL period of DoEE/TEIoC students, a nonparametric statistical analysis is carried out. The data were extracted from questionnaires (sample size= 91) completed by each student and their corresponding workplace and academic supervisors. Our aim is to compare the perception of the aforementioned three respondent groups in terms of students\u2019 competences and other WPL-related issues. Evaluation results of our research can provide an insight towards the achievement of an effective WPL for DoEE/TEIoC students.",

The review process was carried out by the Program Committee members and other reviewers; all are experts in various image analysis and recognition areas. Each paper was reviewed by at least two reviewers, and also checked by the conference Co-chairs. The high quality of the papers in these proceedings is attributed? rst to the authors, and second to the quality of the reviews provided by the experts. We would like to thank the authors for responding to our call, and we wholeheartedly thank the reviewers for their excellent work and for their timely response.

Ontologies enable more effective querying, reasoning, and general use of content and allow for standardizing the quality and delivery of information across communicating information sources.

A basic aspect of spatial information is directional relations, thus embedding directional spatial relations into ontologies along with their semantics and reasoning rules is an important practical issue. This work proposes a new representation for directional spatial information in ontologies by means of OWL properties and reasoning rules in SWRL embedded into the ontology. The proposed representation is based on the decomposition of cone shaped directional relations (CSD-9) offering a more compact representation and improved reasoning performance over existing approaches.

            "Abstract": "We propose SOWL, an ontology for representing and reasoning over spatio-temporal information in OWL. Building upon well established standards of the semantic web (OWL 2.0, SWRL) SOWL enables representation of static as well as of dynamic information, such as objects whose position evolves in time and space. The 4D fluents mechanism forms the basis of the proposed ontology representation in SOWL. Both RCC-8 topologic relations and cone shaped directional relations are supported and integrated in SOWL. Representing both qualitative temporal and spatial information (ie, information whose temporal or spatial extents are unknown such as \u201cleft-of\u201d,\u201cabove\u201d for spatial and \u201cbefore\u201d,\u201cafter\u201d for temporal relations) in addition to quantitative information (ie, where temporal and spatial information is defined precisely) is a distinctive feature of SOWL. Qualitative representations are very common in natural language expressions such in free text or speech and can be proven to be valuable in the Semantic Web. The SOWL spatio-temporal reasoner offers capabilities for inferring new relations over spatio-temporal information and is another distinctive feature of our approach. Building upon tractable sets of temporal and spatial relations the SOWL reasoner also enforces path consistency and retains soundness, completness and tractability over the supported sets of relations.Ontologies offer the means for representing high level concepts, their properties and their interrelationships. Dynamic ontologies will in addition enable representation of information evolving in time and space. Representation of both static and dynamic information by \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The World Wide Web (the Web) is an increasingly popular source for health information. Also, vast amounts of health information are available in medical data bases. Making this information available in a concise and uniform way is of crucial importance to individual users or organizations. Users of the medical domain can be either health care professionals (experts) or consumers (novice users). Consumers searching for medical information usually issue a natural language query and need to retrieve medical documents on a topic of interest that is easy to read and comprehend (eg medical documents that don\u2019t contain complex medical terminology). On the other hand, experts usually do more specialized searches (involving complex terminology) looking for state-of-the-art documents to fulfill their information needs. This thesis deals with issues related to the design and implementation of medical information systems to fulfill the need of both types of users. Medical information is acquired by web sources or by data repositories available (eg Medline). Acquired medical documents from authoritative (validated) sources are analyzed (though text analysis) and automatically indexed by author, type, content and association (eg link) information. System\u2019s functionality is described using use cases tools and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). UML case, package, activities and class diagrams are used to model users, data entities, system functionalities and their interrelationships. Also part of the system\u2019s functionality has been implemented in a system prototype.",

            "Abstract": "The representation of temporal information has been in the center of intensive research activities over the years in the areas of knowledge representation, databases and more recently, the Semantic Web. The proposed approach extends the existing framework of representing temporal information in ontologies by allowing for representation of concepts evolving in time (referred to as \u201cdynamic\u201d information) and of their properties in terms of qualitative descriptions in addition to quantitative ones (ie, dates, time instants and intervals). For this purpose, we advocate the use of natural language expressions, such as \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cafter\u201d, for temporal entities whose exact durations or starting and ending points in time are unknown. Reasoning over all types of temporal information (such as the above) is also an important research problem.

            "Abstract": "The rapid advance of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has resulted in the number of IoT-connected devices growing exponentially, with billions of connected devices worldwide. While this development brings with it great opportunities for many fields of science, engineering, business and everyday life, it also presents challenges such as an architectural bottleneck\u2013with a very large number of IoT devices connected to a rather small number of servers in Cloud data centers\u2013and the problem of data deluge. Edge computing aims to alleviate the computational burden of the IoT for the Cloud by pushing some of the computations and logics of processing from the Cloud to the Edge of the Internet. It is becoming commonplace to allocate tasks and applications such as data filtering, classification, semantic enrichment and data aggregation to this layer, but to prevent this new layer from itself becoming another bottleneck for the whole computing stack from IoT to the Cloud, the Edge computing layer needs to be capable of implementing massively parallel and distributed algorithms efficiently. This book, Advances in Edge Computing: Massive Parallel Processing and Applications, addresses these challenges in 11 chapters. Subjects covered include: Fog storage software architecture; IoT-based crowdsourcing; the industrial Internet of Things; privacy issues; smart home management in the Cloud and the Fog; and a cloud robotic solution to assist medical applications. Providing an overview of developments in the field, the book will be of interest to all those working with the Internet of Things and Edge computing.",

A basic aspect of spatial information is directional relations, thus embedding directional spatial relations into ontologies along with their semantics and reasoning rules is an important practical issue. This work proposes a new representation for directional spatial information in ontologies by means of OWL properties and reasoning rules in SWRL embedded into the ontology. The proposed representation is based on the decomposition of cone shaped directional relations (CSD-9) offering a more compact representation and improved reasoning performance over existing approaches.

CHOROS provides consistency checking and query answering over spatial data represented with the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) and the Cone-Shaped directional logic formalism (CSD). It supports all RCC-8 and CSD-9 relations as well as standard RDF/OWL semantic relations, both represented in RDF/OWL. As such, it can answer mixed SPAR L queries over spatial and non-spatial relation types. CHOROS extends PelletSpatial\u2019s [4] hybrid architecture, which is based on a composition table that implements a path-consistency algorithm. We also introduce a multithreading technique that enables to execute CSD and RCC consistency checking concurrently. As a case study and to objectively assess the performance of CHOROS we developed the\u201d TUC spatial ontology\u201d providing a qualitative spatial description of the regions, forming the campus of Technical University of Crete (TUC). Finally, we discuss and evaluate possible optimizations of CHOROS and compare its performance with that of a spatial reasoner implemented in SWRL and runs under Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [2].",

The need to monitor patient's health remotely and in real time becomes more and more a vital requirement, especially for chronic patients and elderly. In this work, we focus on the management of health care related data stored on the Cloud produced by Bluetooth low energy devices. We present a Cloud based IoT Management System that collects vital user data (eg cardiac pulse rate and blood oxygen saturation) on real time. Our solution enables sensor data collection and processing fast and efficient, while users such as medical personnel can subscribe to patient's data and get notifications. The system is designed based on microservices and includes a notification service for both health care providers and patients minimizing the risk \u2026",

OntoGain follows an ontology learning process defined by distinct processing layers. Building upon plain term extraction a concept hierarchy is formed by clustering the extracted concepts. The derived term taxonomy is then enriched with non-taxonomic relations. Several different stateof-the-art methods have been examined for implementing each layer. OntoGain is based upon multi-word term concepts, as multi-word or compound terms are vested with more solid and distinctive semantics than plain single word terms. We opted for a hierarchical clustering method and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) algorithm for building the term taxonomy. Furthermore an association rule algorithm is applied for revealing non-taxonomic relations. A method which tries to carry out the most appropriate generalization level between a relation\u2019s concepts is also implemented. To show proof of concept, a system prototype is implemented. The OntoGain allows transformation of the derived ontology into OWL using Jena Semantic Web Framework1. OntoGain is applied on two separate data sources (a medical and computer corpus) and its results are compared with similar results obtained by Text2Onto, a state-of-the-art-ontology learning method. The analysis of the results indicates that OntoGain performs better than Text2Onto in terms of precision (extracts more correct concepts) while being more selective (extracts fewer but more reasonable concepts).",

This work proposes a new representation for directional spatial information in ontologies by means of OWL properties and reasoning rules in SWRL embedded into the ontology. The proposed representation is based on the decomposition of cone shaped directional relations (CSD-9) offering a more compact representation and improved reasoning performance over existing approaches.

Diseases that evolve in time require patient\u2019s condition of the disease monitored by the clinicians for providing optimal medical treatment to patients in real time. Often clinicians have to manage with crucial incidents that require direct response based on their good knowledge of the patient\u2019s history medical record and the medical guidelines that are in effect for the disease. That is not an easy task especially when clinicians have to deal with many patients or the disease evolves constantly. In this thesis we focus on Bipolar Disorder, a disease with the characteristics refered to above. It evolves constantly in time and often leads to crucial incidents with hazardous effects for the patient\u2019s life. Nonetheless, our management and design focuses on Breakthrough Depressive Episode Scenario, a scenario that is common among Bipolar Disorder patients. Using Semantic Web Technologies we developed SybillaTUC-a recommendation system based on an ontology designed to represent and manage the information about each patient\u2019s medical record and the management of the disease. By reasoning over patient\u2019s data, SybillaTUC is able to recommend clinicians the best treatment for each patient.SybillaTUC provides clinicians with the ability to individualize the monitoring of Bipolar Disorder, offering constant view of the patient\u2019s condition and easy access to his medical record.

Building upon the idea of semantic similarity, a novel information retrieval method is also proposed. This method is capable of detecting similarities between documents containing semantically similar but not necessarily lexicographically similar terms. The proposed method has been evaluated in retrieval of images and documents on the Web.

Various types of thermocouples (K, N, J, \u03a4) are examined simultaneously in the temperature range 25 C to 100 C. Reference temperature values are obtained using a high-quality mercury-in-glass thermometer. The thermocouple circuit applied is that of cold junction compensation (reference junction). Furthermore, the mechanical thermometer is compared against the reference junction compensation using type T thermocouple and thermistor. The data are collected in a PC which is communicating through its serial port with a programmable data logger thus familiarizing the students with low level programming, as well as with the principles of digital measurement and data acquisition procedures. Data analysis consists of calibration curves, assessment of uncertainties, polynomial fitting, study of the thermoelectric power (sensitivity) against temperature, design of algorithm to calculate temperatures from thermocouple voltages and comparison of the results with NIST standard tables.",

We adopt a model for peer churn, and study the effect of network dynamics on peer organisation and retrieval performance. The overlay network is evaluated on a realistic peer-to-peer environment using real-world data and queries, and taking into account the dynamics of user-driven peer participation.

OntoGain follows an ontology learning process defined by distinct processing layers. Building upon plain term extraction a concept hierarchy is formed by clustering the extracted concepts. The derived term taxonomy is then enriched with non-taxonomic relations. Several different stateof-the-art methods have been examined for implementing each layer. OntoGain is based upon multi-word term concepts, as multi-word or compound terms are vested with more solid and distinctive semantics than plain single word terms. We opted for a hierarchical clustering method and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) algorithm for building the term taxonomy. Furthermore an association rule algorithm is applied for revealing non-taxonomic relations. A method which tries to carry out the most appropriate generalization level between a relation\u2019s concepts is also implemented. To show proof of concept, a system prototype is implemented. The OntoGain allows transformation of the derived ontology into OWL using Jena Semantic Web Framework1. OntoGain is applied on two separate data sources (a medical and computer corpus) and its results are compared with similar results obtained by Text2Onto, a state-of-the-art-ontology learning method. The analysis of the results indicates that OntoGain performs better than Text2Onto in terms of precision (extracts more correct concepts) while being more selective (extracts fewer but more reasonable concepts).",

            "Abstract": "An ontology describes the concepts and relationships that are important in a particular domain, provides a vocabulary for that domain that helps both people and machines to communicate concisely. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with representing information that evolves in time (eg, objects in a video) in ontologies including among others, N-ary relations, reification, and recently the 4D-fluents approach with the later being the one we adopt in this work. However, representing the time dimension of concepts that evolve in time in ontologies require that temporal relationships become ternary (from binary). Typically, this is handled by decomposing ternary relationships to a set of binary relations and by using additional new classes to represent their relationships. This introduces additional complexity into the representation (eg, property restrictions of temporal classes might refer to the additional classes introduced by the representation rather than the classes on which they are originally defined). Writing a temporal ontology using an editor takes time and effort and requires lots of attention to detail. Although there are editors for handling ontologies, with the most popular being the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 editor, there is no tool for crafting temporal concepts in ontologies. This is exactly the problem this work is dealing with. In this thesis, we design and implement a Plug-In for the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 editor that facilitates the crafting (ie, creating, editing) of temporal ontologies. Particular emphasis is given to making the Plug-In portable and easy to use by ordinary users of the semantic Web. The Plug-In is realized as a Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tab that provides a front-end interface \u2026",

Diseases that evolve in time require patient\u2019s condition of the disease monitored by the clinicians for providing optimal medical treatment to patients in real time. Often clinicians have to manage with crucial incidents that require direct response based on their good knowledge of the patient\u2019s history medical record and the medical guidelines that are in effect for the disease. That is not an easy task especially when clinicians have to deal with many patients or the disease evolves constantly.

This process is complementary to text summarization which works by extracting brief text summaries (eg, important phrases or sentences) from the Web sites. To the best of our knowledge, Web image summarization methods are not known to exist. This is exactly the problem this work is dealing with. The proposed method works by analyzing the content of the images stored in a Web-site taking also link information into account. Because there is no unique method for analyzing the content of every possible image type, this work focuses on logo and trademark images. These are important features of a Web site by themselves characterizing the identity of Corporate Web sites or of products presented in such Web sites. The method is based also on machine learning for distinguishing logo and trademarks \u2026",

Despite the technologys numerous advantages, health care and other application fields related with sensitive and confidential information have been reluctant to seize its offerings. This is because of the requirement for data processing data on remote cloud datacenters and therefore the transferring of sensitive data over the Internet. A solution to this problem is the reverse cloud approach that allows software to be transferred near to the data source and to be instantiated into a new cloud environment in order to eliminate the problems of processing sensitive data remotely. To achieve this we developed an innovative software to data service that allows virtual machines in the form of running instances or images to be migrated \u2026",

In this paper, we study the behaviour of semantic overlay networks that support full-fledged information retrieval in the presence of peer churn. We adopt a model for peer churn, and study the effect of network dynamics on peer organisation and retrieval performance. The overlay network is evaluated on a realistic peer-to-peer environment using real-world data and queries, and taking into account the dynamics of user-driven peer participation. Using this evaluation, we draw conclusions on the performance of the system in terms of clustering efficiency, communication load and \u2026",

The stenting procedure is simulated for two different cases; in the first the presence of the plaque is ignored whereas in the second a three dimensional (3D) stiff calcified plaque is located in the stenotic area of the artery. Results indicate that in the second case the von Mises stresses in the arterial wall are higher than the stresses occurred in the first case. In addition, the distribution of the arterial von Mises stress depends on the plaque composition.",

We investigate approaches for computing semantic similarity by mapping terms to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that ontology.

The most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet and MeSH. The focus of this work is also on cross ontology methods which are capable of computing the semantic similarity between terms stemming from different ontologies (WordNet and MeSH in this work). This is a far more difficult problem (than the single ontology one referred to above) which has not been investigated adequately in the literature. X-Similarity, a novel cross-ontology similarity method is also a contribution of this work.

            "Abstract": "A large amount of medical information is currently becoming from many sources, such us journals, books, databases and lately the World Wide Web (WWW). Users of the medical domain can be either health care professionals (experts) or consumers (novice users). Consumers searching for medical information usually issue a natural language query and need to retrieve medical documents on a topic of interest that is easy to read and comprehend (eg medical information that do not contain complex medical terminology). On the other hand, experts usually do more specialized searches (involving complex terminology) looking for state-of-the-art documents to fulfil their information needs. This thesis deals with issues related to the design and implementation of medical information systems to fulfill the need of both types of users. Medical information is acquired by Web sources or by data repositories available (eg Medline). Acquired medical documents from authoritative (validated) sources are analyzed (though text analysis) and are automatically indexed by author, type, content and association (eg link) information. Indexing is based-upon the idea of keeping the most characteristic medical terms of a document. This information is usually extracted by term extraction. Term extraction relates to extracting the most characteristic or important terms (words or phrases) from a document. This information allows for faster and better understanding of the contents of a document collection without first browsing through the contents of its documents. In this thesis is presented AMTEX an automatic term extraction method, specifically designed for the automatic \u2026",

SOWL QL extends SPARQL with a powerful set of temporal and spatial operators, including temporal Allen topological, spatial directional and topological operations or combinations of the above. SOWL QL maintains simplicity of expression, and also upward and downward compatibility with SPARQL. Query translation in SOWL QL yields SPARQL queries, implying that querying spatio-temporal ontologies using SPARQL is still feasible but suffers from several drawbacks \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An ontology describes the concepts and relationships that are important in a particular domain, provides a vocabulary for that domain that helps both people and machines to communicate concisely. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with representing information that evolves in time (eg, objects in a video) in ontologies including among others, N-ary relations, reification, and recently the 4D-fluents approach with the later being the one we adopt in this work. However, representing the time dimension of concepts that evolve in time in ontologies require that temporal relationships become ternary (from binary). Typically, this is handled by decomposing ternary relationships to a set of binary relations and by using additional new classes to represent their relationships. This introduces additional complexity into the representation (eg, property restrictions of temporal classes might refer to the additional classes introduced by the representation rather than the classes on which they are originally defined). Writing a temporal ontology using an editor takes time and effort and requires lots of attention to detail. Although there are editors for handling ontologies, with the most popular being the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 editor, there is no tool for crafting temporal concepts in ontologies. This is exactly the problem this work is dealing with. In this thesis, we design and implement a Plug-In for the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 editor that facilitates the crafting (ie, creating, editing) of temporal ontologies. Particular emphasis is given to making the Plug-In portable and easy to use by ordinary users of the semantic Web. The Plug-In is realized as a Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tab that provides a front-end interface \u2026",

Based on intelligently filtering of evidence-knowledge and individual-specific information we aim to provide treatment notifications and recommended function tests at appropriate times or concluding into alerts for serious mood changes and patient\u2019s nonresponse to treatment. We propose an architecture as the back-end part of a cloud platform for IoT, intertwining intelligence devices with patients\u2019 daily routine and clinicians\u2019 support.",

The RT3S training application is designed in order the tutors (expert surgeons) to easily prepare the educational content for their students and the students (future surgeons) to be trained on the assessment of real patient data, the decision making process on the management and treatment of a patient. It is an e-learning application which uses state-of-art technologies, such as Learning Activity Manager System (LAMS)(1), for the implementation of the training process and it is based on latest e-learning standards, such as IMS Learning Design (2), for the implementation of the training scenarios.The general flow of the training scenarios is depicted in Figure 1. The scenarios start with the learning objectives and the benefits for the trainee in order to trigger his/her interest. The trainee then accesses all the patient related information, which according to the expert is needed in order the trainee to make an initial assessment for the patient condition. Feedback of the expert is provided to the trainee helping him/her to avoid mistakes in the following steps. Based on the above information the trainee is prompted to suggest a treatment plan depending on the level of his/her experience (eg Level 1 medical resident, Level 2 medical student). The trainee compares his/her suggesting with the one provided by the expert. In the next step the imaging examinations are presented.

It works with all RCC and CSD relations in combination with standard RDF/OWL semantic relations in an OWL ontology and can answer SPARQL queries with spatial and non-spatial relations. We also present SOWL, a spatial reasoner for both relation calculi implemented in SWRL and runs under Pellet. We discuss and evaluate possible optimizations of CHOROS and compare its performance with that of SOWL. The experimental results demonstrate that CHOROS runs significantly faster than \u2026",

Our algorithm treats noise and shape distortions by allowing matching of merged sequences of consecutive small segments in a shape with larger segments of another shape, while being invariant to translation, scale, orientation, and starting point selection. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in retrieval of shapes on two data sets of two-dimensional open and closed shapes of marine life species.

Typically, semantic similarity is computed by mapping terms to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that ontology. We investigate approaches to computing the semantic similarity between natural language terms (using WordNet as the underlying reference ontology) and between medical terms (using the MeSH ontology of medical and biomedical terms). The most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet and MeSH. Building upon semantic similarity, we propose the Semantic Similarity based Retrieval Model (SSRM), a novel information retrieval method capable for discovering similarities between documents containing conceptually similar terms. The most effective semantic similarity method is implemented into SSRM. SSRM has been applied in retrieval on OHSUMED (a standard TREC collection available on the Web). The experimental results demonstrated promising performance improvements over classic information retrieval methods utilizing plain lexical matching (eg, Vector Space Model) and also over state-of-theart semantic similarity retrieval methods utilizing ontologies.",

Temporal relations are in fact ternary (i.e., properties of objects that change in time involve also a temporal value in addition to the object and the subject) and cannot be handled directly by OWL.

            "Abstract": "Moving  into  a  new  era  of  healthcare,  new  tools  and  devices are developed to extend and improve health services, such as remote   patient   monitoring   and   risk   prevention.   In   this   concept,    Internet   of   Things   (IoT)   and   Cloud   Computing   present   great    advantages  by  providing  remote  and  efficient  services,  as   well  as  cooperation between patients, clinicians, researchers and  other health professionals.  This  paper  focuses  on  patients  suffering  from  bipolar disorder,  a  brain  disorder  that  belongs  to  a  group  of conditions  called affective  disorders,  which  is  characterized by  great  mood  swings.  We  exploit  the  advantages  of  Semantic   Web  and  Cloud  Technologies  to  develop  a patient  monitoring  system  to  support  clinicians. Based on intelligently filtering of evidence-knowledge and  individual-specific    information    we    aim    to    provide    treatment    notifications and recommended function tests at appropriate times or  concluding into  alerts  for  serious  mood  changes  and  patient\u2019s  non- response  to  treatment.  We  propose  an  architecture  as  the  back-end   part  of  a  cloud  platform  for  IoT,  intertwining  intelligence  devices  with patients\u2019 daily routine and clinicians\u2019 support",

            "Abstract": "Elixir is an autonomous agent that extends the capabilities of Docker Swarm in certain ways:(a) it supports monitoring of resources in real-time,(b) introduces a scheduler for balancing the workload among swarm nodes and, most importantly,(c) supports automatic scaling-up (or down) of worker nodes at run-time with no downtime (ie without stopping the system). The proposed scaling strategy is reactive and works by responding to static (pre-defined) thresholds applying on resource metrics (eg RAM, CPU). The experimental results demonstrate that Docker Swarm with Elixir responds to the increasing (or decreasing) resource demands of each application leading to significantly faster response times compared to its non-auto scaled counterpart, while maintaining optimal allocation of resources per application.",

            "Abstract": "Semantic Similarity relates to computing the similarity between concepts which are not lexicographically similar. We investigate approaches to computing semantic similarity by mapping terms (concepts) to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that ontology. Some of the most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet as the underlying reference ontology. Building upon the idea of semantic similarity, a novel information retrieval method is also proposed. This method is capable of detecting similarities between documents containing semantically similar but not necessarily lexicographically similar terms. The proposed method has been evaluated in retrieval of images and documents on the Web. The experimental results demonstrated very promising performance improvements over state-of-the-art information retrieval methods.",

The service addresses the need of users to monitor and control their homes remotely provided that the home devices are \u201csmart\u201d themselves (i.e. they can be connected to the internet and operated remotely). Home devices transmit their identifier, measurements and status to a fog node and from there to the cloud. To mitigate concerns in regards to data protection, communication delays in delivering large amounts of data to the cloud, all services for the home are realized within a fog node installed at home. This information becomes available to registered users in the cloud based on subscriptions (i.e. to users authorized to review and respond to this information). User access rights are defined based on user roles (i.e. cloud administrators, home moderators and residents). Besides data publication and subscription services, an innovative \u2026",
