A systematic search of databases was carried out to locate theoretical and empirical studies investigating technologies as auxiliary or supporting tools for the inclusion of DHH students. Results are presented in two categories: (1) review/survey or theoretical papers and (2) studies of technology design and evaluation. Based on our findings, there is only preliminary evidence on how technology can support the inclusion of DHH students in mainstream schools. We argue that there is less need for research on technologies specialized on the disability, aiming to accommodate hearing loss, such as technologies to support the acquisition of sign language or speech-to-text translation of the teacher\u2019s talk.

As a result, understanding individuals with learning disabilities and addressing their needs is an active topic of research, although it has been studied for several years. On the other hand, Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is an emerging field of research. AmI environments are claimed to be among other things sensitive, caring and adaptive to their inhabitants. In the context of education, AmI can adopt a student-centric approach and support the education activities that are taking place adapting to the individual learner\u2019s needs.

            "Abstract": "This paper discusses technology acceptance in the context of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments. Determining what would make a technology acceptable by users was widely recognized as a significant field of research since the seventies. Ever since several models have been developed, while recent advances in technology have led to increased research interest in assessing technology acceptance in a variety of domains. This has resulted in a plethora of studies and an extensive number of parameters that can be considered important towards predicting the acceptance of a given technology by its target audience. An important concern is how to practically employ these models for the assessment of AmI environments, given their high complexity and the wide range of potential contexts and target users. To this end, this paper carries out a review of the most important models and their evolution over time, as well as a review of studies extending these models in a variety of domains beyond the workplace. Furthermore, a classification of the parameters studied across these models is carried out, identifying a common feature across existing technology acceptance studies, namely that all assessments are based on self-reported metrics. This highlights the need for a synergistic evaluation approach, where assessment will move beyond self-reported or observed metrics and will be supported and assisted by the AmI environment itself.",

However, recent studies on the technological enhancement of education have shown that teacher\u2019s activities are not adequately supported, as the focus remains rather on the student\u2019s side. This article discusses a learner-centric approach towards supporting instructors in improving the teaching and learning processes in ambient educational environments. The proposed solution introduces an intelligent multi-agent infrastructure that monitors unobtrusively the students\u2019 activities and identifies potential learning weaknesses and pitfalls that need to be addressed at an individual or classroom level. Such real-time insights enable the instructor to intervene providing help and adapt the teaching process according to the needs of the class. For that to be achieved, several applications have been developed:(i) a real-time classroom activity visualizer,(ii) a behavioral reasoner that aims to identify common behaviors by analyzing classroom activities,(iii) a statistics records manager targeting to showcase students\u2019 progress and performance at both an individual and classroom level, and finally (iv) a series of mini-tools that enhance typical procedures that can be found in conventional classrooms, such as the classroom attendance record, the schedule manager, etc. Following the system\u2019s description, findings of a preliminary expert-based evaluation are presented and some concluding remarks regarding the deployment of the system in real-life environments are formulated. Finally, potential future extensions of the system are proposed.",

            "Abstract": "We present the robot developed within the Hobbit project, a socially assistive service robot aiming at the challenge of enabling prolonged independent living of elderly people in their own homes. We present the second prototype (Hobbit PT2) in terms of hardware and functionality improvements following first user studies. Our main contribution lies within the description of all components developed within the Hobbit project, leading to autonomous operation of 371 days during field trials in Austria, Greece, and Sweden. In these field trials, we studied how 18 elderly users (aged 75 years and older) lived with the autonomously interacting service robot over multiple weeks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a multifunctional, low-cost service robot equipped with a manipulator was studied and evaluated for several weeks under real-world conditions. We show that Hobbit\u2019s adaptive approach towards the user increasingly eased the interaction between the users and Hobbit. We provide lessons learned regarding the need for adaptive behavior coordination, support during emergency situations, and clear communication of robotic actions and their consequences for fellow researchers who are developing an autonomous, low-cost service robot designed to interact with their users in domestic contexts. Our trials show the necessity to move out into actual user homes, as only there can we encounter issues such as misinterpretation of actions during unscripted human-robot interaction.",

This path is intrinsically linked with (i) the progressive emergence of new, more general and systematic frameworks for studying and designing interaction, and (ii) technological evolution supporting the establishment of richer alternative interaction techniques and user interface styles.The concept of interactivity between humans and computers, contextually defined in this Chapter as the extent to which the characteristics of an interactive system affect the communication behaviour of both the user (s) and the system itself, plays a crucial role in this respect. Interactivity is not a new concept, as it has been investigated in the literature with respect to both human communication and various types of interactive systems.",

            "Abstract": "With the development of wearable sensors and textile technologies, wearable devices have been incorporated into our everyday life. Using unobtrusive and wearable technology as emotional assistance for wearers has been considered as an important research question in the field of Human-computer interaction (HCI). Not only is it essential to boost one\u2019s own emotional health, it also crucial to influence others\u2019 emotional states through interactions in a group environment. People are easily affected by the emotions and feelings among group members. For example, surrounded by people complaining about their situations, most likely you will feel depressed and sad. If your spouse comes home wearing a big smiling face, your mood can be dramatically affected and you will soon become happier. Researchers call this phenomenon \u201cgroup emotional contagion\u201d[1]. Affective devices should take into account the shared emotions occurring in groups and help their wearers to be aware of their bodily experience in depression or overexcitement and consequently help modify or pacify their emotions. Designing for group emotional health with wearable technologies presents a new challenge to interaction designers. Wearable tech design should also be put in a group\u2019s context. It raises different issues and principles in addition to those of self-emotional awareness and regulation. Designers need to find the important touchpoints with users during the design process. This paper focuses only on people\u2019s bodily experiences in",

The identification and analysis of functional and non-functional requirements related to different life-cycle phases provide designers with appropriate clues for improving the usability and ultimately the acceptability of a Digital Library under design. This paper presents a generic usage life-cycle model for Digital Libraries, as well as a preliminary validation of the model based on the results of an empirical surveybased analysis of user requirements. The derived conclusions are that three main lifecycle phases (usage patterns) can be preliminary distinguished based on the correlation between user demographics such as usage experience and frequency and duration of use, and variations of users\u2019 interest in functional and non-functional requirements. These three phases can be characterised as exploration in width, occasional (but long term) use and exploration in depth of a Digital Library user interface and content. The practical impact of the derived conclusions on the design of user interfaces of Digital Libraries is briefly discussed leading to indications for future work needed.",

Intangible HC dimensions include dexterity, know-how, and skilled use of tools, as well as identity and traditions of the communities in which craftsmanship is, or was, practiced. HCs are part of history and have impact upon the economy of the areasin which they flourish. Despite their cultural significance, efforts towards HC digital representation and presentation are scattered. In this chapter, as a first step towards the Representation and Presentation of Heritage Crafts as cultural heritage (CH), pertinent requirements and needed technological components are investigated. Representation is expected to capture the wide spectrum of knowledge that a HC covers, from objects and their making, to hand gestures and tool uses that define craft motor skills, to the societal value, economic impact, and historical significance of HCs. Presentation is expected to address the need of exploiting Representation to conserve cultural resources, contribute to their accurate interpretation, provide essential and authentic experiences, as well as stimulate revenues of cultural resources through thematic tourism. This chapter lays the foundations and envisions the further development and formalisation of a suitable approach to HC representation and presentation in the form of a generic protocol that together with the appropriate technological tools can be applied to any HC instance.",

Quality of life and active aging of elderly people is becoming an essential objective for today\u2019s European societies. In this scope, the term \u201cAmbient Assisted Living\u201d (AAL) is used to refer to the meaningful usage of information and communication technologies, in a way that they can improve the quality of life of older people by offering them safety and comfort to live longer at home and prologue their independence. Many studies have been carried out about empowering the elderly in AAL environments, concerning the aspects of facilitating everyday living, addressing medical conditions and taking appropriate actions in emergency situations. However, an equally important aspect of the elderly's lives is their active engagement in their surrounding environment and this implies interacting with different types of technology.Robotic platforms have been around for quite some time since researchers have been trying to overcome essential problems that are related to the nature of robotics and their usage in domestic environments.

In this context, modern programming languages, popular user interface (UI) toolkits and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are briefly reviewed, taking into account the facilities offered to software developers for producing more advanced web-based services. The main drawback of these development approaches comes out to be their inability to cope with the diversity of the target user population. A potential solution is proposed through a novel approach to the development of inclusive Web-based interfaces (web content), capable to adapt to multiple and significantly different profiles of users and contexts of use. To this purpose, an advanced toolkit called EAGER is proposed. EAGER allows Microsoft\u00ae .NET developers to create interfaces that conform to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) accessibility guidelines, and which are able to adapt to the interaction modalities, metaphors and user interface elements most appropriate to each individual user, according to profile information (user and context). The process of employing EAGER is significantly less demanding in terms of time, experience and skills required from the developer than the typical process of developing Web interfaces for the \u201caverage\u201d user. Ultimately, EAGER offers significant benefits to developers, and ensures the delivery of widely accessible, usable and satisfying Web-based interfaces.",

            "Abstract": "Intelligent Conversational Agents are already employed in different scenarios, both in commerce and in research. In particular, they can play an important role in defining a new natural interaction paradigm between them and humans. When these Intelligent Agents take a human-like form (embodied Virtual Agents) in the virtual world, we refer to them as Virtual Humans. In this context, they can communicate with humans through storytelling, where the Virtual Human plays the role of a narrator and/or demonstrator, and the user can listen, as well as interact with the story. We propose that the behavior and actions of multiple, concurrently active Virtual Humans, can be the result of communication between them, based on a dynamic script, which resembles in structure a screenplay.

Indeed, from a social perspective, considerable interest in examining the influences of Social Computing (SC) for Social Inclusion (SI) arises from researchers and designers. This paper addresses the existing literature on the use of SC for SI. Previous studies have been reviewed to report affordances of SC design in five different areas: (a) for the elderly, (b) for people with disabilities, (c) for gender studies, (d) for societal change, and (e) for the preservation of cultural heritage. Results from the literature overview provide some examples of applications of new technologies that were designed to reduce social exclusion.

            "Abstract": "High stress levels and sleep deprivation may cause several mental or physical health issues, such as depression, impaired memory, decreased motivation, obesity, etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented changes in our lives, generating significant stress, and worries about health, social isolation, employment, and finances. To this end, nowadays more than ever, it is crucial to deliver solutions that can help people to manage and control their stress, as well as to reduce sleep disturbances, so as to improve their health and overall quality of life. Technology, and in particular Ambient Intelligence Environments, can help towards that direction, when considering that they are able to understand the needs of their users, identify their behavior, learn their preferences, and act and react in their interest. This work presents two systems that have been designed and developed in the context of an Intelligent Home, namely CaLmi and HypnOS, which aim to assist users that struggle with stress and poor sleep quality, respectively. Both of the systems rely on real-time data collected by wearable devices, as well as contextual information retrieved from the ambient facilities of the Intelligent Home, so as to offer appropriate pervasive relaxation programs (CaLmi) or provide personalized insights regarding sleep hygiene (HypnOS) to the residents. This article will describe the design process that was followed, the functionality of both systems, the results of the user studies that were conducted for the evaluation of their end-user applications, and a discussion about future plans.

            "Abstract": "As computer technologies rapidly evolve, evaluation as an integral part of the development lifecycle of complex systems and user interfaces (UIs), which address diverse user groups including people with disability, emerge as critical to their success. Typically though, traditional evaluation methods and techniques originally developed for conducting conventional UI usability evaluations (eg, of GUIs) are usually introduced in late development stages of such UIs and adapted on a case-by-case basis. Reportedly, such non-systematic approaches to evaluation are often proved inefficient and ineffective in assessing the accessibility or other qualities-such as the utility and usabilityof systems that are (also) targeted to a diverse user population. This paper presents a normative framework for evaluation that allows to address additional system qualities such as visibility-findability, perceived usefulness prior access and use, availability-approachability, interaction qualities (eg, accessibility, utility and usability), and user relationship maintainability. The proposed model can be employed both in evaluating an individual system and in comparing/assessing sets of systems. Furthermore, the same model can apply also at the level of subsystems and system functions. A significant advantage of the proposed framework is that it can be employed for evaluations that need to pay attention also to substantial factors that are usually neglected. These include accessibility, the needs and requirements of a more diverse user population, and variances in user patterns as these evolve in the context of repeated and long term usage. In particular, the framework can be \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An online community is a virtual community composed of individuals who form and maintain online communication, share common goals, interests and needs that provide the reason of community existence, and use common interactive tools that support their networking and communication activities. The term \u201cnetworking\u201d is traditionally used to describe the formation and maintenance of connections and relationships between individuals, organizations or other interested parties. Virtual or online networking is a form of interpersonal communication that is characterized by the use of electronic means of communication between the different parties and the exchange of messages and information in electronic forms [11]. Hence, virtual or online communities perform virtual networking. This paper aims to examine how the principles of Design for All can support the formation and operation of online communities that are fully inclusive, multi-cultural and multiplatform, thus providing an infrastructure essentially accessible to all their members to carry out virtual networking activities. Following an introduction to online communities and community formation, the paper briefly builds the case for Design for All and the challenges for new information and communication technologies towards a fully inclusive Information Society. Then, based on practical experience and case studies, the paper examines the benefits and challenges of applying the principles of Design for All in the design, development and support of virtual interaction spaces, in order to cater for the diversity of users-community members, as well as of their environments of use.

To this end, the domain of assistive robotics is continuously researching and developing new robotic solutions for assisted living. One of the research challenges in this scope is the design of appropriate user interfaces for the elderly. This paper discusses the use of a multimodal user interface (UI) development framework for developing elderly-friendly robotic applications in the scope of the EU funded project RAMCIP. The project aims to develop a novel home robotic assistant system for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and at early stages of Alzheimer Disease (AD). The paper describes the UI framework, its application in RAMCIP and the initial experiences regarding the use of the framework gathered from the preliminary pilot trials of the project with actual patients.",

As a result, Conversational Agents are increasingly used in this context, in order to achieve a natural, intuitive and seamless interaction between the user and the system. However, in spite of the continuous progress and advancements in the area of Conversational Agents, there are still some considerable limitations in current approaches. The system proposed in this paper addresses some of the main drawbacks by: (a) automatically integrating new services based on their formal specification, (b) incorporating error handling via follow-up questions, and (c) processing multiple user intents through the segmentation of the input.

This analysis leads to the consideration that, in the context of web design, it is critical to provide design techniques and tools that can cope with a diverse user population in terms of social, cultural and personal characteristics. Towards addressing this need, the present Chapter proposes a Web User Interface (WUI) development toolkit, named EAGER, which embodies consolidated design knowledge and supports web designers in addressing diversity through WUI adaptation. The interfaces created are able to adapt to the interaction modalities, metaphors and user interface elements most appropriate to individual user and context profiles. The proposed design approach is analyzed in depth together with examples of design outcomes.",

            "Abstract": "Game design process creates goals, rules, and challenges to define a game that produces desirable interactions among its participants. Modeling the way in which players interact with the game requires among others the definition of game rules, plot, connection between player and the game, etc. ACTA (ACTivity Analysis) is a general purpose finite state machine (FSM) description language for rapid prototyping of smart games. ACTA facilitates smart game design by intervention professionals who are not familiar with traditional programming languages. Professionals are able to model the game\u2019s logic and interaction using a straightforward and intuitive notation which can be customized for every different game. In order to support a customized scripting vocabulary, a reflection-oriented model was adopted allowing dynamic linking between ACTA generated rules and multiple data types. Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) is the \u201cglue layer\u201d connecting ACTA\u2019s scripting vocabulary with the application internals. Moreover, developers can use ACTA not only for developing event-driven sequential logic games, but also for applications of behavior composed of a finite number of states, transitions between those states and actions, as well as for applications based on rules driven workflows. As a case study illustrating the usefulness and benefits of ACTA, a body posture imitation game, called Mimesis game, was developed based on occupational therapy expertise and practice.",

Besides the talk about digital libraries, digital cameras, digital TVs (and virtually digital anything), and the experience of the same, the reality of the physical is still with us, is necessary, and is arguably here to stay. In the context of digital libraries, there is therefore a dire need to support the library user to fluidly, continuously or seamlessly: switch between the digital and physical fronts, interact with the digital and physical entities, and operate within the digital and physical settings. Among (or together with) possibly other choices, considering the adoption of mobile computing for that cause would not be a miscalculation.In the above framework, the MIMA project stems from the opportunity coming from the large availability of reliable connections through handheld mobile devices such as PDAs and smart phones and the vast amount of digital video streams daily produced. The trend suggests that one of the main challenges of the very next times will be the availability of tools and solutions that support effective real-time presentation of specialized live video content, like news or sport videos.",

Related user interface architectures, as well as a variety of related development method and tools, have also been elaborated. Admittedly, however, despite the recognized validity of the approach, which has been proved in practice in a series of prototype systems, the wider adoption and uptake of user interface adaptation approaches are still limited. One of the identified obstacles is the complexity intrinsic in designing such interfaces and the need of radically revising the current user interface design practice to account for (a) the alternative designs required for adaptation, (b) the parameters involved in driving adaptations (i.e., selecting among alternatives at a given point during interaction), and (c) the logic of adaptation at runtime.

            "Abstract": "Intelligent Conversational Agents are already employed in different scenarios, both in commerce and in research. In particular, they can play an important role in defining a new natural interaction paradigm between them and humans. When these Intelligent Agents take a human-like form (embodied Virtual Agents) in the virtual world, we refer to them as Virtual Humans. In this context, they can communicate with humans through storytelling, where the Virtual Human plays the role of a narrator and/or demonstrator, and the user can listen, as well as interact with the story. We propose that the behavior and actions of multiple, concurrently active Virtual Humans, can be the result of communication between them, based on a dynamic script, which resembles in structure a screenplay. This paper presents CasandRA, a framework enabling real-time user interaction with Virtual Humans, whose actions are based on this kind of scripts. CasandRA can be integrated in any Ambient Intelligence setting, and the Virtual Humans provide contextual information, assistance, and narration, accessible through various mobile devices, in Augmented Reality. Finally, they allow users to manipulate smart objects in AmI Environments.",

Many artists and painters use digital technology to augment their work creatively and technically. Many believe that the time of transition from traditional analogue art to postmodern digital art that is, to an art grounded in codes rather than images has arrived*. The research work described in this paper contributes towards supporting, through the use of Ambient Intelligence technologies, traditional painters\u2019 creativity, as well as methods and techniques of art masters. The paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of an intelligent environment and its software infrastructure, to form a digitally augmented Art Workshop. Its practical deployment was conducted in an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) simulation space and four feasibility studies were conducted. In each of these studies an oil painting was created following an alternative, yet accredited by artists, approach. The workshop was also evaluated with the involvement of real users and artists in the context of a user based usability study.",

            "Abstract": "User requirements elicitation is a fundamental phase of the development process of interactive product and services. This is evident in the principles of user-centered design (Norman and Draper, 1986), and has led to the development and practice of a wide variety of methods and techniques, mostly originating from the social sciences, psychology, organizational theory, creativity and arts, as well as from practical experience (Maguire and Bevan, 2002). Many of these techniques are based on the direct participation of users or user representatives in the process of formulating their own technological needs. However, the vast majority of available techniques has been developed with the \u201caverage\u201d able-bodied user and the working environment in mind.In universal access this precondition no longer holds, and, as pointed out in Chapter 1 of this handbook, the basic design principle of \u201cknowing the user\u201d becomes \u201cknowing the diversity of users.\u201d In this context, the issue of gathering and specifying user requirements needs to be revisited. First, the consideration of accessibility becomes of foremost importance to avoid exclusion from design. This is a difficult obstacle to overcome, because of the limited current experience of designers and developers in identifying and addressing accessibility issues and applying accessibility knowledge and guidelines in a user-oriented fashion (Zimmermann and Vanderheiden, 2008). Part II of this handbook provides an overview of the main accessibility issues related to various target user groups with disabilities.",

            "Publication url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16434",
            "Abstract": "Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has been established as the dominant paradigm for efficiently transferring skills from human teachers to robots. In this context, the Federated Learning (FL) conceptualization has very recently been introduced for developing large-scale human-robot collaborative environments, targeting to robustly address, among others, the critical challenges of multi-agent learning and long-term autonomy. In the current work, the latter scheme is further extended and enhanced, by designing and integrating a novel user profile formulation for providing a fine-grained representation of the exhibited human behavior, adopting a Deep Learning (DL)-based formalism. In particular, a hierarchically organized set of key information sources is considered, including: a) User attributes (e.g. demographic, anthropomorphic, educational, etc.), b) User state (e.g. fatigue detection, stress detection, emotion recognition, etc.) and c) Psychophysiological measurements (e.g. gaze, electrodermal activity, heart rate, etc.) related data. Then, a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and stacked autoencoders, with appropriately defined neural network architectures, is employed for the modelling step. The overall designed scheme enables both short- and long-term analysis/interpretation of the human behavior (as observed during the feedback capturing sessions), so as to adaptively adjust the importance of the collected feedback samples when aggregating information originating from the same and different human teachers, respectively.",

In general, smart environments users are expected to manage multiple places simultaneously (eg, residence, office, etc.) that incorporate a wide range of connected devices and artificial services, which they will have to monitor and control efficiently in a timely manner, regardless of their functional diversity. Despite, the abundance of mobile applications and frameworks that enable a user to control individual smart devices (eg, lights, locks, etc.), there is still the need for a unified interactive system that will aggregate them under a common roof and facilitate interaction through a simple, intuitive and consistent user interface. Therefore, the envisioned application aims to deliver a unified control center for the intelligent environment that focuses on enabling effective manipulation of a multitude of smart devices.",

Reports on how such systems perform in actual home environments with ever-changing parameters and conditions are scarce and so are reports on what to take into consideration when planning the implementation of such complex evaluations. This paper will discuss some of the challenges that were faced by the experiment team during the home trials of an autonomously moving social robotic system. ",

The present work, following a pervasive computing approach, proposes a framework to augment an educational environment, being a typical classroom or any studying environment. In this context, the work presented in this paper investigates unobtrusive interaction and support of active educational or studying activities through appropriate context-sensitive information. To this end, passive visual sensing is employed in order to unobtrusively perceive the current context and users\u2019 actions, thus providing novel ways to implement natural interaction. The suitability of the proposed interaction technologies and overall approach has been demonstrated through three interactive applications integrated in the framework, each one supporting different interaction \u2026",

Yet, the current uptake rates of the Web have not really reached their full potential, mainly due to the design of modern Web-based interfaces, which fail to satisfy the individual interaction needs of target users with different characteristics. A common practice in contemporary Web development is to deliver a single user interface design that meets the requirements of an \u201caverage\u201d user. However, this \u201caverage\u201d user is in fact an imaginary user. Often, the profiles of a large portion of the population, and especially people with disability, elderly people, novice users and users on the move, differ radically.

This paper presents first results of a study with an autonomous mobile social service robot prototype that was deployed in 18 private households of senior adults aged 75 years and older for a total of 371 days. Findings show that utility met the users' expectations. However, the robot was rather seen as a toy instead of being supportive for independent living. Furthermore, despite of an emergency function of the robot, perceived safety did not increase. Reasons for this might be the good health conditions of our users, a lack of technological robustness and slow performance of the prototype. However, users believed that a market ready version of the robot would be vital for supporting people who are more fragile and more socially isolated.",

UX denotes that interaction with a contemporary technological system goes far beyond usability, extending to one\u2019s emotions before, during, and after using the system and cannot be defined only by studying the fundamental usability attributes of effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. Measuring UX becomes a substantially more complicated endeavor when the interaction target is not just a technological system or application, but an entire intelligent environment and the systems contained therein. Motivated by the imminent need to assess, measure and quantify user experience in intelligent environments, this paper presents a methodological and conceptual framework that provides concrete guidance for UX research, design and evaluation, explaining which UX parameter should be measured, how, and when. An evaluation of the framework indicated that it can be valuable for researchers and practitioners, assisting them in planning, carrying out, and analyzing UX studies in a comprehensive and thorough manner, thus enhancing their understanding and improving the experiences they design for intelligent environments.

            "Abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things devices and services and their integration in everyday environments led to the emergence of intelligent offices, classrooms, conference, and meeting rooms that adhere to the paradigm of Ambient Intelligence. Usually, the type of activities performed in such environments (ie, presentations and lectures) can be enhanced by the use of large Interactive Boards that\u2014among others\u2014allow access to digital content, promote collaboration, enhance the process of exchanging ideas, and increase the engagement of the audience. Additionally, the board contents are expected to be plenty, in terms of quantity, and diverse, in terms of type (eg, textual data, pictorial data, multimedia, figures, and charts), which unavoidably makes their manipulation over a large display tiring and cumbersome, especially when the interaction lasts for a considerable amount of time (eg, during a class hour). Acknowledging both the shortcomings and potentials of Interactive Boards in intelligent conference rooms, meeting rooms, and classrooms, this work introduces a sophisticated framework named CognitOS Board, which takes advantage of (i) the intelligent facilities offered by the environment and (ii) the amenities offered by wall-to-wall displays, in order to enhance presentation-related activities. In this article, we describe the design process of CognitOS Board, elaborate on the available functionality, and discuss the results of a user-based evaluation study. View Full-Text",

Play development is part of the child\u2019s growth and maturation process since birth. As such, it is widely used in the context of Occupational Therapy (OT). Occupational therapists use activity analysis to shape play activities for therapeutic use and promote an environment where the child can approach various activities while playing. This paper builds on knowledge stemming from the processes and theories used in OT and activity analysis to present the design, implementation and deployment of a new version of the popular farm game as deployed within an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) simulation space. Within this space, an augmented interactive table and a three-dimensional avatar are employed to extend the purpose and objectives of the game, thus also expanding its applicability to the age group of preschool children from 3 to 6 years old. More importantly, through the environment, the game monitors and follows the progress of each young player, adapts accordingly and provides important information regarding the abilities and skills of the child and their development over time. The developed game was evaluated through a small scale study with children of the aforementioned age groups, their parents, and child care professionals. The outcomes of the evaluation were positive for all target groups and provided significant evidence regarding its potential to offer novel play experience to children, but also act as a valuable tool to child care professionals.",

            "Abstract": "While the body of research focusing on Intelligent Environments (IEs) programming by adults is steadily growing, informed insights about children as programmers of such environments are limited. Previous work already established that young children can learn programming basics. Yet, there is still a need to investigate whether this capability can be transferred in the context of IEs, since encouraging children to participate in the management of their intelligent surroundings can enhance responsibility, independence, and the spirit of cooperation. We performed a user study (N=15) with children aged 7-12, using a block-based, gamified AR spatial coding prototype allowing to manipulate smart artifacts in an Intelligent Living room. Our results validated that children understand and can indeed program IEs. Based on our findings, we contribute preliminary implications regarding the use of specific technologies and paradigms (e.g. AR, trigger-action programming) to inspire future systems that enable children to create enriching experiences in IEs.",

            "Abstract": "Modeling robot behavior is a common task in robot software development. However, its difficulty grows exponentially along with system complexity. To facilitate the development of a modular, rather than monolithic, behavior system, proper software tools need to be introduced. This paper proposes combination of a well-known finite state machine and a custom decision-making tool for implementing adaptive robot behaviors. The notion of automatic behavior adaptation reflects the capability of the robot to adapt during runtime based on the individual end-user, as well as the particular context of use, therefore delivering the most appropriate interaction experience. While each tool on its own can be used towards that aim, a unified approach that combines them simplifies the task at hand and distinguishes the roles of designers and programmers. To demonstrate the methods\u2019 applicability, a concrete example of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The increased importance of user-interface design methodologies, techniques, and tools in the context of the development and evolution of the Information Society has been widely recognized in recent years in the light of the profound impact that interactive technologies are progressively acquiring on individuals\u2019 lives and activities and of the difficulty in developing usable and attractive interactive products and services (eg, Winograd, 2001; Winograd, Bennett, De Young, & Hartfield, 1996). As the Information Society develops further, the issue of user-interface design becomes even more prominent when considering the notions of universal access (Stephanidis, 2001b) and universal usability (Shneiderman, 2000), aiming at the provision of access to anyone, from anywhere and at anytime, through a variety of computing platforms and devices, to diverse products and services. Design for Universal Access in the Information Society has been defined in recent research efforts as design for diversity (Stephanidis, 2001b), and methods, techniques, and codes of practice have been proposed that enable to proactively take into account and appropriately address diversity of users, contexts of use, and technological platforms in the design of interactive artifacts. One of the main concepts proposed in such a context is that of intelligent user-interface adaptation (Stephanidis, 2001b). In a Universal Access perspective, adaptation needs to be \u201cdesigned into\u201d the system rather than decided upon and implemented a posteriori, implying that the outcome of the design process is not a \u201csingular\u201d design but a design space populated with appropriate alternatives \u2026",
