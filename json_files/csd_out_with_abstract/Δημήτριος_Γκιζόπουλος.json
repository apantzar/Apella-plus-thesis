Thus far, software-based self-test approaches presented in the literature have focused almost exclusively on uniprocessors. With the continuing prevalence of multiprocessors, the focus of such research approaches moves from the uniprocessor to the multiprocessor case. In this paper, we study the application of software-based self-testing on symmetric shared-memory multiprocessors (SMP) considering the most common interconnection architectures, shared bus and crossbar switch. We focus on the impact of the shared-memory system architecture, the cache coherence \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Modern microprocessors suffer from increased error rates that come along with fabrication technology scaling. Processor designs continuously become more prone to hardware faults that lead to execution errors and system failures, which raise the requirement of protection mechanisms. However, error mitigation strategies have to be applied diligently, as they impose significant power, area, and performance overheads. Early and accurate reliability estimation of a microprocessor design is essential in order to determine the most vulnerable hardware structures and the most efficient protection schemes. One of the most commonly used techniques for reliability estimation is Architecturally Correct Execution (ACE) analysis.ACE analysis can be applied at different abstraction models, including microarchitecture and RTL and often requires a single or few simulations to report the Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Supply voltage scaling is one of the most effective techniques to reduce the power consumption of microprocessors. However, technology limitations such as aging and process variability enforce microprocessor designers to apply pessimistic voltage guardbands to guarantee correct operation in the field for any foreseeable workload. This worst-case design practice makes energy efficiency hard to scale with technology evolution. Improving energy-efficiency requires the identification of the chip design margins through time-consuming and comprehensive characterization of its operational limits. Such a characterization of state-of-the-art multi-core CPUs fabricated in aggressive technologies is a multi-parameter process, which requires statistically significant information. In this paper, we present an automated framework to support system-level voltage and frequency scaling characterization of Applied Micro's state-of-the-art ARMv8-based multicore CPUs used in the X-Gene 2 micro-server family. The fully automated framework can provide fine-grained information of the system's state by monitoring any abnormal behavior that may occur during reduced supply voltage conditions. We also propose a new metric to quantify the behavior of a microprocessor when it operates beyond nominal conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate potential uses of the characterization framework to identify the limits of operation for improved energy efficiency.",

BIST schemes are typically classified into two categories: off-line and on-line. Input vector monitoring concurrent BIST schemes are a class of on-line techniques that circumvent the problems appearing separately in on-line and in off-line BIST. The utilization of input vector monitoring concurrent BIST techniques provides the capability to perform testing at different stages, manufacturing, periodic off-line and concurrent online. The input vector monitoring concurrent BIST schemes proposed so far have targeted either exhaustive or pseudorandom testing separately. In this paper a novel input vector monitoring concurrent BIST scheme based on a pre-computed test set is presented. The proposed scheme can perform both concurrent on-line and off-line testing; therefore it can be equally well utilized for manufacturing and concurrent on-line testing in the field. The applicability of the scheme is validated with respect to the hardware overhead and the time required for completion of the test in benchmark circuits. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first to be presented in the open literature based on a pre-computed test set that can perform both concurrent on line and off-line testing.",

            "Abstract": "Embedded Processor-Based Self-Test is a guide to self-testing strategies for embedded processors. Embedded processors are regularly used today in most System-on-Chips (SoCs). Testing of microprocessors and embedded processors has always been a challenge because most traditional testing techniques fail when applied to them. This is due to the complex sequential structure of processor architectures, which consists of high performance datapath units and sophisticated control logic for performance optimization. Structured Design-for-Testability (DfT) and hardware-based self-testing techniques, which usually have a non-trivial impact on a circuit\u2019s performance, size and power, can not be applied without serious consideration and careful incorporation into the processor design. Embedded Processor-Based Self-Test shows how the powerful embedded functionality that processors offer can be utilized as a self-testing resource. Through a discussion of different strategies the book emphasizes on the emerging area of Software-Based Self-Testing (SBST). SBST is based on the idea of execution of embedded software programs to perform self-testing of the processor itself and its surrounding blocks in the SoC. SBST is a low-cost strategy in terms of overhead (area, speed, power), development effort and test application cost, as it is applied using low-cost, low-speed test equipment. Embedded Processor-Based Self-Test can be used by designers, DfT engineers, test practitioners, researchers and students working on digital testing, and in particular processor and SoC test. This book sets the framework for comparisons among different SBST \u2026",

We focus on fault tolerance at the architectural level, and especially on fault-tolerance approaches, which are based on chip self-diagnosis and self-reconfiguration. We study test and reconfiguration methodologies in massively defective nanoscale devices, either at fine granularity field programmable devices or at coarse granularity multi-core arrays. In particular, we address the important question of up to which point could future chips have self-organizing fault-tolerance mechanisms to autonomously ensure their own dependable operation. In the case of FPGAs, we present known fault tolerant approaches \u2026",

In this paper, we analyze the testability problems and present scalable test generation for FP units using as a demonstration vehicle the popular, high-speed, two-path architecture of the most complex unit, the FP adder.

Technology scaling along with low voltage operation exacerbates the likelihood and rate of hard (permanent) faults in technologies used by prefetchers such as SRAM and flip flop arrays. Faulty prefetch behavior does not affect correctness but can be detrimental to performance. Hard faults in data prefetchers (unlike their soft counterparts which are rare) can cause significant single-thread performance degradation and lead to large performance variability across otherwise identical cores. In this paper, we characterize in-depth both of these aspects in microprocessors suffering from multiple hard faults in their data prefetcher components.

They are exploited to investigate the probability of input errors to alter both the correct behavior and the output of the program.

The first BIST architecture aims to resolve the test invalidation problem to the larger possible extent, while the second one aims to test cost reduction. Both BIST architectures achieve very high sequential fault coverage and impose moderate hardware and delay overhead. Simplified variations of the two BIST architectures are also presented for the non-recoded signed array multipliers. Thus, the proposed BIST architectures offer a universal BIST solution that covers the totality of signed array multipliers: non-recoded and recoded.",

The continuous urge of high performance has led designers to integrate highly sophisticated predictors with complex prediction algorithms and large storage requirements. As a result, BPUs in modern microprocessors consume large amounts of power. But when a system is under a limited power budget, critical decisions are required in order to achieve an equilibrium point between the BPU and the rest of the microprocessor. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the effects of low voltage configuration Branch Prediction Units (BPU).

Architectural self-organization results from the conjunction of self-diagnosis and self-disconnection mechanisms (to identify and isolate most permanently faulty or inaccessible cores and routers), plus self-discovery of routes to maintain the communication in the array. In the methodology presented in this work, chip self-diagnosis is performed in three steps, following an ascending order of complexity: interconnects are tested first, then routers through mutual test, and cores in the last step. The mutual testing of routers is especially important as faulty routers are disconnected by good ones with no assumption on the behavior of defective elements. Moreover, the disconnection of faulty routers is not physical (\u201chard\u201d) but logical (\u201csoft\u201d) in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Microprocessor design, debug, and validation research and development are increasingly based on modeling and simulation at different abstraction layers. Microarchitecture-level simulators have become the most commonly used tools for performance evaluation, due to their high simulation throughput, compared to lower levels of abstraction, but usually come at the cost of loss of hardware accuracy. As a result, the implementation, speed, and accuracy of microarchitectural simulators are becoming more and more crucial for researchers and microprocessor architects. One of the most critical aspects of a microarchitectural simulator is its ability to accurately express design standards as various aspects of the microarchitecture change during design refinement. On the other hand, modern microprocessor models rely on dedicated hardware implementations, making the design space exploration a time-consuming process that can be performed using a variety of methods, ranging from high-level models to hardware prototyping. Therefore, the tradeoff between simulation speed and accuracy, can be significantly varied, and an application's performance measurements uncertain. In this paper, we present a microarchitecture-level simulation modeling study, which enables as accurate as possible performance modeling of a RISC-V out-of-order superscalar microprocessor core. By diligently adjusting several important microarchitectural parameters of the widely used gem5 simulator, we investigate the challenges of accurate performance modeling on microarchitecture-level simulation compared to accuracy and low simulation throughput of RTL \u2026",

In addition, we characterize the variation of 'weak' DRAM cells in terms of their retention time across 72 DRAM chips and evaluate the error mitigation efficacy of the available error-correcting codes in case of operation under aggressively relaxed refresh periods. Finally, we show the overall energy savings that could be achieved by shaving the adopted guardbands in the cores and memories using various applications. Our characterization results show the potential to obtain up-to 38.8% energy savings in \u2026",

Nowadays, on-line testing is essential for modern microprocessors to detect latent defects that either escaped manufacturing testing or appear during system operation. Moreover, many-core scaling is now facing the \u201cpower wall\u201d. More cores can now be placed on a chip than can be concurrently operating due to energy/power limitations. Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) is a flexible and low-cost solution for on-line March test application and defect detection in small memories, such as L1 caches, that lack Memory Built-In Self-Test (MBIST) hardware. In this paper, a power-aware optimization of the SBST methodology introduced in [10] is presented targeting Ll caches by analyzing the unique characteristics of March SBST routines and possible power \u2026",

In this paper, we study the feasibility of building a low-cost fault-tolerant approach for FPGA-based realtime systems that combines checkpointing and scrubbing, the latter for both fault detection and repair. We calculate the checkpoint frequencies that guarantee the execution of the tasks within their deadlines in the presence of transient faults, taking into consideration the scrubbing time of the FPGA processor.

Two alternatives are proposed depending on whether the target is low energy dissipation during a BIST session or low power dissipation (i.e. average energy dissipation between successive test vectors). The proposed BIST schemes are more efficient than pseudorandom BIST for the same high fault coverage target. Up to 78.33% energy saving is achieved by the proposed low energy BIST scheme and up to 82.22% power saving is achieved by the proposed low power BIST scheme, compared with pseudorandom BIST.",

            "Abstract": "The explosive growth of Internet-connected devices will result in a flood of generated data, which will increase the demand for network bandwidth as well as compute power to process the generated data. Consequently, there is a need for more energy efficient servers to empower traditional centralized (Cloud) data-centers as well as emerging decentralized data-centers at the Edges of the Internet. In this paper, we present our approach, which aims at developing a new class of micro-servers\u2013the UniServer-that exceed the conservative energy and performance scaling boundaries by introducing novel mechanisms at all layers of the design stack. The main idea lies on the realization of the intrinsic hardware heterogeneity and the development of mechanisms that will automatically expose the unique varying capabilities of each hardware component and allow their operation at new extended operating points. Low overhead schemes are employed to monitor and predict the hardware behavior and report it to the system software, which is responsible for optimizing the system operation in terms of energy or performance, while guaranteeing non-disruptive operation under extended operating points. To efficiently manage any potential fault that may incur under extended margins, we aim at identifying critical/vulnerable software structures and developing low cost techniques for protecting them. This eventually, allows us to enhance the fault tolerance of the overall system software that is representative of any state of the art cloud data-center, since it adopts a virtualization environment as well as popular resource management packages.

            "Abstract": "Cross-layer reliability is becoming the preferred solution when reliability is a concern in the design of a microprocessor-based system. Nevertheless, deciding how to distribute the error management across the different layers of the system is a very complex task that requires the support of dedicated frameworks for cross-layer reliability analysis. This paper proposes SyRA, a system-level cross-layer early reliability analysis framework for radiation induced soft errors in memory arrays of microprocessor-based systems. The framework exploits a multi-level hybrid Bayesian model to describe the target system and takes advantage of Bayesian inference to estimate different reliability metrics. SyRA implements several mechanisms and features to deal with the complexity of realistic models and implements a complete tool-chain that scales efficiently with the complexity of the system. The simulation time is significantly \u2026",

Since such structures (accumulators whose inputs are driven by barrel shifters) are commonly found in current, high-speed signal processing VLSI circuits, the presented schema provides a practical solution for the built-in testing of such circuits for testing delay and stuck-open faults.

Modern SoCs usually integrate (one or more) CPUs and (one or more) accelerators, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays).

Chips containing manufacturing defects are potentially malfunctioning chips that may cause system crashes and lead to financial deficit, environmental disaster, and/or jeopardize human life. Moreover, if manufacturing defects are not detected early, the cost of repair is increased by an order of magnitude at each step after the chip fabrication line. It comes naturally that chip testing is an important factor of the business in computer and communications industries, since customers demand reliable products at a reasonable cost and manufacturers, in order to stay competitive in business, must find the means to provide the best products at the lowest cost.",

According to our test methodology, the testability conditions guide test generation process. The identified test conditions are independent of the internal structure and the size of the components.

Multiprocessors and multithreaded architectures are constantly becoming the typical general-purpose computing paradigm, and thus the various existing uniprocessor functional self-testing schemes must be adopted and adjusted to meet the testing requirements of complex multiprocessors. A major challenge in porting a functional self-testing approach from the uniprocessor to the multiprocessor case is to take advantage of the inherent execution parallelism offered by the multiple cores and the multiple threads in order to reduce test execution time.

Small memories, such as L1 caches and translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) are not usually equipped with memory built-in self-test (MBIST) hardware. Software-based self-test (SBST) is a flexible and low-cost solution for on-line March test application and error detection in such small memories. Although, L1 caches and TLBs are small components, their reliable operation is crucial for the system performance due to the large penalties caused when L1 cache or TLB misses occur.

The effective utilization of these architectures poses several challenges, among which a primary one is power consumption. Voltage reduction is one of the most efficient methods to reduce power consumption of a chip. With the galloping adoption of hardware accelerators (i.e., GPUs and FPGAs) in large datacenters and other large-scale computing infrastructures, a comprehensive evaluation of the safe voltage reduction levels for each different chip can be employed for efficient reduction of the total power. We present a survey of recent studies in voltage margins reduction at the system level for modern CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. The pessimistic voltage \u2026",

For such applications, periodic on-line testing of the WSN nodes is an important step towards correctness of operation. However, on-line testing of processors integrated in WSN nodes has to address the additional challenge of minimum energy consumption, because these devices operate on battery, which usually cannot be replaced and in the absence of catastrophic failures determines the lifetime of the system. In this paper initially we derive analytically the optimal way for executing on-line periodic test with adjustable period, taking into account the degrading behavior of the system due to silicon aging effects but also the limited energy budget of WSN applications.

Such strategies are well suited to embedded systems that do not require immediate detection of errors and cannot afford the well-known hardware, information, software, or time-redundancy mechanisms. We first identify the stringent characteristics of a SBST program to be suitable for on-line periodic testing. Also, we study the probability for a SBST program to detect permanent and intermittent faults during on-line periodic testing.

Thus far, SBST approaches have focused almost exclusively on the functional (programmer visible) components of the processor. In this paper, we analyze the challenges involved in testing an important component of modern processors, namely, the pipelining logic, and propose a systematic SBST methodology to address them.

            "Abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is the need to build resilient systems. Resilience is an especially difficult challenge in HPC, in which tightly coupled compute jobs typically execute across a large number of nodes for several hours or even days. Without effective provisions for resilience, in hardware and/or software, a single failure in one node or server typically causes a domino effect, resulting in the termination of the whole job. Such job termination normally results in no useful outcome, so the node hours that have already been expended on the job are wasted. Recently, the most common use of supercomputers and HPC systems are applications that solve large-scale real-world simulation problems [1, 2, 3]. Such applications, implemented as workflows or multi-scale systems are inherently fault-tolerant and have error-containment capabilities that eliminate the domino effects caused by failures. However, failure in a node executing a distributed thread leads to contained error recovery, which translates into decreased performance and throughput.System reliability is also an important limiter on the ability to scale to larger systems. This is because increasing the number of nodes causes the overheads of error containment and error recovery to increase exponentially. Reliability is therefore an important requirement and challenge for exascale, as recognized by the HPC strategic research agendas of the European Technology Platform for High Performance Computing (ETP4HPC)[4, 5, 6], Eurolab4HPC [7], the US Department of Energy [8, 9, 10, 11] and the US National laboratories [12, 13].",

Such increased variability causes otherwise-identical nanoscale circuits to exhibit different performance or power-consumption behaviors, even though they are designed using the same processes and architectures and manufactured using the same exact production lines.

Fault injection in microarchitectural models of the processor, on the other hand, provides deep insights on faults propagation through the entire system stack, including the operating system. Combining beam experiments and fault injection data can deliver deep insights about the devices expected reliability when deployed in the field.

This results in a higher resistance that manifests as intermittent delays. Over time, the high-resistance in interconnects can become permanent opens.\u25a0 The variation in layer thickness can also result in adjacent or crossing conductor signals, which cause intermittent contacts. This can, over time, turn into permanent shorts.The third fault type is transient faults, also known as soft errors. They typically occur because of temporary environmental conditions. Possible causes of transient faults are neutron and alpha particles; power supply and interconnect noise; electromagnetic interference; and electrostatic discharge. Trends in nanometer technologies are having a very negative impact on reliability because of shrinking geometries, lower power voltages, and higher frequencies. This is increasing process variation and manufacturing residuals, and, as a result, increasing the likelihood of intermittent faults. The same smaller transistors and lower voltages result in higher sensitivity to alpha particles and neutrons, thus causing significantly higher rates of particle-induced transient faults. Smaller interconnect features, causing the Miller effect, and higher performances, causing the skin effect, result in a higher number of transient timing errors. Finally, the increased coupling capacitance between adjacent conductors causes higher crosstalk noise and results in crosstalk-induced transient delays. Given these nanometer trends, conventional techniques for improving yield and screening for reliability failures face serious limitations. For instance, the effectiveness \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The share of silicon debug in the overall microprocessor chips development cycle is rapidly expanding due to the ever growing design complexity and the limited efficiency of pre-silicon validation methods. Massive application of short random test programs on the prototype microprocessor chips is one of the most effective parts of silicon debug. However, a major bottleneck and source of\" noise\" in this phase is that large numbers of random test programs fail due to the same or similar design bugs. This redundant behavior adds long delays in the debug flow since each failing random program must be separately examined, although it does not usually bring new debug information. The development of effective techniques that detect dominant modes of failure among random programs and triage them into common categories eliminate redundant debug sessions and significantly boost silicon debug.",

Reliability studies have proposed a plethora of methodologies for assessing system vulnerability which, however, highly rely on traditional reliability metrics that solely express failure rate over time. Although Failures In Time (FIT) is a very strong and representative reliability metric, it may fail to offer an objective comparison of highly diverse systems, such as CPUs against GPUs or other accelerators that are often employed to execute the same algorithms implemented for these platforms. In this paper, we propose a reliability evaluation methodology that takes into account the probability of a workload execution failure in order to compare heterogeneous systems, while we also capture the differences in the performance of these systems.

Dependability-the trustworthiness of a computing system which allows reliance to be justifiably placed on the service it delivers-has always been a key aspect of computer architecture and has been extensively investigated since the first days of computing. Traditionally, dependable computer architectures are utilized in high-end computing systems or computing systems for critical applications, where continuous, uninterrupted operation is among the most important requirements and systems are characterized by high reliability, availability, and maintainability (wellknown measures to quantify dependability). The time has now come for the wealth of concepts and methodologies in the field of dependable (also known as fault-tolerant) computer architecture that have been proposed during the last several decades, to be adopted and extended in mainstream, general-purpose computing systems. Dependable operation of computing systems is a mandatory requirement in virtually all application fields (at lower or higher costs), due to the increasing reliance of everyday human activities on computers or microprocessor-based systems in general. Unfortunately, this ubiquitous computing revolution comes in hand with hard-tosolve technological issues that are closely related to dependable operation of a computing system. Integrated circuits are implemented today in miniaturized and inherently unreliable technologies that render circuits more vulnerable to both temporary disturbances leading to transient (or soft) errors and to permanent (or hard \u2026",

This is achieved by taking advantage of the regularity of multiplier modules and achieving very high fault coverage by a linearsized test set with as small as possible input switching activity. The proposed BIST scheme is more efficient than pseudorandom BIST for the same high fault coverage target.

Detection of bugs in the address translation subsystem of a microprocessor is much less straightforward than other hardware blocks because the address translation is an implicit process, which does not have an easily observable output to architecture or program visible locations. Validation of the correctness of the address translation mechanisms (ATMs) of microprocessors is both very important and challenging problem. In this paper, we present an ISA-independent methodology for the post-silicon validation of the ATMs in modern microprocessors.

More specifically, we demonstrate how the existing FSM hardware can be reused for computing the convolutional code keys and we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing hardware reusability. Additionally we extend the proposed methodology to detect errors that only affect the output logic but not the next state of the FSM, and which are not detected by the previously proposed methodology.",

However, a dramatic change in microprocessor's reliability is also expected. Developing mechanisms for early and accurate reliability estimation will save significant design effort, resources and consequently will positively impact product's time-to-market (TTM). In this paper, we propose a versatile architecture-level fault injection framework, built on top of a state-of-the-art x86 microprocessor simulator, for thorough and fast characterization of a wide range of hardware components with respect to various fault models.",

Whatever is the considered scenario, all this incredible progress has been relying on the assumption that the devices can be depended on in their application and for their purposes. The foundations for this assumption are based on a constant work behind the scenes of the technical and scientific community aimed at enhancing the dependability of the devices.Dependability is a broad term that summarizes several aspects of a system, which typically include availability, reliability, maintainability, safety, and security.

Permanent hardware faults in such components lead to performance fluctuation (not necessarily degradation) but do not produce functional errors. This fact has been identified previously but neither an accurate classification of the behavior of permanent faults in these components over a set of CPU benchmarks nor detailed measurements of the magnitude of their performance impact has been reported. Depending on such measurements the performance-related components of microprocessors can be disabled in fine or coarse granularities, salvaging the microprocessor functionality although at different performance levels.

The combined execution of the micro-viruses takes very short time compared to regular programs execution, and can quickly reveal the voltage limits of the cores and chips at voltage levels below nominal. The micro-virus based characterization flow requires orders of magnitude shorter time while it delivers virtually identical: (a) Vmin values for the different CPU chips, and (b) Vmin values for the different cores within a CPU chip.

Intermittent faults constitute the largest part of reliability failures that are manifested in the field during the semiconductor product operation. Since software-based self-test (SBST) has been proposed as an effective strategy for on-line testing of processors integrated in non-safety critical low-cost embedded system applications, optimal test period specification is becoming increasingly challenging. In this paper we first introduce a reliability analysis for optimal periodic testing of intermittent faults that minimizes the test cost incurred based on a two-state Markov model for the probabilistic modeling of intermittent faults. Then, we present for the first time an enhanced SBST strategy for on-line testing of complex pipelined embedded processors. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal \u2026",

ASG is implemented in hardware utilising an accumulator whose inputs are driven by a barrel shifter. Since such structures (accumulators whose inputs are driven by barrel shifters) are commonly found in current, high-speed signal processing VLSI circuits, the presented schema provides a practical solution for the built-in testing of such circuits for testing delay and stuck-open faults. Utilisation of ASG to applying SIC pairs to adjacent pairs of inputs of the CUT, resulting in pseudoexhaustive schemes, is also addressed.",

Accurately measuring the impact on system reliability of any change in the technology, circuits, microarchitecture and software is most of the time a multi-team multi-objective problem and reliability must be traded off against other crucial design attributes (or objectives) such as power, performance and cost. Unfortunately, tools and models for cross-layer reliability analysis are still at their early stages compared to other very mature design tools and this represents a major issue for mainstream applications. This paper presents preliminary information on a cross-layer framework built on top of a Bayesian model designed to perform component-based reliability analysis of complex systems.",
