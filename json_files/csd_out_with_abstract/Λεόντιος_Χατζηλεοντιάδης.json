A visual-attention task, consisting of bottom-up (visual pop-out) and top-down (visual search) conditions during stimuli of four triangles, i.e., a target and three distractors, was engaged. In pop-out condition, both color and orientation of the distractors differed from target, while in search condition they differed only in orientation. During the task, high-density EEG (256 channels) data were recorded and analyzed by means of behavioral, event-related potentials, i.e., the P300 component and brain source localization analysis using 3D-Vector Field Tomography (3D-VFT). Twenty subjects (half female; 32\u00b14.7 years old) participated in the experiments, performing 60 trials for each condition. Behavioral analysis revealed that both female and male outperformed in the pop-out condition \u2026",

The scheme was applied to proteins of known structure extracted by public available databases and statistical analysis followed in order to reveal possible patterns in the sequence of TMs within a protein.

The dynamic behaviour of a cantilever beam with a breathing crack under harmonic excitation is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A simple single-degree-of-freedom system with varying stiffness is employed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the beam. The time-varying stiffness is modelled using a simple periodic function. Both simulated and experimental response data are analysed by applying empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert transform and the instantaneous frequency of each oscillatory mode is obtained. It is shown that the instantaneous frequency oscillates between frequencies corresponding to the open and closed states revealing the breathing of the crack. The variation of the instantaneous frequency increases with increasing crack \u2026",

From an alternative perspective, smartphone interaction behavioral data, unobtrusively acquired in a non-clinical setting, can assist the screening and monitoring of MCI and its symptoms\u2019 progression. In this vein, the diagnostic ability of digital biomarkers, drawn from Fine Motor Impairment (FMI)- and Spontaneous Written Speech (SWS)-related data analysis, are examined here. In particular, keystroke dynamics derived from touchscreen typing activities, using Convolutional Neural Networks, along with linguistic features of SWS through Natural Language Processing (NLP), were used to distinguish amongst MCI patients and healthy controls (HC). Analytically, three indices of FMI (rigidity, bradykinesia and alternate finger tapping) and nine NLP features, related with lexical richness, grammatical, syntactical complexity and word deficits, formed the feature space. The proposed approach was tested on two demographically matched groups of 11 MCI patients and 12 HC, having undergone the same neuropsychological tests, producing 4930 typing sessions and 78 short texts, within 6 months, for analysis. A cascaded-classifier scheme was realized under three different feature combinations and validated via a Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation scheme. The acquired results have shown: a) keystroke features with a k-NN classifier achieved an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.68-0.88 \u2026",

The signals were recorded from 99 normal pregnant women in a singleton pregnancy at gestational ages from 28 to 40 weeks, before the onset of labor. There were 56 female fetuses and 43 male. Main results: Analysis of FHR shows that the means as well as measures of irregularity of FHR, such as approximate entropy and algorithmic complexity, decrease as gestation progresses. There were also indications that mutual information and multiscale entropy were lower in male fetuses in early pregnancy. Significance: Fetal age and gender seem to influence FHR tracings.

In this vein, the localization of neuronal generators of event-related potential (ERP) components, that is, the mismatch negativity and the P300, based on high-density electroencephalogram data, was explored as a means to enhance their sensitivity as markers of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). A 2-tone oddball experiment was conducted, involving 21 healthy elderly, 21 mild cognitive impairment, and 21 mild AD patients, while high-density electroencephalogram data were recorded. The results revealed longer latencies of both mismatch negativity and P300 and slower and far less accurate responses as neurodegeneration progressed. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography revealed that source differences between healthy and mild \u2026",

These cultural expressions are usually transmitted orally and/or using gestures and are modified over a period of time, through a process of collective recreation. As the world becomes more interconnected and many different cultures come into contact, local communities run the risk of losing important elements of their ICH, while young people find it difficult to maintain the connection with the cultural heritage treasured by their elders. In this paper, we present a novel holistic approach for the safeguarding and transmission of ICH that goes beyond the mere digitization of ICH content. Based on multisensory technology for the capturing of ICH, the proposed approach enables the generation of completely novel cultural content.

A simple single-degree-of freedom lumped system is employed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the beam. The time varying stiffness is modelled using a simple periodic function. Both simulated and experimental response data are analysed by applying empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert transform and the instantaneous frequency (IF) is obtained. It is shown that the IF oscillates between the frequencies corresponding to open and closed states revealing the physical process of crack breathing. The variation of the IF follows definite trends and therefore can be used as an indicator of the crack size. It allows an efficient and \u2026",

The proposed approach was applied to three-channel (Fp1, Fp2, and F3/F4 10/20 sites) EEG recordings drawn from 16 healthy right-handed subjects. For the evaluation of the efficiency of the AsI, an extensive classification process was conducted using two feature-vector extraction techniques and a SVM classifier for six different classification scenarios in the valence/arousal space.

An important challenge would be to provide flexible solutions, where intelligent models could contribute, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modelling, e.g., via Fuzzy Logic (FL). This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This work proposes the FCM-QoI model, consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of two dance \u2026",

While early treatment can produce significant benefits for patients, the mildness of many early signs combined with the lack of accessible high-frequency monitoring tools may delay clinical diagnosis. To meet this need, user interaction data from consumer technologies have recently been exploited towards unsupervised screening for PD symptoms in daily life. Similarly, this work proposes a method for detecting fine motor skills decline in early PD patients via analysis of patterns emerging from finger interaction with touchscreen smartphones during natural typing. Our approach relies on low-/higher-order statistical features of keystrokes timing and pressure variables, computed from short typing sessions.

Feature estimation also accounts for physiological parameters that relate to EEG frequency bands, reference states, time intervals, and hemispheric asymmetries.

Experimental results, when applying the proposed method to pre-classified ECG data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Beth Israel Hospital (MIT/BIH) ECG database, prove that the proposed method exhibits over 99% of detectability, even when the ECG data are contaminated with noise.

The VAM method is based on the effect of modulation of high-frequency acoustic waves by a low-frequency vibration. The intensity of the modulation is related to the severity of the damage and has been used so far as a damage index. The damage index simply based on the amplitude of the first side bands in the spectral domain often leads to controversial results about the severity of the damage.  In this work, the nonlinear characteristics of the vibro-modulation were systematically investigated by employing time-frequency analysis based on the Zhao-Atlas-Marks (ZAM) distribution. The results of the analysis show that the amplitude of the sideband components is modulated by the low frequency vibration and the modulation amplitude depends on the size of the crack. Based on the obtained results, a new damage index was defined in relation to the strength of the modulation. The new damage index is more sensitive and robust and correlates better with crack size compared to the index based on the amplitude of the sidebands.",

            "Abstract": "A method for crack detection in beams by time-frequency analysis of flexural waves is described. Two different time-frequency representations, namely the continuous wavelet transform and the smoothed pseudo-Wigner distribution are employed. Simulated and measured flexural waves in a cracked beam are analysed and both the location and size of the crack are accurately determined. The location of the crack is estimated using the arrival time of reflected waves with different group velocities. The ratio of the reflected wave energy to the incident wave one is calculated and used as an indicator of the crack size. Wave experiments in a slender brass beam are in good agreement with predictions verifying the efficiency of the method. In view of the results obtained, the advantages and shortcomings of the time-frequency representations employed are presented and discussed.",

Two widely used QRS detection algorithms based on digital filtering (DF) are compared with a newly introduced one, based on higher-order statistics (HOS). The percentage of QRS complexes failed detection along with the number of false positives and false negatives are measured for quantitative performance evaluation. Experimental results, when applying the proposed methods to nocturnal ECG recordings from the Sleep Laboratory of the Philipps University of Marburg, Germany, prove that the HOS-based QRS detector exhibits higher overall QRS detection accuracy (99.95%) than the two DF-based ones (99.75% and 99.59%, respectively). Moreover, it has lower noise susceptibility despite the presence of different noise types, such as smooth or abrupt baseline drift \u2026",

Five parameters were obtained, two from the time domain (turns and zero crossings per second), two from the frequency domain (median frequency and total power per second) and one from the bi-frequency domain (bispectrum peak amplitude). The KNN classifier with the leave-one-out method was used for classification whereas the Self Organising Feature Maps (SOFM) was used for cluster analysis and visualization of the group separation.

Analysis of the experimental results, when applying the KD to EBS recorded from patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction, justify an efficient performance of the KD to outwit the noise presence by accurately extracting the authentic structure of EBS. Since the KD removes the undesired signal from the EBS recordings, it can easily be used for data-volume reduction when long-term recordings are employed, e.g., in sleep laboratories, intensive care units, homecare telemedical devices. Due to its simplicity, the KD can be implemented in a real-time context and can be used for continuous EBS screening.",

In order to facilitate the understanding of the learning context and curricula organization of the both courses, the MindMup tool from the i-Treasures Pedagogical Planner (www. itreasures. eu) is employed. The results presented can inspire LMS administrators to include the measure of QoI and reflect upon issues like system-quality, system-use and user-satisfaction into their current evaluation techniques of LMS based b-learning systems efficiency.",

Mining of LMS users\u2019 data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies \u2026",

The method is applied to the simulated fundamental vibration mode of a simply supported rectangular plate containing a crack parallel to one of its edges of arbitrary length, depth and location. The analyzed spatial response by exhibiting abrupt changes at the site of the crack allows for an accurate determination of the location and length of the crack. Additionally, the dependence of both the maximum value and the energy of the estimated fractal dimension on crack depth provide a quantitative means for the estimation of the depth of the crack. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated using various examples for plates, concerning the depth, length and position of the crack. Finally, the sensitivity of the method to additive random signal noise is systematically investigated using a noise \u2026",

Structural techniques are now routinely used to report cortical atrophic rates in aging and particularly within the context of the Alzheimer's disease, and may be integrated with functional techniques which examine the functional characteristics of the cortex at rest and during the performance of a task. Despite advancing age cognitive function remains highly plastic, allowing for interventions that aim to maintain or even remediate its capacity and the mechanisms by which structure and function are altered among seniors. Overall, information on the integrity of the cerebral structure and function aid in the early detection and treatment of the Alzheimer's disease as well as the evaluation and track of the disease's progression.

In this article, the authors describe the mapping of peers\u2019 collaborative contributions for turn-taking sequences, which, in turn, are transformed to symbol-sequences and analysed for pattern extraction. The use of a normalised complexity measure, when applied to collaborative data from the field of environmental engineering, reveals peers\u2019 tendencies to more complex turn-taking patterns when they receive appropriate feedback. The efficiency and simplicity of the proposed complexity analysis in pattern identification makes it useful for tracking non-stationarities in peers\u2019 collaborative activity.",

In this study, analysis of fetal phonocardiograph signals (fPCG), in order to achieve fetal heartbeat segmentation, is proposed. The proposed approach (namely WT-FD) is a Wavelet Transform (WT)-based method that combines Fractal Dimension (FD) analysis in the WT domain for the extraction of fHSs from the underlying noise. Its adoption in this field stems from its successful use in the fields of lung and bowel sounds de-noising analysis. The efficiency of the WT-FD method in fHS extraction has been evaluated with 19 simulated fHS signals, created for the present study, with additive noise up to (3dB), along with the Simulated Fetal PCGs database available at PhysioBank. Results have shown promising performance in the identification of the correct location and morphology of the fHSs, reaching an overall accuracy of 89% justifying the efficacy of the method. The WT-FD approach effectively extracts the fHS signals from the noisy background, paving the way for testing it in real fHSs and clearly contributing to better evaluation of the fetal heart functionality.",

The i-Treasures integrated platform is conceived to support both traditional learning approaches and innovative and active learning processes, based on extensive use of sensor-technologies. In this light, during the development process, particular attention has been devoted to the definition of requirements with specific reference to sensor-mediated Human Computer Interaction (HCI) issues and the evaluation process was designed accordingly, in coherence with the specific advanced features of the integrated platform. The paper offers a view of the complexity of the design of ICT-based tools supporting the preservation and transmission of ICH and also provides an insight (and this could have a broader impact) into the methodology adopted to harmonize the requirements and the evaluation phases which are key pillars for the construction of any educationally effective ICT-based learning system.",

The overall estimation errors for the crack location and length are found equal to 0 and 0.0673, respectively.

To this purpose, sixteen features are extracted from the sEMG signal acquired from the user's forearm, and evaluated by the Mahalanobis distance criterion. Discriminant analysis is used to reduce the number of features used in the classification of the signed ASL gestures. The proposed features are tested against noise resulting in a further reduced set of features, which are evaluated for their discriminant ability. The classification results reveal that 97.7% of the inspected ASL gestures were correctly recognized using sEMG-based features, providing a promising solution to the automatic ASL gesture recognition problem",

The proposed WHOS-based feature space extends the relative power spectrum-based (phase blind) approaches reported so far a step forward; this is realized via dynamic monitoring of the nonlinerities of the EEG brain response to tonic cold pain stimuli by capturing the change in the underlying quadratic phase coupling at the bifrequency wavelet bispectrum/bicoherence domain due to the change of the pain level. Three pain characterization scenarios were formed and experimentally tested involving WHOS-based analysis of EEG data, acquired from 17 healthy volunteers that were subjected to trials of tonic cold pain stimuli.

However, the foremost disadvantage of this technological breakthrough is the time consuming task of reviewing the vast amount of images produced. To address this, a novel technique for distinguishing pathogenic endoscopic images related to ulcer, the most common disease of GT, is presented here. Towards this direction, the Bidimensional Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition was applied to RGB color images of the small bowel acquired by a WCE system in order to extract their Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs).

            "Abstract": "Anovel technique for denoising explosive lung sounds (ELSs), such as fine/coarse crackles and squawks (SQs), is presented here. A combination of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and fractal dimension (FD) analysis is proposed to form a denoising EMD-FD filter. The latter decomposes the data into a number of intrinsic mode functions and automatically selects their important and unimportant portions, which lead to the estimation of the denoised ELS signal and the background noise, respectively. Experimental results prove efficient performance of the EMD-FD filter (mean detectability 98.4%; sensitivity 98.1%; specificity 97.7%) in sustaining both time location and structural characteristics of ELS. Lung sounds facilitate the noninvasive diagnosis of pulmonary diseases, since the acoustic energy generated by breathing is highly associated with the relevant pulmonary dysfunction [1],[2]. One of the major issues that attracts attention in the field of lung sound research is the accurate detection of lung sounds, such as ELSs. This is due to the nonstationary nature of ELSs given that they behave as transient signals of a short time duration superimposed on the underlying vesicular sound.The most common types of ELSs are crackles and SQs [1],[2], with crackles being further categorized to fine crackles (FCs) and coarse crackles (CCs), according to their time-and frequency-domain features [3],[4]. In particular, FCs are exclusively inspiratory high-pitched events met in mid to late inspiration with repetitive, pattern-like behavior over subsequent breaths [5].

By using wavelet-based maximum entropy on the mean (wMEM), task-specific EEG channels are selected to predict right hand and right foot sensorimotor tasks, employing spatial pattern analysis with and without covariance estimation regularization. EEG from five healthy individuals (Dataset IVa, BCI Competition III) were evaluated by a cross-subject paradigm. Prediction performance was evaluated via a two-layer feed-forward neural network, where the classifier was trained and tested by data from two subjects independently. The highest mean prediction accuracy achieved by using subject-pair (ay-al) specific selected EEG channels was on average (90:36+/-5:59) and outperformed that achieved by using all available channels (83:21+/-12:26). Significant improvements in performance suggest a role of wMEM for channel selection in BCI. Spatially projected cortical sources may be useful for capturing inter-subject associative sensorimotor brain dynamics and pave the way towards subject-independent BCI.",

In this vein, there are six key elements that can help to understanding the concept of gamification, namely: i) perception of play; ii) clear rules; iii) concrete objectives and intermediate goals; iv) group dynamics; v) motivation with rewards; and vi) continuing the challenge (Marcus, 2013).

Beyond their importance in daily life and perception of the world, they play crucial role in knowledge acquisition as well. For instance, medicine was one of the first domains where the conceptual tools of rationality and empiricism were combined with techniques of investigation to make the human body an object of knowledge (Foucault, 1973). In this context, the techniques mentioned above are based on the application of senses in order to acquire medical knowledge. More precisely, vision and hearing became specific objects of knowledge over the course of the 19th century, supplemented through technique and technology. Thus, seeing and hearing are to be understood as fundamentally and absolutely different modes of not only knowing the world, but also reaching a medical diagnosis.A branch of medicine closely associated with one of these techniques, namely visual inspection, is gastroenterology. In the field of gastroenterology, vision is widely understood as the fundamental mode of knowing the state of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The advent of medical imaging technologies, such as radiography (in the wider sense), tomography and especially endoscopy, promoted this thesis (Lorenz et al., 1993; Rutgeerts et al., 1980) by enabling the visual examination without demanding to gain physical access. In case of visual inspection, as in case of auscultation, there are specific properties observed in order to assess the image content, no matter how simple or sophisticated the imaging technology is.

This paper proposes an enhancement of this type of processing, known as temporal feature integration, by employing and testing alternative deployable strategies. Specifically, data are fitted through commonly used statistical principles, estimating the parameters of a given probability density function that maximize the log-likelihood of the samples inside each texture window. The main statistical model that is set under investigation is the alpha-stable distribution because it can successfully represent signals, which the commonly used Gaussian curves fail to capture. Within this framework, the enhanced feature integration method is also elaborated, introducing new measures for feature modeling. The main objective of this \u2026",

An EEG data set, formed by the responses of nine subjects during music listening, along with self-reported ratings of liking and familiarity, is used. Features are extracted from the beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-49 Hz) EEG bands in time windows of various lengths, by employing three TF distributions (spectrogram, Hilbert-Huang spectrum, and Zhao-Atlas-Marks transform). Subsequently, two classifiers (k-NN and SVM) are used to classify feature vectors in two categories, i.e., \"like\u00e2 and \"dislike,\u00e2 under three cases of familiarity, i.e., regardless of familiarity (LD), familiar music (LDF), and unfamiliar music (LDUF).

The required QoI (both for teachers and students) is estimated by adopting a fuzzy logic-based modeling approach, namely FuzzyQoI, applied to LMS Moodle data from two academic teaching of dance disciplines, including rare and contemporary dances, respectively. The latter are used as paradigms that comply with the educational scenarios of the i-Treasures project (www. i-treasures. eu), which refers to the intangible cultural heritage. Based on documental analysis, the pedagogical design strategies per semester were transcribed to concept maps and the dynamically (per week) estimated QoIs were presented as feedback to the teachers at the end of the first semester, so they could reflect and update their pedagogical planning, anticipating more enhanced QoI at the second one. The results presented here show the beneficial role of QoI to shift the educational scenarios and strategies towards a more dynamic design, yet taking into consideration the inherent tendencies and attitudes of the users\u2019 interaction within the blearning context.",

Doppler ultrasound signals (DUS), which is commonly used for monitoring the fetal heart rate, can also be used for identifying the event timing of fetal cardiac valve motions. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive technique to identify the fetal cardiac timing events on the basis of analysis of fetal DUS (5 normal subjects, in both early and late gestational ages). We proposed using the swarm decomposition technique which enabled the frequency contents of the Doppler signals to be linked to the opening and closing of the heart's valves (aortic and mitral). In the early gestational age, the time intervals from R peak of fetal ECG to opening and closing of aortic valve were found to be 59.4\u00b11.9 ms and 218.8\u00b12.4 ms respectively and in the late gestational age 65.4\u00b110 ms and 218.1 \u00b13.4 ms \u2026",

The fundamental vibration mode of the cracked cantilever beam is analyzed and both the location and size of the crack are estimated. The location of the crack is determined by the abrupt changes in the spatial variation of the analyzed response, while the size of the crack is related to the estimate of kurtosis. The proposed prediction method was validated by experiments on cracked Plexiglas beams. The influence of added noise on the estimation accuracy of the method has been investigated. Compared to existing methods for crack detection, the proposed kurtosis-based prediction scheme is attractive due to low computational complexity and inherent robustness against noise.",

Prior to the lacunarity analysis, wavelet-based denoising of DBS is employed to eliminate effects of the vesicular sound (background noise) to DBS oscillatory pattern.

Then, texture information is extracted by analyzing the intrinsic second/higher-order correlation of the original image and by calculating the lacunarity index of the refined image.

            "Abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FoG) is a movement disorder that mostly appears in the late stages of Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD). It causes incapability of walking, despite the PD patient\u2019s intention, resulting in loss of coordination that increases the risk of falls and injuries and severely affects the PD patient\u2019s quality of life. Stress, emotional stimulus, and multitasking have been encountered to be associated with the appearance of FoG episodes, while the patient\u2019s functionality and self-confidence are constantly deteriorating. This study suggests a non-invasive method for detecting FoG episodes, by analyzing inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. Specifically, accelerometer and gyroscope data from 11 PD subjects, as captured from a single wrist-worn IMU sensor during continuous walking, are processed via Deep Learning for window-based detection of the FoG events. The proposed approach, namely DeepFoG, was evaluated in \u2026",

In order to create a BCI system, a signal processing method is required to extract features upon which the discrimination is based. In this article, the Empirical Mode Decomposition along with the Hilbert-Huang Spectrum (HHS) is found to contain the necessary information to be considered as an input to a discriminator. Also, since the HHS defines amplitude and instantaneous frequency for each sample, it can be used for an online BCI system. Experimental results when the HHS applied to EEG signals from an on-line database (BCI Competition III) show the potentiality of the proposed analysis to capture the imagined motor activity, contributing to a more enhanced BCI performance.",

In particular, the WT-FD filter incorporates the WT-based multiresolution decomposition to initially decompose the recorded bioacoustic signal into approximation and detail space in the WT domain. Next, the FD of the derived WT coefficients is estimated within a sliding window and used to infer where the thresholding of the WT coefficients has to happen. This is achieved through a self-adjusted procedure that iteratively \"peels\" the estimated FD signal and isolates its peaks produced by the WT coefficients corresponding to ELS or EBS \u2026",

Previous works on estimating fetal heart rate variability from doppler ultrasound (DUS) signal mainly through autocorrelation analysis showed low accuracy when compared with heart rate variability computed from fetal ECG (fECG). In this work, we proposed a method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the kurtosis statistics to estimate fetal heart rate and its variability from DUS. Comparison between estimated beat-to-beat intervals using the proposed method and the autocorrelation function (AF) with respect to RR intervals computed from fECG as the ground truth was done on DUS signals from 44 pregnant mothers in the early (20 cases) and late (24 cases) gestational weeks. The new EMD-kurtosis method showed significant lower error in estimating the number of beats in the early group (EMD-kurtosis: 2.2% vs. AF: 8.5%, p<0.01, root mean squared error) and the late group (EMD-kurtosis: 2.9% vs. AF: 6.2%). The EMD-kurtosis method was also found to be better in estimating mean beat-to-beat with an average difference of 1.6 ms from true mean RR compared to 19.3 ms by using the AF method. However, the EMD-kurtosis performed worse than AF in estimating SNDD and RMSSD. The proposed EMD-kurtosis method is more robust than AF in low signal-to-noise ratio cases and can be used in a hybrid system to estimate beat-to-beat intervals from DUS. Further analysis to reduce the estimated beat-to-beat variability from the EMD-kurtosis method is needed.",

However, despite achieving acceptable results, they have been only applied on either small or homogeneous data-sets. A study was developed herein to identify cardiac arrhythmias from varied-length 12-lead ECG signals obtained from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020 and acquired from a wide set of sources. Our team, Care4MyHeart, developed an approach that starts by analyzing the labels of the database. Then, applying various signal processing techniques to denoise the 12-lead signals. After that a beat-by-beat segmentation procedure was followed to identify the most significant beats in exhibiting the arrhythmia within the signals. A CNN+BiLSTM model was then trained and evaluated on the training set using 10-fold cross-validation scheme as well as on \u2026",

The only precondition to the system solution, that corresponds to a discretized inversion of the Ray transform, is the known location and values of a limited number of boundary points. The method is accompanied by a theoretical analysis on the regularization achieved and the errors introduced.

Four-channel fPCG sensors made of low cost (34 weeks of gestation). A novel multi-lag covariance matrix-based eigenvalue decomposition technique was used to separate maternal breathing, fetal heart sounds (fHS) and maternal heart sounds (mHS) from abdominal phonogram signals. Prior to the fHR estimation, the fPCG signals were denoised using a multi-resolution wavelet-based filter. The proposed source separation technique was first tested in separating sources from synthetically mixed signals and then on raw abdominal phonogram signals. fHR signals extracted from fPCG signals were validated using simultaneous recorded CTG-based fHR recordings.The experimental results have shown that the fHR derived from the acquired fPCG can be used to detect periods of acceleration and deceleration, which are critical indication of the fetus' well-being. Moreover, a comparative analysis demonstrated that fHRs from CTG and fPCG signals were in good agreement (Bland Altman plot has mean = -0.21 BPM and +,-2SD = +,-3) with statistical significance (p<0.001 and Spearman correlation coefficient rho=0.95). The study findings show that fHR estimated from fPCG could be a reliable substitute for fHR from the CTG, opening up the possibility of a low cost monitoring tool for fetal well-being.",

Effective Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) can significantly improve mortality and morbidity rates, leading to longer independent living and a reduced use of healthcare resources. The proposed project, namely Care4MyHeart, sets as an overall goal to introduce a personalized home-based CR program, enabling lifestyle behavioral change towards increased quality of life, surpassing the currently unsustainable provision of healthcare for CVD. In particular, the Care4MyHeart-Pesronalized Serious Game (C4MH-PSG) platform targets CVD patients entering Phase III, as this is where large numbers of patients, who would benefit significantly from exercise and CR, drop out. C4MH-PSG supports the key predictors for attendance to CR Phase III programs, including high program availability, ease of access to program \u2026",

Based on recent bibliography, various approaches result in efficient P-phase identification, while S- phase identification is still an open problem, since there is an overlap of the S- phase arrival and the P- phase coda. They usually employ simple energy ratio criteria, the linear seismic wave polarity assumption, neural networks or heuristic methods based on seismologists' experience, but they seem to have moderate performance, especially for noisy cases. The proposed method uses a Wavelet Transform-based filtering technique that separates the STationary from the NonSTationary parts of a mixed signal, namely the WTST-NST filter, combined with Higher-Order Statistics (HOS).

To address this, a novel technique for discriminating abnormal endoscopic images related to ulcer, the most common disease of GT, is presented here. Towards this direction, the Bidimensional Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEEMD) was applied to images of the small bowel acquired by a WCE system in order to extract their Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs).

            "Abstract": "BackgroundAlthough EEG-based emotional responses to music have been studied extensively, little research has been conducted for the discrimination of music appraisal judgments. In the psychology-based literature music appraisal is mainly interpreted in terms of affective experiences, such as emotional resonance, aesthetic awe and thrill (Kone\u010dni, 2005; Schubert, 2007; Evans & Schubert, 2008). In the field of neurophysiology, EEG-based evidence of brain activation due to emotion-evocative music is mainly reported. Altenm\u00fcller, Schurmann, Lim, and Parlitz (2002) found that pleasant music causes left frontal brain activation, while unpleasant music causes right and slightly bilateral frontal activation. Similar evidence has been produced by the study of Schmidt and Trainor (2001). Another EEG-based study showed that consonant (pleasant) music causes greater midline brain activity compared to dissonant (unpleasant) music (Slammer, Grigutsch, Fritz, & Koelsch, 2007). As far as EEG-based emotion recognition is concerned, Lin et al.(2010) achieved an accuracy of 82.29\u00b13.06% for the classification of distinct emotions due to music listening, using spectrogram-based feature extraction and support vector machines (SVM). However, the aforementioned electrophysiological evidence arises from the listening of positively/negatively valenced music that cannot be directly mapped to liked/disliked music. For instance, depending on the listeners\u2019 mood, sad-sounding musical excerpts can be occasionally preferred instead of happy-sounding ones. In general, evidence of brain activity related to emotional responses is reported in the majority of \u2026",

EEG data were acquired from an experiment targeting the elicitation of four emotions using affective sounds. Features were computed for each electrode individually and tested in terms of classification using the k-nearest neighbors classifier. Results show that the valence of affective states can be recognized effectively, when the arousal level is specified. Moreover, an above chance level classification accuracy was achieved using a single electrode for the four affective states recognition. Both FD and HOC performed similarly, while the best classification rates were achieved from frontal electrode locations.",

There is also the additional need for software for the rapid determination of earthquake parameters for high-seismicity areas.",

All coronary artery disease (CAD) 24-hour circadian heart rate data were fitted by a cosinor analysis algorithm. Hourly HRV features from time- and frequency-domains were then extracted from all 24-hour patient data. A one-way ANOVA test was performed followed by a Tukey post-hoc multiple comparison test to investigate the differences among the three groups.

            "Abstract": "Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a novel technology that allows direct noninvasive visualization of the entire small intestine. CE permits a detailed examination in the ambulatory setting, allowing identification of clinically relevant lesions, and it is appealing to both patients and providers. In this context, advanced image processing analysis could facilitate the physician to come up with a diagnosis, providing him/her with the appropriate classification indicators. Towards this direction, in this work, the Bidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) was applied to small intestine images generated by a CE system (i.e., the Pillcam SB capsule) to extract their Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). The latter could be used as a new classification domain, as they reflect different modes included in the original signal and related to the underlined pathology. BEMD is more advantageous compared to other techniques \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Early diagnosis of the cardiac abnormalities during the pregnancy may reduce the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Doppler ultrasound signals (DUS), which is commonly used for monitoring the fetal heart rate, can also be used for identifying the event timings of fetal cardiac valve motions. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive technique to identify the fetal cardiac timing events on the basis of analysis of fetal DUS (10 normal subjects and 6 abnormal subjects). We proposed using the cepstrum analysis which enabled the frequency contents of the Doppler signals to be linked to the opening and closing of the heart's valves (Aortic and mitral). The time intervals from R peak of fetal ECG to opening and closing of aortic valve were found to be 123.83\u00b17.41 (msec) and 222.85\u00b121.21 (msec), respectively. The time intervals from R peak to opening and closing of mitral valve were found to be 295.03\u00b113.62 (msec \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 in Europe and the subsequent failure of national healthcare systems to sufficiently respond to the fast spread of the pandemic , extensive statistical analysis and accurate forecasting of the epidemic in local communities is of primary importance in order to better organize the social and healthcare interventions and determine the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. For this purpose, a novel combination of Monte Carlo simulations, wavelet analysis and least squares optimization is applied to a known basis of SEIR compartmental models , resulting in the development of a novel class of stochastic epidemiological models with promising short and medium-range forecasting performance. The models are calibrated with the epidemiological data of Greece, while data from Switzerland and Germany are used as a supplementary background. The developed models are capable of estimating parameters of primary importance such as the reproduction number and the real magnitude of the infection in Greece. A clear demonstration of how the social distancing interventions managed to promptly restrict the epidemic growth in the country is included. The stochastic models are also able to generate robust 30-day and 60-day forecast scenarios in terms of new cases, deaths, active cases and recoveries.",

The results revealed alterations in the amplitude of N170 and the localization of areas with maximum neural activation.

            "Abstract": "The main target of the study was to merge, modify and expand various earthquake data processing software in a single unified processing utility. For this reason, the database system of DATASCOPE (Colorado Univ.) was employed as the basic RDBMS for the seismological data, using the CSS 3.0 schema file for the data manipulation. Additional software to create and check the appropriate tables of the database was implemented. For the waveform processing the Matseis software (Sandia Labs.) was used (based on the MATLAB commercial software) and appropriate interface between DATASCOPE to Matseis was implemented. All developed algorithms were implemented through the interface of Matseis and MATLAB. Expansions and modifications include an overview window of the waveform data, auto phase pickers, easy phase evaluation/characterisation, calculation of earthquake parameters (using HypoellipseY2K) and focal mechanisms (using FPFIT). A significant effort was devoted to the automatic P-and S-phase identification. The finally proposed method uses a wavelet transform-based filtering technique, the WTST-NST filter, combined with High Order Statistics (HOS). The method was applied to real seismic data recorded in Greece from a local experiment. The resulting P-and S-phases indicate that the proposed algorithms provide high identification accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "Because of its practical importance, crack detection in structures has been a subject of intensive investigation during the last three decades. Among the techniques developed for crack detection, vibration based techniques have been widely employed since they offer a fast and inexpensive means for crack identification [1].A crack in a structure induces a local flexibility, which affects the dynamic behaviour of the structure to a considerable degree. It results in reduction of natural frequencies and changes in mode shapes. Therefore, it is possible to predict the location and size of a crack by measuring these changes in these vibration parameters [2, 3, 4, 5]. Despite the progress achieved, the main problem with crack detection based on linear vibration analysis is the lack of sensitivity to the presence of small cracks. A beam with a fatigue crack is an inherently nonlinear system. Several works studied the problem of beams with breathing cracks by employing different approaches with no emphasis, however, on crack detection [6, 7, 8]. Its basic nonlinear characteristic is the generation of harmonics under harmonic excitation. First applications of nonlinear detection techniques considered the evaluation of higher harmonics [9]. The accurate measurements of harmonics, however, require great effort to minimize the nonlinear distortion of the measuring setup. When two frequencies are used simultaneously as excitation, response components at frequencies equal to the sum and difference of the excitation frequencies are generated. The possibility of crack detection by exploiting this characteristic feature was proposed in Reference [10]. This study \u2026",

Towards that, we have created a user interface in order to elicit effective states through an imitation procedure. Recent brain imaging experiments have shown that two regions of the brain (inferior frontal cortex and superior parietal lobe) are active even when a person performs an action or s/he observes the same action be done by another individual. In accordance with those findings, we try to trigger the Mirror Neuron System, which is responsible for this behavior, by showing pictures with faces expressing different emotions. The user\u2019s response is reflected in the acquired electroencephalograms (EEGs), which, after processing with higher-order crossings, are used for classification and identification of any emotional \u2026",

For some children, however, auditory process disorders (APDs) act as a barrier to the comprehension of the sound elements, like rhythmic motives, variations, etc. The effect of APD in music perception is often neglected within classroom activities. This paper tries to shed light upon this effect, by focusing on duration comprehension. Experimental results from APD testing in pupils (9-12 yrs) from three Greek primary schools show that age influences the duration pattern sequence perception. Moreover, sensitivity in spatial sound information is increased in the age of 10 yrs. These results initiate some implications for ICT-based approach in music education that would foster adaptation to pupilspsila special needs during the educational process.",

            "Abstract": "Perinatal morbidity and mortality can be reduced when any cardiac abnormalities during a pregnancy are diagnosed early. Doppler ultrasound signals (DUS) are often used to monitor the heart rate of a fetus and they can also be used to identify the timing events of fetal cardiac valve motions. This paper proposed a novel, noninvasive technique which can be used to identify the fetal cardiac timing events based upon the analysis of fetal DUS (based upon 66 normal subjects belonging to three differing age groups) which can later be used to estimate fetal cardiac intervals from a DUS signal. The foundation of this method is a novel decomposition method referred to as Swarm Decomposition (SWD) which makes it possible for the frequency contents of Doppler signals to be associated with cardiac valve motions. These motions include the opening (o) and closing (c) of Aortic (A) and Mitral (M) valves. When compared to the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), SWD results achieve a higher accuracy when isolating the constituent parts of analyzed DUS signals. Pulsed Doppler images are used in order to verify the estimated timings. Three fetal age groups were assessed in terms of their cardiac intervals: 16-29, 30-35, and 36-41 weeks. The proposed method was used to estimate the following fetal cardiac intervals: Systolic Time Interval (STI), Isovolumic Relaxation Time (IRT), Pre-ejection Period (PEP), and Ventricular Ejection Time (VET). The evaluation of fetal cardiac performance can be enhanced, given that these findings can be leveraged as sensitive markers throughout the process.",

Since it cannot be cured, treatment options focus on the improvement of PD symptoms. In fact, evidence suggests that early PD intervention has the potential to slow down symptom progression and improve the general quality of life in the long term. However, the initial motor symptoms are usually very subtle and, as a result, patients seek medical assistance only when their condition has substantially deteriorated; thus, missing the opportunity for an improved clinical outcome. This situation highlights the need for accessible tools that can screen for early motor PD symptoms and alert individuals to act accordingly.

The tatum represents the shortest durational value in music that is not just an accidental phenomenon (Bilmes 1993). The tactus period is the most perceptually prominent period, and is the period at which most humans would tap their feet in time with the music (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983). The measure period is often related to the rate of harmonic change or the length of a repeated rhythmic pattern. This article deals with the estimation of the tempo at the tactus level.

            "Abstract": "Human-computer interaction requires efficient acquisition of the relevant information from the user. This poses high accuracy in the performance of the relevant systems, especially when visual information is used as the basic means to capture the user's information. At the same time, speed and efficiency under a variety of conditions (e.g, resolution, luminance) is required. From this perspective, a new approach in the automated iris and gaze detection problem is presented here, using the chrominance of low resolution webcam data. The algorithms developed, when combined with a face tracker, exhibit high performance, circumventing the variability of the lighting conditions and/or user's facial characteristics.",

This expansion is a direct result of the advantageous properties of HOS, which make them favorable in problems where nonGaussianity, nonminimum phase, colored noise, or nonlinearities are important and must be accounted for. To this end, HOS have been applied to the design of advanced communications, sonar, radar, speech, biomedical, geophysical, and imaging systems. The purpose of the present study is to review the main aspects of the application of HOS in the biomedical engineering field by presenting biomedical application problems that can directly benefit from the use of HOS, in order to aid the reader in grasping the utility of HOS\u2010based techniques within the biomedical signal processing \u2026",

Despite their biological and medical significance only a small portion, less than 1%, of transmembrane (TM) proteins have a well determined 3-dimensional structure. A number of algorithms designed to identify TM helices in the primary amino acid sequence have been developed. Here, a novel computational approach for the problem of secondary structure prediction in TM proteins with a single TM segment is proposed, by applying the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the hydrophobic sequence of the protein. The normalised energy of the resulting signal across all scales of analysis is scanned for continuity allowing for the accurate detection of a single TM segment within the protein sequence. The prediction of both starting and ending point of the TM within the sequence is performed by means of edge detection of the \u2026",

From this perspective, the learner's emotional state is interweaved with the structural elements of his/her learning functioning (both internal and external) when placed within an educational setting. The advent of new technological achievements in the accurate acquisition of the learner's affective state allows for the redesign of the ICT-based educational settings, taking into account a bilateral approach of the learner's system that involves both cognitive and emotional processes, as reflected in the Valence/Arousal space. Justification of the crucial role of learner's affective state in the design of an ICT-based educational setting is provided with the implications derived from an experimental case-study, referring to emotional responses to IADS-based sound stimuli presented to three age-dependent learner-groups. The proposed affective parameters define an enriched BT that could serve as a basis for structuring a new model, closer to the pragmatic nature of the learner's system.",

To this end, a musicological analysis was conducted on these particular sonatas and referential patterns in these works of Beethoven were defined. Appropriate interactive questionnaires were designed in order to create a statistical normative rating that describes the emotional status when an individual listens to these musical excerpts. Based on these ratings, it is possible for emotional annotations for these same referential patterns to be created and integrated into the music score.",

In addition, Higher Order Crossings (HOCs) analysis was employed for feature extraction realization from the HAF-filtered signals. The introduced HAF-HOC scheme incorporated four different classification methods to accomplish a robust emotion recognition performance.

The accurate and fast detection of sleep apnea stages is of great importance for patients' recovery and treatment. A criterion for the diagnosis of such respiratory disorder based on the characteristics of the heart-rate variability signal in the wavelet packets domain is presented. Preclassified data of 20 apneic patients and 20 controls drawn from two international databases were subjected to analysis. Experimental results show that a wavelet packet-based measure can be formed for noninvasive diagnosis of sleep apnea. This was justified in all cases of apneic patients where all apneic episodes were accurately identified. The technique is rather simple and could be easily used for prescreening apneic patients in sleep laboratories and intensive care units.",

CMs are considered effective as teaching and learning tools that assist the development of conceptual knowledge, allowing visual observation of relationships and connections between multiple areas and pieces of information (Novak & Gowin, 1984). Moreover, the ability to recognize connections between different pieces of information or aspects of a problem facilitates problem-based learning (PBL) (Schaal, 2010). The latter assists the development of higher-order thinking skills, helping students to become independent, self-directed learners who \u2026",

In this study a method is proposed for the discrimination between proteins with single and multiple transmembrane segments, combining chemical and statistical features of the proteins with higher-order statistics and morphological analysis for protein categorisation. The method was tested on human proteins, extracted from public available databases and the results have shown an efficiency of the proposed algorithm to correctly classify the sequences under study into two classes, for a wide range of transmembrane segment lengths. This paves the way for a more efficient analysis of transmembrane proteins taking into account the individual features and patterns occurring within proteins with single and multiple transmembrane segments.",

Two recordings from eminent flutists [Kuijken (flute traverso); Rampal (modern flute)] provided the audio data.

The most commonly used is the RGB colour space, since most high-quality cameras used in computer vision systems provide RGB signals, for example endoscopic capsule cameras. This work describes a computer vision algorithm intended to assist the physician in the diagnosis of endoscopic diseases, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, using a colour space rotation-based method. This algorithm modifies the images RGB representation channels in such way that the bleeding information can be effectively enhanced in a single channel. Tests in endoscopic images were performed and results have shown that the proposed colour-based rotation approach successfully increases the detection of bleeding regions in endoscopic images, corroborating the usefulness in physician diagnosis assistance.",

Visual information is the basis for most navigational tasks, so visually impaired individuals are at disadvantage because appropriate information about the surrounding environment is not available. With the recent advances in inclusive technology it is possible to extend the support given to people with visual impairment during their mobility. In this context we propose a system, named SmartVision, whose global objective is to give blind users the ability to move around in unfamiliar environments, whether indoor or outdoor, through a user friendly interface. This paper is focused mainly in the development of the computer vision module of the SmartVision system.",

Therefore, studying emotions in the context of social interactions requires a novel dataset, and K-EmoCon is such a multimodal dataset with comprehensive annotations of continuous emotions during naturalistic conversations. The dataset contains multimodal measurements, including audiovisual recordings, EEG, and peripheral physiological signals, acquired with off-the-shelf devices from 16 sessions of approximately 10-minute long paired debates on a social issue.
