A specially developed Spectral Imaging system was used for the in vivo spectral imaging and analysis of the tissue and for the measurement, as a function of both time and location, of the acetic acid-induced alterations in the tissue scattering properties. Modeling and fitting of the experimental data result in the calculation of the kinetic constants of the marker-tissue interaction process, and spatil distribution of whcih is visualized with the aid of a pseudocolor scale.

Synchronized spectral scanning and image storing enables the collection of a stack of calibrated spectral images, from which a fully resolved spectrum per image pixel can be calculated and displayed. We also present results from a pilot use of the developed HySI system as a research tool, in an attempt to develop novel, non-invasive diagnostic methods for the detection and grading of cervical precancers and of pigmented skin lesions. In the case of cervical diagnosis we have succeeded to detect in vivo, quantitatively assess and map alterations in tissue structure and functionality, associated with progress of the disease, with high sensitivity and specificity. In the case of pigmented skin areas, near infrared spectral analysis and imaging of melanin-rich spots show that they become transparent at certain imaging wavelengths and that the transparency wavelength increases with the melanin content and the lesion\u2019s depth. This information can be used for the in vivo quantitative assessment of the later, which is considered to be of great diagnostic and predictive value.",

After application of ALA, in situ conversion to endogenous porphyrins is accomplished in a gradual manner. Therefore, the determination of fluorescence kinetics and spatial distribution in vivo versus time is a crucial point for the success of ALA-PDT. Seventeen basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and 20 actinic keratoses (AK) were enrolled in this study. In 5 BCC and 4 AK, in vivo fluorescence kinetics were performed over 24 hrs and for the remaining lesions between 2 and 7 hrs after ALA application. In vivo spatial and quantitative detection of the fluorescence intensity versus time showed considerable variations among tumors of the same type, so light irradiation was performed according to patient individualities.

The colposcopy impression and DySIS values were compared with consensus histology reports of biopsies. Subjects were recruited to a training group and subsequently to a test group.

In the proposed paper a new efficient technique is presented, appropriate for registering images, which are translated and rotated versions of a reference image. The technique consists of two main parts: an efficiently implemented prewhitening part and an iterative part, which yields the unknown displacements after a few iterations. The most costly part of the algorithm (ie cross-correlation computations) is performed efficiently via a new scheme based on a proper partitioning of the images and the use of the FFT. The new registration technique exhibits a superior performance compared to the conventional cross-correlation method. The new technique has been successfully applied in a visual diagnostic method for detecting, in vivo, epithelial dysplasias and malignancies.",

We present an integrated system combining a Hyperspectral Camera system (HyCam), with spectral classification algorithms, developed for the in vivo and objective discrimination between non dysplastic, dysplastic nevi and melanomas. A melanoma animal model was developed in order to monitor the process of melanoma development. Reference spectra were collected from normal skin areas, which were compared with the spectra obtained from the lesions using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm. A pseoudocolor map was created with different colors representing various degrees of similarity between test and reference spectra. The system's predictions ware validated with biopsy/histology.

Estimations were based on experimental data obtained from dynamic contrast-enhanced optical imaging of cervix, in vivo. We have developed a pharmacokinetic, in silico, model of the optical tracer's uptake by the epithelium. We have identified that the kinetic parameters of the model correlate well with pathologic alterations in both metabolic and structural characteristics of the tissue, associated with the neoplasia progress. Global sensitivity analysis and global optimization methods were employed for identifying the key determinant set of biological parameters that dictate the model's output. Particularly, the shuffled complex evolution algorithm converged to a set of four parameters that can be estimated with an error of 7 \u2026",

In this study the distinction between normal lymphocytes and lymphoblasts of childhood ALL is proposed using their spectral characteristics. The method has been based upon the analysis and classification of optical absorption characteristics of the bone marrow cells. Spectral microscopy system is capable of capturing a great number of narrow-band images, in the wide spectral range of the optical spectrum. The analysis showed statistically significant difference (P<0.0001) between normal lymphocytes and lymphoblasts as far as it concerns the detection, identification and mapping of their \u2026",

The biophysical basis of the AcetoWhitening (AW) phenomenon and the exploitation of its optical characteristics for assessing, in-vivo, functional and structural characteristics of the abnormal cervical epithelium utilizing an advanced colposcope, are presented. Towards the quantitative assessment of the AW optical effect in different CIN stages, we developed a biophysical model for the epithelial transport pathways of dilute Acetic Acid (AA) solution in the cervical stratified epithelium. Model predictions for various neoplasia grades confirmed the validity of the model. The dynamic optical characteristics of the AW effect are found to be strongly correlated with functional (extracellular acidity) and structural (extracellular space and abnormal layer number) parameters. This highlights the potential of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a novel algorithmic scheme for self-organizing data, adopting an recursive-mode k-means clustering approach. The proposed methodology attempts to refine and improve the clustering result by sequentially updating centers on the basis of their present and previous positions, exploiting both prior expert knowledge and posterior data information from the statistical distribution of the examined population. The performance of the implemented algorithm is evaluated on Dynamic Imaging data from cervical tissue, examining numerous sample curves representing the temporal response of tissue areas under the aceto-whitening effect. In comparison to the performance of classical k-means approach, the preliminary results of this study indicate the outperformance of the proposed iterative scheme. The primary benefit is attributed to the center improvement strategy against the center \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Two issues of great interest in the field of lasers in artwork conservation are the so-called yellowing effect and the discoloration of pigments. We have viewed these issues from a comprehensive point of view, considering all our present experimental results as well as ongoing modeling and theoretical calculations. The first concern to be discussed is the yellowing effect in laser cleaning of marble or stone artifacts. Although, in most cases, a yellowish layer exists underneath the black encrustation, the so-called \u2018patina\u2019, it has become clear that there are situations where yellowing cannot be attributed to an existing layer. In the present study, a light scattering model that may account for the yellowing is presented. This model considers a thin absorbent layer and the surface roughness and/or created voids and accounts for the reflectance spectra measured by (i) hyper-spectral imaging and (ii) integrating sphere \u2026",
