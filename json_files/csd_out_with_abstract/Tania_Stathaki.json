In this letter, the authors propose a sequential blind signal extraction algorithm that attempts to identify smooth sources in instantaneous mixtures. The approach incorporates smoothness constraints in the traditional negentropy cost function to extract smooth components, using an approximate second-order optimization method",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we propose a fast head-shoulder detector as a means to facilitating faster pedestrian detection. The proposed approach is based on the observation that human head-shoulder regions share relatively robust features. The purpose is to address the problem of high computational speed of the deformable part model (DPM) detector by selecting candidate regions with higher likelihood to contain pedestrians. The proposed head-shoulder detector is based on the simple, yet effective normed gradient features. Head-shoulder detector outputs regions which are strong candidates for the presence of pedestrians and therefore, pedestrian detection processes are performed only within these regions, avoiding exhaustive sliding window search across the entire test image. Additionally, a two-pedestrian detector is applied to reinforce the detection accuracy especially in scenarios where pedestrians are close to \u2026",

The available images have been acquired from different sensors (multisensor scenario) or they are of the same type but exhibit different types of distortion, as for example blurring (multi-focus scenario). Our aim is to create from these images a single image Y which will be perceptually enhanced. The composite image should contain a more useful description of the scene than the one provided by any of the individual sources, and therefore, should be more useful for human visual or machine perception. The task of combining images to form a single improved image is called image fusion. Image fusion has been used in many fields such as aerial and satellite imaging, med-",

            "Abstract": "Few-shot classification addresses the challenge of classifying examples given not just limited supervision but limited data as well. An attractive solution is synthetic data generation. However, most such methods are overly sophisticated, focusing on high-quality, realistic data in the input space. It is unclear whether adapting them to the few-shot regime and using them for the downstream task of classification is the right approach. Previous works on synthetic data generation for few-shot classification focus on exploiting complex models, e.g. a Wasserstein GAN with multiple regularizers or a network that transfers latent diversities from known to novel classes. We follow a different approach and investigate how a simple and straightforward synthetic data generation method can be used effectively. We make two contributions, namely we show that: (1) using a simple loss function is more than enough for training a feature generator in the few-shot setting; and (2) learning to generate tensor features instead of vector features is superior. Extensive experiments on miniImagenet, CUB and CIFAR-FS datasets show that our method sets a new state of the art, outperforming more sophisticated few-shot data augmentation methods.",

In the case that there are common degraded areas in at least one of the input images, the fusion algorithms cannot improve the information provided there, but simply convey a combination of this degraded information to the output. The authors propose a combined spatial-domain method of fusion and restoration in order to identify these common degraded areas in the fused image and use a regularized restoration approach to enhance the content in these areas. The proposed approach was tested on both multi-focus and multi-modal image sets and produced interesting results.",

A number of texture features are proposed, based on local variance, entropy, and binary patterns. Their potential in discriminating among classes in a wide range of height values used for habitat mapping (from less than 5 cm to 40 m) is tested in an area with heath, tree, and shrub vegetation. A number of missing data handling, outlier removal, and data normalization methods are evaluated to enhance the proposed framework.

Forest biomass is a source of large quantities of timber, but also of a great variety of valuable materials, chemicals and biofuels, and therefore, the identification of the species, the categorization of them into tree and non-tree species, the monitoring and assessment of their health status, as well as quality characteristics, where feasible, constitute crucial actions of a plan for the protection and rational management of the forest biomass. In the current work, for the identification and recording of trees and shrub vegetation species, the disease detection and the assessment of the biomass condition and quality in an operationally, time and power cost efficient manner, the use of aerial data is proposed. Specifically, using the abovementioned data, we propose the segmentation of trees and shrubs applying an energy minimization approach and then, assuming that the forest areas and forest biomass quality depends on trees and shrubs vegetation condition, their modelling through the extraction of multi-pyramid textural features through linear dynamical systems. The experimental results presented use images of a forest area in Greece, where fir trees prevail, and reveal the great potential of the proposed methodology.",

Our kernel has a parametric form which offers flexibility in modeling the functions obtained from various types of image data. We estimate the kernel parameters, including the unknown subpixel shifts, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

The first approach is the well-known receiver operating characteristics analysis which is introduced for a sound quality evaluation of the edge maps estimated by combining different edge detectors.

The KLT transforms the original image into a new image with components (pixels) which ideally are statistically independent. The watermark is introduced during the transformation process. The proposed method is encouraging as far as imperceptibility and robustness are concerned.",

Motivated by fact that visual appearance of the large-size and small-size pedestrians are significantly different, we apply a scale-aware detection mechanism. Two detectors are used, each focuses on the detection of either large-size or small-size pedestrians. The detection results from two detectors are weighted combined so that final detection results can be reinforced by a proper detector with respect to the size of the candidate pedestrian.",

The well-established Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) human detector, though regarded as a reference for human detection, still suffers from the typical problem of the trade-off between precision and recall, relying on the threshold of its classifiers. In this paper, we propose a human detection system which can provide both good precision and recall without the need for adjusting the classification thresholds. Our strategy is to combine the HOG detector with a body part model in order to eliminate the false detections that do not match the human silhouette (body) model. For this purpose, a probabilistic model of the human body is learned to describe the relative position between the distinctive body parts. A HOG detection would be retained if the body parts can be detected in the confidence areas provided by the learned body model. Moreover, the body parts detectors are boosted cascade classifier learned with the Haar, HOG or LBP features. The multi-modal feature representation of the different human body parts is more robust against variations in human appearances. Experiment results on the INRIA data sets show that our human detector achieves a precision of 70% at a recall of 50%, which cannot be achieved by the HOG detector under any parameter settings.",

A new algorithm was used for the adaptation of the subband filter coefficients employing a new power normalisation (PN) scheme introduced in Papoulis et al. (2002). This structure is briefly described here, the adaptive algorithm is presented and an extensive convergence analysis is then given.

The technique presented is based on the mean shift algorithm, which provides an efficient way to track objects based on their colour characteristics. A novel and efficient method is derived for tracking through changes in the target scale, where an object of interest moves away or towards the camera and therefore appears to change size in the image plane. The method works by interleaving spatial mean shift iterations with scale iterations. It is shown that this method is considerably more efficient than other methods and possesses other advantages too. It is also demonstrated that the Bhattacharyya coefficient, a histogram similarity metric that is used in the mean shift framework, can be used to reliably detect when target occlusion occurs. In such situations, the motion of an object can be extrapolated to give an accurate estimate of its \u2026",

The one-dimensional AR modeling technique has been used extensively for one-dimensional biomedical signals, and some examples are given in Section 5.1. 1. For two-dimensional biomedical signals, the idea of applying the two-dimensional AR modeling technique has not been explored, as only a couple of examples can be found in the literature, as shown in Section 5.1. 2.In the following sections, we concentrate on a two-dimensional AR modeling technique whose results can be used to describe textured surfaces in images under the assumption that every distinct texture can be represented by a different set of two-dimensional AR model coefficients. The conventional Yule-Walker system of equations is one of the most widely used methods for solving AR model coefficients, and the variances of the estimated coefficients obtained from a large number of realizations, ie, simulations using the output of a same set of AR model coefficients but randomly generated driving input, are sufficiently low. However, estimations fail when large external noise is added onto the system; if the noise is Gaussian, we are tempted to work in the third-order statistical domain, where the third-order moments are employed, and therefore the external Gaussian noise can be eliminated [1, 2]. This method leads to higher variances from the estimated AR model coefficients obtained from a number of realizations. We propose three methods for estimation of two-dimensional AR model coefficients. The first method relates \u2026",

Improved performance is possible by transductive inference, where the entire test set is available concurrently, and semi-supervised learning, where more unlabeled data is available. Focusing on these two settings, we introduce a new algorithm that leverages the manifold structure of the labeled and unlabeled data distribution to predict pseudo-labels, while balancing over classes and using the loss value distribution of a limited-capacity classifier to select the cleanest labels, iteratively improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Our solution surpasses or matches the state of the art results on four benchmark datasets, namely miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB and CIFAR-FS, while being robust over feature space pre-processing and the quantity of available data.

In this paper, we propose a method for action recognition using depth sensors and representing the skeleton time series sequences as higher-order sparse structure tensors to exploit the dependencies among skeleton joints and to overcome the limitations of methods that use joint coordinates as input signals. To this end, we estimate their decompositions based on randomized subspace iteration that enables the computation of singular values and vectors of large sparse matrices with high accuracy. Specifically, we attempt to extract different feature representations containing spatio-temporal complementary information and extracting the mode-n singular values with regards to the correlations of skeleton joints. Then, the extracted features are combined using discriminant correlation analysis, and a neural network is used to recognize the action patterns. The experimental results presented use three widely used action datasets and confirm the great potential of the proposed action learning and recognition method. View Full-Text",

However,it is generally difficult to reduce false positives on hard negative samples such as tree leaves, traffic lights, poles, etc. Some of these hard negatives can be removed by making use of high level semantic vision cues. In this paper, we propose a region-based CNN method which makes use of semantic cues for better pedestrian detection. Our method extends the Faster R-CNN detection framework by adding a branch of network for semantic image segmentation. The semantic network aims to compute complementary higher level semantic features to be integrated with the convolutional features. We make use of multi-resolution feature maps extracted from different network layers in order to ensure good detection accuracy for pedestrians at different scales. Boosted forest is used for training the integrated features in a cascaded manner for hard negatives mining. Experiments on the Caltech-USA pedestrian dataset show improvements on detection accuracy with the semantic network. With the deep VGG16 model, our pedestrian detection method achieves robust detection performance on the Caltech-USA dataset.",

            "Abstract": "A strategy is introduced for achieving high accuracy in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) tasks. Initially, a novel pose rectification process and an image normalization process are sequentially introduced to produce images with less variations prior to the feature processing stage. Then, feature sets that have a wealth of texture and edge information are extracted with the utilization of wavelet coefficients, where more effective and compact feature sets are acquired by reducing the redundancy and dimensionality of the extracted feature set. Finally, a group of discrimination trees are learned and combined into a final classifier in the framework of Real-AdaBoost. The proposed method is evaluated with the public release database for moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR). Several comparative studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show the distinctive superiority of the proposed method under both standard operating conditions (SOCs) and extended operating conditions (EOCs). Moreover, our additional tests suggest that good recognition accuracy can be achieved even with limited number of training images as long as these are captured with appropriately incremental sample step in target poses.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, the problem of joint disparity and motion estimation from stereo image sequences is formulated in the spatiotemporal frequency domain, and a novel steerable filter-based approach is proposed. Our rationale behind coupling the two problems is that according to experimental evidence in the literature, the biological visual mechanisms for depth and motion are not independent of each other. Furthermore, our motivation to study the problem in the frequency domain and search for a filter-based solution is based on the fact that, according to early experimental studies, the biological visual mechanisms can be modelled based on frequency-domain or filter-based considerations, for both the perception of depth and the perception of motion. The proposed framework constitutes the first attempt to solve the joint estimation problem through a filter-based solution, based on frequency-domain considerations. Thus, the presented ideas provide a new direction of work and could be the basis for further developments. From an algorithmic point of view, we additionally extend state-of-the-art ideas from the disparity estimation literature to handle the joint disparity-motion estimation problem and formulate an algorithm that is evaluated through a number of experimental results. Comparisons with state-of-the-art-methods demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. View Full-Text",

In recent years, great progress has been made in applying SOD on many vision tasks. The depth map could provide additional spatial prior and boundary cues to boost the performance. Combining the depth information with image data obtained from standard visual cameras has been widely used in recent SOD works, however, introducing depth information in a suboptimal fusion strategy may have negative influence in the performance of SOD. In this paper, we discuss about the advantages of the so-called progressive multi-scale fusion method and propose a mask-guided feature aggregation module(MGFA). The proposed framework can effectively combine the two features of different modalities and, furthermore, alleviate the impact of erroneous depth features, which are inevitably caused by the variation of depth quality. We further introduce a mask-guided refinement module(MGRM) to complement the high-level semantic features and reduce the irrelevant features from multi-scale fusion, leading to an overall refinement of detection. Experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics.",

Guidelines for choosing this parameter are developed in the context of classical (nonblind) image restoration. The intensity bounds are applied by means of the gradient projection method, and conditions for convergence are derived when the bounds are refined using the current image estimate.

Then the sub-band energy functions of wavelet package of the original features are designed and calculated to serve as the input vectors of the neural networks.

However, most of data augmentation/synthesis methods for few-shot classification are overly complex and sophisticated, e.g. training a wGAN with multiple regularizers or training a network to transfer latent diversities from known to novel classes. We make two contributions, namely we show that: (1) using a simple loss function is more than enough for training a feature generator in the few-shot setting; and (2) learning to generate tensor features instead of vector features is superior. Extensive experiments on miniImagenet, CUB and CIFAR-FS datasets show that our method sets a new state of the art, outperforming more sophisticated few-shot data augmentation methods.",

This weighting factor enables nonstationary signal models to be tracked. In particular, the behavior of the weighting factor is known to influence the performance of the LS estimation. However there are certain constraints on the weighting factor. In this paper, we have reformulated the LS estimation with the commonly used exponential weighting factor as a constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we have addressed this constrained optimization using the Lagrange programming neural networks (LPNNs) thereby enabling the weighting factor to be adapted.

The estimation of the parameters is achieved based on second and higher order cumulants properties and optimization methods.

Fusion using ICA performs well in transferring the salient features of the input images into the composite output, but its performance deteriorates severely under mild to moderate noise conditions. CPA fusion is robust under severe noise conditions, but eliminates the high frequency information of the images involved. We pro-pose to use ICA fusion within high activity image areas, identified by edges and strong textured surfaces and CPA fusion in low activity areas identified by uniform background regions and weak texture. A binary image map is used for selecting the appropriate method, which is constructed by a standard edge detector followed by morphological operators. The results of the proposed approach are very encouraging as far as joint fusion and denoising is concerned.

These nontarget objects often possess very similar visual appearance to that of cars making it hard to separate the car and the noncar classes. Accordingly, most past works experienced low precision rates at high recall rates.

In this paper, we propose a CNN architecture, named Modular-CNN, to improve the performance of building detectors that employ Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) in a remote sensing dataset. Additionally, we propose two improvements to increase the classification accuracy of Modular-CNN. The first improvement combines the power of raw and normalised features, while the second one concerns the Euler transformation of feature vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Modular-CNN and the novel improvements in remote sensing and other datasets in a comparative study with other state-of-the-art \u2026",

The key principle that drives both the development and the subjective relevance of these metrics is the preservation of input image related visual information. Of course, image visual information can be defined in many ways and this can lead to the formulation of several possible pixel-level image fusion metrics. Initially, important visual information is considered that relates to \u2018edge\u2019-based information and associated image regions. This concept is then expanded with the involvement of Human Visual System modelling within the metric formulation process. A number of such image fusion measures are therefore developed and their characteristics are examined for accurately predicting fusion system performance as compared to that obtained from subjective tests. Extensive experimentation allows for the detailed analysis, optimisation, and understanding of the comparative behaviour of these image fusion performance measures.",

The concept is brought forth in our work, which aims to evaluate the performance of image fusion algorithms based on their ability to retain textural details from the fusion process. We utilise the GLCM model to extract second-order statistical features for the derivation of an image textural measure. This is used to replace the edge-based calculations in the Petrovic metric. Performance evaluation on established fusion methods verify that the proposed metric is accurate, especially for multimodal scenarios.",

Consequently, it is not guaranteed that the feature representation for pedestrians of a particular scale is optimised. In this paper, we propose a Scale-Aware Multi-resolution (SAM) method for pedestrian detection which can adaptively select multi-resolution convolutional features according to pedestrian sizes. The proposed SAM method extracts the appropriate CNN features that have strong representation ability as well as sufficient feature resolution, given the size of the pedestrian candidate output from a region proposal network. Moreover, we propose an enhanced SAM method, termed as SAM+, which incorporates complementary features channels and achieves further performance improvement.

However there are scenarios that machine learning cannot be applied successfully, for example in situations where data is scarce. This is the case when one-to-one matching is required between a query and a dataset of hand gestures where each gesture represents a unique class. In situations where learning algorithms cannot be trained, classic computer vision techniques such as feature extraction can be used to identify similarities between objects. Shape is one of the most important features that can be extracted from images, however the most accurate shape matching algorithms tend to be computationally inefficient for real-time applications. In this work we present a novel shape matching methodology for real-time hand gesture recognition. Extensive experiments were carried out comparing our method with other shape matching methods with respect to accuracy and computational complexity using our own collected hand gesture dataset and a modified version of the MPEG-7 dataset.%that is widely used for comparing 2D shape matching algorithms.

In this paper, we propose to combine the advantages of example-based SISR and self-example based SISR. A novel hierarchical random forests based super-resolution (SRHRF) method is proposed to learn statistical priors from external training images. Each layer of random forests reduce the estimation error due to variance by aggregating prediction models from multiple decision trees. The hierarchical structure further boosts the performance by pushing the estimation error due to bias towards zero. In order to further adaptively improve the super-resolved image, a self-example random forests (SERF) is learned from an image pyramid pair constructed from the down-sampled SRHRF generated result. Extensive numerical results show that the SRHRF method enhanced using SERF (SRHRF+) achieves the state-of-the-art performance on natural images and yields substantially superior performance for image with rich self-similar patterns.",

Recent studies show Chebyshev polynomials to be effective in image fusion mainly in medium to high noise conditions, as per real-life satellite conditions. However, its application was limited to heuristics. In this research, we have proposed a way to adaptively select the optimal CPA parameters according to user specifications.

We are concentrating on very high degree polynomials (transfer functions) for which factorisation procedures for root extraction are unreliable. The initial linear phase transfer functions are obtained by standard design algorithms and particularly in this study by the Remez algorithm. The approach taken involves the use of the Cauchy residue theorem applied to the logarithmic derivative of the appropriate curves. This leads into a set of parameters related directly to the polynomial coefficients, which facilitate the factorisation problem. The results of the proposed design scheme are very encouraging as far as robustness and computational complexity are concerned.",

The identification problem requires the comparison of assemblies of image regions with a previously stored view of a known prototype. Shape context representation and matching are employed for recovering point correspondences between the image and the prototype. Assuming that the prototype view is sufficiently similar in configuration with an object in the complex scene, the correspondence process will succeed. However, a number of ambient conditions such as partial object occlusion and contour distortion, may affect the performance of the matching process and consequently the identification result. A novel multistage type of clustering of suspicious image locations is applied in a novel fashion to enable the identification of regions of interest on the complex scene, based on a set of density \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The environmental challenges the world faces have never been greater or more complex. Global areas that are covered by forests and urban woodlands are threatened by large-scale forest fires that have increased dramatically during the last decades in Europe and worldwide, in terms of both frequency and magnitude. To this end, rapid advances in remote sensing systems including ground-based, unmanned aerial vehicle-based and satellite-based systems have been adopted for effective forest fire surveillance. In this paper, the recently introduced 360-degree sensor cameras are proposed for early fire detection, making it possible to obtain unlimited field of view captures which reduce the number of required sensors and the computational cost and make the systems more efficient. More specifically, once optical 360-degree raw data are obtained using an RGB 360-degree camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle, we convert the equirectangular projection format images to stereographic images. Then, two DeepLab V3+ networks are applied to perform flame and smoke segmentation, respectively. Subsequently, a novel post-validation adaptive method is proposed exploiting the environmental appearance of each test image and reducing the false-positive rates. For evaluating the performance of the proposed system, a dataset, namely the \u201cFire detection 360-degree dataset\u201d, consisting of 150 unlimited field of view images that contain both synthetic and real fire, was created. Experimental results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed system, which has achieved an F-score fire detection rate equal to 94.6%, hence reducing \u2026",

This paper aims to find these weights by minimising a constant-modulus (CM) cost function that describes the dispersion of the fused image. In order to accelerate convergence rate and avoid spurious solutions, we also introduce optimal learning rates while updating fusion weights.

There are mainly two groups of fusion methods depending on the signal domain they are applied: spatial domain methods and transform domain methods. The Dispersion Minimisation Fusion (DMF) and Kurtosis Maximisation Fusion (KMF) based techniques we are going to discuss are spatial domain methods that is to say the fusion is simply performed on the image itself. In this work we propose to linearly combine the input images with appropriate weights estimated using specific mathematical performance criteria which evaluate in various ways improvement in visual perception. More specifically, in order to estimate the weights we propose iterative methods which use cost functions based on two statistical parameters, ie the dispersion and the kurtosis. The optimisation of the proposed cost functions enables us to obtain a fused image which is less distorted compared to the input ones.",

Shape-from-shading techniques extract height and surface normal information from a single 2D image by taking into consideration knowledge about illumination, reflectance and shape. In this paper, a novel feature is proposed that can describe the 3D information of reconstructed images based on a shape-from-shading technique in order to successfully acquire building boundaries.

The identification process is applied on isolated objects and requires the segmentation of the image into separate objects, followed by the extraction of representative shape features and the similarity estimation of pairs of objects. In order to enable an efficient object representation, a novel boundary-based shape descriptor is introduced, formed by a set of one dimensional signals called shape signatures. During identification, the cross-correlation metric is used in a novel fashion to gauge the degree of similarity between objects. The invariance of the method to uniform-scaling and partial occlusion is achieved by considering both cases as possible scenarios when correlating shape signatures. The proposed vision system is robust to ambient conditions (partial occlusion) and \u2026",

In this paper we explore the use of randomised forests (sometimes referred to as randomised decision forests) for people detection. A randomised forest classifier is trained for people detection with edge orientation features. These features capture information concerning the distribution of edges with specific orientations. The classifier is trained and tested on the INRIA person data set, and some results are presented. (5 pages)",

            "Abstract": "Salient object detection has achieved great improvements by using the Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). However, the FCN-based U-shape architecture may cause dilution problems in the high-level semantic information during the up-sample operations in the top-down pathway. Thus, it can weaken the ability of salient object localization and produce degraded boundaries. To this end, in order to overcome this limitation, we propose a novel pyramid self-attention module (PSAM) and the adoption of an independent feature-complementing strategy. In PSAM, self-attention layers are equipped after multi-scale pyramid features to capture richer high-level features and bring larger receptive fields to the model. In addition, a channel-wise attention module is also employed to reduce the redundant features of the FPN and provide refined results. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed PSAM effectively contributes to the whole model so that it outperforms state-of-the-art results over five challenging datasets. Finally, quantitative results show that PSAM generates accurate predictions and integral salient maps, which can provide further help to other computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

To this end, a framework for tree classification that can contribute in the monitoring of wood resources, timber management and environmental protection is proposed in this paper. More specifically, we use LiDAR sensing technology and extract the skeleton of trees using the Fast Marching method. Then, we model them using linear dynamical systems taking advantage of the fact that each one of the tree species has been grown in a specific way and exhibits specific properties in the growing direction of it. This is achieved by dividing the tree skeletons into overlapping segments in the direction of z axes and creating higher-order patches consisting of trees? skeleton branching coordinates of each segment. Finally, due to the fact that the structure of tropical trees is complex, classification is performed introducing descriptors that take into account the combination of dynamic, appearance and noise parameters. For the evaluation of the proposed system, a dataset consisting of fifteen point clouds of common Caatinga tropical trees was created. Experimental results presented in this paper show the great application of the proposed methodology",

A PCA step is first used to map the object boundary to its canonical form, reducing the problem of the nonuniform sampling of the object contour introduced by the affine transformation. Then, a PCA-based scheme is employed to train a set of basis functions on the signals extracted from the objects' boundaries. The derived bases are used to analyze the boundary locally. Based on the theory of invariants and local boundary analysis, a novel invariant function is constructed.

To tackle this dilemma, we propose a dynamic distillation method along with a lightweight framework, which significantly reduces the parameters. This method considers the factors of both teacher and student performance within the training stage and dynamically assigns the distillation weight instead of applying a fixed weight on the student model.

The initial linear phase transfer functions are obtained by standard design algorithms and particularly in this study by the Remez algorithm. The approach taken involves the use of the Cauchy Residue Theorem applied to the contour integral of the logarithmic derivative of the transfer function around appropriate curves. This leads into a set of parameters related directly to the polynomial coefficients, which facilitate the factorisation problem.

A multistage modelling technique, which appears in the literature as \"endomorphic modelling\", is applied to this kind of signal. The signal is divided into sub-sets of samples and each sub-set is modelled using an AR model. A new image is formed using the same AR model coefficient estimated from different blocks, then the new image is re-modelled using AR models again. This process ends when the variance of the estimated parameters is sufficiently small.

The simulation experiments show that the recognitions of the early fault states can be completed correctly by using the proposed recognition algorithm. The classes of cable faults include in 1-phase ground faults, and the 2-phase short circuit faults or ground faults, and the 3-phase short circuit faults or ground faults, open circuit. The fault resistance range is 1\u00d710\u22121\u223c1\u00d7109 \u03a9.",

            "Abstract": "We present a regularized mixed norm multichannel image restoration algorithm. The problem of multichannel restoration using both within- and between-channel deterministic information is considered. For each channel a functional that combines the least mean squares (LMS), the least mean fourth (LMF), and a smoothing functional is proposed. We introduce a mixed norm parameter that controls the relative contribution between the LMS and the LMF, and a regularization parameter that defines the degree of smoothness of the solution, both updated at each iteration according to the noise characteristics of each channel. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that no knowledge of the noise distribution for each channel is required, and the parameters just mentioned are adjusted based on the partially restored image.",

            "Abstract": "The current state-of-the-art hand gesture recognition methodologies heavily rely in the use of machine learning. However there are scenarios that machine learning cannot be applied successfully, for example in situations where data is scarce. This is the case when one-to-one matching is required between a query and a dataset of hand gestures where each gesture represents a unique class. In situations where learning algorithms cannot be trained, classic computer vision techniques such as feature extraction can be used to identify similarities between objects. Shape is one of the most important features that can be extracted from images, however the most accurate shape matching algorithms tend to be computationally inefficient for real-time applications. In this work we present a novel shape matching methodology for real-time hand gesture recognition. Extensive experiments were carried out comparing our \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper forms a part of a series of recent studies we have undertaken, where the problem of nonlinear signal modelling is examined. We assume that an observed \"output\" signal is derived from a Volterra filter that is driven by a Gaussian input. Both the filter parameters and the input signal are unknown and therefore the problem can be classified as blind or unsupervised in nature. In the statistical approach to the solution of the above problem we seek for equations that relate the unknown parameters of the Volterra model with the statistical parameters of the \"output\" signal to be modelled. These equations are highly nonlinear and their solution is achieved through a novel constrained optimisation formulation. The results of the entire modelling scheme are compared with recent contributions.",

            "Abstract": "Over the last decade or so, laser scanning technology has become an increasingly popular and important tool for forestry inventory, enabling accurate capture of 3D information in a fast and environmentally friendly manner. To this end, the authors propose here a system for tropical tree species classification based on 3D scans of LiDAR sensing technology. In order to exploit the interrelated patterns of trees, skeleton representations of tree point clouds are extracted, and their structures are divided into overlapping equal-sized 3D segments. Subsequently, they represent them as third-order sparse structure tensors setting the value of skeleton coordinates equal to one. Based on the higher-order tensor decomposition of each sparse segment, they 1) estimate the mode-n singular values extracting intra-correlations of tree branches and 2) model tropical trees as linear dynamical systems extracting appearance \u2026",
