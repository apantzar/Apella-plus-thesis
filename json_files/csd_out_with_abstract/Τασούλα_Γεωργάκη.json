            "Abstract": "Lyric-voice quality level has been repeatedly reported as declining during the last few decades, both by scholars and distinguished opera professionals. Many believe that the current vocal pedagogy for this genre is to be blamed for this effect and have reported a need for vocal education reform. Meanwhile, scientific research of the vocal mechanism has provided knowledge on an interdisciplinary level, in fields such as Singing Acoustics and Cognition, while new real-time visual feedback technologies and software tools, that can be of immediate use to the vocal pedagogic system, are evolving constantly. In this paper we propose an assistive feedback environment for the pedagogy of lyric singers, which includes a multi-window interface for testing postural and breathing habits, diaphragm activity, glottal activity and formant tuning.",

This paper presents the design and development of a model which takes as input a dancer\u2019s movement and outputs music, structurally related to dance, with the use of machine learning techniques. Both the technical and artistic aspects of the model development are described in detail. In particular, the paper compares the use of machine learning techniques to traditional coding, in interactive dance and music applications. Moreover, it describes the significant discrimination between movement sonification and dance musification and explains why the model presented here falls into the second category. Special focus is given to the implications of the COVID-19 restrictions regarding the established collaboration with the dancer.",

First we trace the evolution of different approaches for the use of fractals in music since the 80's by a literature review. Furthermore, we review representative fractal algorithms and platforms that implement them. Properties such as self-similarity (pink noise), correlation, memory (related to the notion of Brownian motion) or non correlation at multiple levels (white noise), can be used to develop hierarchy of criteria for analyzing different layers of musical structure. L-systems can be applied in the modelling of melody in different musical cultures as well as in the investigation of musical perception principles. Finally, we propose a critical investigation approach for the use of artificial or natural fractal curves in systematic musicology.",

            "Abstract": "It is considered hard to teach programming in secondary education while achieving the aims of curriculum. However, when teaching is supported by suitable methodologies, learning can be ameliorated. Under this premise, this paper discusses different teaching approaches to programming in secondary education and examines the potential benefit of sound-alerts as a complementary teaching tool. Such alerts were created by pairing different sound stimuli to specific programming actions and operations. Both the selection of the sound stimuli, as well as the potential impact of the use of sound alerts on programming are evaluated through subjective studies. Results showed that participants preferred synthesized to natural (pre-recorded) stimuli for all types of alerts. It was also revealed that users prefer sound-alerts associated to pending actions, errors, successful code execution, conditional statements and code looping over alerts highlighting the step-by-step execution of the code. Finally, the test results showed that students understand both the meaning and the use of code commands more clearly when they use a sound-enriched programming environment instead of a conventional one. These results were the motivation for the initial creation of an audio and voice messages\u2019 data base and the initial design of a new comprehensive educational tool using sound.",

The software, written in Max/MSP, aims to assist singing practice by providing users with a visual substitute to their subjective auditory feedback. Under the guidance of their professional vocal instructor, students can store in the software spectral representations of accurately produced sounds, creating personalized Reference Sound Banks (RSBs). When students practice on their own, the software can be put into practice, assisting them to match their current Voice Spectrum Harmonic Content to the stored RSBs one note at a time. Results of a preliminary evaluation showed that, when using this software, students achieve a larger number of accurately produced sounds in a smaller amount of time.",

            "Abstract": "This paper we report on an interdisciplinary project for modeling Greek chant with real-time vocal synthesis. Building on previous research, we employ a hybrid musical instrument: Phonodeon (Georgaki et al. 2005), consisting of a MIDI-accordeon coupled to a real-time algorithmic interaction and vocal synthesis engine. The synthesis is based on data provided by the AOIDOS program developed in the Department of the Computer science of the University of Athens, investigating Greek liturgical chant compared to bel canto singing. Phonodeon controls expressive vocal synthesis models based on formant synthesis and concatenated filtered samples. Its bellows serve as hardware control device that is physically analogous to the human breathing mechanism [georgaki, 1998a], while the buttons of the right hand can serve multiple functions. On the level of pitch structure, this paper focuses on a particular aspect of control, namely that of playing in the traditional non-tempered and flexible interval structure of Greek modes (\u03ae\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9: echoi) while using the 12-semitone piano-type keyboard of the left hand. This enables the musical exploration of the relationship between the spectral structure of the vocal timbre of Greek chant and characteristic intervals occuring in the modal structure of the chant. To implement that, we developed techniques for superimposing interval patterns of the modes on the keyboard of the phonodeon. The work is the first comprehensive interactive model of antique, medieval and modern near-eastern tunings. The techniques developed can be combined with techniques for other control aspects, such as timbre and vocal expression \u2026",

Our goal is to implement a score-to-singing synthesis system, where the score is written in a score editor and saved in the midi format. However, MBROLA accepts phonetic files as input rather than midi ones and because of this, we construct a midi-file to phonetic-file converter, which applies irrespective of the underlying language. The evaluation of the Greek singing voice synthesis system is achieved through a psycho acoustic experiment. The thirty participants are given two samples and are asked to evaluate them according to vocalness, naturalness, intelligibility and expressivity, in a 1-5 scale MOS test. The results are encouraging, with naturalness and expressivity being ranked above 2.5 in average. Thereafter, we create a new diphone database \u2026",

In the domain of Ancient Greek musicology indeed, where we find the roots of the occidental music, the main research has been done mostly by scholars of classical Greek literature. However, there is still a vast territory for research in audio performances to be carried out with the help of new digital technologies.In this paper, we will present an attempt to decode a recited text of Ancient Greek tragedy and render it into sound. At the first paragraph of this article we underline the origin of music arising from the melodicity of speech in Ancient Greek tragedy. In the second paragraph, we describe the methodology we have used in order to analyse the voice of S. Psaroudaks, himself professor of Ancient Greek music, by an open source prosodic feature extraction tool based on Praat. We give a description of the prosodic analysis, implementation details and discuss its feature extension capabilities as well. Last, we refer to the difference between the Ancient and Modern Greek phonological system, the application of this research in music and further development.",

They claim that they cannot recall the exact position of the respiration, vocal tract or muscle activities taught, and thus base their practice solely on the subjective basis of their auditory perception of their own voice.Recent fMRI studies have confirmed that Opera singers tend to control their voice by depending largely on their somatosensory, rather than auditory feedback of their voice. They have learned how to control their bodies in order to achieve their optimum sound. But how can everyone achieve this? Is there a way to quantify and repeat, what our teacher suggests as our current best result?",

The approach aims at identifying higher-level semantics of transcribed and recorded jazz solos. At these initial stages, analytical decisions are rather exploratory and rely on the input of one of the authors and experienced jazz performer. We apply the method to two well-known solos, by Sonny Rollins and Charlie Parker, and discuss how improvisations resemble story-telling, employing a broad range of structural, expressive and technical tools, usually associated with linguistic production, experience, and meaning. We elucidate the implicit choices of experienced jazz improvisers, who have developed a strong command over the language and can communicate expressive intent, elicit emotional responses, and unfold musical \u201cstories\u201d that are memorable and enjoyable to fellow musicians and listeners. We also comment on potential artificial intelligence applications of this work to music research and performance.",

This meta system, which could be regarded also as one total composed instrument, is a recursive interaction process between its agents; a robot arm, human body and a sound space being rendered artificially. The computational modeling of this embodied approach is explained and a proto-type of the experiment is shown as a real tool to test empirically this artistic concept.",

            "Abstract": "This paper discusses a new method for encoding Byzantine Music Neumatic Notation (especially the one developed during the \u2018transitory\u2019period 1670-1814). The Notation of this period is characterized by difficulties and peculiarities. The difficult access to Byzantine manuscripts and their deteriorated condition, complicate reading. In addition, our incomplete knowledge of the interpretation of signs impedes the comprehension of the musical text leading in results that are often in dispute. The fact that sign unions are complex enough together with their presence in various places in a composition make electronic transcriptions the ultimate challenge. Moreover, there does not exist a framework for data encoding and analysis. This work presents a proposal for the development of such a model for the old Byzantine Neumatic Notation in Python. The implementation of this project is still at an initial stage, and focuses, mostly, on the efficient digitization of old manuscripts. The system, even though fully functional, has certain limitations. Some signs are missing, and the musical text is created using microphotographies. Future developments of the program will focus on resolving these deficiencies and adding more features to the system.",

It is divided into two parts. The first part of the study is based upon reference, investigating the interconnection between art and science. This mechanism is characterized by transformation processes in the interdisciplinary practices that are applied mainly by various artists and movements of the post-Second World War period. The expressive element seeks an unworldly explanation through audio and visual conjunctions. This nature is obvious in Paul Klee\u2019s reflections of musical elements in his paintings, and Rimmington\u2019s attempts to marry audio-visual influences in his \u2018colour organs\u2019. The experimentations of composers such as Xenakis and Stockhausen at various locations with light and colour illustrate the continuous \u2026",

How we judge software, is based on aesthetic criteria, the way they were handed down to us from theories of abstract painting (20th century avant-garde), the theory of montage by Sergei Eisenstein, of neurophysiology (synesthesia, muscular images) and of the successful correspondence of the two media (pixel and music) in the works and theory of James Whitney.",

It is of particular importance in young ages, as it has been suggested to promote the children\u2019s social integration. While singing is a key component of elementary music classes, proper vocal training of young individuals has not been implemented into the current Greek elementary school curriculum. In addition, oftentimes music teachers are not trained to provide proper vocal instruction to young individuals. This work is part of the ASMA research project, which focuses on the social and aesthetic importance of student vocal training and the development of interactive applications supporting its instruction in elementary schools. The main hypothesis is that new technologies informing modern teaching methodologies can support proper vocal practice, by offering teachers individualized feedback on each student\u2019s needs.
