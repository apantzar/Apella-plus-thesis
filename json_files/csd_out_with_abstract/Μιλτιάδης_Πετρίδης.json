            "Abstract": "Complexity and scale of modern data is at its highest level but its temporal properties are often neglected. As a result, it is often hard for a user to make an informed decision about its time related characteristics. However, an aesthetic and efficient visualization can mitigate this drawback of data representation. For example, an informative graphical visualization based on user's interaction with a computer interface can dramatically improve user experience with temporal data. In this paper, I propose such visualization of temporal data for reasoning. I developed a temporal model supporting different temporal entities for this data. These include timestamps, intervals, different time granularity and uncertainty of time. I proposed a multimodal visualization based on this abstract time model so a user will have the functionality to reason on temporal properties of visualized data from different points of view.",

            "Abstract": "New technologies have emerged to support the global economy where for instance suppliers, manufactures and retailers are working together in order to minimise the cost and maximise efficiency. One of the technologies that has become a buzz word for many businesses is business process management or BPM. A business process comprises activities and tasks, the resources required to perform each task, and the business rules linking these activities and tasks. The tasks may be performed by human and/or machine actors. Workflow provides a way of describing the order of execution and the dependent relationships between the constituting activities of short or long running processes. Workflow allows businesses to capture not only the information but also the processes that transform the information-the process asset (Koulopoulos, TM, 1995). Applications which involve automated, human-centric and collaborative processes across organisations are inherently different from one organisation to another. Even within the same organisation but over time, applications are adapted as ongoing change to the business processes is seen as the norm in today\u2019s dynamic business environment. The major difference lies in the specifics of business processes which are changing rapidly in order to match the way in which businesses operate. In this chapter we introduce and discuss Business Process Management (BPM) with a focus on the integration of heterogeneous BPM systems across multiple organisations. We identify the problems and the main challenges not only with regards to technologies but also in the social and cultural context. We also \u2026",

An overview of GSNN and a generalised reduction technique, which subsumes some existing decremental methods, such as the Shrink algorithm, are presented. The reduction technique is given for case bases in terms of a measure of the importance of each case to the predictive power of the case base. A trial test is performed on two case bases of different kinds, with several metrics proposed in the solution space. The tests show that GSNN can out-perform standard nearest neighbour methods on this set. Further test results show that a caseremoval order proposed based on a GSNN error function can produce a sparse case \u2026",

The most popular techniques for generating recommendations are through content-based and collaborative filtering with the latter used to provide user to user recommendations.

It is demonstrated that a simple online learning algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art batch algorithms and performs as well as a deep learning algorithm, Deep Belief Networks.

The framework uses the SOA paradigm to store and index a set of business workflow execution event traces. It also allows transparent service interfaces to enterprise system components that orchestrate and monitor business workflows. The CBR component employs similarity measures to retrieve workflow execution cases similar to a given target case. This enables the reuse of associated knowledge about the workflow execution into the new target case. This paper presents the CBR-WIMS approach and architecture and illustrates its features through its application to two real-life enterprise systems. The paper examines the portability and robustness of the CBR-WIMS architecture and provides an evaluation of its suitability through an analysis of the experience gained from the two enterprise systems application case studies.",

One of the most important resources is the bandwidth. The flexibility of IPTV services which provide users to stream multimedia contents at anytime and anywhere they want makes the demand for video-on-demand (VoD) service higher. To serve the VoD requests, the server uses unicast scheme which consumes more bandwidth and resources. However, the server bandwidth capacity is limited as such the numerous requests from the clients may exhaust all the available bandwidth depending on the number of requests at a given time, which leads to the poor quality of services.

The creation of software designs already enjoys wide software support through CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools. However, there has been limited application of computer reasoning to software designs in other areas. Yet there is expert knowledge embedded in software design artefacts which could be useful if it were successfully retrieved. While the semantic tags are an important aspect of a class diagram, the approach formulated here uses only structural information. It is shown that by applying case-based reasoning and graph matching to measure similarity between class diagrams it is possible to identify properties of an implementation not encoded within the actual diagram, such as the domain, programming language, quality and implementation cost.

The system actually implicates a problem which is equivalent to the famous Graph Coloring problem, and therefore is NP complete for attackers. The complexity of bisectional multivariate quadratic equation (BMQE) system is determined by the number of the variables, of the equations and of the elements of F q , which is denoted as n, m, and q, respectively. The paper shows that, if the number of the equations is larger or equal to twice the number of the variables, and q n  is large enough, the system is complicated enough to prevent attacks from most of the existing attacking schemes.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, several existing interpolation methods of use in CBR are discussed and compared. Interpolation in CBR is normally applied to a retrieval set of cases which are \u2018near to\u2019a given target set in the problem domain. The interpolation method is then used to select an appropriate solution value from a solution domain. The main factors examined here, governing the accuracy and power of the interpolation, are the selection of cases for interpolation and the method of interpolation. Two selection criteria are examined: selection by nearest neighbours and selection by divergence algorithms. Three interpolation methods examined are examined: nearest neighbour, distance weighted nearest neighbour, linear regression and a generalised regression method, suitable to nominal values. Experimental results on three case-bases are presented for comparison. These are a: a real valued 2-dimensional sinusoidal random valued function, the classical iris case base, and the travel case base. The results show that linear regression is best for dense case bases, but is limited to real continuous problems. For general CBR usage, divergence selection can improve accuracy by a factor of 2, and that generalised regression can additionally improve accuracy also by a factor of 2.",

In this paper we consider how CBR can be used as a flexible query engine to improve the usability of numerical models. Particularly they can help to solve inverse and mixed problems, and to solve constraint problems. We discuss this idea with reference to the illustrative example of a pneumatic conveyor. We describe a model of the problem of particle degradation in such a conveyor, and the problems faced by design engineers. The solution of these problems requires a system that allows iterative sharing of control between user, CBR system, and numerical model. This multi-initiative interaction is illustrated for the pneumatic conveyor by means of Unified Modeling Language (UML) collaboration and sequence diagrams. We show approaches to the solution of these problems via a CBR tool.",

To capture user behaviour effectively, the CBR system classifies the log information into five contexts and then combines them into a single dimension, instead of using the conventional approach where the transaction amount, time dimensions or features dimension are used individually.

It has been established that structural information plays an important role in classi? cation accuracy [14]. An alternative to the bag of words/phrases representation is a graph based rep-sentation, which intuitively possesses much more expressive power. However, this representation introduces an additional level of complexity in that the calculation of the similarity between two graphs is signi? cantly more computationally expensive than between two vectors (see for example [16]). Some work (see for example [12]) has been done on hybrid representations to capture both structural elements (-ing the graph model) and signi? cant features using the vector model.

            "Abstract": "(TLFNs) have been shown to outperform single-hidden-layer neural networks (SLFNs) for function approximation in many cases. However, their added complexity makes them more difficult to find. Given a constant number of hidden nodes nh, this paper investigates how their allocation between the first and second hidden layers (nh= n1+ n2) affects the likelihood of finding the best generaliser. The experiments were carried out over a total of ten public domain datasets with nh= 8 and 16. The findings were that the heuristic n1= 0.5nh+ 1 has an average probability of at least 0.85 of finding a network with a generalisation error within 0.18% of the best generaliser. Furthermore, the worst case over all data sets was within 0.23% for nh= 8, and within 0.15% for nh= 16. These findings could be used to reduce the complexity of the search for TLFNs from quadratic to linear, or alternatively for \u2018topology mapping\u2019between TLFNs and SLFNs, given the same number of hidden nodes, to compare their performance.",

            "Abstract": "At present, the complexity and scale of modern digital conversations between people is at its highest level but there is a gap in how to represent these conversations to a user. As a result, it is often hard for a user to understand the flow of a conversation and make an informed decision over it. However, an aesthetic and efficient visualisation can mitigate this drawback of data representation. In this paper, a case-based approach was proposed for choosing an appropriate visualisation for user\u2019s conversations. A case was formulated as a visualisation of a conversation which a user decided to use for his analysis of the conversation. When a user decides to visualise a new conversation, the most similar visualisation type from previous users\u2019 experiences is selected for the visualisation of the new conversation. In this paper, the cases of visualisations of conversations from the IBM Many Eyes platform were collected and a case-based reasoning approach for choosing a visualisation of user\u2019s conversation was designed. Finally, the work of the proposed approach was tested on a sample email conversation, and then four participants evaluated the appropriateness of the chosen visualisation types in comparison with other eight possible visualisations for the email conversation.",

The method relies on the definition of an error function in terms of distance metrics in the solution and problem space. The retrieved solution is taken to minimise this error function. The method applies equally to nominal, continuous and mixed domains, and does not depend upon an embedding n-dimensional space. In continuous Euclidean problem domains, the method is shown to be a generalisation of Shepard's Interpolation method. We refer the retrieval algorithm to as the Generalised Shepard Nearest Neighbour (GSNN) method. A novel aspect of GSNN is that it provides a general method for interpolation over nominal solution domains. The performance of the \u2026",

The system relies on two important reasoning principles obtained from the expert: 1) there is a natural hierarchical retrieval mechanism which may be employed; and 2) much of the reasoning on a qualitative level is linear in nature, although the computational solution of the problem is non-linear. The paper describes the qualitative representation of geometric room information on which the system is based, and the principles on which the CBR system operates.",

It is an infographic intelligent crime-reporting analysis application that incorporates crime data sourced from local police, social media and crowdsourcing, including sentiment analysis of Twitter streams in conjunction with historical police crime datasets. An evaluation of the approach suggests that by combining sentiment analysis with smart crime reporting applications, it is possible to improve the forecasting of crime.",

In addition to formulating the temporal order over state-sequences, it also takes into account of temporal distances in terms of both the temporal duration of each state and the temporal gaps between adjacent pairs of states, which are neglected in most existing approaches to time-series and state-sequence matching. In particular, when specialized as a real-penalty-style measurement by means of reifying the cost functions, it is more flexible with regards to real-life applications than binary-value-style distance measurements. In addition, it is more robust than those existing real-penalty-style distance measurements since it can filter out noise during the matching procedure.",

            "Abstract": "Swallowing sound recognition is an important task in bioengineering that could be employed in systems for automated swallowing assessment and diagnosis of abnormally high rate of swallowing (aerophagia)[1], which is the primary mode of ingesting excessive amounts of air, and swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia)[2]-[5], that may lead to aspiration, choking, and even death. Dysphagia represents a major problem in rehabilitation of stroke and head injury patients. In current clinical practice videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) is the gold standard for diagnosis of swallowing disorders. However, VFSS is a ti-consuming procedure performed only in a clinical setting. VFSS also results in some radiation exposure. Therefore, various non-invasive methods are proposed for swallowing assessment based on evaluation of swallowing signals, recorded by microphones and/or accelerometers and analyzed by digital signal processing techniques [2]-[5]. Swallowing sounds are caused by a bolus passing through pharynx. It is possible to use swallowing sounds to determine pharyngeal phase of the swallow and characteristics of the bolus [2].",

It is based primarily on analysing web user behavioural data with the usage of machine learning techniques with the aim to optimise web advertising. Being able to identify \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cfirst time seen\u201d customers is of high importance in online advertising since a successful guess could identify \u201cpossible prospects\u201d who would be more likely to purchase an advertisement\u2019s product. By identifying prospective customers, online advertisers may be able to optimise campaign performance, maximise their revenue as well as deliver advertisements tailored to a variety of user interests. This work presents a hybrid approach benchmarking machine-learning algorithms and attribute preprocessing techniques in the context of behavioural targeting in process oriented environments. The performance of our suggested methodology is evaluated using the key performance metric in online advertising which is the predicted conversion rate. Our experimental results indicate that the presented process mining framework can significantly identify prospect customers in most cases. Our results seem promising, indicating that there is a need for further workflow research in online display advertising.",

Project managers are expected to deliver high quality products in a shorter time with fewer or less expensive resources. Despite the availability of well\u2010established project management frameworks and innovative tools and techniques, software projects still fall short of meeting their time, cost and quality objectives. While there are many studies that treat projects as \u2018black boxes\u2019 and retrospectively analyse the externally apparent characteristics of projects that might influence their success, this work addresses the internal processes of project management. This paper describes the methods developed to conduct an empirical study into the internal dynamics\u2010often reacting to external events\u2010of software project management during project execution focussing on the Design, Build, and Test (DBT) stages of the application development lifecycle. The data used comes from a case study carried out at a large software development company which uses an incremental delivery model with intensive parallel development in a multi\u2010location team environment. The main research concerns of the overall study are the extent to which the project performance indicators currently used provide enough information to project managers to make good decisions, and the range of issues that occur during project execution that affect the project\u2019s ability to achieve its time, cost and quality objectives. This paper discusses the research methods that were eventually adopted. The original intention was to build numerical models \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Social engineering attacks are frequent, well-known and easy-toapply attacks in the cyber domain. Historical evidence of such attacks has shown that the vast majority of malicious attempts against both physical and virtual IT systems were based or been initiated using social engineering methods. By identifying the importance of tackling efficiently cybersecurity threats and using the recent developments in machine learning, case-based reasoning and cybersecurity we propose and demonstrate a two-stage approach that detects social engineering attacks and is based on natural language processing, case-based reasoning and deep learning. Our approach can be applied in offline texts or real time environments and can identify whether a human, chatbot or offline conversation is a potential social engineering attack or not. Initially, the conversation text is parsed and checked for grammatical errors using natural language processing techniques and case-based reasoning and then deep learning is used to identify and isolate possible attacks. Our proposed method is being evaluated using both real and semi-synthetic conversation points with high accuracy results. Comparison benchmarks are also presented for comparisons in both datasets.",

This work presents a novel approach of simulating swarm computing behaviour in a sandbox environment where swarms of robots are challenged to fight against each other with a goal of \u201cconquering\u201d any environment bases. Swarm strategies are being used which are decided, modified and applied at run time. Autonomous swarm agents seem surprisingly applicable to several problems where combined artificial intelligence agents are challenged to generate innovative solutions and evaluate them prior to proposing or adopting the best possible one. This work is applicable in areas where AI agents should make selections close to real time within a range of available options under a multi-constraint, multiobjective mission environment. Relevance to Business Process workflows is also presented and documented.",

Their capability of learning complex patterns and behaviors make them a suitable solution for differentiating between normal traffic and network attacks. In this paper, we have applied a deep autoencoded dense neural network algorithm for detecting intrusion or attacks in network connection and evaluated the algorithm with the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset.

Rather, the system is built on a similarity metric defined directly over pairs of cases. The problems of efficiency, consistency, redundancy, completeness and correctness are discussed for such a system. Performance measures for the CBR system are given, and the results for trials of the system are presented. The competence of the current case-base is discussed, with reference to a representation of cases as points in an n-dimensional feature space, and a Gramian visualisation.

Managing business processes presents a challenge related to the temporal complexity, uncertainty and large volume of data generated. This paper presents new developments and evaluation of an enhanced approach for the intelligent monitoring of business processes using Case-Based Reasoning in the CBR-WIMS platform. A short overview of the CBR-WIMS approach, based on the representation of business process cases as graphs, comprising process events and their temporal relationships is presented. The enhanced similarity measure based on the Maximum Common Sub-graph is presented and an evaluation of its effectiveness and efficiency is shown and discussed. The evaluation uses historical data from a real business process. The paper also discusses the use of a clustering technique in CBR-WIMS. This allows the semi-automatic tagging of cases and so provides enhanced explanation and context to users, increasing the confidence and usability of retrieved solutions and advice. A set of experiments are presented and discussed showing the added value that this enhancement brings to the intelligent monitoring and management of real business processes in an organisation.",

Dust storm behaviour varies based on five attributes. These are wind speed, pressure, temperature, humidity and surface type. Storms can affect heavily congested cities and can cause increased difficulty in outdoor activities and everyday operations. However, their prediction using historical data has not been used yet in a fully efficient and comprehensive way. This study examines the process of both predicting and identifying dust storms using historical dust events through the combination of hybrid artificial intelligence networks combining Bayesian networks (BN) with a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach. Their outcomes are then being utilised to ignite appropriate policy making against dust-storm events \u2026",

Consequently, the number of fraud cases has also increased, causing billion of dollar losses each year worldwide, although from Literature, there has been substantial work in the domain of fraud detection by both the industry and academia\u2019s. Despite the substantial work, there are few researches in applying case-based reasoning (CBR) approach in the context of detecting Financial Fraud. In this paper we aim at evaluating the performance of CBR in Identifying fraudulent patterns among financial transaction by comparing it with logistic regression (LR) and neural network (NN) which are often used in many related work. To evaluate our approach simulated data, based on a sample of real anonymous transaction provided by a bank was used and the result shows that LR outperformed NN and CBR model, with a steady increase in precision, sensitivity and specificity as the percentage ratio for the training and test data were varied. This was due to the linearity, fuzziness and presence of uncertainty in the sampling dataset. Therefore, we can reach a conclusion that part of the possible reasons why there are few research in applying CBR to the context of detecting financial fraud patterns may be due to incomplete information, fuzziness and uncertainty in the available data sets used for experimentation.",

In so doing, our paper contributes to more robust strategies in investigating financial bubbles. The framework uses a geometric pattern description of historical time series and applies clustering techniques to derive a model that generalizes those patterns onto observations.

The novel feature of this research is that cases are represented as structures in a relational database of products, components and materials. The paper proposes a method for extending the usual \"weighted sum\" over attribute similarities for a \u00b7single table to encompass relational structures over several tables. The capabilities of the system are discussed, particularly with respect to differing user objectives, such as cost estimation, CAD, cutting scheme re-use, and initial design. It is shown that specification of a target case as a relational structure combined with suitable weights can fulfil several user functions. However, it is also shown that some user functions cannot satisfactorily be specified via a single target case. For these functions it is proposed to allow the specification of a set of target cases. A derived similarity measure between individuals and sets of cases is proposed.",

            "Abstract": "Determining the optimal number of hidden nodes is the most challenging aspect of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) design. To date, there are still no reliable methods of determining this a priori, as it depends on so many domain-specific factors. Current methods which take these into account, such as exhaustive search, growing and pruning and evolutionary algorithms are not only inexact, but also extremely time consuming -- in some cases prohibitively so. A novel approach embodied in a system called Heurix is introduced. This rapidly predicts the optimal number of hidden nodes from a small number of sample topologies. It can be configured to favour speed (low complexity), accuracy, or a balance between the two. Single hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) can be built twenty times faster, and with a generalisation error of as little as 0.4% greater than those found by exhaustive search.",

This study is based on the police data, collected from different sources. The proposed solution can capture the semantic similarity distance between the crimes from the crime database in order to put the selected crime in the right category. We focussed on the crime features and the description of each crime. We will also implement one of Deep Learning algorithms the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) algorithm, on top of a labelled crime data that is captured from online police data source. The crime data are labelled using a previous solution presented in a previous work in order to prepare the data to be introduced to RNN algorithm. The proposed solution can capture the semantic similarity distance between the crimes from the crime database in order to put the selected crime in the right category. We focussed on the crime features and the description of each crime. In elaborated experiments, the researchers built tools based on RNN as well as proposed algorithm from previous research, which implements RNN on a top layer and Natural Language Processing based Text Mining on the lower layer. The experiment results so that there is a speed up in RNN training time with an increasing number of threads and CPU cores used.

In this paper, we propose an approach that combines virtualization on the existing software infrastructure such as Pilot Jobs with minimum change on the part of resource providers.

Moreover, design patterns can improve software documentation, speed up the development process and enable large-scale reuse of software architectures. This paper presents a Multiple Levels Detection Approach (MLDA) to recover design pattern instances from Java source code. The novelty behind MLDA is its ability to extract design pattern instances based on a generated class level representation of an investigated system. Specifically, MLDA presents what is the so-called Structural Search Model (SSM) which incrementally builds the structure of each design pattern based on the generated source code model.

To assist with this, in this paper we describe a novel workflow application to address the tasks of high solution accuracy and shorter prediction resolution time. We describe how workflows can be generated to assist experts and how our solution can scale over time to produce domain-specific reusable cases for similar problems.

Both public and private companies are highly concerned on how travel patterns, vehicle-passenger behaviours and other relevant phenomena such as weather affect their performance since usually any travel network can be remarkably expensive to build and swiftly saturated after its public release. We propose suitable workflow similarity metrics for developing efficient performance measures for the rail industry using extensive business process workflow pattern analysis based on Case-based Reasoning. We use meta-heuristic features and extend our similarity measures to capture relevant-to-the-industry granular features and apply this work to an industrial case study. Preliminary results of this work are promising since they perform well with the complexity of the problem and can scale on demand while providing an efficient predictive accuracy. Several modelling experiments are presented, that show that the approach proposed here can provide a sound basis for the effective and useful analysis of operational sensor data from train Journeys.",

The paper describes example problems faced by design engineers in this context and the issues that need to be considered in this approach.

This paper presents preliminary results toward the building a reliable forward problem on ensemble approach IPCBR model, that leverages the capabilities of Case based Reasoning(CBR) and Inverse Problem Techniques (IPTs) to describe and model abnormal stock market fluctuations (often associated with asset bubbles) using datasets from historical stock market prices. The framework uses a rich set of past observations and geometric pattern description and then applies a CBR to formulate the forward problem, Inverse Problem formulation is then applied to identify a set of parameters that can statistically be associated with the occurrence of the observed patterns.  This research work presents a formative strategy aimed to determine the causes of behaviour, rather than predict future time series points which brings a novel perspective to the problem of asset bubbles predictability, and a deviation from the existing research trend.

In particular, in the domain of Artificial Intelligence, temporal knowledge may be uncertain and incomplete due to the unavailability of complete and absolute temporal information. This paper introduces an inferential framework for deriving logical explanations from partial temporal information. Based on a graphical representation which allows expression of both absolute and relative temporal knowledge in incomplete forms, the system can deliver a verdict to the question if a given set of statements is temporally consistent or not, and provide understandable logical explanation of analysis by simplified contradiction and rule based reasoning.",

Based on a time theory that takes both points and intervals as primitive, this paper introduces a graphical representation for uncertain and incomplete temporal knowledge, which allows logical expressions of both absolute and relative temporal relations, including both logical conjunctions and disjunctions. The consistency of any given collection of uncertain and incomplete temporal knowledge depends on if there is at one temporal scenario that is temporal consistent, where a consistency checker for temporal scenarios is provided.",

            "Abstract": "Generally speaking, the term temporal logic refers to any system of rules and symbolism for representing and reasoning about propositions qualified in terms of time. In computer science, particularly in the domain of Artificial Intelligence, there are mainly two known approaches to the representation of temporal information: modal logic approaches including tense logic and hybrid temporal logic, and predicate logic approaches including temporal arguement method and reified temporal logic. On one hand, while tense logic, hybrid temporal logic and temporal argument method enjoy formal theoretical foundations, their expressiveness has been criticised as not power enough for representing general temporal knowledge; on the other hand, although reified temporal logic provides greater expressive power, most of the current systems following the temporal reification lack of complete and sound axiomatic theories. With there observations in mind, a new reified temporal logic with clear syntax and semantics in terms of a sound and complete axiomatic formalism is introduced in this paper, which retains all the expressive power of temporal reification.",

MLDA is able to extract design pattern instances based on a generated class level representation of an investigated system. Specifically, MLDA presents what is the so-called Structural Search Model (SSM) which incrementally builds the structure of each design pattern based on the generated source code model. Moreover, MLDA uses a rule-based approach to match the method signatures of the candidate design instances to that of the subject system. As the experiment results illustrate, MLDA \u2026",

The framework uses a diverse set of features including information on users, the content they generate while communicating, question tags, spatial and temporal features. Then these features are used as input for training predictive models by various machine learning algorithms. As a case study, three diverse Q&A communities from Stack Exchange are selected to test the framework.

Although, recommender systems have been discovered in many aspects, the popularity bias is still one of the challenges that need to be considered. Therefore, we proposed a novel model that applies a switching technique to solve the long tail recommendation problem (LTRP) when collaborative filtering fails to find the target case using a multi-level method. We evaluate the results using the public dataset 100K Movielens. Our result outperforms all the existing methods through reducing the recommendation error rates for the items in the long tail. ",

The research and practice bodies of knowledge need to match that complexity if they are to provide practical solutions to the challenges facing such projects. This research investigates the interdependent influences exerted on project progress that emerge during project execution and cause schedule delay. This paper aims to demonstrate the value of integrating different research methods and techniques from the technical and social domains in order to address such complexity, in particular the utility of actor\u2011network theory (ANT) to expose the influencing factors on project schedule delay. The research approach (Mixed method) was applied to empirical data from a global software provider, integrating quantitative analysis (project metrics) with qualitative analysis (grounded theory) and culminating in the development of an explanation model (ANT). The findings demonstrate that considerable benefit can be gained from the fuller understanding of the management dynamics during project execution provided by this approach. ANT makes researchers look at the networks of influence at play between human and nonhuman elements of the project, thus offering a richer picture of the project.",

Recent developments in distributed computing technologies have shown capable for efficiency gains from effective distribution. Current models of CBR distribution are discussed and an extension is proposed focusing on the challenge posed from large data volumes. This is shown to be also associated with more challenges in the quality of data and the requirement for real time processing. The proposed approach is presented and a novel architecture for distribution of CBR systems is proposed. An evaluation of the approach and architecture is conducted and presented based on a set of experiments in the area of business process workflow management. The experiments establish a serial execution baseline and show promising high speedup gains, especially at large volumes (exceeding millions) of cases. It is shown that at high enough data volumes, there is a clear benefit of distributing some of the early parts of the CBR life cycle to a finer data and process granularity level. Such approach seems to maximise the benefit from the use of modern distribution technologies. Concluding, this paper signposts future areas of research leading to a more generic model that can maximise the efficiency gains of distribution in CBR systems.",

The paper presents the CBR-WIMS approach to the monitoring of business workflows using Case-based Reasoning (CBR). This approach re-uses knowledge from previous known business workflow executions by identifying similarity between event traces, taken from workflow executions. The case representation and similarity measures are presented along with the Case-based process for retrieval of similar traces. The explanation features of the CBR-WIMS framework are illustrated through two application case studies. A new CBR-WIMS enhancement providing additional explanation is shown. The enhancement involves the use of clustering algorithms and tagging of clusters. This supports contextual knowledge that helps to provide partial explanation to retrieved similar cases, as well as an insight into possible action recommendations. Finally, the provenance of cases and its use within CBR-WIMS to establish the context of particular retrieved cases is explained. The evaluation of the explanation capabilities of CBR-WIMS is presented through two real application case studies. The results are discussed and further work planned to enhance further the explanation capabilities of CBRWIMS is presented.",

The special feature of this system is that similarity is derived primarily from graph matching algorithms. The special problem of such a system is that it does not operate on search indices that may be derived from single cases and then used for visualisation and principle component analyses. Rather, the system is built on a similarity metric defined directly over pairs of cases. The problems of efficiency, consistency, redundancy, completeness and correctness are discussed for such a system. Performance measures for the CBR system are given, and the results for trials of the system are presented. The competence of the current casebase is discussed, with reference to a representation of cases as points in an n-dimensional feature space, and a Gramian visualisation. A refinement of the case base is performed as a result of the competence analysis and the performance of the case-base before and after refinement is compared.",

Dynamic workflows are being used increasingly due to their flexibility in a working environment where they minimize mundane tasks like long-term maintenance and increase productivity by automatically responding to changes and introducing new processes. Constant changes within unstable environments where information may be sparse, inconsistent and uncertain can create a bottleneck to a workflow in predicting behaviours effectively. Within a business environment, automatic applications like customer support, complex incidents can be regarded as instances of a dynamic process since mitigation policies have to be responsive and adequate to any case no matter its unique nature. Support engineers work with any means at their disposal to solve any emerging case and define a custom prioritization strategy, to achieve the best possible result. This paper describes a novel workflow architecture for heavy knowledge-related application workflows to address the tasks of high solution accuracy and shorter prediction resolution time. We describe how policies can be generated against cases deriving from heterogeneous workflows to assist experts and domain-specific reusable cases can be generated for similar problems. Our work is evaluated using data from real business process workflows across a large number of different cases and working environments.",

Although this approach has been widely applied, there are still limitations to be overcome in this research area. Accuracy is still one of the areas that need to be improved. In addition, the rapid growth of information available online presents recommender systems with several challenges. More specifically, data sparsity and coverage affect the quality of the recommendations that can be provided. In this paper, we propose an item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF) approach with triangle similarity measures that take into account the length and angle of rating vectors between users and allow positive and negative adjustments using a multi-level recommendation approach. We have improved the predictive accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms all \u2026",

An MHCBR framework is proposed. This framework includes sub-processes for subscribing of provider case-bases through agents, creating a dynamic structure, and retrieving solutions by using agents and employing a Blackboard communication architecture.A mechanism based on the competence of a provider case base is introduced to improve MHCBR performance. A negotiation system to support the retrieval process from each source case base of the MHCBR is proposed. ProMHCBR, a MHCBR system employing agents is discussed and an experimental evaluation of this system is presented.",

The ever-growing data generation and its utilisation have increased the complexity of workflow domains leading to an increased interest in distributed approaches for efficient workflow monitoring. Existing work has proposed a CBR enhancement to tackle deficiencies in areas where data volumes increase significantly. In such areas, the notion of a \u201cdata volume\u201d component was proposed in an enhanced CBR architecture. This work proceeds further by evaluating a proposed distributed CBR lifecycle based on GPU programming to abstract further and evaluate the hypothesis that: increased data volumes can be tackled efficiently using distributed case bases and processing on demand. Our proposed approach is evaluated against previous work and it shows promising speedup gains. This paper signposts future research areas in distributed CBR paradigms.",

Our conference officers selected the best 15 papers from those papers accepted for presentation at the conference in order to publish them in this volume. The papers were chosen based on review scores submitted by members of the program committee, and underwent further rounds of rigorous review. In Chapter 1, Cai Luyuan et al. Present a new method of shape decomposition based on a refined morphological shape decomposition process. In Chapter 2, Kazunori Iwata et al. propose a method for reducing the margin of error in effort and error prediction models for embedded software development projects using artificial neural networks (ANNs). In Chapter 3, Viliam \u0160imko et al. describe a model-driven tool that allows system code to be generated from use-cases in plain English. In Chapter 4, Abir Smiti and Zied Elouedi propose a Case Base Maintenance (CBM) method that uses machine learning techniques to preserve the maximum competence of a system. In Chapter 5, Shagufta Henna and Thomas Erlebach provide a simulation based analysis of some widely used broadcasting schemes within mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and propose adaptive extensions to an existing broadcasting algorithm.",

The framework is based on a simple time model which characterizes each time element as a subset of the set of real numbers and allows expression of both absolute time values and relative temporal relations. The formalism presented here formally specifies the so-called most general temporal constraint (GTC), which guarantees the common-sense assertion that \u201cthe beginning of the effect cannot precede the beginning of the cause\u201d. It is shown that there are in fact 8 possible causal relationships which satisfy GTC, including cases where, on the one hand, effects start simultaneously with, during, immediately after, or some time after their causes, and on the other hand, events end before, simultaneously with, or after their causes. The causal relationships characterized in this paper are versatile enough to subsume those representatives in the literature.",

To illustrate this concept a hybrid approach is proposed using a combination of case-based reasoning and artificial neural networks which indirectly estimate the similarity among past storm cases with any new ones. Our approach reveals that case-based reasoning may have a solid potential of being used in successful prediction and possible mitigation of extreme weather forecasting.",

            "Abstract": " Recommender systems help users find relevant items efficiently based on their interests and historical interactions. They can also be beneficial to businesses by promoting the sale of products. Recommender systems can be modelled by applying different approaches, including collaborative filtering (CF), demographic filtering (DF), content-based filtering (CBF) and knowledge-based filtering (KBF). However, large amounts of data can produce recommendations that are limited in accuracy because of diversity and sparsity issues. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach that combines user-user CF with the attributes of DF to indicate the nearest users, and compare the Random Forest classifier against the kNN classifier, developed through an investigation of ways to reduce the errors in rating predictions based on users past interactions. Our combined method leads to improved prediction \u2026",

Accessing Multiple Case Bases should not require a change to their data structure. This paper presents an investigation into applying Case-Based Reasoning to Multiple Heterogeneous Case Bases. A case study is presented to illustrate and evaluate the approach.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present current research using the ShapeCBR system that automates the process of creation and selection of cases to populate a CBR system for retrieval of 3D shapes to assist with the design of metal castings. The special feature of this system is that similarity is derived primarily from graph matching algorithms. The particular problem of such a system is that it does not operate on simple search indices that may be derived from single cases and then used for visualisation and principal component analyses. Rather, the system is built on a similarity metric defined directly over pairs of cases and is primarily structural. An overview of previous research in this area is presented. This demonstrates the feasibility of a CBR approach to the design of metal castings. This paper describes further research into the use of the traditional componentisation as used in method engineering to provide a shape representation suitable for efficient retrieval of design knowledge. The paper presents current work aiming mainly at enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the similarity metrics used in the ShapeCBR system. The architecture of the ShapeCBR system is presented. Finally, performance measures for the CBR system and the metrics used are given, and the results of trials of the system are presented and compared to results obtained from previous research.",

Firstly, a graphical representation for key-frames extracted from zone-defense video clips is introduced, where each key-frame is expressed in terms of a zone-defense graph, representing the positions of defenders and the ball. Secondly, defense-lines are defined and extracted from zone-defense graphs for each zone-defense strategy, based on which, a 10-dimentional feature vector with respect to the defense-lines is introduced to characterize the structure relationships. Experiments have been conducted for basketball zone-defense strategy detection on both simulated and real-life basketball zone-defense video database, which demonstrate the validation and practicability of such a structure based feature characterization, and, in particular, its robustness with respect to the disturbance of local transformation of subprime nodes in the graphs.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe a system to assist the engineer in solving the design problem of pneumatic conveyors. The system is an example of how case-based reasoning (CBR) systems can collaborate with numerical models in order to increase their usability. It is shown how the CBR system is produced from a numerical model, and how it can solve several problems not directly addressed by the numerical model alone. These problems are those of inverse queries, and queries in the presence of constraints.  The paper also discusses the solution to several difficulties which arose in querying the CBR system. These are connected with interpolation over nominal values and with interpolation in the presence of constraints. These problems are discussed generally, and examples of their solution for the pneumatic conveyor are presented in detail.  This paper describes a CBR system developed on the back of a numerical model for pneumatic conveyors. Computational models of physical processes are an important tool for engineers in many the design of physical systems. They are often complex pieces of software, needing a considerable degree of knowledge and understanding to solve a specific engineering problem. The models are often deterministic in nature, so that they produce unknown outputs, from given specified inputs. The engineer will often use considerable skill in using such the model to solve a particular problem. Sometimes the model will be used in a trial and error fashion, attempting to find the right inputs for a given set of outputs ( i.e. the inverse problem). Often only some of the inputs and some of the outputs will be known, or \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper aims to answer the following research question:\u201cCan the standard CBR models be generalised to a unified (problem: solution) space to allow flexible query modes?\u201cIn the standard Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) model, a case is represented as a< problem, solution> pair. The problem space and solution space are treated as separate, and nearest neighbours are retrieved using a metric defined on the problem space. The standard method applies to domains where the similarity assumption is valid: that cases which are near in the problem space are also near in the solution space. This presumes that a metric is also defined in the solution space. In this paper a generalisation of the standard CBR retrieval method, which integrates solution space and retrieval space into a single query space is proposed. The retrieval method is proposed by means of the concept of nearest neighbours to a constraint region. It is shown that the standard CBR retrieval is a special case of this more general model. The advantages of the general model are explained in connection with its more general query modes.",

Swarm strategies are being used which are decided, modified and applied at run time. Autonomous swarm agents seem surprisingly applicable to several problems where combined artificial intelligence agents are challenged to generate innovative solutions and evaluate them prior to proposing or adopting the best possible one. This work is applicable in areas where AI agents should make selections close to real time within a range of available options under a multi-constraint, multi-objective mission environment.
