Our design introduces concepts from Peer-to-Peer computing in order to provide a scalable and reliable infrastructure for storage, search and retrieval of annotated content. To ensure fast file lookups in the distributed repositories, our system incorporates a multidimensional indexing scheme which serves the need for supporting both exact match and range queries over a group of metadata attributes. Finally, file transfers are conducted using GridTorrent, a grid-enabled, Peer-to-Peer mechanism that performs efficient data transfers by enabling cooperation among participating nodes and balances the cost of file transfer among them. The proposed architecture is the middleware component used by the GREDIA project, in which both media and banking partners plan to share large \u2026",

The dimension k is selected differently in each method giving various results. The projected space is divided into discrete groups of related iterations, which are assigned to different processors. Two of the methods preserve optimal time completion, by scheduling loop iterations according to the hyperplane method.

As information is not necessarily generated and processed centrally, data resources need to be scattered among various data storage facilities. Data objects may also need to be copied from one facility to the other\u2013\u201creplicated\u201d at a site\u2013in order to be evaluated by local VO participants or unique to the site instruments and computing devices. While the main objective when replicating data to remote processes is to reduce aggregate network usage and boost end-application performance, replicas can also be exploited in favor of resiliency to network and site failures and increased data transfer throughput. Nevertheless, managing replicas in highly distributed data storage environments can be very complex. The processes involved in creating, locating, retrieving and updating replicas must guarantee both scalability and fault-tolerance. In this paper, we investigate the requirements of a Grid-centric, replica-based data storage and retrieval infrastructure, present the current trends and implementations and elaborate on how future architectures can capitalize on peer-to-peer technologies in order to achieve even higher levels of scale, without the need of deploying special data management servers.",

Many scientific algorithms, especially nested loops, which require nearest-neighbor communication in a lattice space, are modeled by a task graph or iteration space with the properties of a grid. We consider the nested loop model with unit dependencies thus having an iteration space with the form of a n-dimensional grid. The exact model is that of generalized grids with diagonal edges, allowing unequal boundaries for each dimension. We survey the optimal time scheduling techniques for UET-UCT (unit execution time-unit communication time) grid topologies, using unbounded and bounded number of processors, without allowing task duplication. UET-UCT scheduling of generalized n-dimensional grids is low complexity tractable.",

Central Macedonia has been hard hit by the economic crisis with already below average GDP and above average unemployment being further worsened by a surge in unemployment since 2008. This weak performance is due largely to the slow pace of restructuring from low to medium technology intensive towards higher-tech manufacturing. Although the regional economy is increasingly dominated by services the bulk of activity is in fields such as retail trade, tourism and transport services despite efforts to create or attract knowledge intensive services.In terms of industrial specialisation, the manufacturing sector remains highly specialised in certain medium-to-low technology and labour-intensive sectors, such as the food industry, textiles & clothing, non-metallic mineral products and furniture, with lower productivity than the national average. However, there a number of new knowledge-intensive sectors like bio-agriculture, bio-medicine, and ICT that seem promising but still attract relatively limited investment. The region has certainly made efforts to support ICT based development, for instance through the Regional Innovation Pole.",

Due to the dynamic structure of the peer-to-peer systems that usually form the backbone of volunteer computing, obtaining accurate distance metrics using traditional techniques is infeasible. Thus, techniques that could improve system performance, such as dynamic load balancing, are very difficult to implement. We show that the master-worker paradigm used by the overwhelming majority of volunteer computing applications results in certain network topology and protocol characteristics that render distance measurement method with zero network overhead feasible and preferable. Therefore, we present a simple distance measurement method that is based on passive monitoring of application-level traffic. We subsequently test the method using simulation as well as a reference implementation \u2026",

This method is based on loop mapping for systolic arrays. The virtual array of cells is derived from the index space, by applying a linear transformation. This array is divided (cut) into a fixed number of clusters, equal to the number of available real processors. The basic idea of our method is that the cutting is performed along properly selected boundary directions, so as to minimize inter-cluster communication and equilibrate the number of virtual cells for every cluster. Each cluster is then assigned to a different processor, which performs in a roughly independent manner, as the communication requirements are now minimized. This mapping cuts down overall communication delays, while using a fixed number of processors from a (n-1)-dimensional mesh-connected distributed architecture.",

The recognition of data content requires prior knowledge and special techniques in Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition, which usually require long computing time. Second, since several audio features can be used as indices [3](such as pitch, amplitude, and frequency), a method or processing technique designed and developed for one feature may not be appropriate for another. Third, the extremely large data size and the use of a similarity search require extensive computation. Similarity matching is based upon the computation of the distance between a query and each record in the database; the best match is in the data set with the smallest distances.

In areas such as the analysis of natural languages, or speech recognition, the syntactic approach gains wide interest by the scientific community. The complexity of the patterns and the wide variety of the features that characterize them, makes impractical the use of common decision-theoretic approaches [1]. In many applications, such as the processing of biomedical signals (eg, ECG, EEG, eta), Syntactic methods have been considered as an alternative way of simultaneous detection and classification of some characteristic complexes of these signals. The kernel of all such methods is the parsing algorithm, which is responsible for analyzing the complex object into a sequence of primitive patterns. The complexity of the parsing procedure depends on the class of the underlying grammar. Context-free grammars combine satisfactorily both the expressive power and the simplicity in their analysis. They can describe many features of natural languages and are widely used in Syntactic pattern recognition applications.",

We use computational geometry methods, that exploit efficiently the regularity of nested loops index spaces, in order to significantly reduce the communication cost, which in most cases is the main drawback of parallel programs' performance. Through extensive testing, we show that the proposed method outperforms in all cases the classic cyclic mapping, succeeding to reduce the communication by 15%-35%. This significant reduction of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents Chain Grouping, a new low complexity method for the problem of partitioning the loop iteration space into groups with little intercommunication requirements, for mapping onto mesh-connected architectures. First, the iterations are scheduled in time, according to the hyperplane method, taking into consideration the minimum time displacement. Then, the iteration space is divided into discrete groups of related iterations, which are assigned to different processors, while preserving the optimal completion time. Chain Grouping is based on clustering together neighboring uniform chains of iterations, formed by a particular dependence vector. This vector will be proven as the best among all to reduce the total communication requirements. Inside every group, the optimal hyperplane scheduling is preserved and references to intragroup iterations are considerably increased. The partitioned groups are \u2026",

Their benefit is the ability to use the information contained in all simultaneously acquired channels. In this paper we present a multichannel version of a nonsyntactic algorithm, based on length transformation. The proposed algorithm uses a decentralized schema for combining the results derived from each individual lead, instead of a global/centralized one (a spatial vector approach). Its performance was evaluated using the CSE database and real ECGs acquired by a 12-lead cardiograph. The results are also compared with previous\u2014single-channel and multichannel\u2014versions of the algorithm, showing a better performance. Since a multichannel algorithm is always a time-consuming task, it is rarely used in real-time monitoring systems. Motivated by this observation, we designed a parallel implementation of \u2026",

The exascale system is projected to have millions of nodes, with thousands of cores for each node. At such an extreme scale, the substantial amount of concurrency can cause a critical contention issue for I/O system. This study proposes a dynamically coordinated I/O architecture for addressing some of the limitations that current parallel file systems and storage architectures are facing with very large-scale systems. The fundamental idea is to coordinate I/O accesses according to the topology/profile of the infrastructure, the load metrics, and the I/O demands of each application. The measurements have shown that by using IKAROS approach we can fully utilize the provided I/O and network resources, minimize disk and network contention, and achieve better performance.",

Each SMP node has multiple CPUs and a single memory mapped PCI-SCI Network Interface Card. We apply a hyperplane-based grouping transformation to the tiled space, so as to group together independent neighboring tiles and assign them to the same SMP node. In this way, intranode (intragroup) communication is annihilated. Groups are atomically executed inside each node. Nodes exchange data between successive group computations. We schedule groups much more efficiently by exploiting the inherent overlapping between communication and computation phases among successive atomic group executions. The applied non-blocking schedule resembles a pipelined datapath, where group computation phases are overlapped with communication ones, instead of being \u2026",

It is therefore of interest to try to parallelize the nested loops in order to reduce the overall computation time. A special category of FOR (DO) nested loops are the uniform dependence loops, which yield efficient parallelization techniques and are the focus of this paper. The primary goals in this area of research are:(1) achieving the optimal parallel time and (2) minimizing the number of processing elements required for the execution of the parallel program. In this paper we present a new dynamic lower bound on the number of processors needed for scheduling and we use a decision algorithm to verify that all uniform dependence loops can achieve this bound.",

In the past, too many approaches were devoted in efficient program parallelization considering various models for the parallel programs and the target architectures. The most widely used parallelism description model is the task graph model with precedence constraints. Nevertheless, as far as physical mapping of tasks onto parallel architectures is concerned little research has given practical results. It is well known that the physical mapping problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, thus allowing only for heuristic approaches. Most researchers or tool programmers use exhaustive algorithms, or the classical method of simulated annealing. This paper presents an alternative approach onto the mapping problem.

Already in cases of chronic disease management the regular use of mHealth and telemonitoring approaches is very common facilitating the constant patient monitoring and enabling the use of innovative features for patients, medical experts and caregivers. Remote communication is essential as it allows the prevention or/and the precise treatment of patients. The power efficiency, the computing capabilities and the affordability of modern biosignals sensors, portable computing machines and IoT devices allows for the development of advanced and compelling solutions in the area of mHealth and patient telemonitoring.

Instruments on the Grid are virtualized resources similar to storage and computing devices, and can be part of composite services or workflows concurrently invoked by multiple users in such Service-Oriented environments. The requirement for real-time, interactive control of instruments poses a need for exclusive or limited access by concurrent clients. Unfortunately, instrument modeling and standardization of instrument reservation and management are still in a very early stage. According to a number of use case requirements, which we review in this work, we propose a standards-compliant model for the representation of instruments on the Grid, and we describe a set of primitives for their reservation.

            "Abstract": "Computing Grids are hardware and software infrastructures that support secure sharing and concurrent access to distributed services by a large number of competing users from different virtual organizations. Concurrency can easily lead to overload and resource shortcomings in large-scale Grid infrastructures, as today\u2019s Grids do not offer differentiated services. We propose a framework for supporting quality of service guarantees via both reservation and discovery of best-effort services based on the matchmaking of application requirements and quality of service performance profiles of the candidate services. We illustrate the middleware components needed to support both strict and loose guarantees and the performance assessment techniques for the discovery of suitable services.",

The introduced platform encompasses the principles of heterogeneous Workflow Management Systems (WFMSs) and the peer-to-peer paradigm to enhance collaboration among healthcare professionals. The novelty of the presented work is that: (i) it combines the concept of client side computing with the microservices architectural pattern to enhance user experience, while increasing the efficiency of healthcare provision, and that (ii) it could be considered the springboard of an ecosystem of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) services in medicine. The paper discusses the implementation details and the technological aspects behind the whole system, along with some initial evaluation results.",

Constructionism asserts that knowledge is not simply transmitted from teacher to student, but is actively constructed in the mind of the learner.

This happens due to the fact that designers demand interaction at both the specification and implementation level.

            "Abstract": "Static algorithms have been proposed to parallelize loops with uniform dependencies for networks of workstations. However, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of these networks demands a dynamic solution to the scheduling and load balancing problem. At the same time many dynamic scheduling algorithms have been proposed, but all of them are dealing with programs with parallel loops, i.e. loops without dependencies. In this paper we extend the applicability of dynamic algorithms by presenting a dynamic scheduling algorithm that uses simple data structures in order to handle programs with data dependencies. Experimental results validate the proposed algorithm in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks.",

This method is based on loop mapping for systolic arrays. The virtual array of cells is derived from the index space, by applying a linear transformation. This array is divided (cut) into a fixed number of clusters, equal to the number of available real processors. The basic idea of our method is that the cutting is performed along properly selected boundary directions, so as to minimize inter-cluster communication and equilibrate the number of virtual cells for every cluster. Each cluster is then assigned to a different processor, which performs in a roughly independent manner, as the communication requirements are now minimized. This mapping cuts down overall communication delays, while using a fixed number of processors from a (n-1)-dimensional mesh \u2026",
