A crucial step of this method is to compute the roots of a special type of class field polynomials with the most commonly used being the Hilbert and Weber ones. These polynomials are uniquely determined by the CM discriminant D. In this paper, we consider a variant of the CM method for constructing elliptic curves (ECs) of prime order using Weber polynomials. In attempting to construct prime-order ECs using Weber polynomials, two difficulties arise (in addition to the necessary transformations of the roots of such polynomials to those of their Hilbert counterparts). The first one is that the requirement of prime order necessitates that D\u22613mod8), which gives Weber polynomials with degree three times larger than the degree of their corresponding Hilbert polynomials (a fact that could affect \u2026",

The computational techniques we developed are applied to several examples including Fermat curves, p-cyclic covers of the affine line and to Lehr\u2013Matignon curves.The aim of this paper is the study of equivariant equicharacteristic infinitesimal deformations of a curve X of genus g, admitting a group of automorphisms. This paper is the result of my attempt to understand the work of J. Bertin and A. M\u00e9zard [2000] and of G. Cornelissen and F. Kato [2003]. Let X be a smooth projective algebraic curve, defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p\u2265 0. The infinitesimal deformations of the curve X, without considering compatibility with the group action, correspond to directions on the vector space H1 (X, X) which constitutes \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p\u2265 0. A generalized Fermat curve of type (k, n), where k, n\u2265 2 are integers (for p\u2260 0 we also assume that k is relatively prime to p), is a non-singular irreducible projective algebraic curve F k, n defined over K admitting a group of automorphisms H\u2245 Z k n so that F k, n/H is the projective line with exactly (n+ 1) cone points, each one of order k. Such a group H is called a generalized Fermat group of type (k, n). If (n\u2212 1)(k\u2212 1)> 2, then F k, n has genus g n, k> 1 and it is known to be non-hyperelliptic. In this paper, we prove that every generalized Fermat curve of type (k, n) has a unique generalized Fermat group of type (k, n) if (k\u2212 1)(n\u2212 1)> 2 (for p> 0 we also assume that k\u2212 1 is not a power of p). Generalized Fermat curves of type (k, n) can be described as a suitable fiber product of (n\u2212 1) classical Fermat curves of degree k. We prove that, for (k\u2212 1)(n\u2212 1)> 2 (for p> 0 \u2026",
