            "Abstract": "The Extensible Markup Language (XML) tends to become a widely accepted formalism for the representation and exchange of data over the Web. A problem that often arises in practice is the representation in XML of data that are context-dependent (for example, information that exists in many different languages, in many degrees of detail, and so on). In this paper we propose an extension of XML, namely MXML or Multidimensional XML, which can be used in order to alleviate the problem of representing such context-dependent (or multidimensional) data. Apart from its usefulness in the semistructured data domain, MXML also reveals some new and promising research directions in the area of multidimensional languages.",

Recently, it was demonstrated by Rondogiannis and Symeonidou that Bezem's technique can be extended to higher-order logic programs with negation, retaining its extensional properties, provided that it is interpreted under a logic with an infinite number of truth values. Rondogiannis and Symeonidou also demonstrated that Bezem's technique, when extended under the stable model semantics, does not in general lead to extensional stable models. In this paper, we consider the problem of extending Bezem's technique under the well-founded semantics. We demonstrate that the well-founded extension fails to retain extensionality in the general case. On the positive side, we demonstrate that for stratified higher-order logic programs, extensionality is indeed achieved. We analyze the reasons of the failure of extensionality in the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Boolean grammars extend context-free grammars by allowing conjunction and negation in rule bodies. This new formalism appears to be quite expressive and still efficient from a parsing point of view. Therefore, it seems reasonable to hope that boolean grammars can lead to more expressive tools that can facilitate the compilation process of modern programming languages. One important aspect concerning the theory of boolean grammars is their semantics. More specifically, the existence of negation makes it difficult to define a simple derivation-style semantics (such as for example in the case of context-free grammars). There have already been proposed a number of different semantic approaches in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to present the basic ideas behind each method and identify certain interesting problems that can be the object of further study in this area.",

We argue that one can define simple and natural new continuous operators by using a small set of operators that are easily shown to be continuous. Finally, we demonstrate that despite the fact that the underlying truth domain and the set of possible interpretations of a PrefLog program are infinite, we can define a terminating bottom-up proof procedure for implementing a significant and useful fragment of the language.",

In this paper, we propose lexicographic logic, an extension of classical propositional logic that can express a variety of preferences, most notably lexicographic ones. The proposed logic supports a simple new connective whose semantics can be defined in terms of finite lists of truth values. We demonstrate that, despite the well-known theoretical limitations that pose barriers to the quantitative representation of lexicographic preferences, there exists a subset of the rational numbers over which the proposed new connective can be naturally defined. Lexicographic logic can be used to define in a simple way some well-known preferential operators, like \" and if possible \", and \" or failing that \". Moreover, many other hierarchical preferential operators can be defined using a systematic approach.

For these reasons we define temporal stratification, an intermediate notion between stratification and local stratification. We demonstrate that for the temporal deductive databases we consider, temporal stratification coincides with local stratification in certain important cases in which the latter is polynomial-time decidable.

The truth values below Zero are ordered like the countable ordinals. The values above Zero have exactly the reverse order.

            "Abstract": "We introduce locally stratified Boolean grammars, a natural subclass of Boolean grammars with many desirable properties. Informally, if a grammar is locally stratified then the set of all pairs of the form (nonterminal, string) of the grammar can be mapped to a (possibly infinite) set of strata so as that the following holds: if the membership of a string w in the language defined by nonterminal A depends on the membership of string w\u2032 in the language defined by nonterminal B, then (B, w\u2032) cannot belong to a stratum higher than the stratum of (A, w); furthermore, if the above dependency is obtained through negation,(B, w\u2032) must belong to a stratum lower than the stratum of (A, w). We prove that local stratifiability can be tested in linear time with respect to the size of the given grammar. We then develop the semantics of locally stratified grammars and prove that it is independent of the choice of the stratification mapping \u2026",

The Doubter, on his move, chooses one of the variables in the body of the rule and doubts it in turn. The Believer wins by eventually forcing the Doubter to doubt a fact.

In this paper we remedy the above two deficiencies, obtaining a transformation algorithm that is applicable to mainstream lazy functional languages. The proposed transformation initially uses defunctionalization in order to eliminate higher-order functions from the source program.

These lattices arise naturally in many non-monotonic formalisms, such as normal logic programs, higher-order logic programs with negation, and boolean grammars. We consider functions over such lattices that may overall be non-monotonic, but retain a restricted form of monotonicity inside each stratum. We demonstrate that such functions always have a least fixed point which is also their least pre-fixed point. Moreover, we prove that the sets of pre-fixed and post-fixed points of such functions, are complete lattices. For the special case of a trivial lexicographic lattice structure whose elements essentially consist of a unique stratum, our theorem gives as a special case the well-known \u2026",

Moreover, under the assumption that the programs have a finite number of rules, it was demonstrated in [RW05, GRW05] that the game is equivalent to the well-founded semantics of negation. In this paper we present work-in-progress towards demonstrating that the game of [RW05, GRW05] is equivalent to the well-founded semantics even in the case of programs that have a countably infinite number of rules. We argue however that in this case the proof of correctness has to be more involved. More specifically, in order to demonstrate that the game is correct one has to define a refined game in which each of the two players in his first move makes a bet in the form of a countable ordinal. Each ordinal can be considered as a kind of clock that imposes a\" time limit\" to the moves of the corresponding player. We argue that this refined game can be used to give the proof of correctness for the countably infinite case.",
