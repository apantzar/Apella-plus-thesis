These problems are natural generalisations of the Longest Path problem. Our approach uses bidimensionality theory combined with novel dynamic programming techniques over branch decompositions of the input graph. These techniques can be applied to a more general family of problems that deal with finding connected subgraphs under certain degree constraints.",

We examine the problem of computing in polynomial time the cutwidth of a partial w-tree with bounded degree. In particular, we show how to construct an algorithm that, in nO (\u201c\u20192d) steps, computes the cutwidth of any partial w-tree with vertices of degree bounded by a \ufb01xed constant d. Our algorithm is constructive in the sense that it can be adapted to output the corresponding optimal vertex ordering. Also, it is the main subroutine of an algorithm computing the pathwidth of a bounded degree partial w-tree in nO ((\u201c\u201d i) 2) steps.",

            "Abstract": "In general, graph search can be described in terms of a sequence of searchers' moves on a graph, able to capture a fugitive resorting on its vertices/edges. Several variations of graph search have been introduced, di# ering on the abilities of the fugitive as well as of the search. In this paper, we examine the case where the fugitive is inert, ie, it moves only whenever the search is about to capture it. Mainly, there are two variants for\" clearing\" an edge during a search: when a sliding of a searcher occurs along the edge or when both its endpoints are simultaneously occupied by searchers. These variants define the inert edge search and the inert node search respectively. A third search variant, the inert mixed search, is defined when both ways of clearing an edge are possible. As we show, inert search and inert mixed search are equivalent (surprisingly, this is not the case if we discard the inertness property). Moreover, we prove that, in any case, by restricting the searches to only those that always reduce further the fugitive's possible resorts, does not give any advantage to the fugitive (this monotonicity property is usually expressed as:\" recontamination does not help\"). So far, the only monotonicity result on inert search concerns inert node search and our results yield a much simpler proof of that result as well. Furthermore, we define a new graph-theoretic parameter, the proper-treewidth, in analogy to the parameter proper-pathwidth, and prove it equivalent to the inert mixed search game. Last, we prove that proper-treewidth, in turn, is equivalent to a known graph theoretic parameter related to treewidth.",

Our results are twofold: first, we give an upper bound on the number of necessary additional edges when a solution exists. This bound is a function of k, independent of the size of G.

In this paper we show how deep min-max and duality theorems from graph minors can be used to obtain exponential speed-up to many known practical algorithms for different domination problems.

A popular definition of pathwidth is given in terms of node search where we are given a system of tunnels that is contaminated by some infectious substance and we are looking for a search strategy that, at each step, either places a searcher on a vertex or removes a searcher from a vertex and where an edge is cleaned when both endpoints are simultaneously occupied by searchers. It was proved that the minimum number of searchers required for a successful cleaning strategy is equal to the pathwidth of the graph plus one. Two desired characteristics for a cleaning strategy is to be monotone (no recontamination occurs) and connected (clean territories always remain connected). Under these two demands, the number of searchers is equivalent to a variant of pathwidth called {\\em connected pathwidth}. We prove \u2026",

We study the problem for the class  of -minor-free graphs, under the equivalent setting of the \\textsc{Weighted -Bond Cover} problem, and present a constant-factor approximation algorithm using the primal-dual method. For this, we leverage a structure theorem implicit in [Joret et al., SIDMA'14] which states the following: any graph  containing a -minor-model either contains a large two-terminal {\\sl protrusion}, or contains a constant-size -minor-model, or a collection of pairwise disjoint {\\sl constant-sized} connected sets that can be contracted simultaneously to yield a dense graph. In the first case, we tame the graph by replacing the protrusion with a special-purpose weighted gadget. For the second and third case, we provide a weighting scheme which guarantees a local approximation ratio. Besides making an important step in the quest of (dis)proving a constant-factor approximation for \\textsc{Weighted} -\\textsc{Vertex Deletion}, our result may be useful as a template for algorithms for other minor-closed families.",

Our model is defined for robbers that are visible (their position in the graph is known to the cops) and active (they can move at any point in the game) but is easily adapted to other variants of the single-robber game that have been considered in the literature. We show that the game with many robbers is nonmonotone: that is, fewer cops are needed if the robbers are allowed to reoccupy positions that were previously unavailable to them. As the moves of the cops depend on the position of the visible robbers, strategies for such games should be interactive, but the game becomes, in a sense, less interactive as the initial number of robbers increases. We prove that the main parameter emerging from the game, which we denote , captures a hierarchy of parameters \u2026",

We initiate the study of elimination distances to graph properties expressible in first-order logic.

Our main result is the following meta-theorem: for every graph property P expressible by a first order-logic formula \\phi\\in \\Sigma_3, that is, of the form \\phi=\\exists x_1\\exists x_2\\cdots \\exists x_r \\forall y_1\\forall y_2\\cdots \\forall y_s \\exists z_1\\exists z_2\\cdots \\exists z_t \\psi, where \\psi is a quantifier-free first-order formula, checking whether the elimination distance of a graph to P does not exceed k, is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by k. Properties of graphs expressible by formulas from \\Sigma_3 include being of bounded degree, excluding a forbidden subgraph, or containing a bounded dominating set. We complement this theorem by showing that such a general statement does not hold for formulas with even slightly more expressive prefix structure: there are formulas \\phi\\in \\Pi_3, for which computing elimination distance is W[2]-hard.",

Our algorithms run in time O (n+ 20 (k)), an improvement over previous algorithms for some of these problems running in time O (n+ k\u00ba (k)). The flexibility of our approach allows tuning of algorithms to obtain smaller constants in the exponent.",

            "Abstract": "Lately, there has been an increased interest in signed networks with applications in trust, security, or social computing. This paper focuses on the issue of defining models and metrics for reciprocity in signed graphs. In unsigned directed networks, reciprocity quantifies the predisposition of network members in creating mutual connections. On the other hand, this concept has not yet been investigated in the case of signed graphs. We capitalize on the graph degeneracy concept to identify subgraphs of the signed network in which reciprocity is more likely to occur. This enables us to assess reciprocity at a global level, rather than at an exclusively local one as in existing approaches. The large scale experiments we perform on real world data sets of trust networks lead to both interesting and intuitive results. We believe these reciprocity measures can be used in various social applications such as trust management \u2026",

The searchers try to capture the fugitive by applying some sequence of moves that include placement, removal, or sliding of a searcher along an edge. The fugitive tries to avoid capture by moving along unguarded paths. The search number of a graph is the minimum number of searchers required to guarantee the capture of the fugitive. In this paper, we initiate the study of this game under the natural restriction of connectivity where we demand that in each step of the search the locations of the graph that are clean (ie non-accessible to the fugitive) remain connected. We give evidence that many of the standard mathematical tools used so far in classic graph searching fail under the connectivity requirement. We also settle the question on \u201cthe price of connectivity\u201d, that is, how many searchers more are required for searching a \u2026",

Traditional techniques for graph clustering, such as spectral methods, typically suffer from high time and space complexity. In this article, we present CoreCluster, an efficient graph clustering framework based on the concept of graph degeneracy, that can be used along with any known graph clustering algorithm. Our approach capitalizes on processing the graph in an hierarchical manner provided by its core expansion sequence, an ordered partition of the graph into different levels according to the k-core decomposition. Such a partition provides an efficient way to process the graph in an incremental manner that preserves its clustering structure, while making the execution of the chosen clustering algorithm much faster due to the smaller size of the graph's partitions onto which the algorithm operates. An experimental analysis on a multitude of real and synthetic data demonstrates that our approach can be applied to any clustering algorithm accelerating the clustering process, while the quality of the clustering structure is preserved or even improved.",

Minor containment testing is one of algorithmically most important and technical parts of the theory, and minor containment in graphs of bounded branchwidth is a basic ingredient of this algorithm.

By discovering hidden combinatorial structure of cliques and neighborhoods, we have developed polynomial-time algorithms that, for k = 3 and k = 4, identify whether or not a given graph G is a k-leaf power of a tree T, and if so, produce a tree T for which G is a k-leaf power.

A graph H is a minor of G if G contains a model of H as a subgraph. We give an algorithm that, given a planar n-vertex graph G and an h-vertex graph H, either finds in time  a model of H in G, or correctly concludes that G does not contain H as a minor.

In this paper we give a parameterized 2-approximation algorithm for the computation of tree-cut width; for an input n-vertex graph G and an integer w, our algorithm either confirms that the tree-cut width of G is more than w or returns a tree-cut decomposition of G certifying that its tree-cut width is at most 2w, in time .

Specifically we show that, for any problem whose so lution value does not increase under contractions and whose solution value is large on a grid graph augmented by a bounded number of handles, the treewidth of any bounded-genus graph is at most a constant factor larger than the square root of the problem's solution value on that graph. Such bidimensional problems include vertex cover, feedback vertex set, minimum maximal matching, dominating set, edge dominat-ing set, r-dominating set, connected dominating set, planar set cover, and diameter. This result has many algorithmic and combinatorial con-sequences. On the algorithmic side, by showing that an augmented grid is the prototype bounded-genus graph, we generalize and simplify many existing algorithms for such problems in graph classes excluding a mi-nor.

A number of empirical studies shows that a set of reduction rules for solving Dominating Set problems introduced by Alber, Fellows & Niedermeier leads efficiently to optimal solutions for many realistic networks. Despite of the encouraging experiments, the only class of graphs with proven performance guarantee of reductions rules was the class of planar graphs. However it was conjectured in that similar reduction rules can be proved to be efficient for more general graph classes like graphs of bounded genus. In this paper we (i) prove that the same rules, applied to any graph G of genus g, reduce the k-dominating set problem to a kernel of size O(k+g), i.e. linear kernel. This resolves a basic open question on the potential of kernel reduction for graph domination. (ii) Using such a kernel we \u2026",

One way of measuring the similarity between trees is to find the smallest common superstructure or supertree, where common elements are typically defined in terms of a mapping or embedding. In the simplest case, a supertree will contain exact copies of each input tree, so that for each input tree, each vertex of a tree can be mapped to a vertex in the supertree such that each edge maps to the corresponding edge. More general mappings allow for the extraction of more subtle common elements captured by looser definitions of similarity.We consider supertrees under the general mapping of minor containment.

In a co-authorship network, for instance, the fractional core index of an author intuitively reflects the degree of collaboration with equally or higher-ranked authors. Our system has been deployed on a real-world co-authorship network derived from DBLP, demonstrating that the idea of fractional cores can be applied even to large-scale networks.

The drawback of such general results is that it is usually not clear how to derive from them constructive kernels with reasonably low explicit constants. To fill this gap, we recently presented [STACS 2014] a framework to obtain explicit linear kernels for some families of problems whose solutions can be certified by a subset of vertices. In this article we enhance our framework to deal with packing problems, that is, problems whose solutions can be certified by collections of subgraphs of the input graph satisfying certain properties. -Packing is a typical example: for a family  of connected graphs that we assume to contain at least one planar graph, the task is to decide whether a \u2026",

We are interested in the parameterized complexity of F-M-DELETION when the parameter is the treewidth of G, denoted by tw. Our objective is to determine, for a fixed F}, the smallest function f_F such that F-M-DELETION can be solved in time f_F(tw)n^{O(1)} on n-vertex graphs. Using and enhancing the machinery of boundaried graphs and small sets of representatives introduced by Bodlaender et al. [J ACM, 2016], we prove that when all the graphs in F are connected and at least one of them is planar, then f_F(w) = 2^{O(wlog w)}. When F is a singleton containing a clique, a cycle, or a path on i vertices, we prove the following asymptotically tight bounds: - f_{K_4}(w) = 2^{Theta(wlog w)}. - f_{C_i}(w) = 2^{Theta(w)} for every i<5, and f_{C_i}(w) = 2^{Theta(wlog w)} for every i>4. - f_{P_i}(w) = 2^{Theta(w)} for every i<5, and f_{P_i}(w) = 2^{Theta(wlog w)} for every i>5. The lower bounds hold unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, and the superexponential ones are inspired by a reduction of Marcin Pilipczuk [Discrete Appl Math, 2016]. The single-exponential algorithms use, in particular, the rank-based approach introduced by Bodlaender et al. [Inform Comput, 2015].

            "Abstract": "We introduce the rendezvous game with adversaries. In this game, two players, {\\sl Facilitator} and {\\sl Disruptor}, play against each other on a graph. Facilitator has two agents, and Disruptor has a team of  agents located in some vertices of the graph. They take turns in moving their agents to adjacent vertices (or staying). Facilitator wins if his agents meet in some vertex of the graph. The goal of Disruptor is to prevent the rendezvous of Facilitator's agents. Our interest is to decide whether Facilitator can win. It appears that, in general, the problem is PSPACE-hard and, when parameterized by , co-W[2]-hard. Moreover, even the game's variant where we ask whether Facilitator can ensure the meeting of his agents within  steps is co-NP-complete already for . On the other hand, for chordal and -free graphs, we prove that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. These algorithms exploit an interesting relation of the game and minimum vertex cuts in certain graph classes. Finally, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by both the graph's neighborhood diversity and .",

For such graph classes and under natural restrictions on their maximum degree or subgraph exclusion, we prove that the relation between their treewidth and the maximum size of a grid minor is linear.

A model of a graph H in a graph G is a set of disjoint connected subgraphs of G indexed by the vertices of H, such that if {u,v} is an edge of H, then there is an edge of G between components C  u  and C  v . Graph H is a minor of G if G contains a model of H as a subgraph. We give an algorithm that, given a planar n-vertex graph G and an h-vertex graph H, either finds in time  a model of H in G, or correctly concludes that G does not contain H as a minor. Our algorithm is the first single-exponential algorithm for this problem and improves all previous minor testing algorithms in planar graphs. Our technique is based on a novel approach called partially embedded dynamic programming.",

We study the case where the fugitive is visible (the cops\u2019 strategy can take into account his current position) and lazy (he moves only when the cops move to his position). Our results are stated and proven in a general setting where the fugitive\u2019s speed (i.e., the lengths of paths he can move along) can be unbounded or bounded by some constant. We give a min-max characterization of the corresponding parameters, which we show to be computable in polynomial time for fugitivess with unbounded speed and speed at most 3 and to be NP-complete for all other finite speeds.

            "Abstract": "We initiate the algorithmic study of the following \"structured augmentation\" question: is it possible to increase the connectivity of a given graph G by superposing it with another given graph H? More precisely, graph F is the superposition of G and H with respect to injective mapping \\phi: V(H)->V(G) if every edge uv of F is either an edge of G, or \\phi^{-1}(u)\\phi^{-1}(v) is an edge of H. We consider the following optimization problem. Given graphs G,H, and a weight function \\omega assigning non-negative weights to pairs of vertices of V(G), the task is to find \\varphi of minimum weight \\omega(\\phi)=\\sum_{xy\\in E(H)}\\omega(\\phi(x)\\varphi(y)) such that the edge connectivity of the superposition F of G and H with respect to \\phi is higher than the edge connectivity of G. Our main result is the following \"dichotomy\" complexity classification. We say that a class of graphs C has bounded vertex-cover number, if there is a constant t depending on C only such that the vertex-cover number of every graph from C does not exceed t. We show that for every class of graphs C with bounded vertex-cover number, the problems of superposing into a connected graph F and to 2-edge connected graph F, are solvable in polynomial time when H\\in C. On the other hand, for any hereditary class C with unbounded vertex-cover number, both problems are NP-hard when H\\in C. For the unweighted variants of structured augmentation problems, i.e. the problems where the task is to identify whether there is a superposition of graphs of required connectivity, we provide necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions on the existence of such superpositions.

In that sense, tree-cut decompositions can be seen as an edge-version of tree-decompositions and have algorithmic applications on problems that remain intractable on graphs of bounded treewidth. In this paper, we prove that every graph admits an optimal tree-cut decomposition that satisfies a certain Menger-like condition similar to that of the lean tree decompositions of Thomas [A Menger-like property of tree-width: The finite case, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 48(1):67-76, 1990].

            "Abstract": "A subgraph complement of the graph G is a graph obtained from G by complementing all the edges in one of its induced subgraphs. We study the following algorithmic question: for a given graph G and graph class , is there a subgraph complement of G which is in ? We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for various choices of the graphs class , such as bipartite, d-degenerate, or cographs. We complement these results by proving that the problem is -complete when  is the class of regular graphs.",

            "Abstract": "The r-domination search game on graphs is a game-theoretical approach to the investigation of several graph and hypergraph parameters including treewidth and hypertree width. The task is to identify the minimum number of cops sufficient to catch the visible and fast robber. In r-domination search, the robber is being arrested if he resides inside a ball of radius r around some cop. In this setting, the power of the cops does not depend only on how many they are but also on the local topology of the graph around them. This is the main reason why the approximation complexity of the r-domination search game varies considerably, depending on whether r\u2009=\u20090 or r\u2009\u2265\u20091. We prove that this discrepancy is canceled when the game is played in (non-trivial) graph classes that are closed under taking of minors. We give a constant factor approximation algorithm that for every fixed r and graph H, computes the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We present a series of techniques for the design of subexponential parameterized algorithms for graph problems. The design of such algorithms usually consists of two main steps: first find a branch- (or tree-) decomposition of the input graph whose width is bounded by a sublinear function of the parameter and, second, use this decomposition to solve the problem in time that is single exponential to this bound. The main tool for the first step is Bidimensionality Theory. Here we present the potential, but also the boundaries, of this theory. For the second step, we describe recent techniques, associating the analysis of sub-exponential algorithms to combinatorial bounds related to Catalan numbers. As a result, we have  time algorithms for a wide variety of parameterized problems on graphs, where n is the size of the graph and k is the parameter.",

            "Abstract": "Suppose  is a finite family of graphs. We consider the following meta-problem, called -Immersion Deletion: given a graph  and integer , decide whether the deletion of at most  edges of  can result in a graph that does not contain any graph from  as an immersion. This problem is a close relative of the -Minor Deletion problem studied by Fomin et al. [Proceedings of FOCS, IEEE, 2012, pp. 470--479], where one deletes vertices in order to remove all minor models of graphs from . We prove that whenever all graphs from  are connected and at least one graph of  is planar and subcubic, then the -Immersion Deletion problem admits a constant-factor approximation algorithm running in time , a linear kernel that can be computed in time , and a -time fixed-parameter algorithm, where  count the vertices and edges of the input graph. These results mirror the findings of Fomin et al., who obtained a similar set of algorithmic results for -Minor Deletion, under the assumption that at least one graph from  is planar. An important difference is that we are able to obtain a linear kernel for -Immersion Deletion, while the exponent of the kernel of Fomin et al. for -Minor Deletion depends heavily on the family . In fact, this dependence is unavoidable under plausible complexity assumptions, as proven by Giannopoulou et al. [ACM Trans. Algorithms, 13 (2017), p. 35]. This reveals that the kernelization complexity of -Immersion Deletion is quite different from that of -Minor Deletion.",

The family of {\\xi}-nearly planar graphs is widely extending the notion of planarity.

We show that the two parameterized graph classes are parametrically equivalent.",

As a consequence, we extend our results to several other problems such as vertex cover, edge dominating set, independent set, clique-transversal set, kernels in digraphs, feedback vertex set, and a collection of vertex-removal problems.

The difficulty of the \u201cconnected\u201d version and of the \u201cmonotone internal\u201d version of the graph searching problem comes from the fact that none of these problems is minor closed for arbitrary graphs, as opposed to all known variants of graph searching.

In general, there is no guarantee that those sets are finite, as graphs are not well quasi ordered under the contraction partial ordering relation. In this paper we provide the obstruction set for k = 2. This set is finite, it consists of 174 graphs and completely characterizes the graphs with connected monotone mixed search number at most 2.

            "Abstract": "The node search game against a lazy (or, respectively, agile) invisible robber has been introduced as a search-game analogue of the treewidth parameter (and, respectively, pathwidth). In the connected variants of the above two games, we additionally demand that, at each moment of the search, the clean territories are connected. The connected search game against an agile and invisible robber has been extensively examined. The monotone variant (where we also demand that the clean territories are progressively increasing) of this game, corresponds to the graph parameter of connected pathwidth. It is known that the price of connectivty to search for an agile robber is bounded by 2, that is the connected pathwidth of a graph is at most twice (plus some constant) its pathwidth. In this paper, we investigate the connected search game against a lazy robber. A lazy robber moves only when the searchers' strategy threatens the location that he currently occupies. We introduce two alternative graph-theoretic formulations of this game, one in terms of connected tree decompositions, and one in terms of (connected) layouts, leading to the graph parameter of connected treewidth. We observe that connected treewidth parameter is closed under contractions and prove that for every k>= 2, the set of contraction obstructions of the class of graphs with connected treewidth at most k is infinite. Our main result is a complete characterization of the obstruction set for k= 2. One may observe that, so far, only a few complete obstruction sets are explicitly known for contraction closed graph classes.

In this paper, we show that all problems expressible in Counting Monadic Second Order Logic and satisfying a compactness property admit a polynomial kernel on graphs of bounded genus. Our second result is that all problems that have finite integer index and satisfy a weaker compactness condition admit a linear kernel on graphs of bounded genus. The study of kernels on planar graphs was initiated by a seminal paper of Alber, Fellows, and Niedermeier [J. ACM, 2004] who showed that Planar Dominating Set admits a linear kernel. Following this result, a multitude of problems have been shown to admit linear kernels on planar graphs by combining the ideas of Alber et al. with problem specific reduction rules. Our theorems unify and extend all previously known kernelization results for planar graph problems. Combining our theorems with the Erdos-P\u00f3sa property we obtain various new results on linear kernels for a number of packing and covering problems.",

In those games agents have to select a simple path in the network that starts from a predetermined set of initial vertices. Depending on how the value of the retrieved goods is splitted among the agents, we consider two game types: finders-share in which the agents that find a good split among them the corresponding benefit and firsts-share in which only the agents that first find a good share the corresponding benefit.

Recent discussions of the future of theoretical computer science have pointed to the importance of heuristic algorithms for NP-hard problems. In 2009, in his plenary talk at the FOCS Theory Day, Richard Karp posed the question\u201cwhy do heuristics work so well in practice?\u201d as one of the most important challenges in the theory of computing. Applied computing communities have been aware of this issue for decades, and have lamented the relative mission-failure of theoretical computer science. Theoretical computer science, has reciprocally lamented its lack of support, both by core funding agencies, and in Computer Science curriculums. There is a central dysfunction between theory and practice to which Karp points. In real life, typical inputs to a computational problem are the outputs of other resource-constrained processes, both natural and artificial. While datasets may be large, significant (although often multifaceted) structure is almost always present and worth taking into account in algorithm design and complexity analysis.",

In previous work [IPEC, 2017] we proved that if H is planar and connected, then the problem cannot be solved in time 2 o(tw) \u00b7 n O(1) under the ETH, and can be solved in time 2 O(tw\u00b7log tw) \u00b7 n O(1). In this article we manage to classify the optimal asymptotic complexity of {H}-M-Deletion when H is a connected planar graph on at most 5 vertices. Out of the 29 possibilities (discarding the trivial case H = K 1), we prove that 9 of them are solvable in time 2 \u0398(tw) \u00b7 n O(1) , and that the other 20 ones are solvable in time 2 \u0398(tw\u00b7log tw) \u00b7 n O(1).

In the context of this problem, Robertson and Seymour introduced the celebrated irrelevant vertex technique that has since become standard in graph algorithms. The technique consists of detecting a vertex that is irrelevant in the sense that its removal creates an equivalent instance of the problem. That way, one may solve the problem in  steps, as the detection of an irrelevant vertex takes  time and at most  vertices may need to be removed. In this paper we study the Planar Disjoint Paths problem where the input graph is planar. We introduce an extension of the irrelevant vertex technique where all the irrelevant vertices are removed simultaneously so that an instance of the Planar Disjoint Paths problem can be transformed in a linear number of steps to an equivalent one that has bounded treewidth. As a consequence, the Planar Disjoint Paths problem can be solved in linear time for every fixed number of terminals.",

            "Abstract": "For every r\u2208 N, let \u03b8 r denote the graph with two vertices and r parallel edges. The \u03b8 r-girth of a graph G is the minimum number of edges of a subgraph of G that can be contracted to \u03b8 r. This notion generalizes the usual concept of girth which corresponds to the case r= 2. In K\u00fchn and Osthus (2003), K\u00fchn and Osthus showed that graphs of sufficiently large minimum degree contain clique-minors whose order is an exponential function of their girth. We extend this result for the case of \u03b8 r-girth and we show that the minimum degree can be replaced by some connectivity measurement. As an application of our results, we prove that, for every fixed r, graphs excluding as a minor the disjoint union of k \u03b8 r\u2019s have treewidth O (k\u22c5 log k).",

The searchers try to capture the fugitive by applying some sequence moves that include placement, removal, or sliding of a searcher along an edge. The fugitive tries to avoid capture by moving along unguarded paths. The search number of a graph is the minimum number of searchers required to guarantee the capture of the fugitive. In this paper, we initiate the study of this game under the natural restriction of connectivity where we demand that in each step of the search the locations of the graph that are clean (ie non-accessible to the fugitive) remain connected. We give evidence that many of the standard mathematical tools used so far in the classic graph searching fail under the connectivity requirement. We also settle the question on \u201cthe price of connectivity\u201d that is how many searchers more are required for searching a graph when the connectivity demand is imposed. We make estimations of the price of connectivity on general graphs and we provide tight bounds for the case of trees.

A search strategy is monotone if it prevents the fugitive from pervading again areas from where he had been expelled and is connected if, at each step, the set of vertices that is or has been occupied by the searchers induces a connected subgraph of G. It has been shown that the corresponding connected and monotone search number of a graph G can be expressed as the connected treewidth, denoted by ctw (G), that is defined as the minimum width of a rooted tree-decomposition (X, T, r), where the union of the bags corresponding to the nodes of a path of T containing \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Bidimensionality Theory is a meta-algorithmic theory whose main ingredients are the Grid Exclusion Theorem of the Graph Minors series of Robertson and Seymour and the celebrated Courcelle\u2019s Theorem. The grid exclusion theorem states that if a graph excludes a bidimensional grid as a minor (a graph H is a minor of a graph G if H can be obtained by some subgraph of G by con- tracting edges) then its structure topologically resembles the structure of a tree (in technical terms, it has small treewidth). Intuitively, this result says that the absence of the bidimensional structure of a grid implies that a graph has the \u201cmono-dimensional\u201d structure of a tree. On the other side, Courcelle\u2019s theorem states that if a problem on graphs is expressible in Monadic Second Order Logic (MSOL), then it is possible to solve it in linear time when the treewidth of their input graphs is fixed. Intuitively, this theorem expresses the fact that the mono- dimensional structure of a tree (i.e., small treewidth) makes it possible to treat a graph as the input string of a finite-state tree automaton, where the finiteness of its states is guaranteed by the MSOL-expressibility of the problem. Combin- ing these two results together, we derive that the absence of the bidimensional structure of a grid, enables the applicability of the \u201cdivide-and-conquer\u201d tech- nique for problems of certain descriptive complexity. It appears that for many graph theoretic problems the existence of a grid-minor (or other bidimensional strucures) on the input graph provides a certificate for an immediate negative (or positive) answer and, for the remaining instances, a dynamic programming approach on graphs of \u2026",

We initiate the study of connected expansion which naturally arises in a number of applications.  Our main tool for this investigation is the branchwidth of a graph. In particular, we prove that any 2-edge-connected graph of branchwidth k has a {em connected} branch decom-po-si-tion of width k, i.e., a branch decomposition in which any cut separates two edge-sets that induce two connected subgraphs. Our proof is constructive, and is inspired from the existential proof of Seymour and Thomas (1994) for carvings. We also prove that the {em connected} search number (i.e., connected pathwidth) of any n-node graph of branchwidth k is at most O(klog n) and this bound is the best possible for parameters k and n.  A first consequence of these results is that, for any graph, the connected search number is at most O(log n) times larger than the (standard) search number. The only bound known so far held for trees only. Another consequence is that the connected search number can be approximated in polynomial time up to a factor O(log{n}cdotlog{OPT}). That is, for any connected graph G, one can compute in polynomial time a connected search strategy for G that uses at most O (log{n}cdotlog{OPT}) times the optimal number OPT of searchers.  The ratio O(log{n}cdotlog{OPT}) is the same as the best known approximation ratio for (standard) pathwidth, and any improvement for the approximation of connected search (i.e., connected pathwidth) would indeed produce an improvement for the approximation of pathwidth.",

            "Abstract": "Graph clustering or community detection constitutes an important task forinvestigating the internal structure of graphs, with a plethora of applications in several domains. Traditional tools for graph clustering, such asspectral methods, typically suffer from high time and space complexity. In thisarticle, we present CoreCluster, an efficient graph clusteringframework based on the concept of graph degeneracy, that can be used along withany known graph clustering algorithm. Our approach capitalizes on processing thegraph in a hierarchical manner provided by its core expansion sequence, anordered partition of the graph into different levels according to the k-coredecomposition. Such a partition provides a way to process the graph inan incremental manner that preserves its clustering structure, whilemaking the execution of the chosen clustering algorithm much faster due to thesmaller size of the graph's partitions onto which the algorithm operates.",

We consider the following meta-problem, called -Immersion Deletion: given a graph  and integer , decide whether the deletion of at most  edges of  can result in a graph that does not contain any graph from  as an immersion. This problem is a close relative of the -Minor Deletion problem studied by Fomin et al. [FOCS 2012], where one deletes vertices in order to remove all minor models of graphs from . We prove that whenever all graphs from  are connected and at least one graph of  is planar and subcubic, then the -Immersion Deletion problem admits: a constant-factor approximation algorithm running in time ; a linear kernel that can be computed in time ; and a -time fixed-parameter algorithm, where  count the vertices and edges of the input graph. These results mirror the findings of Fomin et al. [FOCS 2012], who obtained a similar set of algorithmic results for -Minor Deletion, under the assumption that at least one graph from  is planar. An important difference is that we are able to obtain a linear kernel for -Immersion Deletion, while the exponent of the kernel of Fomin et al. for -Minor Deletion depends heavily on the family . In fact, this dependence is unavoidable under plausible complexity assumptions, as proven by Giannopoulou et al. [ICALP 2015]. This reveals that the kernelization complexity of -Immersion Deletion is quite different than that of -Minor Deletion.",

Our system has been deployed on a real-world co-authorship network derived from DBLP, demonstrating that the idea of fractional cores can be applied even to large-scale networks. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to query for the fractional core index of an author, to see who the closest equally or higher-ranked co-authors are, and explore the entire co-authorship network in an incremental manner.",

Formally, given a graph class , the class  contains all graphs whose blocks belong to  and the class  contains all graphs where the removal of a vertex creates a graph in . Given a hereditary graph class , we recursively define  so that  and, if , . The block elimination distance of a graph  to a graph class  is the minimum  such that  and can be seen as an analog of the elimination distance parameter, with the difference that connectivity is now replaced by biconnectivity.

In the \\emph{connected}  variants of the above two games, we additionally demand that, at each moment of the search, the \\emph{clean} territories are {\\sl connected}. The connected search game against an agile and invisible robber has been extensively examined. The monotone variant (where we also demand that the clean territories are progressively increasing) of this game, corresponds to the graph parameter of {\\sl connected pathwidth}. It is known that \\emph{the price of connectivtiy} to search for an agile robber is bounded by , that is the connected pathwidth of a graph is at most twice (plus some constant) its pathwidth. In this paper,  we investigate the study of the connected search game against a {\\sl lazy} robber. A lazy robber moves only when the searchers' strategy threatens the location that he currently occupies.   We introduce two alternative graph-theoretical formulations of this game, one in terms of connected tree decompositions, and one in terms of (connected) layouts,  leading to the graph parameter of {\\sl connected treewidth}.  We  observe that connected treewidth parameter is closed under contractions and prove that for every , the set of contraction obstructions of the class of graphs with connected treewidth at most  is infinite.

            "Abstract": "This paper is concerned with the graph searching game. The search number s (G) of a graph G is the smallest number of searchers required to \u201cclear\u201d G. A search strategy is monotone (m) if no recontamination ever occurs. It is connected (c) if the set of clear edges always forms a connected subgraph. It is internal (i) if the removal of searchers is not allowed. The difficulty of the \u201cconnected\u201d version and of the \u201cmonotone internal\u201d version of the graph searching problem comes from the fact that, as shown in the paper, none of these problems is minor closed for arbitrary graphs, as opposed to all known variants of the graph searching problem. Motivated by the fact that connected graph searching, and monotone internal graph searching are both minor closed in trees, we provide a complete characterization of the set of trees that can be cleared by a given number of searchers. In fact, we show that, in trees, there is only one obstruction for monotone internal search, as well as for connected search, and this obstruction is the same for the two problems. This allows us to prove that, for any tree T, mis (T)= cs (T). For arbitrary graphs, we prove that there is a unique chain of inequalities linking all the search numbers above. More precisely, for any graph G, s (G)= is (G)= ms (G)\u2264 mis (G)\u2264 cs (G)= ics (G)\u2264 mcs (G)= mics (G). The first two inequalities can be strict. In the case of trees, we have mics (G)\u2264 2 s (T)\u2212 2, that is there are exactly 2 different search numbers in trees, and these search numbers differ by a factor of 2 at most.",

The game with many robbers is non-monotone: more cops are needed if their moves are restricted so as to monotonically decrease the space available to the robbers. Because the cops may decide their moves based on the robbers\u2019 current position, strategies in the game are interactive but the game becomes, in a sense, less interactive as the initial number of robbers increases.

Examples are cutwidth, pathwidth, and directed or weighted variants of these.  However, these algorithms  have complicated technical details. This paper attempts to present ideas  in these algorithms in a different more easily accessible manner, by  showing that the algorithms can be obtained by a stepwise modification  of a trivial hypothetical non-deterministic algorithm.

The design of such algorithms usually consists of two main steps: first find a branch (or tree) decomposition of the input graph whose width is bounded by a sublinear function of the parameter and, second, use this decomposition to solve the problem in time that is single exponential to this bound. The main tool for the first step is the Bidimensionality Theory. Here we present not only the potential, but also the boundaries, of this theory. For the second step, we describe recent techniques, associating the analysis of subexponential algorithms to combinatorial bounds related to Catalan numbers. As a result, we have 2 O (k)\u22c5 n O (1) time algorithms for a wide variety of parameterized problems on graphs, where n is the size of the graph and k is the parameter.",

We prove the following three results. First, Degree Contractibility is NP-complete even when d= 14. Second, it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k and d. Third, it is W [1]-hard when parameterized by k. We also study its variant where the input graph is weighted, ie, has some edge weighting and the contractions preserve these weights. The Weighted Degree Contractibility problem is to test if a weighted graph G can be contracted to a weighted graph of minimum weighted degree at least d by using at most k weighted contractions. We show that this problem is NP-complete and that it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k. In addition, we pinpoint a relationship with the problem of finding a minimal edge-cut of maximum \u2026",

Based on the k-core, which essentially measures the robustness of a community under degeneracy, we extend it to weighted graphs, devising a novel concept of k-cores on weighted graphs.

A cut U is a k-cut if G [U] contains exactly k (\u2265 1) components. More specifically, a k-cut U is a (k, \u2113)-cut if V\u2216 U induces a subgraph with exactly \u2113 (\u2265 2) components. The Disconnected Cut problem is to test whether a graph has a disconnected cut and is known to be NP-complete. The problems k-Cut and (k, \u2113)-Cut are to test whether a graph has a k-cut or (k, \u2113)-cut, respectively. By pinpointing a close relationship to graph contractibility problems we show that (k, \u2113)-Cut is in P for k= 1 and any fixed constant \u2113\u2265 2, while it is NP-complete for any fixed pair k, \u2113\u2265 2.

Our approach combines tools from topological graph theory and analytic combinatorics.

Namely, the number of partial solutions that can be arranged on a surface cut decomposition can be upper-bounded by the number of noncrossing partitions on surfaces with boundary. It follows that partial solutions can be represented by a single-exponential (in the branchwidth k) number of configurations. This proves that, when applied on surface cut \u2026",

This workshop series has established itself as the main forum on the field of Graph Searching, with a wide participation of researchers in several disciplines in Computer Science and in Mathematics. In a graph searching game, a number of hiding entities that are sometimes called evaders, or fugitives, or hiders (depending on the application) hide in a domain that can be represented as a graph or a network. A number of seeking entities called searchers or pursuers aim to locate the evaders. In this context, the searchers aim to locate the evaders as efficiently as possible, where the concept of efficiency depends on the specific setting. Several variants of this fundamental game can be defined depending on the characteristics of the evaders and the searchers in terms of parameters such as the relative speed, visibility, sensor capabilities, etc.Graph searching provides a rigorous framework for modeling concepts such as hiding, pursuing, sense of direction, collaboration and coalition formation. Graph searching thus provides the tools to model real-life activities such as search-and-rescue operations, coal mining, or motion planning in robotics. Thus, the field has several applications in the domains of Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research. Equally important, it is driven by foundational issues rooted in Complexity Theory, Graph Theory, Analysis of Algorithms \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The graph parameter of pathwidth can be seen as a measure of the topological resemblance of a graph to a path. A popular definition of pathwidth is given in terms of node search where we are given a system of tunnels that is contaminated by some infectious substance and we are looking for a search strategy that, at each step, either places a searcher on a vertex or removes a searcher from a vertex and where an edge is cleaned when both endpoints are simultaneously occupied by searchers. It was proved that the minimum number of searchers required for a successful cleaning strategy is equal to the pathwidth of the graph plus one. Two desired characteristics for a cleaning strategy is to be monotone (no recontamination occurs) and connected (clean territories always remain connected). Under these two demands, the number of searchers is equivalent to a variant of pathwidth called {\\em connected pathwidth}. We prove that connected pathwidth is fixed parameter tractable, in particular we design a  time algorithm that checks whether the connected pathwidth of  is at most  This resolves an open question by [Dereniowski, Osula, and Rz{\\k{a}}{\\.{z}}ewski, Finding small-width connected path-decompositions in polynomial time.

            "Abstract": "Classic complexity theory indicates that a large number of natural combinatorial problems are inherently hard to solve algorithmically (in technical terms, they are NP-hard and, thus, it is not expected that they admit a polynomial time algorithm). The parameterization idea tries to cope with this rather discouraging fact by asking whether it is possible to to design algorithms where the non-polynomial part of their running times depends exclusively on some parameter of the problem input. The idea in this approach is that the chosen parameterization reflects a good part of real instances of the problem.Parameterized complexity and algorithms have developed rapidly during the last three decades. Since the fundamental work of Downey and Fellows in [1, 3\u20135], parameterized complexity theory introduced numerous innovative ideas in algorithmic design and offered insightful results in almost all disciplines of theoretical computer science. The first monograph in this field was the book:[RG Downey and MR Fellows. Parameterized complexity. Monographs in Computer Science.

In this paper we improve the algorithmic analysis of both problems by proving a series of combinatorial results relating the branchwidth of planar graphs with their face cover. Combining this fact with duality properties of branchwidth, allows us to derive analogous results on feedback vertex set.

Our approach combines tools from topological graph theory and analytic combinatorics.

Namely, the number of partial solutions that can be arranged on a surface cut decomposition can be upper-bounded by the number of noncrossing partitions on surfaces with boundary. It follows that partial solutions can be represented by a single-exponential (in the branchwidth k) number of configurations. This proves that, when applied on surface cut \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The notions of hypertree width and generalized hypertree width were introduced by Gottlob, Leone, and Scarcello in order to extend the concept of hypergraph acyclicity. These notions were further generalized by Grohe and Marx, who introduced the fractional hypertree width of a hypergraph. All these width parameters on hypergraphs are useful for extending tractability of many problems in database theory and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we study the approximability of (generalized, fractional) hyper treewidth of sparse hypergraphs where the criterion of sparsity reflects the sparsity of their incidence graphs. Our first step is to prove that the (generalized, fractional) hypertree width of a hypergraph H is constant-factor sandwiched by the treewidth of its incidence graph, when the incidence graph belongs to some apex-minor-free graph class. This determines the combinatorial borderline above which the notion of (generalized, fractional) hypertree width becomes essentially more general than treewidth, justifying that way its functionality as a hypergraph acyclicity measure. While for more general sparse families of hypergraphs treewidth of incidence graphs and all hypertree width parameters may differ arbitrarily, there are sparse families where a constant factor approximation algorithm is possible. In particular, we give a constant factor approximation polynomial time algorithm for (generalized, fractional) hypertree width on hypergraphs whose incidence graphs belong to some H-minor-free graph class.",

            "Abstract": "A graph containment problem is to decide whether one graph can be modified into some other graph by using a number of specified graph operations. We consider edge deletions, edge contractions, vertex deletions and vertex dissolutions as possible graph operations permitted. By allowing any combination of these four operations we capture the following ten problems: testing on (induced) minors, (induced) topological minors, (induced) subgraphs, (induced) spanning subgraphs, dissolutions and contractions. A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. Our results combined with existing results settle the parameterized complexity of all ten problems for split graphs.",

From Menger\u2019s theorem both problems are equivalent (and computationally easy) in the unbounded case for single source, single target paths. However, in the bounded case, they are combinatorially distinct and are both NP-hard, even to approximate. Our results indicate that a more refined landscape appears when we study these problems with respect to their parameterized complexity. For this, we consider several parameterizations (with respect to the maximum length l of paths, the number k of paths or the size of a cut, and the treewidth of the input graph) of all variants of both problems (edge/vertex-disjoint paths or cuts, directed/undirected). We provide FPT-algorithms (for all variants) when parameterized by both k and l and hardness results when the parameter \u2026",

The H-coloring problem is the problem of checking whether, for fixed H, there exists an homomorphism (H-coloring) from an input graph G to H.It is known that if H is bipartite or it has a loop the H-coloring problem can be trivially solved in polynomial time, but in the case that H is loop less and not-bipart ite the problem is known to be NP-complete [HN90]. An interesting generalization of the H-coloring problem is the list H-coloring problem where each vertex of G carries a list of the vertices of H where it is allowed to be mapped [FH98, FHH99].

            "Abstract": "We introduce a novel model-theoretic framework inspired from graph modification and based on the interplay between model theory and algorithmic graph minors. We propose a new compound logic operating with two types of sentences, expressing graph modification: the modulator sentence, defining some property of the modified part of the graph, and the target sentence, defining some property of the resulting graph. In our framework, modulator sentences are in monadic second-order logic and have models of bounded treewidth, while target sentences express first-order logic properties along with minor-exclusion. Our logic captures problems that are not definable in first order logic and, moreover, may have instances of unbounded treewidth. Also, it permits the modelling of wide families of problems involving vertex/edge removals, alternative modulator measures (such as elimination distance or G-treewidth), multistage modifications, and various cut problems. Our main result is that, for this compound logic, model checking can be done in quadratic time. This algorithmic meta-theorem encompasses, unifies, and extends all known meta-algorithmic results on minor-closed graph classes. Moreover, all derived algorithms are constructive and this, as a byproduct, extends the constructibility horizon of the algorithmic applications of the Graph Minors theorem of Robertson and Seymour. The proposed logic can be seen as a general framework to capitalize on the potential of the irrelevant vertex technique.",

We consider graph classes with bounded connected (and monotone) mixed search number and we deal with the question whether the obstruction set, with respect of the contraction partial ordering, for those classes is finite. In general, there is no guarantee that those sets are finite, as graphs are not well quasi ordered under the contraction partial ordering relation. In this paper we provide the obstruction set for k= 2, where k is the number of searchers we are allowed to use. This set is finite, it consists of 177 graphs and completely characterises the graphs with connected (and monotone) mixed search number at most 2.

For the more general class of plain partial weight assignment we give an FPT algorithm for the (H,C,K)-coloring decision problem.
