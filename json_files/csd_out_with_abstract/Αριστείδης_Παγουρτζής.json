Analyzing such huge complex networks has become particularly demanding in computational terms. A task of paramount importance for understanding the structure of social networks as well as of many other real-world systems is to identify communities, that is, sets of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to other nodes of the network. In this paper we propose two algorithms for community detection in networks, by employing the neighborhood overlap metric and appropriate spanning tree computations.",

            "Abstract": "In all-optical networks that use WDM technology it is often the case that several communication requests have to be blocked, due to bandwidth and technology limitations. Minimizing request blocking is therefore an important task calling for algorithmic techniques for efficient routing and wavelength assignment. Here we study the problem for rings under both the undirected and the directed settings, corresponding to symmetric and one-way communication respectively. The problem in graph-theoretic terms can be formulated as the maximum routing and path coloring problem. We present a chain-and-matching technique for routing requests and coloring the corresponding paths which gives constant approximations for both the undirected and the directed cases. For the undirected problem we obtain a 2/3-approximation algorithm; this corresponds to a considerable increase in the number of satisfied requests \u2026",

Under random movement of network nodes and topology triggered reactive path distribution statistics among the neighboring nodes, there must be a unified model to determine an adequate path stability estimation strategy in MANETs. We present novel link connectivity metrics (LCM) and path distribution analysis (PDA) strategies for path stability estimation under uniform speed and random trajectory of mobile nodes. We also design an adaptive routing model that guarantees effective communication among neighboring nodes inside a cluster. We find that LCM strategy among neighboring nodes is affected by the link expiration time, relative velocity, link connectivity, and link stability metrics in terms of remaining probability for a \u2026",

Two of these algorithms are novel, whereas the rest are adaptation of earlier approaches. An experimental evaluation of the algorithms in terms of attained profit and execution time reveals that the theoretically best algorithm performs only marginally better than one of the new algorithms, while at the same time being several orders of magnitude slower. Furthermore, an extremely fast greedy heuristic with nonconstant approximation ratio performs reasonably well and may be favored over the other algorithms whenever it is crucial to minimize execution time. \u00a9 2011 Wiley \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An important objective of research in counting complexity is to understand which counting problems are approximable. In this quest, the complexity class TotP, a hard subclass of #P, is of key importance, as it contains self-reducible counting problems with easy decision version, thus eligible to be approximable. Indeed, most problems known so far to admit an fpras fall into this class. An open question raised recently by the community of descriptive complexity is to find a logical characterization of TotP and of robust subclasses of TotP. In this work we define two subclasses of TotP, in terms of descriptive complexity, both of which are robust in the sense that they have natural complete problems, which are defined in terms of satisfiability of Boolean formulae. We then explore the relationship between the class of approximable counting problems and TotP. We prove that TotP  FPRAS if and only if NP  RP and FPRAS  TotP unless RP = P. To this end we introduce two ancillary classes that can both be seen as counting versions of RP. We further show that FPRAS lies between one of these classes and a counting version of BPP. Finally, we provide a complete picture of inclusions among all the classes defined or discussed in this paper with respect to different conjectures about the NP vs. RP vs. P questions.",

In this problem, a team of initially co-located agents must report data from all safe nodes of the network to the homebase, infinitely often. The malicious host can choose whether to kill visiting agents or allow them to pass through (gray hole).

Our proposal has an additional benefit, since it deals with coercion resistance in a more efficient manner, by taking advantage of the function splitting architecture between the participating authorities from FOO to reduce the quadratic complexity of identifying and removing coerced votes, which are cast with fake credentials, as in JCJ. To this end we utilise a method of converting digital signatures to group signatures due to Petersen.",

We focus on adaptive deterministic protocols for small values of h. We provide asymptotically matching lower and upper bounds for the cases h= 2 and h= 3. While for h= 2 our bound is quadratic, similar to the bound obtained for oblivious protocols, for h= 3 we prove a sub-quadratic bound of Theta (n^ 2 log log n/log n), where n is the number of nodes in the network. The latter is the first result showing an adaptive algorithm which is asymptotically faster than oblivious h-shot broadcast protocols, for which a tight quadratic bound is known for every constant h. Our upper bound for h= 3 is constructive, making use of constructions of graphs with large girth. We also show an improved upper bound of O (n^(1+ alpha/sqrt {h})) for h>= 4, where alpha is an absolute constant independent of h. Our upper bound for h>= 4 is non-constructive.",

Depending on certain conditions reflecting the knowledge of the robots we show that a rendezvous algorithm is always possible on a general connected graph.More specifically, we give new rendezvous algorithms for two robots as follows.

We present four deterministic and purely combinatorial algorithms for this problem, and give theoretical guarantees for their worst-case approximation ratios. Two of these algorithms are novel, whereas the rest are adaptation of earlier approaches. An experimental evaluation of the algorithms in terms of attained profit and execution time reveals that the theoretically best algorithm performs only marginally better than one of the new algorithms, while at the same time being several orders of magnitude slower. Furthermore, an extremely fast greedy heuristic with nonconstant approximation ratio performs reasonably well and may be favored over the other algorithms whenever it is crucial to minimize execution time.\u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In particular, when a user requests the signing of a message, blinded to protect her privacy, the signer embeds data in the signature that makes it valid if and only if a condition holds. A verifier, identified by a private key, can check the signature and learn the value of the predicate. Auditability mechanisms in the form of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs are provided, so that a cheating signer cannot issue arbitrary signatures and a cheating verifier cannot ignore the embedded condition.

In this problem, a team of initially co-located agents must report data from all safe nodes of the network to the homebase, infinitely often. The malicious host can choose whether to kill visiting agents or allow them to pass through (gray hole). In another variation of the model, the malicious host can, in addition, alter its whiteboard contents in order to deceive visiting agents.

Our contribution comprises a linear time 4/3-approximation algorithm and an FPTAS, which respectively improve on a linear time 2-approximation algorithm and a PTAS given for the more general case of common deadlines [2,3]. We then consider a selfish perspective, in which jobs are submitted by players who may falsely report larger processing times, and show a tight upper bound of 2 on the approximation ratio of strategyproof mechanisms, even randomized ones.

In this quest, the complexity class TotP, a hard subclass of\\# P, is of key importance, as it contains self-reducible counting problems with easy decision version, thus eligible to be approximable. Indeed, most problems known so far to admit an fpras fall into this class. An open question raised recently by the community of descriptive complexity is to find a logical characterization of TotP and of robust subclasses of TotP. In this work we define two subclasses of TotP, in terms of descriptive complexity, both of which are robust in the sense that they have natural complete problems, which are defined in terms of satisfiability of Boolean formulae. We then explore the relationship between the class of approximable counting problems and TotP. We prove that TotP\\nsubseteq FPRAS if and only if NP \u2260 RP \u2026",

We present a new variation of the Warshall algorithm for Max-CLOSURE, both in fine-grained and coarse-grained forms; the coarse-grained version, appropriate for parallel implementation in PVM is especially designed so as to consist of highly parellelisable submatrix multiplications. We used existing, espe-cially efficient PVM subroutines to realise our new MAX-CLOSURE and TC algorithms; the experimental results show that the new algorithms achieve considerable improvement compared to previously known ones.",

We propose the RMT-Partial Knowledge Algorithm (RMT-PKA), which solves RMT whenever this is possible, therefore it is a unique algorithm, as defined in [10]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unique protocol for RMT against general adversaries in the partial knowledge model.",

In particular, we examine the case in which a bound k is given and a node may transmit at most k times during the broadcasting protocol. We focus on oblivious algorithms, that is, algorithms where each node decides whether to transmit or not with no consideration of the transmission history. Our main contributions are (a) a lower bound of \u2126 (n2 k) on the broadcasting time of any oblivious k-shot broadcasting algorithm and (b) an oblivious broadcasting protocol that achieves a matching upper bound, namely O (n2 k), for every k\u2264",

            "Abstract": "During recent years the field of fine-grained complexity has bloomed to produce a plethora of results, with both applied and theoretical impact on the computer science community. The cornerstone of the framework is the notion of fine-grained reductions, which correlate the exact complexities of problems such that improvements in their running times or hardness results are carried over. We provide a parameterized viewpoint of these reductions (PFGR) in order to further analyze the structure of improvable problems and set the foundations of a unified methodology for extending algorithmic results. In this context, we define a class of problems (FPI) that admit fixed-parameter improvements on their running time. As an application of this framework we present a truly sub-quadratic fixed-parameter algorithm for the orthogonal vectors problem. Finally, we provide a circuit characterization for FPI to further solidify the notion of improvement.",

An interesting question in this context is whether allowing certain flexibility in the departure times of scheduled routes may reduce the number of vehicles needed. We formulate this question as the Flexible Train Rostering problem. We consider two cases that are of practical interest: Unlimited flexibility: only the durations of routes are given and we are free to determine the most appropriate departure time for each route. Limited flexibility: initial departure times are given, together with a delay threshold \u03b5; we are asked to determine the most appropriate delay\u2264 \u03b5 for each route. We also consider variants where we are allowed to use empty rides,(ie, routes without passengers).

A parallel coarse-grained algorithm is derived from a finegrained algorithm. Its advantage is that approximately half of the work is organised as totally independent computation sequences of several processes. We consider conceptual description of dependencies between operations as partial order graphs of events. Such graphs can be split into disjoint subgraphs corresponding to different phases of the computation. This approach helps to design a parallel algorithm in a way which guarantees large independence of actions. We also show that a transformation of the fine-grained algorithm into the coarse-grained is rather nontrivial, and that the straightforward approach does not work.",

We consider a class of approximation algorithms for this problem, which are based on orienting the edges of the multigraph, then grouping appropriately the incoming and outgoing edges at each node so as to construct a bipartite multigraph of maximum degree w, and finally obtaining a proper edge coloring of this bipartite multigraph. As shown by Nomikos et al.(2001), simply choosing an arbitrary edge orientation in the first step yields a 2-approximation algorithm. We investigate whether this approximation ratio can be improved by a more careful choice of the edge orientation in the first step. We \u2026",

Studying the problem of Secure Message Transmission (SMT) proves essential for achieving Broadcast in incomplete networks. We present a polynomial protocol that achieves parallel secure message transmissions between any two sets of nodes of an incomplete network provided that the weakest connectivity conditions which render the Broadcast problem solvable hold. Using the above, we show that the SMT protocol can be used as a subroutine for the simulation of any known protocol for complete networks, which leads us to protocols for generic networks which remain polynomial with respect to the measures of consideration. We extend our result to the case of wireless networks by exploiting the fact that participants are committed to perform local broadcasts, which greatly facilitates achieving \u2026",

The most known among them is the market-basket problem which assumes that we have a large number of items and we want to know which items are bought together. A recent application is that of web pages (baskets) and linked pages (items). Pages with many common references may be about the same topic. In this paper we present a parallel algorithm for mining frequent itemsets. We provide experimental evidence that our algorithm scales quite well and we discuss the merits of parallelization for this problem.",

Colored Resource Allocation Games are a generalization of congestion and bottleneck games where players have their strategies in multiple copies (colors). We focus on two main subclasses of these games depending on the player cost: in Colored Congestion Games the player cost is the sum of latencies of the resources allocated to the player, while in Colored Bottleneck Games the player cost is the maximum of these latencies. We investigate the pure price of anarchy for three different social cost functions and prove tight bounds for each separate case. We first consider a social cost function which is particularly meaningful in the setting of multifiber all-optical networks, where it captures the objective of fiber cost minimization. Additionally, we consider the two \u2026",

In contrast to classical path coloring, it is, in this setting, possible to assign a color more than once to paths that pass through the same edge; the number of allowed repetitions per edge is given and the goal is to minimize the number of colors used.We present algorithms and hardness results for tree topologies of special interest. Our algorithms achieve approximation ratio of 2 in spiders and 3 in caterpillars, whereas the best algorithm for trees so far, achieves an approximation ratio of 4. We also study the directed version of the problem and show that it admits a 3-approximation algorithm in caterpillars, while it can be solved exactly in spiders.",

We introduce and study a model where some heterogeneous objects have to be placed on a network so that the elements with high value may exert a positive externality on neighboring elements whose value is lower. We aim at maximizing this positive influence called graph externality. By exploiting a connection with the minimum dominating set problem, we prove that the problem is NP-hard when the maximum degree is 3, but polynomial time solvable when the maximum degree is 2. We also present exact and approximation algorithms for special cases. In particular, if only two valuations exist, then a natural greedy strategy, which works well for maximum coverage problems, leads to a constant approximation algorithm.

To this end we exploit the relation of Ext-CVC to Ext-VC, that is, to the extension variant of Vertex Cover.

Our main contribution is the determination of a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving RMT in the partial knowledge model with a general adversary. We propose the RMT-Partial Knowledge Algorithm (RMT-PKA), which solves RMT whenever this is possible, therefore it is a unique algorithm, as defined in [10]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unique protocol for RMT against general adversaries in the partial knowledge model.",

Initially, we focus on oblivious algorithms for k-shot broadcasting, that is, algorithms where at each step each node decides whether to transmit or not with no consideration of the transmission history. Our main contributions are (a) a lower bound of \u03a9 (n 2/k) on the broadcasting time of any oblivious k-shot broadcasting algorithm, and (b) an oblivious broadcasting protocol that achieves a matching upper bound, namely O (n 2/k), for every k\u2264 n and an upper bound of O (n 3/2) for every k> n.

We distinguish oblivious deterministic algorithms which allow only one processor to transmit in each time-step and term them singleton algorithms. We also distinguish oblivious randomized algorithms where in each time-step all processors have equal probability of transmission, and call them uniform. The merit of oblivious algorithms, especially the singleton and uniform ones, is that they are simple and easy to implement.",

            "Abstract": "Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a dominating technology in contemporary all-optical networking. It allows several connections to be established through the same fiber links, provided that each of the connections uses a different wavelength. A second requirement is that a connection must use the same wavelength from one end to the other in order to avoid the use of wavelength converters which are costly or slow. In practice, the available bandwidth is limited to few dozens, or at most hundreds, wavelengths per fiber and the situation is not expected to change in the near future. It is therefore impossible to serve a large set of communication requests simultaneously. It thus makes sense to consider the problem of satisfying a maximum profit subset of requests, where profits may represent priorities or actual revenues related to requests. In our model, requests are undirected, which corresponds to full-duplex communication. We describe a request by its connection path and its profit, and formulate the problem in graph-theoretic terms as follows:",

We choose an intricate systolic algorithm for the TC problem, by Guibas, Kung and Thompson (GKT algorithm for short), as a starting point due to its particularly close relationship to matrix multiplication. The GKT algorithm reduces the TC problem to three successive parallel matrix multiplications. We extract the main ideas of this algorithm, namely different path decompositions related to min-paths and max-paths computations and devise a two-pass parallel algorithm, such that the second pass is purely a triangular matrix multiplication involving exactly  of the total number of elementary operations (multiplying two single elements of the matrix). This is helpful in coarse-grained parallel computations since matrix multiplication is well \u2026",

We address the problem under the realistic assumption that the topological knowledge of players is restricted to a certain subgraph and specifically study the role of local information exchange in the feasibility of RMT. We employ the General Adversary model of Hirt and Maurer and the recently introduced Partial Knowledge Model which subsume all known models for the adversary and local knowledge respectively. Tight feasibility conditions, naturally involving the network topology, the adversary and the local knowledge of players, are presented.",

A mobile agent, situated in a starting node, has to walk to a target node traversing a path of minimum length. All information about adjacencies is distributed to certain nodes called landmarks. We wish to minimize the total memory requirements as well as keep the memory requirements per landmark to reasonable levels. We propose a landmark selection and information distribution scheme with overall memory requirement linear in the number of nodes, and constant memory consumption per non-landmark node. We prove that a navigation algorithm using this scheme attains a constant stretch factor overhead in tree topologies, compared to an optimal landmark-based routing algorithm that obeys certain restrictions.

For instance, when a request can occur at any node in a graph and requires a server at that node, a minimum dominating set represents a minimum set of servers that serve an arbitrary single request by moving a server along at most one edge. This paper studies domination problems for two requests. For the problem of placing a minimum number of servers such that two requests at different nodes can be served with two different servers (called win-win), we present a logarithmic approximation, and we prove that nothing better is possible. We show that the same is true for Roman domination, the well studied problem variant that asks for each vertex to either possess its own server or to have a neighbor with two servers. Still the same is true if each idle server can move along one \u2026",

A fundamental ingredient of this task is the discovery of sets of attributes (itemsets) whose frequency in the data exceeds some threshold value. In this paper we describe two algorithms for completing the calculation of frequent sets using a tree structure for storing partial supports, called interim\u2010support (IS) tree. The first of our algorithms (T\u2010Tree\u2010First (TTF)) uses a novel tree pruning technique, based on the notion of (fixed\u2010prefix) potential inclusion, which is specially designed for trees that are implemented using only two pointers per node. This allows to implement the IS tree in a space\u2010efficient manner. The second algorithm (P\u2010Tree\u2010First (PTF)) explores the idea of storing the frequent itemsets in a second tree structure, called the total support tree (T\u2010tree); the main innovation lies in the use of multiple \u2026",

We compare RAP to #P and prove that it has exactly the same oracle power as #P i.e., FP#P[1] = FPRAP[1] - in other words #P and RAP are Cook[1]-interreducible. As a consequence, it turns out that PRAP[1] captures the power of the whole Polynomial Hierarchy. The newly defined class has additional interesting properties. It has been shown that for many classes that restricting the computational tree to a complete binary (CB) one does not reduce the computational power. RAP does not follow this rule: the CB version of RAP is properly contained \u2026",

Our main contribution is a tight condition for the feasibility of RMT in the setting resulting from the combination of these two quite general models; this settles the central open question of [13].Obtaining such a condition presents the need for knowledge exchange between players.

A notable exception is Peleg's paper, where the problem of deterministic communication in ad hoc radio networks with large labels is raised and a deterministic broadcasting algorithm is proposed, which runs in O(n2log n) time for N polynomially large in n. The O(nlog2n)-time deterministic broadcasting algorithm for networks with small labels given by Chrobak et al. implies deterministic O(n log N log n)-time broadcasting and O(n2log2N log n)-time gossiping in networks with large labels.

In this paper, we consider the effect of assigning weights on edges of unweighted network graphs and estimate their importance in community detection. In particular, we propose a new edge weight function and study its effect when used as a preprocessing step for community detection algorithms. Experimental results on a benchmark of random networks confirm our intuition that assigning weights on edges can play an important role in improving the performance of such algorithms.",

In addition, F is feasible if its augmentation with any new element x implies that either F\u2009+\u2009x exceeds B or F\u2009+\u2009x is dependent. Our first result is a polynomial time approximation scheme for this NP-hard problem which generalizes a recently studied version of the lazy bureaucrat problem. We next study the approximability of a more general setting called lazy staff matroid. In this generalization, every element of  has a multidimensional weight. We show that approximating this generalization is much harder than for the lazy matroid problem since it includes the independent dominating set problem.",

However no distributed algorithm is known that solves PCST with a guaranteed approximation factor. In this work we present an asynchronous distributed -approximation algorithm that constructs a PCST for a given connected undirected graph with non-negative edge weights and a non-negative prize value for each node. Our algorithm is an adaptation of the centralized algorithm proposed by Goemans and Williamson \\cite{GW_1995} to the distributed setting, and is based on the primal-dual method. The message complexity of the algorithm with input graph having node set  and edge set  is . Initially each node knows only its own prize value and the weight of each incident edge. The algorithm is spontaneously initiated at a special node called the \\emph{root node} and when it terminates each node knows whether it is in the PCST or not. To the best of our knowledge this is the first distributed constant approximation algorithm for PCST.",

In this setting, we view the wavelength assignment process as a strategic game in which each communication request selfishly chooses a wavelength in an effort to minimize the maximum congestion that it encounters on the chosen wavelength. We measure the cost of a certain wavelength assignment as the maximum, among all physical links, number of parallel fibers employed by this assignment. We start by settling questions related to the existence and computation of and convergence to pure Nash equilibria in these games. Our main contribution is a thorough analysis of the price of anarchy of such games, that is, the worst-case ratio between the cost of a Nash equilibrium and the optimal cost. We first provide upper bounds on the price of anarchy for \u2026",
