Abnormal heart rate during the recovery phase of the exercise has been proven to contain information concerning patient\u2019s clinical status. Many studies also denoted the significance of the first two minutes of the recovery as a predictor of mortality. In this study, employing signals recorded from patients during a CR exercise program at home, instead of a stress test in a clinical environment, we analyzed the HR signal toward the understanding of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system at the start of the program and after its completion. Features from time and frequency domain, already used for the evaluation of the exercise, were implemented. As an amelioration of the patient\u2019s status is detected based on these features, while the CR program \u2026",

As research resources are fostered, research community promotes the need to extract new knowledge from bio-signals towards the adoption of new medical procedures. However, integrated access, query and management of ECGs are impeded by the diversity and heterogeneity of bio-signal storage data formats. In this scope, the proposed work introduces a new methodology for the unified access to bio-signal databases and the accompanying metadata.

            "Abstract": "Purpose.: To explore new features of the optic nerve head morphology using the Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) and to assess their discriminating power between glaucomatous patients and normal subjects.Methods.: HRT reports, exported as TIFF images, from 97 normal subjects and 97 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients were used. For each image the contour of the dominant region of the optic disc cupping surface (dROCS) was transformed into a data series by calculating the distance of each contour pixel from the centroid. The length of contour (LC) and SD of contour (SDC) along with the dROCS area divided by the disc area (DA) HRT parameter were examined as novel parameters.Results.: The means of LC and SDC, after adjustment for cup area (CA) and DA HRT parameters, and dROCS/DA, after adjustment for CA, presented statistically significant differences (ANCOVA, P< 0.001) between the two groups. Using LC and SDC together in discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation, 75.3% of cases were correctly classified. Using dROCS/DA together with SDC, the correct classification percentage was 80.6%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.782 for LC, 0.725 for SDC, 0.861 for dROCS/DA, and 0.879 for the linear discrimination function that combines dROCS/DA and SDC.Conclusions.: These findings suggest that LC, SDC, and dROCS/DA can be exploited to the discrimination between glaucomatous and normal subjects. LC and SDC seem to arise from the difference in the shape of the contour of dROCS between the groups, suggesting bigger deviations and irregularities in the POAG group.",

The input image is initially decomposed into a set of primitive homogeneous regions through the morphological watershed transform applied to the image intensity gradient magnitude. This decomposition is represented by a region adjacency graph (RAG) that is input to a hierarchical merging process in which neighboring regions of high similarity are merged. The region similarity criterion is based on the concept of watershed contour dynamics. The robustness of the segmentation to the presence of noise and/or low contrast is improved by a regularization of the contour dynamics. Experimental results on various kinds of synthetic and real images, as well as comparison of the proposed method with other wellknown region merging algorithms are presented.",

Manual electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation for its diagnosis is tedious, time-consuming, requires high expertise, and suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability. Deep learning techniques could be exploited in order for robust arrhythmia detection models to be designed. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid neural model utilizing focal loss, an improved version of cross-entropy loss, to deal with training data imbalance. ECG features initially extracted via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are input to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for temporal dynamics memorization and thus, more accurate classification into the four ECG rhythm types, namely normal (N), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), atrial flutter (AFL) and AV junctional rhythm (J).

Approach: Different linear and nonlinear parameters indicating correlation or complexity were used to study the influence of fetal age and gender on FHR tracings. The signals were recorded from 99 normal pregnant women in a singleton pregnancy at gestational ages from 28 to 40 weeks, before the onset of labor. There were 56 female fetuses and 43 male. Main results: Analysis of FHR shows that the means as well as measures of irregularity of FHR, such as approximate entropy and algorithmic complexity, decrease as gestation progresses. There were also indications that mutual information and multiscale entropy were lower in male fetuses in early pregnancy. Significance: Fetal age and gender seem to influence FHR tracings. Taking this into consideration would improve the interpretation \u2026",

Such a map is produced for every training image using Graph-cuts to calculate the most suited balance of current and prior information. Training maps are optimally adapted on the test image, through non-rigid registration, producing the Optimum Local Weighting map, which is anatomically the most suitable to this test image.

            "Abstract": "Background: Obesity is a major public health problem globally and in Europe. The prevalence of childhood obesity is also soaring. Several parameters of the living environment are contributing to this increase, such as the density of fast food retailers, and thus, preventive health policies against childhood obesity must focus on the environment to which children are exposed. Currently, there are no systems in place to objectively measure the effect of living environment parameters on obesogenic behaviors and obesity. The H2020 project \u201cBigO: Big Data Against Childhood Obesity\u201d aims to tackle childhood obesity by creating new sources of evidence based on big data.Objective: This paper introduces the Obesity Prevention dashboard (OPdashboard), implemented in the context of BigO, which offers an interactive data platform for the exploration of objective obesity-related behaviors and local environments based on the data recorded using the BigO mHealth (mobile health) app.Methods: The OPdashboard, which can be accessed on the web, allows for (1) the real-time monitoring of children\u2019s obesogenic behaviors in a city area,(2) the extraction of associations between these behaviors and the local environment, and (3) the evaluation of interventions over time. More than 3700 children from 33 schools and 2 clinics in 5 European cities have been monitored using a custom-made mobile app created to extract behavioral patterns by capturing accelerometer and geolocation data. Online databases were assessed in order to obtain a description of the environment. The dashboard\u2019s functionality was evaluated during a focus group discussion with \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Integrated care and connected health are two fast evolving concepts that have the potential to leverage personalised health. From the one side, the restructuring of care models and implementation of new systems and integrated care programs providing coaching and advanced intervention possibilities, enable medical decision support and personalized healthcare services. From the other side, the connected health ecosystem builds the means to follow and support citizens via personal health systems in their everyday activities and, thus, give rise to an unprecedented wealth of data. These approaches are leading to the deluge of complex data, as well as in new types of interactions with and among users of the healthcare ecosystem. The main challenges refer to the data layer, the information layer, and the output of information processing and analytics. In all the above mentioned layers, the primary concern is the quality both in data and information, thus, increasing the need for filtering mechanisms. Especially in the data layer, the big biodata management and analytics ecosystem is evolving, telemonitoring is a step forward for data quality leverage, with numerous challenges still left to address, partly due to the large number of micro-nano sensors and technologies available today, as well as the heterogeneity in the users\u2019 background and data sources.

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for aligning multiple genomic or proteomic sequences using a fuzzyfied Hidden Markov Model (HMM). HMMs are known to provide compelling performance among multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithms, yet their stochastic nature does not help them cope with the existing dependence among the sequence elements. Fuzzy HMMs are a novel type of HMMs based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy integrals which generalizes the classical stochastic HMM, by relaxing its independence assumptions. In this paper, the fuzzy HMM model for MSA is mathematically defined. New fuzzy algorithms are described for building and training fuzzy HMMs, as well as for their use in aligning multiple sequences. Fuzzy HMMs can also increase the model capability of aligning multiple sequences mainly in terms of computation time. Modeling the multiple sequence alignment procedure with fuzzy HMMs can yield a robust and time-effective solution that can be widely used in bioinformatics in various applications, such as protein classification, phylogenetic analysis and gene prediction, among others.",

The topographic features of the resulting image are detected based on first and second-order image derivatives which characterize the local differential image structure. Using an artery model of a smooth elongated object with an approximately Gaussian smoothed semi-elliptical profile, the candidate skeleton areas are detected as sets of points consisting of ridges, saddle points and peaks. False skeleton areas, produced due to the noise sensitivity of the differentiation filters, have small size and are eliminated by connected component labeling (CCL). CCL may \u2026",

This algorithm requires only one pass from the initial dataset in order to generate the item set, while new metrics corresponding to the notion of Support and Confidence are used. URG-2 was evaluated over two medical databases, introducing randomly multiple missing values for each record's attribute (rate: 5\u2009\u2013\u200920% by 5% increments) in the initial dataset. Compared with the classical approach (records with missing values are ignored \u2026",

This viewpoint has recently been demonstrated by the introduction and adoption of approaches and tools, such as the Personal Health Record (PHR). In the current work, the design of a mobile personal health system for logging information corresponding to the patient status and sharing it within social networks is presented. By utilizing event-driven patterns, the pervasive sharing of the recorded information is enabled, under conditions specified by the mobile user. This \u201canytime-anywhere\u201d information sharing may be valuable to senders (i.e. patients) and receivers (e.g. relatives, healthcare professionals, similar patients, etc.) in terms of emotional support, mutual understanding, sharing of experiences, seeking of advice and improved self-tracking.

There is evidence that chronic conditions may be managed successfully using telehealth, but this is not leading to large scale deployment. Organisational and structural changes are needed to progress from pilots to real implementations that are integrated in the care routines. The ACT project goes beyond the trial setting to assess programs implementing care coordination (CC) and telehealth (TH) in different EU regions. The aim is to identify best practice organisational and structural processes supporting integration and implementation of telehealth in a care coordination context for routine management of patients with long-term medical conditions. In this report we describe the framework of indicators for CC&TH outcomes and drivers that define data elements collected during the project. The evaluation engine is responsible for capturing, monitoring and evaluating CC&TH deployment, using collected data. The evaluation results contribute to the \u201cbest practice cookbook\u201d that will facilitate CC&TH deployment at scale. This report also shares what we have learned from a data transfer test case.",

In 17 coronary arteries from nine patients, IVUS and BCA were performed. From each angiographic projection, a single end-diastolic frame was selected and in each frame the IVUS catheter was interactively detected for the extraction of 3D catheter path. Ultrasound data was obtained with a sheath-based catheter and recorded on S-VHS videotape. S-VHS data was digitized and lumen and media-adventitia contours were semi-automatically detected in end-diastolic IVUS images. Each pair of contours was aligned \u2026",

No studies have been conducted among high-school students, and SRER has not been validated vs. objective eating rate (OBER) in such populations. The objectives were to investigate (among high-school student populations) the association between OBER and BMI z-scores (BMIz), the validity of SRER vs. OBER, and potential differences in BMIz between SRER categories. Three studies were conducted. Study 1 included 116 Swedish students (mean\u00b1SD age: 16.5\u00b10.8, 59% females) who were eating school lunch. Food intake and meal duration were objectively recorded, and OBER was calculated. Additionally, students provided SRER. Study 2 included students (n= 50, mean\u00b1SD age: 16.7\u00b10.6, 58% females) from Study 1 who ate another objectively recorded school lunch. Study 3 included 1832 high-school students (mean\u00b1SD age: 15.8\u00b10.9, 51% females) from Sweden (n= 748) and Greece (n= 1084) who provided SRER. In Study 1, students with BMIz\u2265 0 had faster OBER vs. students with BMIz< 0 (mean difference:+ 7.7 g/min or+ 27%, p= 0.012), while students with fast SRER had higher OBER vs. students with slow SRER (mean difference:+ 13.7 g/min or+ 56%, p= 0.001).

Electrical properties of the atrial myocardium may be related to the appearance of this type of arrhythmia. However ectopic beats, occurring normally in healthy people, disturb cardiac rhythm. Those beats arise from fiber outside the region of SA node. With this work we aim at highlighting differences in the atrial activity between healthy subjects, healthy subjects presenting many ectopic events and patients with AF. The X-Y-Z leads of vectorcardiography recordings are considered. Wavelet-based parameters are extracted from a window which represents atrial activity originated from SA node and compared between signals of the three groups. Results show differences potentially related to the conduction system of the atrium between healthy people and people with AF, as well as between healthy people and people with ectopic events.

These subsets, collectively accounting for ~30% of all G-CLL, are not represented within the common IgM/D variant, thus prompting speculations about distinct ontogenetic origin and/or immune triggering, as well as raising questions regarding the timing of class-switch recombination (CSR) in relation to malignant transformation.

We extend the UML Activity Diagram\u2013to HWADD1 diagram-to support workflow topics as well as standardized Clinical Documents that are handled by the processes. The diagram can be used to identify the activities in the processes in health care and also the resources for the execution of the activities. Adding also the concept of clinical documents the diagram can represent, in a sound way, the processes in a regional health network and the required resources in a homogenized way.

Recently, the analysis of the PWM from PAF patients during SR, revealed the presence of a distinct secondary morphology in a remarkable percentage of beats. We hypothesize that the variability on the PWM can be attributed to the coexistence of electrical remodeling and the transient modification of the conduction route which is the result of the shift of the stimulation site within the sinus node.

            "Abstract": "In the last decade an unprecedented development in bioinformatics has been observed. An extremely high number of organisms have been sequenced and included in genomic databases. The huge amount of data produced needs to be stored and processed for further analysis. Scientists, have researched algorithms for finding complicated patterns in DNA sequences, but there is a need for computational power and large storage systems, in order to implement specific algorithms in as many as possible DNA sequences stored in large Databases and save the results produced for future use.Recently, a number of pattern matching algorithms that allowing gaps have been introduced and Grid is an emerging techology that seems to be helpful in this kind of biomedical research. In this paper, we present our effort towards the construction of a user friendly Interface for accessing the Grid EGEE platform. The Interface is a specific one and was built to perform Pattern-Matching with Bounded Gaps in Genomic and Proteomic Sequences. The algorithm and the Interface is tested with small and large DNA and protein sequences as an input, downloaded from a gene and protein repository, NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and the gathered results produced are presented.",

Three known classifiers are tested and compared in both cases, namely the Fisher linear discriminant, the\u00a2-nearest neighbor classifier, and the nearest mean classifier. The performance of each classifier is evaluated in terms of the probabilities of false alarm and detection or the receiver operating characteristic.

The splicing mechanism involves complex interactions among positional and compositional features of different lengths. Computational modeling of the underlying constructive information is especially challenging, in order to decipher splicing-inducing elements and alternative splicing factors. SpliceIT (Splice Identification Technique) introduces a hybrid method for splice site prediction that couples probabilistic modeling with discriminative computational or experimental features inferred from published studies in two subsequent classification steps. The first step is undertaken by a Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) trained on the probabilistic profile that is extracted using two alternative position-dependent feature selection methods.

Shape prior information is captured from a training set and is introduced in the optimization procedure to restrict the evolution into allowable shapes. In this way, the evolution converges onto regions even with weak boundaries. Although significant effort has been devoted on different ways of capturing and analyzing prior information, very little thought has been devoted on the way of combining image information with prior information. This paper focuses on a more natural way of incorporating the prior information in the level set framework. For proof of concept the method is applied on hippocampus segmentation in T1-MR images. Hippocampus segmentation is a very challenging task, due to the multivariate surrounding region and the missing boundary with the neighboring amygdala, whose intensities are identical. The proposed method, mimics the human segmentation way and thus shows enhancements in the segmentation accuracy.",

Computational lumen border detection in OCT images is highly advantageous, since it may support rapid morphometric analysis. However, automatic detection is very challenging, since OCT images typically include various artifacts that impact image clarity, including features such as side branches and intraluminal blood presence. This paper presents ARCsingle bondOCT, a segmentation method for fully-automatic detection of lumen border in OCT images.ARCsingle bondOCT relies on multiple, consecutive processing steps, accounting for image preparation, contour extraction and refinement. In particular, for contour extraction ARCsingle bondOCT employs the transformation of OCT images \u2026",

A new approach for mining uncertainty rules and filling missing values is proposed, which is in turn particularly suitable for dynamic databases, like the ones used in home care systems.  Methods:  In this study, a new data mining method named FiMV (Filling Missing Values) is illustrated based on the mined uncertainty rules.

The proposed approach enables extraction of the corresponding boundaries in sequential IVUS frames by applying an iterative procedure, in which initialization of the two contours in each frame is performed automatically, based on the segmentation of its previous frame. The above procedure is implemented through a user-friendly interface, permitting the interaction of the user when needed.

We have previously reported distinctive SHM patterns amongst IGHV4-34 CLL, especially for subsets with stereotyped BcR IG. However, although a large number of cases (~2000) was previously studied, since even the largest subsets account for only ~3% of CLL, meaningful conclusions could not be reached for smaller subsets.

Three groups, of 10 subjects each, are considered: a) normal sleep, b) psychophysiological insomnia, and c) sleep misperception. One night sleep PSG and sleep macro- micro structure annotations were available per subject. The statistical properties and the dynamics of CAP events are in focus. Multiscale and non-linear methods are presented for the analysis of the microstructure event time series, applied for each type of CAP events, and their combination. The results suggest that a) both types of insomnia present CAP differences from normal sleep related to hyperarousal, b) sleep misperception presents more extensive differences from normal, potentially reflecting multiple sleep mechanisms, c) there are differences between the two types of insomnia as regard \u2026",

            "Abstract": "While various technical approaches for constructing Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications/services have been proposed, it has become apparent that interoperability of AAL systems is the key challenge that has to be tackled for exploiting AAL technologies in their full potential. Equally important, there is a lack of tools that can support AAL system/application developers to implement systemic and affordable solutions. The objective of this work is to illustrate the design and development of a basic AAL application devoted to physical activity monitoring by exploiting the universAAL open platform and tools. Our main goal is to illustrate the procedure that developers have to follow for such a development as well as the benefits offered from the adoption of universAAL in terms of extensibility and interoperability.",

It has been widely argued that various types of such errors may be prevented by introducing Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) at the point of care. Objectives: Although significant research has been conducted in the field, still medication safety is a crucial issue, while few research outcomes are mature enough to be considered for use in actual clinical settings. In this paper, we present a clinical decision support framework targeting medication safety with major focus on adverse drug event (ADE) prevention.

Using an artery model of a smooth elongated object with an approximately Gaussian smoothed semi-elliptical profile, the candidate skeleton areas are detected as sets of points consisting of ridges, saddle points and peaks. False skeleton areas, produced due to the noise sensitivity of the differentiation filters, have small size and are eliminated by connected component labeling (CCL).

A novel algorithm, namely rule discovery algorithm (RDA), appropriate for periodic time series data, like electrocardiograms (ECGs) can be considered, is proposed. The first phase of the algorithm aims to break the sequence (i.e. an ECG) into overlapping, reconfigured length subsequences according to the sampling frequency and the types of ECG abnormalities to be studied. The Pearson correlation coefficient was chosen as the categorization metric, which is independent of the base line shifts and the amplitude scales. At the following phase the categorized sequence was scanned, so the most efficient rules would be mined. The format of those rules is \"IF A occurs THEN B occurs WITHIN time T\", where A and B are categorized subsequences and T the time duration between A and B. RDA \u2026",

The framework integrates diverse and dynamic knowledge sources in the form of rule-based ADE signals, all under a uniform Knowledge Base (KB) structure, according to the defined knowledge model. Equally important, it employs the means to contextualize the encapsulated knowledge, in order to provide appropriate support considering the specific local environment (hospital, medical department, language, etc.), as well as the mechanisms for knowledge querying, inference, sharing, and management.

Thus, it helps diagnosis and prevention of atherosclerosis. About 100\u2013300 crosssectional OCT images are obtained for each artery. Therefore, it is important to facilitate and objectify the process of detecting regions of interest, which otherwise demand a lot of time and effort from medical experts. We propose a processing pipeline to automatically detect parts of the arterial wall which are not normal and possibly consist of plaque. The first step of the processing is transforming OCT images to polar coordinates and to detect the arterial wall. After binarization of the image and removal of the catheter, the arterial wall is detected in each axial line from the first white pixel to a depth of 80 pixels which is equal to 1.5 mm. Then, the arterial wall is split to orthogonal patches which undergo OCT-specific transformations and are labelled as plaque (4 distinct kinds: fibrous, calcified, lipid and mixed) or normal tissue. OCT-specific transformations include enhancing the more reflective parts of the image and rendering patches independent of the arterial wall curvature. The patches are input to AlexNet which is fine-tuned to learn to classify them. Fine-tuning is performed by retraining an already trained AlexNet with a learning rate which is 20 times larger for the last 3 fully-connected layers than for the initial 5 convolutional layers. 114 cross-sectional images were randomly selected to finetune AlexNet while 6 were selected to validate the results.

The aim of this study was to compare Data Mining diagnosis with clinical diagnosis by applying a Data Miner (DM) to a clinical dataset of infertile men with azoospermia. DESIGN: One hundred and forty-seven azoospermic men were clinically classified into four groups: a) obstructive azoospermia (n= 63), b) non-obstructive azoospermia (n= 71), c) hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (n= 2), and d) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (n= 11). The DM (IBM s DB2/Intelligent Miner for Data\u00ae 6.1) was asked to reproduce a four-cluster model. RESULTS: DM formed four groups of patients: a) eugonadal men with normal testicular volume and normal FSH levels (n= 86), b) eugonadal men with significantly reduced testicular volume (median 6.5 cm3) and very high FSH levels (n= 29), c) eugonadal men with moderately reduced testicular volume (median 14.5 cm3) and raised FSH levels (n= 20), and d) hypogonadal men (n= 12). Overall DM concordance rate in hypogonadal men was 92%, in obstructive azoospermia 73%, and in non-obstructive azoospermia 69%. CONCLUSIONS: Data Mining produces clinically meaningful results but different from those of the clinical diagnosis. It is possible that the use of large sets of structured and formalised data and continuous evaluation of DM results will generate a useful methodology for the Clinician.",

            "Abstract": "Persistent cervical infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the development of cervical cancer. Therefore, there are other co-factors facilitating the hrHPV carcinogenic process, one of which is smoking. To assess the effect of smoking on high-risk (hr) HPV DNA positivity and on the expression of HPV E7 oncoprotein, as a surrogate of persistenthrHPV infection, we used data from women recruited for the PIPAVIR project, which examined the role of E7 protein detection in cervical cancer screening. Women were tested for hrHPV DNA, using Multiplex Genotyping (MPG), and E7 protein, using a novel sandwich ELISA method, and gave information on their smoking habits. Among 1473 women, hrHPV prevalence was 19.1%. The odds ratio (OR) for hrHPV positivity of smokers compared to non-smokers was 1.785 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.365\u20132.332, p< 0.001). The ORs for E7 positivity, concerning hrHPV positive women, ranged from 0.720 to 1.360 depending on the E7 detection assay used, but this was not statistically significant. Smoking increases the probability of hrHPV infection, and smoking intensity is positively associated to this increase. Smoking is not related to an increased probability of E7 protein positivity for hrHPV positive women.",

The objective of the multi-agent system is to provide a set of alert/notification mechanisms for the clinicians, helping them to classify the clinical condition of each patient. Therefore, despite the huge amount of data managed by the system, due to the daily use of the contact center's services, these alert mechanisms provide the clinician with an overview of the cases that need further examination and save him/her time from the trivial cases. The multi-agent system consists of different types of agents, each one assigned with specific tasks, which communicate with each other, in order to share knowledge.",

In this work we demonstrate that power spectral analysis of drivers' heart rate can report driving errors caused by sleepiness. Furthermore, variation of Fractal Dimension (FD) can aid significant information for the assessment of the driving situation. ECG and EEG data were collected from sleep-deprived subjects exposed to real field driving conditions. A lower ratio of low frequency to high frequency components (LF/HF), and lower LF values were reported on the occurrence of driving errors.",

So far, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method for multiple sequence alignment has been proved competitive to the classical deterministic algorithms with respect to phylogenetic analysis; nevertheless, its stochastic nature does not help it cope with the existing dependence among the sequence elements. This paper deals with phylogenetic analysis of protein and gene data using multiple sequence alignments produced by fuzzy profile Hidden Markov Models. Fuzzy profile HMMs are a novel type of profile HMMs based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy integrals, which generalize the classical stochastic HMM by relaxing its independence assumptions. In this paper, alignments produced by the fuzzy HMM model are used in phylogenetic analysis of protein data, enhancing the quality of phylogenetic trees. The new methodology is implemented in HPV virus phylogenetic inference. The results of the analysis are compared against those obtained by the classical profile HMM model and depict the superiority of the fuzzy profile HMM in this field.",

For the system to be implemented successfully it is essential that it is accepted by consumers and health professionals. While still under development it was investigated how the system is perceived by them. The system was discussed in a focus group with five females (age: 19\u201324 years) interested in weight management. Nineteen overweight young adults completed a questionnaire on their experiences with the system after 5 hours of using and wearing the system. Furthermore, twelve health professionals were interviewed on the system. Overall the system was perceived as very promising. The objective measurements of both eating and physical activity behavior, and real-time feedback were especially appreciated. However, it was emphasized that the system should be discrete, user-friendly and comfortable for the consumer, and saves the health professional time. These results of the focus group, interviews and questionnaire on user experience are promising and are being taken into account in the further development of the system.",

The local weights regulate locally the combination of each term during the evolution, acting as an experienced balancer between image and prior information. The ideal proportion of relation between the mixture of different ACMs and the prior model is defined by the optimum global weights. As proof of concept, the method is applied on the very challenging task of segmenting hippocampus and amygdala structures.",

Fibrosis markers galectin-3 and TGF-beta1 in serum were higher in patients with AF and MS as compared to AF without MS. We propose that high level of galectin-3 and TGF-beta1 could be predictors of LA myocardium fibrosis in patients with AF.",

However, synchronization phenomena of different origin (neurological, mechanical, ventilation parameters) may occur, which vary among patients, and during the course of monitoring of a single patient, the timely recognition of which is challenging even for experts. The dynamics and complex causal relations among bioparameters and the ventilation synchronization are not well studied. The purpose of this work is \u2026",

This paper describes an architecture enabling biosensors, forming a Body Area Network (BAN), to be integrated in a Grid infrastructure. The Grid services proposed, such as access to recorded data, are offered via the BAN console, an enhanced wearable computer, where the recordings of multiple biosensors are integrated. Medical Grid-enabled Nodes can have access to biosensor measurements upon demand, or can agree to get notifications and alerts. Thus, in such a distributed environment, data and computational resources are independent, yet cooperating unobtrusively, contributing to the notion of pervasive healthcare.",

            "Abstract": "Early identification of patients at risk for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is essential to attain optimal treatment and a favorable prognosis. We compared the performance of a beat-to-beat (B2B) P-wave analysis with that of standard P-wave indices (SPWIs) in identifying patients prone to PAF. To this end, 12-lead ECG and 10 min vectorcardiogram (VCG) recordings were obtained from 33 consecutive, antiarrhythmic therapy na\u00efve patients, with a short history of low burden PAF, and from 56 age- and sex-matched individuals with no AF history. For both groups, SPWIs were calculated, while the VCG recordings were analyzed on a B2B basis, and the P-waves were classified to a primary or secondary morphology. Wavelet transform was used to further analyze P-wave signals of main morphology. Univariate analysis revealed that none of the SPWIs performed acceptably in PAF detection, while five B2B features reached an AUC above 0.7. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop two classifiers\u2014one based on B2B analysis derived features and one using only SPWIs. The B2B classifier was found to be superior to SPWIs classifier; B2B AUC: 0.849 (0.754\u20130.917) vs. SPWIs AUC: 0.721 (0.613\u20130.813), p value: 0.041. Therefore, in the studied population, the proposed B2B P-wave analysis outperforms SPWIs in detecting patients with PAF while in sinus rhythm. This can be used in further clinical trials regarding the prognosis of such patients.",

In immunogenetics, substantial effort has been put on the analysis of the repertoire of T cell receptors (TCR), one of the main weapons of the adaptive immune system, since this analysis is of great significance for the study of lymphoid malignancies, such as the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). However, sequencing errors, inherent even in traditional low-throughput sequencing, can interfere with repertoire analysis, possibly misleading the immunogenetic interpretation of the analysis outcomes. The high sequencing error rate of NGS aggravates the problem even further.

Flow rate properties are important for the assessment of pathologies like mitral regurgitation. We expect this method to be transferable to in-vivo patient data. The method consists of two main parts:(a) detecting a bounding box which encloses aliasing contours and its surroundings (namely a region representative of flow convergence area),(b) application of Convolutional Neural Networks for regression to estimate the flow convergence area. Best result achieved is the 5% mean error for validation data which is from other experiments that were used for training. Given the small number of training data, this method shows promising results.",

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method that allows to analyze and quantify the distribution of ventilation in the lungs. In this article, we present a new approach to promote the use of EIT data and the implementation of new clinical applications for differential diagnosis, with the development of several machine learning models to discriminate between EIT data from healthy and non-healthy subjects. EIT data from 16 subjects were acquired: 5 healthy and 11 non-healthy subjects (with multiple pulmonary conditions). Preliminary results have shown accuracy percentages of 66\\% in challenging evaluation scenarios. The results suggest that the pairing of EIT feature engineering methods with machine learning methods could be further explored and applied in the diagnostic and monitoring of patients suffering from lung diseases. Also, we introduce the use of a new feature in the context of EIT data analysis (Impedance Curve Correlation).",

However, to date, there is no methylation-based data on the association of methylation with alternative splicing and the distribution in exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). We presently report that, based on the computational analysis of the Human Epigenome Project data, CpG hypermethylation (>80%) is frequent in alternatively spliced sites (particularly in noncanonical) but not in alternate promoters. The methylation frequency increases in sequences containing multiple putative ESEs. However, significant differences in the extent of methylation are observed among different ESEs.

Currently, limited information is available regarding the role of antigens in the selection and activation of cognate T cells, although this is relevant in light of B and T cell interactions inducing T cell tolerance. Our preliminary next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies in 11 patients assigned to stereotyped subset #4, a clinically indolent disease subgroup, indicated T-cell receptor beta chain (TRB) gene repertoire restriction and oligoclonality. Prompted by these observations, here we sought to obtain a comprehensive view of the T-cell repertoire in CLL by extending our analysis to 36 untreated CLL patients \u2026",

The analysis resulted in a set of statistically significant over- represented motifs.

The splicing mechanism involves complex interactions among positional and compositional features of different lengths. Computational modeling of the underlying constructive information is especially challenging, in order to decipher splicing-inducing elements and alternative splicing factors. SpliceIT (Splice Identification Technique) introduces a hybrid method for splice site prediction that couples probabilistic modeling with discriminative computational or experimental features inferred from published studies in two subsequent classification steps. The first step is undertaken by a Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) trained on the probabilistic profile that is extracted using two alternative position-dependent feature selection methods. In the second step, the extracted predictions are combined with known species \u2026",

A number of established features derived from linear and nonlinear fields were employed to study the possible influence of maternal smoking on FHR tracings. Moreover, correlation and measures of complexity of the FHR were explored, in order to get closer to the core of information that the signal of FHR tracings conveys. Data included FHR tracings from 61 uncomplicated singleton pregnancies, 16 pregnant smoker cases, and 15 pregnancies of women with IUGR. The analysis of FHR indicated that some parameters, such as mutual information (P=0.0025), multiscale entropy (P=0.01), and algorithmic complexity (P=0.024) appeared \u2026",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is a need to create reliable monitoring and behavioral systems, and to investigate their effectiveness in preventing childhood obesity.Objective: To evaluate a range of novel technologies for collecting photographs, information regarding physical activity and geographic data (GPS) in overweight and obese children and adolescents during their day-to-day life.Methodology: The study was carried out in the context of the four-year European project BigO (http://bigoprogram. eu, Horizon2020, No. 727688). Overweight and obese children and adolescents aged 9-18 years participated in the study following approval by the local Committee on the Ethics of Human Research. Written informed consent was obtained by parents/guardians in all cases. The data collection system includes the BigO technology platform, which interfaces with a Smartphone and Smartwatch, and records data objectively (using inertial sensors and GPS) for each patient. Data are then transmitted to BigO servers to extract behavioral indicators, including:(a) physical activity/exercise,(b) dietary habits, and (c) environmental conditions (urban, socio-economic, nutritional). During the first pilot phase, participants used the BigO system for 2 weeks to take photographs of the food they consumed, as well as food advertisements, and wore the watch for specific periods during the week (at least 2 weekdays, 1 weekend and 3 nights). Finally, they were asked to return the watch and complete a questionnaire.Results: Forty children \u2026",

It is the purpose of this paper to explain our approach to the above study, and emphasise some of its elements that we deem important. More specifically, emphasis is placed on a number of methodology issues like, the mapping of the current situation, the roadmap to the proper construction of the telemedicine framework, and other human and organizational aspects of establishing telemedicine services in Greece. The ultimate goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the various multidisciplinary methodologies can be applied to face the challenges posed by telemedicine services application problems. In so doing, numerous studies and results are utilised to enrich the theoretical grounds of the various approaches.",

This work aims at investigating the difference in vitals that is induced by medication intake, delays and omissions, combined with a high or low salt diet. Experimental data were collected from heart failure (HF) subjects and include multiple measurements within a day, under different activities. These recordings were repeated on four separate days, each under different salt and medication intake conditions. The data were analysed by generating features that express temporal intra-subject differences. Statistical analysis for each feature highlighted the importance of blood pressure while standing and before exercise. Classifiers were built, that can distinguish with 80% accuracy the short term medication effect, or incompliance, from variation after medication intake. This quantitative characterization of the temporal vital sign variation, with respect to activities, medication and diet changes could contribute to an effectiveness and compliance model in daily life conditions.",

Metrics used were performed in 47 patients and included power spectral analysis, approximate entropy (ApEn) estimation and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The resulting values were compared with a previously validated measure of severity of illness, the sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA). We found decreased variability and approximate entropy and increased DFA scaling exponent /spl alpha/ in patients with the highest SOFA, incidence of death and length of stay. Correlations concerning /spl alpha/ exponent were stronger for surgical patients with past medical history while decreased ApEn was associated with increased morbidity of surgical patients without medical history.",

For example, we considered the technical features supported by modern mobile phones, such as Augmented Reality (AR), barcode scanning, and Near-Field Communication (NFC) tagging for identifying the drugs of interest, in order to avoid difficulties and errors in keying-in drug names by the user. We illustrate the applicability and virtue of the proposed approach via a mobile application that has been particularly designed to meet these goals.",

Nutritional adherence effect is examined on groups of patients, such as patients with high BMI that receive low nutrition and critically ill males. Regarding the latter analysis, an accuracy rate of 76.4% was achieved when classifying the critically ill males towards their outcome.

In wearable chest EIT, patients breathe spontaneously, and therefore, their breathing pattern might not be stable. Since most of the EIT feature extraction methods are applied to STBPs, this renders their automatic identification  of central importance. Approach: The EIT frame sequence is reconstructed from the raw EIT recordings and the raw Global Impedance Waveform (GIW) is computed. Next, the respiratory component of the raw GIW is extracted and processed for the automatic respiratory cycle (breath) extraction and their subsequent grouping into STBPs. Main Results: We suggest three criteria for the identification of STBPs, namely, the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Introduction: There is a plethora of medical algorithms in the web, which refer to Medical Computational Problems (MCPs) and provide all computational facilities required to solve a Medical Problem. MCPs are medical problems, the solution of which deals with mathematical or statistical models, signal or image processing, and estimation of parameters. The main problem in exposing MCPs is that the existing information about them is scattered and poorly organized. This paper presents an OWL Ontology Model that manages MCPs by means of organizing and visualizing their existing knowledge. Furthermore, an internet application that deals with the Ontology Model and provides an infrastructure to describe and associate MCPs, algorithmic solutions, and algorithmic implementations is built. Finally, an innovative algorithm that constructs the problems vectors from the ontology individuals is illustrated. Methods: In order to create a Medical Computational Problems-Knowledge Base (MCPs-KB) a prototype MCP ontology model was designed and implemented by use of the Ontology Web Language (OWL). The tool Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with its OWL plug-in was used to build the MCP ontology. The user space and three computational spaces\u2013medical problem, solutions, and implementation\u2013are proposed in order to provide a detailed accurate description of the MCP Ontology. The problem space consists of medical computational problems; the solution space is composed of algorithm solutions, whereas implementation model objects assist in carrying out the solutions.

            "Abstract": "Separation from mechanical ventilation is a difficult task, whereas conventional predictive indices have not been proven accurate enough, so far. A few studies have explored changes of breathing pattern variability for weaning outcome prediction, with conflicting results. In this study, we tried to assess respiratory complexity during weaning trials, using different non-linear methods derived from theory of complex systems, in a cohort of surgical critically ill patients. Thirty two patients were enrolled in the study. There were 22 who passed and 10 who failed a weaning trial. Tidal volume and mean inspiratory flow were analyzed for 10 minutes during two phases: 1. pressure support (PS) ventilation (15-20 cm H2O) and 2. weaning trials with PS: 5 cm H2O. Sample entropy (SampEn), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) exponent, fractal dimension (FD) and largest lyapunov exponents (LLE) of the two respiratory parameters were computed in all patients and during the two phases of PS. Weaning failure patients exhibited significantly decreased respiratory pattern complexity, reflected in reduced sample entropy and lyapunov exponents and increased DFA exponents of respiratory flow time series, compared to weaning success subjects (p < 0.001). In addition, their changes were opposite between the two phases of the weaning trials. A new model including rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), its product with airway occlusion pressure at 0.1 sec (P0.1), SampEn and LLE predicted better weaning outcome compared with RSBI, P0.1 and RSBI* P0.1 (conventional model, R2 = 0.874 vs 0.643, p < 0.001).

However, the steps through which DNA methylation targets affect gene pathways remain unclear. This work presents a novel computational approach that maps DNA methylation data from Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to gene pathways and identifies significant associations between differentially methylated loci and significantly enriched pathways. The objective is to provide a broader view of the DNA methylation mechanism by examining the extent to which certain biological pathways may be modulated by alterations of the DNA methylation profile. To test this method we used data from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent adult leukemia in the western world, where alterations of DNA methylation are \u2026",

The ECG signal is grouped in three different groups that are defined by QRS complex, P and T waves. These groups are defined by performing nonstationary spectral analysis. A standard autoregressive model is used to extract coefficients of local stationary ECG beat segment. Such a filter is useful for tracking changes in local statistical properties. Finally a Hidden Markov model is used for automatic segmentation. Due to the locality of signal statistical properties, it is important the Hidden Markov model to be initialised carefully. Thus, the initialisation of Hidden Markov chain is accomplished using autoregressive (AR) filter coefficients. The ECG signals are finally segmented into stationary regimes characterized by different autoregressive models in a beat by beat basis. This method has been tested in different \u2026",

Although numerous physiological indicators are available to describe an individual's level of alertness, the EEG signal has been shown to be one of the most predictive and reliable, since it is a direct measure of brain activity. In the present study, multichannel EEG data that were collected from 20 sleep-deprived subjects during real environmental conditions of driving are presented for the first time.

In this work, a fully automated approach for lumen and media-adventitia border detection is presented based on an active contour model, the initialization of which is performed via an analysis mechanism that takes advantage of the inherent morphologic characteristics of IVUS images. The in vivo validation of the proposed model in human coronary arteries revealed that it is a feasible approach, enabling accurate and rapid segmentation of multiple IVUS images.",

            "Abstract": "The automatic detection of adventitious sounds, such as wheezes and crackles, is a valuable non-invasive tool to detect and follow-up respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Crackles are short explosive sounds that seem to result from an abrupt opening or closing of the airways. Several methods have been proposed for automatic detection of crackles [1] based on wavelets and based on empirical mode decomposition. Wheezes are continuous sounds that are usually associated with obstructions in the air passages. Different methods were proposed to automatically detect wheezes, such as based on the detection of the wheezes signature in the spectrogram space (WS-SS)[2]. The performance of several features was tested for the detection of crackles and wheezes events. These features include thirty-one features usually employed in the context of Music Information Retrieval, the WS-SS [2] as well as the Teager energy and entropy. The classification was done using a logistic regression classifier. A leave-one-out (subject) cross-validation approach was used to test the performance of the two detectors. Sounds of twenty subjects, seventeen patients with manifestations of at least one type of adventitious sounds and three lung healthy subjects, were used in this study. The optimal detection parameters, such as the number of features, were chosen based on a grid search. Neighbourhood frames were grouped and considered as belonging to the same event. For the crackle detection, the best results were obtained using twenty-seven features. Using the optimal configuration [1], the positive predictive value (ppv) and \u2026",

One of the main driving forces is the management and analytics of multi-level multi-scale and multi-source data containing different semantics and possibilities for the realization of personalized health through the precision medicine approach. In the case of cardiovascular big data analytics progress is evident especially at the levels of physiology and eHealth. Specifically there is progress in the ICU domain, where streaming data are the big data source comprising a paradigm for point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics helping the clinical decision support system (CDSS) for physiological assessment of the cardiorespiratory system, as well as in the eHealth domain through the uptake of advanced closed loop telemonitoring systems addressing connected health and coordinated care for \u2026",

In sporadic cancers, silent p53 mutations are correlated with exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and exonic methylated sites. The present study shows that mutations in splice sites are also very frequent in LF/LFL syndromes, while missense mutations are less common compared to other familial or sporadic cancers (P\u2009=\u20090 in both cases). Furthermore, it is shown that the codons at which LF/LFL germline missense mutations occur, correlate with CpG\u2010containing ESEs (r\u2009=\u20090.181, P\u2009=\u20090.014) which are all methylated in p53.

Two different cases of speech under vocal fold pathology are examined: vocal fold paralysis and vocal fold edema. Three known classifiers are tested and compared in both cases, namely the Fisher linear discriminant, the#-nearest neighbor classifier, and the nearest mean classifier. The performance of each classifier is evaluated in terms of the probabilities of false alarm and detection or the receiver operating characteristic. The datasets used are part of a database of disordered speech developed by Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The experimental results indicate that vocal fold paralysis and edema can easily be detected by any of the aforementioned classifiers.",

Recent genome-wide studies provide compelling evidence for long-range sequence-dependence of this process, thus necessitating the computational identification of cytosine methylation and its deviations at individual CpG sites, processes which might reveal the activation of various epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. The present study deals with the prediction of methylation at single CpG sites located both in CpG islands and non-CpG islands, relying solely on the intrinsic information of the 401nt sequences centred at the candidate methylated CpG cytosines. The proposed method was evaluated on human methylation data available by the Human Epigenome Project.

            "Abstract": "Implementing information and communications technology (ICT) at scale requires evaluation processes to capture the impact on users as well as the infrastructure into which it is being introduced. For older adults living with cognitive impairment this requires evaluation that can accommodate different levels of cognitive impairment, alongside input from family and formal caregivers, plus stakeholder organisations. The European Horizon 2020 project INdependent LIving support Functions for the Elderly (IN LIFE) set out to integrate 17 technologies into a single digital platform for older people living with cognitive impairment plus their families, care providers and stakeholders. The IN LIFE evaluation took place across six national pilot sites to examine a number of variables including impact on the users, user acceptance of the individual services and the overall platform, plus the economic case for the IN LIFE platform. The results confirmed the interest and need among older adults, family caregivers, formal caregivers and stakeholders, for information and communications technology (ICT). Relative to the baseline, quality of life improved and cognition stabilized, however, there was an overall reluctance to pay for the platform. The findings provide insights into existing barriers and challenges for adoption of ICT for older people living with cognitive impairment.",

To achieve this, a consortium of experts, both from industry (two companies, one hospital and one healthcare organization) and academia (three universities), was set to investigate, analyse, design, build and test the new platform. This paper provides insights to the PCEH concept and to the current stage of the project. In doing so, we aim at increasing the awareness of this important endeavor and sharing the lessons learned so far throughout our work.",

However, efficient emotion recognition remains a difficult task, often attempted subjectively, with obtrusive means and/or using specialized hardware. The present work uses haptic touch data acquired from Android smartphones to takes the first step towards the development of an objective, unobtrusive and real-life emotion recognition method that exploits the association between emotion and haptic touch. Focusing on four basic emotions (Excitement, Relaxation, Boredom and Frustration) the proposed method achieves very promising classification accuracy using a mixture of feature extraction and machine learning based classification techniques.

            "Abstract": "Persistent cervical infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the development of cervical cancer. Therefore, there are other co-factors facilitating the hrHPV carcinogenic process, one of which is smoking. To assess the effect of smoking on high-risk (hr) HPV DNA positivity and on the expression of HPV E7 oncoprotein, as a surrogate of persistent hrHPV infection, we used data from women recruited for the PIPAVIR project, which examined the role of E7 protein detection in cervical cancer screening. Women were tested for hrHPV DNA, using Multiplex Genotyping (MPG), and E7 protein, using a novel sandwich ELISA method, and gave information on their smoking habits. Among 1473 women, hrHPV prevalence was 19.1%. The odds ratio (OR) for hrHPV positivity of smokers compared to non-smokers was 1.785 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.365\u20132.332, p< 0.001). The ORs for E7 positivity, concerning hrHPV positive women, ranged from 0.720 to 1.360 depending on the E7 detection assay used, but this was not statistically significant. Smoking increases the probability of hrHPV infection, and smoking intensity is positively associated to this increase. Smoking is not related to an increased probability of E7 protein positivity for hrHPV positive women. View Full-Text",

Continuous Wavelet Transform is applied to ECG and Mean/Max parameters are calculated within the P window for different frequency bands. Thus, 24 parameters are available, which, along with the 4 window lengths (corresponding to P wave length of X, Y, Z, V signals), make a pool of available parameters to be used for classification. Linear regression is used for the classification of the two groups and bootstrapping is applied in order to enhance statistical robustness. The features to be used in the regression model are selected from the pool of available parameters by use of an iterative procedure. The outcome of the feature selection procedure shows that X and Z-axis features as well as vector-magnitude features are the most important ones for the prediction of Atrial Fibrillation after CABG.",

Given the emerging multifarious interactions between CLL and bystander T cells, we sought to determine whether antigen (s) are also selecting T cells in CLL. We performed a large-scale, next-generation sequencing (NGS) study of the T-cell repertoire, focusing on major stereotyped subsets representing CLL subgroups with undisputed antigenic drive, but also included patients carrying non-subset IG rearrangements to seek for T-cell immunogenetic signatures ubiquitous in CLL. Considering the inherent limitations of NGS, we deployed bioinformatics algorithms for qualitative curation of T-cell receptor rearrangements, and included multiple types of controls. Overall, we document the clonal architecture of the T-cell repertoire in CLL. These T-cell clones persist and further \u2026",

Most individuals maintain their food intake weight (g) and eating rate (g/min) rank in relation to their peers, despite food and environmental manipulations. Single meal measures may enable identification of \u201clarge portion eaters\u201d and \u201cfast eaters,\u201d finding individuals at risk of developing obesity. The aim of this study was to predict real-life food intake weight and eating rate based on one school lunch. Twenty-four high-school students with a mean (\u00b1SD) age of 16.8 yr (\u00b10.7) and body mass index of 21.9 (\u00b14.1) were recruited, using no exclusion criteria. Food intake weight and eating rate was first self-rated (\u201cLess,\u201d\u201cAverage\u201d or \u201cMore than peers\u201d), then objectively recorded during one school lunch (absolute weight of consumed food in grams). Afterwards, subjects recorded as many main meals (breakfasts, lunches and dinners) as possible in real-life for a period of at least two weeks, using a Bluetooth connected weight scale and a smartphone application. On average participants recorded 18.9 (7.3) meals during the study. Real-life food intake weight was 327.4 g (\u00b1110.6), which was significantly lower (p= 0.027) than the single school lunch, at 367.4 g (\u00b1167.2). When the intra-class correlation of food weight intake between the objectively recorded real-life and school lunch meals was compared, the correlation was excellent (R= 0.91). Real-life eating rate was 33.5 g/min (\u00b114.8), which was significantly higher (p= 0.010) than the single school lunch, at 27.7 g/min (\u00b113.3).

A series of relevant bioparameters continuously monitored, are meant to guide the medical professionals in appropriately adapting the operation and treatment, in this direction. Still, the dynamics and complex causal relations among bioparameters and the ventilation synchronization are not well studied. The purpose of this work is to elaborate on a methodology towards predicting level of ventilation synchronization based on the previous known evolution of monitored bioparameters. A nonlinear model is thus proposed, based on support vector machines regression, and the best input memory is investigated. The proposed model shows good correlation (over 0.7) with the actual outputs, and low error, constituting an encouraging step \u2026",

Specifically, the extent of plaque and its type, which are indicative of the patient\u2019s condition, are better assessed by OCT images in comparison to other in vivo modalities. A large amount of imaging data per patient require automatic methods for rapid results. An effective step towards automatic plaque detection and plaque characterization is axial lines (A-lines) based classification into normal and various plaque types. In this work, a novel automatic method for A-line classification is proposed. The method employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification in its core and comprised the following pre-processing steps: arterial wall segmentation and an OCT-specific (depth-resolved) transformation and a post-processing step based on the majority of classifications. The important step was the OCT-specific transformation, which was based on the estimation of the attenuation coefficient in every pixel of the OCT image. The dataset used for training and testing consisted of 183 images from 33 patients. In these images, four different plaque types were delineated. The method was evaluated by cross-validation. The mean values of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 74.73%, 87.78%, and 61.45%, respectively, when classifying into plaque and normal A-lines. When plaque A-lines were classified into fibrolipidic and fibrocalcific, the overall accuracy was 83.47% for A-lines of OCT-specific transformed images and 74.94% for A-lines of original images.

This paper presents a novel approach towards constructing a personalized mobile system, introduced as add-on to existing remote monitoring systems, for the management of health information by the patient himself/herself, with a Personal Health Record (PHR) constituting the system backbone. Particular emphasis is given to interconnection aspects with the monitoring system, so as to enable enhanced customization and management of monitoring-driven information provided to the patients according to their requirements/preferences.

In this paper, a method for automatic detection of abnormal motion patterns is proposed to be used as a computerized diagnostic tool for pathologic cardiac function. A multi-scale modeling method, based on a Generating-Shrinking neural network and a 4-D surface parametric model were used to extract the deformation of the myocardium from multi slice-multi phase MRI examinations. A feature extraction procedure then calculated myocardial thickening and radial deformation of the left ventricle and produced a set of motion parameters from the surface model. Input patterns consisting of the above features were fed into a feedforward neural network, which was trained to capture the normal cardiac function and to distinguish certain pathologic motion patterns.",

The defective hematopoiesis in CIN can be mainly attributed to accelerated Fas-mediated death of the CD34+/CD33+ granulocytic progenitors, secondary to an inflammatory bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Crucial to CIN pathogenesis are the increased numbers of activated T cells identified in both peripheral blood (PB) and BM of CIN patients, supporting an immune pathogenesis. Using Sanger sequencing, we previously reported that the T-cell receptor (TR) gene repertoire in CIN is skewed, indicating antigen selection in CIN ontogeny. However, the analytical depth afforded by Sanger sequencing is limited, hindering definitive conclusions. In order to obtain a truly comprehensive view into the role of antigen drive in \u2026",

Alternative methods for initial evaluation are sought. Our aim was the prediction of Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) in patients potentially suffering from OSA based on nonlinear analysis of respiratory biosignals during sleep, a method that is related to the pathophysiology of the disorder.   Materials and Methods Patients referred to a Sleep Unit (135) underwent full polysomnography. Three nonlinear indices (Largest Lyapunov Exponent, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and Approximate Entropy) extracted from two biosignals (airflow from a nasal cannula, thoracic movement) and one linear derived from Oxygen saturation provided input to a data mining application with contemporary classification algorithms for the creation of predictive models for AHI.   Results A linear regression model presented a correlation coefficient of 0.77 in predicting AHI. With a cutoff value of AHI = 8, the sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 71.4% in discrimination between patients and normal subjects. The decision tree for the discrimination between patients and normal had sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 60%, respectively. Certain obtained nonlinear values correlated significantly with commonly accepted physiological parameters of people suffering from OSA.   Discussion We developed a predictive model for the presence/severity of OSA using a simple linear equation and additional decision trees with nonlinear features extracted from 3 respiratory recordings.

            "Abstract": "The remarkable advances in high-performance computing and the resulting increase of the computational power have the potential to leverage computational cardiology towards improving our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of arrhythmias such as Atrial Fibrillation (AF). In AF, a complex interaction between various triggers and the atrial substrate is considered to be the leading cause of AF initiation and perpetuation. In electrocardiography (ECG), P-wave is supposed to reflect atrial depolarization. It has been found that even during sinus rhythm (SR), in AF patients multiple P-wave morphologies are present in patients with history of AF, suggesting a higher dispersion of the conduction route in this population. In this scoping review, we focused on the mechanisms which modify the electrical substrate of the atria in AF patients, while investigating the existence of computational models that simulate the propagation of the electrical signal through different routes. The adopted review methodology is based on a structured analytical framework which includes the extraction of the keywords based on an initial limited bibliographic search, the extensive literature search and finally the identification of relevant articles based on the reference list of the studies. The leading mechanisms identified were classified according to their scale, spanning from mechanisms in the cell, tissue or organ level, and the produced outputs. The computational modeling approaches for each of the factors that influence the initiation and the perpetuation of AF are presented here to provide a clear overview of the existing literature.

ACT focuses on studying Coordinated Care (CC) and TeleHealth (TH) services for chronically ill patients, such as heart failure, COPD, diabetes, as well as co-morbid patients. The potential of these services to improve quality of care within European healthcare systems can be fully released only when certain barriers are overcome and organizational changes progress. Therefore, the purpose of ACT, as described in this work, is to study in a qualitative and quantitative manner, with a solid and reproducible research methodology, the organizational and structural procedures supporting effective implementation of CC&TH services in the routine management of chronic patients. The consortium will investigate key organizational and structural drivers in 5 European \u2026",

Applications are progressively required to run on multiple computing platforms and accommodate the capabilities of different devices. Users and context are significantly characterized by diversity, leading to a very broad range of accessibility and interaction requirements and preferences that need to be adequately addressed. The current approach of designing separate user interfaces, one for each target use, is time consuming, error prone, and does not adequately addresses the challenges of cross-platform consistency, universal access and integration. To this end, this paper proposes a new integrative approach to multi-device user interface development for achieving device-independence by-design and further pursuing improved levels user experience for all through adaptive presentational models for various \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Even though temperature is a continuous quantitative variable, its measurement has been considered a snapshot of a process, indicating whether a patient is febrile or afebrile. Recently, other diagnostic techniques have been proposed for the association between different properties of the temperature curve with severity of illness in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), based on complexity analysis of continuously monitored body temperature. In this study, we tried to assess temperature complexity in patients with systemic inflammation during a suspected ICU-acquired infection, by using wavelets transformation and multiscale entropy of temperature signals, in a cohort of mixed critically ill patients. Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study. In five, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS, group 1) developed, 10 had sepsis (group 2), and seven had septic shock (group 3). All temperature curves were studied during the first 24 hours of an inflammatory state. A wavelet transformation was applied, decomposing the signal in different frequency components (scales) that have been found to reflect neurogenic and metabolic inputs on temperature oscillations. Wavelet energy and entropy per different scales associated with complexity in specific frequency bands and multiscale entropy of the whole signal were calculated. Moreover, a clustering technique and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied for permitting pattern recognition in data sets and assessing diagnostic accuracy of different wavelet features among the three classes of patients. Statistically significant differences were found in wavelet entropy between patients with SIRS \u2026",

In this paper we propose an approach towards the seamless integration of and access to disparate and heterogeneous sources of medical information, through a semantically enhanced platform called SCP-ECG Integrated Access (SEIA).

It is crucial to develop a strategy that supports the engagement of healthcare professionals to promote the sustainable adoption of telehealth services further. The aim of the study was to show how variables related to the perception of telehealth services for COPD by different healthcare professionals interact to influence its adoption and to generate advice for future telehealth service implementation.   Methods Data was thematically synthesized from published qualitative studies to create causal loop diagrams, further validated by expert interviews. These diagrams visualize dependencies and their polarity between different variables.   Results Adoption of telehealth services from the nurse\u2019s perspective is directly affected by change management and autonomous decision making. From the physician\u2019s perspective, perceived value is the most important variable. Physical activity management and positive user experience are considered affecting perceived value for physiotherapists. There is no consensus where self-management services should be positioned in the COPD care pathway.   Conclusion Our results indicate how complex interactions between multiple variables influence the adoption of telehealth services. Consequently, there is a need for multidimensional interventions to achieve adoption. Moreover, key variables were identified that require attention to ensure success of telehealth services. Furthermore, it is necessary to explore where self \u2026",

In the era of high-throughput sequencing (HTS), the abundance of immunogenetic data has revealed unprecedented opportunities for the thorough profiling of T-cell receptors (TR) and B-cell receptors (BcR). However, the volume of the data to be analyzed mandates for efficient and ease-to-use immune repertoire profiling software applications. This work introduces Immune Repertoire Profiler (IRProfiler), a novel software pipeline that delivers a number of core receptor repertoire quantification and comparison functionalities on high-throughput TR and BcR sequencing data. Adopting 5 alternative clonotype definitions, IRProfiler implements a series of algorithms for 1) data filtering, 2) calculation of clonotype diversity and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Many experimental and clinical studies have confirmed a continuous cross-talk between both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of autonomic nervous system and inflammatory response, in different clinical scenarios. In cardiovascular diseases, inflammation has been proven to play a pivotal role in disease progression, pathogenesis and resolution. A few clinical studies have assessed the possible inter-relation between neuro-autonomic output, estimated with heart rate variability analysis, which is the variability of R-R in the electrocardiogram, and different inflammatory biomarkers, in patients suffering from stable or unstable coronary artery disease and heart failure. Moreover, different indices derived from heart rate signals\u2019 processing, have been proven to correlate strongly with severity of heart disease and predict final outcome. In this review article we will summarize major findings from different investigators, evaluating neuro-immunological interactions through heart rate variability analysis, in different groups of cardiovascular patients. We suggest that markers originating from variability analysis of heart rate signals seem to be related to inflammatory biomarkers. However, a lot of open questions remain to be addressed, regarding the existence of a true association between heart rate variability and autonomic nervous system output or its adoption for risk stratification and therapeutic monitoring at the bedside. Finally, potential therapeutic implications will be discussed, leading to autonomic balance restoration in relation with inflammatory control.",

The relevance of each sleep feature to the EEG FD is investigated, and the most informative ones are depicted. In order to quantitatively assess the relation between sleep characteristics and EEG dynamics, a modeling approach is proposed which employs subsets of the sleep macrostructure and microstructure features as input variables and predicts EEG FD based on these features of sleep micro/macrostructure.

Association is the discovery of association relationships or correlations among a set of items. The algorithm that was implemented is a basic algorithm for mining association rules, known as a priori. In Healthcare, association rules are considered to be quite useful as they offer the possibility to conduct intelligent diagnosis and extract invaluable information and build important knowledge bases quickly and automatically. The problem of identifying new, unexpected and interesting patterns in medical databases in general, and diabetic data repositories in specific, is considered in this paper. We have applied the apriori algorithm to a database containing records of diabetic patients and attempted to extract association rules from the stored real parameters. The results indicate that the methodology followed may be of good value to the diagnostic procedure, especially when large data volumes are involved.

It aims at improving self-management and providing remote support for continuous disease management. However, it is often not clear how TH-supported services fit into existing pathways for COPD management. The objective of this study is to uncover where TH can successfully contribute to providing care for COPD patients exemplified in a Greek care pathway. The secondary objective is to identify what conditions need to be considered for successful implementation of TH services. Building on a single case study, we used a two-phase approach to identify areas in a Greek COPD care pathway where care services that are recommended in clinical guidelines are currently not implemented (challenges) and areas that are not explicitly recommended in the guidelines but that would benefit from TH services (opportunities). In phase I, we used the care delivery value chain framework to identify the divergence between the clinical guidelines and the actual practice captured by a survey with COPD healthcare professionals. In phase II, we conducted in-depth interviews with the same healthcare professionals based on the discovered divergences. The responses were analyzed with respect to identified opportunities for TH and care pathway challenges. Our results reveal insights in two areas. First, several areas with challenges were identified: patient education, self-management, medication adherence, physical activity, and comorbidity management.

            "Abstract": "Biomedical signal monitoring can counteract the risk of human operator error due to inattention or fatigue in safetycritical and restrictive environments, such as in aviation, space, automobile and heavy industrial machinery operation. Real-time biomedical data acquisition is changing through advances in microelectronics fabrication, bio-MEMS and power micro-generators. Such data acquisition and processing systems are becoming increasingly miniaturised, flexible and pervasive, while data is being collected from inside the human body as well as around it. In this paper we review two related research projects exploiting this technological convergence, discuss its implications and suggest future innovation prospects through further similar cross-disciplinary synergies.",

            "Abstract": "During pulmonary function testing (PFT), patients tend to tilt from upright to leaning forward position. The influence of torso movement on EIT chest examinations is unknown. We studied this effect in healthy subjects and patients with pulmonary diseases and found significant position-dependent changes in end-expiratory impedance that may impact EIT findings during PFT.",

Deconvolution procedures are applied, in the form of spatial filtering, in order to estimate transmembrane currents from the extracellular recordings. Simulated data are used in order to test the methods. The current source estimates are compared to the actual transmembrane currents and to Laplacian estimates.",

In this regard, the employed methodology involved first the systematic analysis and formalization of the knowledge sources elaborated in the scope of this work, through which an application-specific knowledge model has been defined. The entire framework architecture has been then specified and implemented by adopting Computer Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs) as the knowledge engineering formalism for its construction. The framework integrates diverse and dynamic knowledge sources in the form of rule-based ADE signals, all under a uniform Knowledge Base (KB) structure, according to the defined knowledge model. Equally important, it employs the means to contextualize the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Diabetes management by insulin administration is based on medical experts' experience, intuition, and expertise. As there is very little information in medical literature concerning practical aspects of this issue, medical experts adopt their own rules for insulin regimen specification and dose adjustment. This paper investigates the application of a neural network approach for the development of a prototype system for knowledge classification in this domain. The system will further facilitate decision making for diabetic patient management by insulin administration. In particular, a generating algorithm for learning arbitrary classification is employed. The factors participating in the decision making were among others diabetes type, patient age, current treatment, glucose profile, physical activity, food intake, and desirable blood glucose control. The resulting system was trained with 100 cases and tested on 100 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Health care delivery is changing drastically. In its current state it tends to use the home care model in order to increase quality of life, to rationalize costs and to achieve wellness. Pivotal to these purposes are contact centers, which act as mediators between the medical staff and the citizens seeking advice and/or therapy. Main platforms used for the development of such applications are the INTERNET and PCs, and the telecommunication networks, including mobile solutions. In this paper, a generic contact center model shall be presented, which is under development in the context of an IST European project in health telematics entitled \u2018Distance Information Technologies for Home care. The Citizen Health System (CHS)\u2019. After the description of this generic contact center, an application for health care delivery to diabetic patients shall be described. In this application we shall see the possible use of the Wireless \u2026",
