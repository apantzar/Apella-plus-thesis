The produced software tests emulate the functionality of a scan path design, and can be applied during the normal-operation mode of the microprocessor, thus enabling at-speed testing. A major advantage of the proposed approach lies in the fact that the generation of the software tests does not require any knowledge about the low-level implementation of the microprocessor and is only based on its RT-level description and its instruction set architecture.",

To increase the utilization of the dictionary entries some methods are based on the correction of some bits before the loading of the entries into the scan chains. The coordinates of the bits that should be corrected are sent by the automatic test equipment (ATE), hence, the number of corrections should be relatively small. In this paper we propose a new method which is based on the use of an auxiliary dictionary of minor size for storing masks. To this end, we give an algorithm for the suitable selection of the masks so that any one of them is used for on the fly bit-flipping of parts of many dictionary entries, before they are loaded into the scan chains. The efficiency of the proposed method is supported with extensive experimental results.",

In this paper, we propose a slightly modified structure and a heuristic for speeding up significantly the searching of a suitable CAV. We also show, experimentally, that the proposed structure, in most cases, compares favorably to LFSRs and the other arithmetic function based bit-serial sequence generators.",

However, no performance or area penalty is imposed on the CUT since, instead of additional inverters, the negated outputs of the scan flip-flops can be utilized. The proposed algorithm targets the maximization of run-lengths of zeros (or ones) in the test set accompanying the CUT. This algorithm combined with the Minimum Transition Count mapping of don't cares in a test set as well as with the alternating run-length code that have been recently proposed, achieves better test-data compression and reduced scan-power results than the relative works in the literature.",

As technology scales, due to manufacturing defects and process variations a large number of cells in a cache is expected to be faulty. The number of faulty cells varies from die to die and in the field of the application depends on the operating conditions (eg, supply voltage, frequency). Several techniques have been proposed to tolerate faults in caches. A drawback of the redundancy based techniques is that the amount of redundancy is decided at the design time targeting a maximum number of faults, so in cases of a small number of faults (eg, in the nominal supply voltage in a system with DVS) only a part of the redundant resources is used. In this paper we propose a new reconfigurable-self adaptive fault tolerant cache scheme. The unique characteristic of our scheme is that it uses its resources for both the reduction of the \u2026",

The proposed method encodes the test data provided by the core vendor using a new, very effective compression scheme based on multilevel Huffman coding. Specifically, three different kinds of information are compressed using the same Huffman code, and thus significant test data reductions are achieved. A simple architecture is proposed for decoding on-chip the compressed data. Its hardware overhead is very low and comparable to that of the most efficient methods in the literature. Additionally, the proposed technique offers increased probability of detection of unmodeled faults since the majority of the unknown values of the test set are replaced by pseudorandom data generated by an LFSR.",

Unfortunately, voltage scaling increases the impact of process variations on memory cells resulting in an exponential increase in the number of malfunctioning memory cells.

In this work, we propose a new CFT technique which applies a systematic redistribution (permutation) of the cache blocks (assuming various block granularity levels) within the cache structure using the orthogonal Latin Square concept and taking as input the location of the malfunctioning cells in the cache array. The aim of the redistribution is twofold. First, to uniformly distribute the faulty blocks to sets and second, to gather the faulty subblocks to a minimum number of blocks, so as the fault free blocks are maximized.

An inherent problem of Domino logic is that under specific input conditions the charge redistribution between parasitic capacitances at internal nodes of a circuit can violate the noise margins and cause erroneous responses at the output. The dominant solution to this problem is the multiple precharging of the gate's internal nodes. However, the added precharge transistors are not testable for stuck-open faults. Undetectable stuck-open faults at these transistors may cause noise margins reduction and consequently may affect the reliability of the circuit since its operation in the field will be sensitive to environmental factors such as noise.

The proposed algorithm uses the well-known concept of solving systems of linear equations and, based on heuristics, minimizes the number of seeds and test vectors while achieving 100% fault coverage. Experimental results indicate that it compares favorably to the other known techniques.",

            "Abstract": "The main disadvantage of LFSR-based compression is that it should be usually combined with a constrained ATPG process, and, as a result, it cannot be effectively applied to IP cores of unknown structure. In this paper, a new LFSR-based compression approach that overcomes this problem is proposed. The proposed method allows each LFSR seed to encode as many slices as possible. For achieving this, a special purpose slice, called stop-slice, that indicates the end of a seed's usage is encoded as the last slice of each seed. Thus, the seeds include by construction the information of where they should stop and, for that reason, we call them self-stoppable. A stop-slice generation procedure is proposed that exploits the inherent test set characteristics and generates stop slices which impose minimum compression overhead. Moreover, the architecture for implementing the proposed technique requires negligible \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Operating below nominal voltage levels is a promising direction to enable ultra-low power CMOS-based sytems. This is true due to the cubic relation between the dynamic power consumption and the supply voltage. The main roadblock during aggressive voltage scaling is that the reliability of the circuits and especially of memory structures (SRAM cells) is exponentially decreased. The usage of well-known error correction codes (ECC) can only remedy a part of the problem. ECC have been proposed to protect the lower level caches (e.g., L2 or L3), but ECC cannot be employed in single-cycle first level caches due to their performance sensitivity to the additional latency of ECC. In this work, we propose a methodology to solve this problem by exploring the use of criticality metrics in aggressive superscalar processors. Instead of disabling the faulty frames of a faulty cache (as proposed in related work), we keep these frame \" alive \" (data are still placed and accessed in these faulty frames) and we use strong ECC to correct the hard multibit errors. The key idea is to direct to faulty cache frames data that can be delayed for one or more cycles without affecting program completion time i.e., instructions considered to not be on the critical path of the program execution. The basic mechanisms for hardening first level faulty caches with strong ECC protection without inflating program executing time are described in this position paper.",

For eliminating this problem, we present a new, low-overhead decompression scheme that can generate clusters of test bits in parallel. The test data are encoded using a recently proposed and very effective compression method called multilevel Huffman. Thus, apart from the significantly reduced test-application times, the proposed approach offers high compression ratios, as well as increased probability of detection of unmodeled faults, since the majority of the unspecified bits of the test sets are replaced by pseudorandom data. The time/space advantages of the proposed approach are validated by thorough experiments.",

            "Abstract": "Recent trends in IC technology have given rise to a new requirement, that of low power dissipation during testing, that Built-In Self-Test (BIST) structures must target along with the traditional requirements. To this end, by exploiting the inherent properties of Carry Save, Carry Propagate and modified Booth multipliers, in this paper we propose new power-efficient BIST structures for them. The proposed BIST schemes are derived by: (a) properly assigning the Test Pattern Generator (TPG) outputs to the multiplier inputs, (b) modifying the TPG circuits and (c) reducing the test set length. Our results indicate that the total power dissipated during testing can be reduced from 29.3% to 54.9%, while the average power per test vector applied can be reduced from 5.8% to 36.5% and the peak power dissipation can be reduced from 15.5% to 50.2% depending on the implementation of the basic cells and the size of the multiplier. The test application time is also significantly reduced, while the introduced BIST schemes implementation area is small.",

The proposed technique is generic and can be applied to test set embedding or mixed-mode schemes based on various TPG. The imposed hardware overhead is very small since it is confined to just one extra bit per seed plus one very small counter in the scheme's control logic, while the test-sequence-length reductions achieved are up to 44.71%. Along with the test-sequence-reduction technique, an efficient seed-selection algorithm for the test-per-clock, LFSR-based, test set embedding case is presented. The proposed algorithm targets the minimization of the selected seed volumes and, combined with the test-sequence-reduction technique, delivers results with fewer seeds and much smaller test sequences than the already proposed approaches.",

The finding of the locations of all patterns of a given test set T in the sequence generated under a constant C is done in O(n+ | T |) steps instead of O(n middot |T|) steps of a previous approach. Next we present a method which, given a test set T, and an odd constant C, finds the seed in the sequence generated under C that can reproduce all patterns of T in minimum length.

Those trends necessitate i) to study fault-tolerant (FT) cache mechanisms in a wide spectrum of fault-probabilities and ii) to devise appropriate FT techniques that must be able to adapt their FT capacity to the volume of defective locations of the target faulty caches. It is well known that keeping the cache capacity, block size and the volume of defective cells constant, the average number of misses, due to faulty cells, decreases as the associativity of the cache increases.

On-line testing will play an important role towards this direction. In this paper we propose a hierarchical architecture for concurrent soft error detection. This architecture is based on current sensing techniques and provides very low area overhead, small detection times and negligible performance penalty on the functional circuit under check.",

            "Abstract": "Modulo 2/sup n/+1 adders find great applicability in several applications including RNS implementations and cryptography. In this paper, we present two novel architectures for designing modulo 2/sup n/+1 adders, based on parallel-prefix carry computation units, the first architecture utilizes a fast carry increment stage, whereas the second is a totally parallel-prefix solution. CMOS implementations reveal the superiority of the resulting adders against previously reported solutions in terms of implementation area and execution latency.",

Moreover, a technique for reducing the length of the generated test sequences is introduced. This technique achieves significant savings with minor overhead (one extra bit per seed plus a small counter in the scheme\u2019s control logic). Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm and the test sequence reduction technique.",

            "Abstract": "Various compression methods have been proposed for tackling the problem of increasing test-data volume of contemporary, core-based systems. Despite their effectiveness, most of the approaches that are based on classical codes (e.g., run-lengths, Huffman) cannot exploit the test-application-time advantage of multiple-scan-chain cores, since they are not able to perform parallel decompression of the encoded data. In this paper, we take advantage of the inherent parallelism of Huffman decoding and we present a generalized multilevel Huffman-based compression approach that is suitable for cores with multiple scan chains. The size of the encoded data blocks is independent of the slice size (i.e., the number of scan chains), and thus it can be adjusted so as to maximize the compression ratio. At the same time, the parallel data-block decoding ensures the exploitation of most of the scan chains' parallelism. The \u2026",

In this work, we propose a methodology to mitigate the impact of defective bits (due to permanent faults) in first-level set-associative data caches. Our technique assumes that faulty caches are enhanced with the ability of disabling their defective parts at cache subblock granularity. Our experimental findings reveal that while the occurrence of hard-errors in faulty caches may have a significant impact in performance, a lot of room for improvement exists, if someone is able to take into account the spatial reuse patterns of the to-be-referenced blocks (not all the data fetched into the cache is accessed). To this end, we propose frugal PC-indexed spatial predictors (with very small storage requirements) to orchestrate the (re)placement decisions among the fully and partially unusable faulty blocks.

The only way to reduce the effect of cache access time on processor cycle time is the use of pipelined caches. A timing model for on-chip caches has recently been presented in [1]. In this paper the timing model given in [1] is extended so as pipelined caches can be handled. Also the possible pipelined architectures of a cache memory are investigated. The speedup of the pipelined cache against the non-pipelined one is examined as a function of the pipeline depth, the organization and the physical implementation parameters.",
