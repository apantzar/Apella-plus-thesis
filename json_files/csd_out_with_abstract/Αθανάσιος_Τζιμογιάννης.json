            "Abstract": "Developing students\u2019 algorithmic and computational thinking is currently a major objective for primary and secondary education in many countries around the globe. Literature suggests that students face at various difficulties in programming processes, because of their mental models about basic programming constructs. Arrays constitute the first data structure students have to cope with in introductory programming courses. This paper presents the results of an empirical study on secondary education students\u2019 misconceptions and mental representations of the array data structure. Students\u2019 responses to written tasks regarding short code segments were mapped to the different levels of the SOLO taxonomy, in order to identify how students use arrays to solve programming problems. The analysis of the results showed that the majority of the students tended to manifest responses assigned to the lower SOLO levels, ie prestructural, unistructural and multistructural. The findings indicate that many students in the sample had incomplete or faulty representations of the array concept, which seem to be connected to their misconceptions about the programming variable concept.",

A total of 1165 primary and secondary education teachers participated in the study, immediately after following a training programme on basic ICT skills. The authors\u2019 results showed that the majority of the teachers in the sample have positive attitudes towards the training programme they attended, the general role that ICT can play in education and the integration of ICT in the educational process. The authors\u2019 findings also revealed some parameters that interfere negatively, thus making many teachers cautious of or sceptical about ICT integration in educational practice. Multivariate analysis identified three groups of teachers that exhibited a consistent approach: a group of teachers having positive attitudes towards the items of the research, a second group \u2026",

We describe the development, in conjunction with European partner institutions, of a new game, entitled RU EU?, intended to raise student awareness of European issues, notably the question of European identity; this seems to be both important and topical at the time of Brexit. We describe the development and the nature of the game and its launch, and the feedback which we have received from students who have played it, and suggest that, while it is not necessarily a substitute for traditional lecture-style teaching, games such as this can provide an additional tool in the geography lecturer\u2019s armoury.",

Web 2.0, on the other hand, has received in the last decade intense and growing educational and research interest. The key idea, upon which the educational Web 2.0 is built, is the wide range of affordances incorporated that transform both Pedagogy (Pedagogy 2.0, ie, selfdirected, reflective and community learning) and Content (Content 2.0, ie, shared and learner-generated content). This chapter presents TPACK 2.0, as a promising framework a) to guide learning design and teacher preparation programs and b) to promote Web 2.0 integration in curriculum and classroom settings by harnessing their learner-centered, participative and social networking characteristics.",

The PBP-VC project team have been working with stakeholders from a number of large virtual campus projects across Europe in identifying and exploring key issues relating to best practice. The importance of developing a practical framework for identifying, evaluating and promoting best practice in virtual campuses and e-learning can be demonstrated by the significant number of high profile e-learning and virtual campus failures both within Europe and globally, In many cases their failure has been quite spectacular with millions pound being wasted as a result some quite basic errors in overlooking key best practice issues that have occurred across several large-scale projects.

It was felt that many VCs suffered from a low profile resulting in little support at senior levels, thus hampering their development, as well as having very little contact and interoperability with each other. If eLearning and VC initiatives are to be sustainable within the European Union, then it is vital that stakeholders understand how new models of teaching and learning transform the institution and how they can be used to enhance the flexibility and inclusiveness of the European education system. This paper reports on the work of a European Commission DG Education and Culture co-financed project PBP-VC Promoting Best Practice in Virtual Campuses which is aimed at providing a deeper understanding of the key issues and critical success factors underlying the implementation of VCs. The paper will outline a tentative model of issues underpinning best practice in VCs derived from an initial literature based investigation of existing VC initiatives within Europe. In addition, the project is working towards developing a practical framework to help guide the process of creating best practice in VCs, as well as raising awareness of issues and approaches to creating sustainable VCs.",

By adopting the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework, we developed an extended TPACK scale, including two sub-constructs, i.e., a) the Educational Context and b) teachers\u2019 self-assessment of TPACK abilities. The analysis of the results showed that the participants appear to believe that they have a good level of knowledge with regards to the primary TPACK domains, i.e., content, pedagogy and technology. However, most teachers perceived them separately and were not able to integrate their TPACK knowledge in order to design and implement meaningful ICT-based interventions in their classroom practice.

            "Abstract": "The diversity of the EU is both a strength and a weakness, with Issues of National and European identity contributing to division, marginalization and exclusion. Many European citizens have very firmly entrenched, but frequently simplistic, views about the value of the European Union as good (pro EU) or bad (anti EU). To promote a culture of increased tolerance and inclusion, EU citizens need to develop a more mature and nuanced understanding of National and European identity that considers the validity of others\u2019 points of view. Serious Games are increasingly recognised as active and effective methods for tackling complex social problems. Therefore, the RU EU?(are you EU?) project developed a game to increase players\u2019 awareness of the complexity of European identity and values, to help players develop a more detailed understanding of European identity and promote critical thinking about their own views, the views of others, and the wider societal consequences. In this paper we describe the RU EU? Game as a case study explaining the thinking behind the game design. We outline the early design tasks that led to development of the multicomponent model of European identity that we used in the game, the adoption of the journalist narrative and the tools that assisted the player in his goal of compiling and publishing a set of articles about European identity. We discuss the potential of the game tools and mechanics to be used more widely to promote social understanding and inclusion.",

Increasingly, a wide range of services, administration, businesses and citizenship processes are transferred online. In addition, ICT are perceived to be inherent to the reform efforts necessary for the 21st century society.Academics, researchers, educators, experts and policy officers, at international level, have acknowledged digital skills as one of the key competences for work force, lifelong development and active participation in social and economical life. The main argument is that people who can understand and effectively use digital means and facilities are significantly empowered and advantaged in terms of educational opportunities and success, professional development, employment prospects, civic participation and many other aspects of their personal and social life (eg public and social services, cultural and everyday practices, online shopping, social networking etc.).",

The PBP-VC project team have been working with stakeholders from a number of large virtual campus projects across Europe in identifying and exploring key issues relating to best practice and sustainability. The importance of developing a practical framework for identifying, evaluating and promoting best practice in virtual campuses and e-learning can be demonstrated by the significant number of high profile e-learning and virtual campus failures both within Europe and globally. In many cases their failure has been quite spectacular with millions of dollars being wasted as a result some quite basic errors in overlooking key best practice issues that have occurred across several large-scale projects.

It was felt that many VCs suffered from a low profile resulting in little support at senior levels, thus hampering their development, as well as having very little contact and interoperability with each other. If eLearning and VC initiatives are to be sustainable within the European Union, then it is vital that stakeholders understand how new models of teaching and learning transform the institution and how they can be used to enhance the flexibility and inclusiveness of the European education system. This paper reports on the work of a European Commission DG Education and Culture co-financed project PBP-VC Promoting Best Practice in Virtual Campuses which is aimed at providing a deeper understanding of the key issues and critical success factors underlying the implementation of VCs. The paper will outline a tentative model of issues underpinning best practice in VCs derived from an initial literature based investigation of existing VC initiatives within Europe. In addition, the project is working towards developing a practical framework to help guide the process of creating best practice in VCs, as well as raising awareness of issues and approaches to creating sustainable VCs.",

The Erasmus+ funded RU EU? project aims to develop an innovative online game, the RU EU? game, that will help students across Europe to develop a better understanding of their own National and European identity and values, as well as those of others, and to challenge them about their attitudes and prejudices by tackling problem solving dilemmas relating to identity. It is hoped that the game will provide an engaging platform for young Europeans to confront some of the complex and confusing issues surrounding National and European identity at a time of change and increasing tension across Europe.

Web 2.0, on the other hand, has received in the last decade intense and growing educational and research interest. The key idea, upon which the educational Web 2.0 is built, is the wide range of affordances incorporated that transform both Pedagogy (Pedagogy 2.0, eg selfdirected, reflective and community learning) and Content (Content 2.0, eg shared and learner-generated content).

Hailed as an open collaborative learning space, many questions remain unanswered regarding the appropriate teacher preparation and the pedagogical impact of using Web 2.0 tools in the classroom practice. Do teachers feel comfortable and ready to adopt educational Web 2.0? What are their beliefs and perceptions regarding the educational potential of Web 2.0? What are the educational and contextual issues that determine teachers' challenges and decisions to use Web 2.0 in their classroom practice? This article addresses these questions by presenting the design and the implementation of a development program aiming to prepare teachers to make meaningful and purposeful use of Web 2.0 tools in their classroom. The model of technological pedagogical content knowledge and the authentic learning approach were the guiding principles that largely influenced the Web 2.0 pedagogical framework, which was designed and applied in this particular teacher preparation program. The aim of the program was the preparation of the participating teachers, coming from the area near the city of Korinthos, Greece for purposeful applying Web 2.0 tools in their instruction. The course sessions and the related instructional activities were implemented between February and April 2011. In total, 86 primary and secondary teachers participated in the pilot courses.

The principles that determined the particular MOOC design framework were directed by three dimensions of teacher participation: a) engagement b) peer interaction and mutual support and c) collaborative creation of educational artefacts. A total of 566 language teachers from secondary education schools were enrolled in this MOOC, which achieved a completion rate of 57.6%. We used a mixed method that combines the analysis of teachers\u2019 engagement through platform records and their responses to a specific questionnaire. The results provided supportive evidence that the design framework was effective towards promoting teachers\u2019 active engagement, peer interaction and support, and development of learning design abilities to integrate collaborative writing with Google Docs in their classroom. In addition, the analysis showed that the majority of participants conceptualized this MOOC as an efficient environment for their professional development.",

Research data already published offer significant knowledge regarding university students\u2019 deficiencies in computer programming and the alternative representations they built about abstract programming constructs. However, secondary education students\u2019 learning and development in computer programming has not been extensively studied. This paper reports on the use of the SOLO taxonomy to explore secondary education students\u2019 representations of the concept of programming variable and the assignment statement. Data was collected in the form of students\u2019 written responses to programming tasks related to short code programs. The responses were mapped to the different levels of the SOLO taxonomy. The results showed that approximately more than one half of the students in the sample tended to manifest prestructural, unistructural and multistructural responses to the research tasks. In addition, the findings provide evidence that students\u2019 thinking and application patterns are prevalently based on mathematical-like mental models about the concepts of programming variable and the assignment statement. The paper concludes with suggestions for instructional design and practice to help students\u2019 building coherent and viable mental models of the programming variable and the assignment statement.",

We have recorded differences in teachers\u2019 beliefs according to their attributes such as gender, specialty, teaching experience, computer experience, training on ICT, and computer ownership. Our findings have also revealed some parameters, which interfere making thus many teachers cautious or fearful about ICT integration in the educational practice.

In exploring the above, this investigation uses a case-study approach within a qualitative paradigm and draws upon a heuristic that brings together a set of ideas on adult program development to guide research techniques and analysis procedures. The latter focuses on five key elements of program development for adults: needs identification, planning, design, climate, and evaluation. The findings identify the importance placed by the participants on digital literacy and indicate some tentative points and practices that, when suitably adapted, could pave the way for effective preparation and delivery of digital literacy courses for adults.",

The study was administered in the context of an authentic coursework project, in a second semester university course attended by 48 students. The analysis was based on the models of Community of Inquiry and Social Network Analysis and shed light into the different patterns of participation students showed and the evolution of their learning presence within the community of blogs. Preliminary research findings, both quantitative and qualitative, indicated that the majority of the students in the sample were generally active and exhibited learning presence actions within their group blog. Differences between students in the various groups were also recorded. The results suggested that properly designed blog activities can help students to achieve higher cognitive levels through enhancing their communication and collaboration skills, and their critical thinking.",

On the basis of reported literature, in particular, deficiencies identified in Bell\u2019s (1991) traditional \u201cindividual\u201d,\u201cgroup,\u201d and \u201cschool development\u201d approaches, the authors propose an alternative model for TPD delivered through VCs. In support of this \u201cnew\u201d model, key issues underlying the VC paradigm in terms of the design and implementation of such environments are further discussed. In particular, the authors argue about the value and complications behind the adoption of this model and suggest principles supporting the design of such type of environments.",

The survey was administered in Greece to a total of 1165 primary and secondary education teachers, just after they had completed a training programme on basic ICT skills. The majority of the teachers in the sample stated positively towards the role that ICT could play in education. However, only a small percentage of them have adopted and use ICT in their instruction job. Our findings have also revealed some interfering factors, which make many teachers cautious or skeptical about ICT integration in the educational practice. We have also recorded differences in teachers\u2019 beliefs and perceptions according to their gender and subject specialty. Finally, we conclude with some implications, which could be helpful to the educational policy authorities in their attempt to implement new initiatives aiming at teachers\u2019 preparation to effectively integrate ICT in their everyday classroom practice.",

            "Abstract": "Educational research has shown that high school and university students also follow the Aristotelian idea about motion; for example, a continuous action of a force is necessary to keep an object in motion. The survey presented in this article aims at a deeper investigation of secondary education students' ideas about the forces involved in objects moving under the sole influence of gravity. The main objectives are: (1) to investigate other ideas or difficulties, which intervene and determine students' mental models about motion and force, and (2) to reveal how the students in the sample are grouped according to their alternative conceptions. Our study has been mainly determined by the revision in Science Curriculum established in Greece three years ago. A survey has been administered to a total of 146 students (15\u201316 years old) attending six typical public high schools in Greece. The results presented show \u2026",

It is widely considered that Web 2.0 applications, while not designed specifically for educational purposes, have a number of affordances that provide multiple opportunities for shared content and resources, self-directed learning, collaborative learning, ubiquitous and lifelong learning. The emerged socially based technologies of the Web 2.0 have the potential to offer enhanced learning opportunities and support students' participation in effective task-oriented personal learning spaces independent of physical, geographic, and institutional boundaries (Hall 2009; McLoughlin and Lee 2010).Among Web 2.0 tools, blogs constitute a new content \u2026",

Computer simulations are applications of special interest in physics teaching because they can support powerful modeling environments involving physics concepts and processes. In this study two groups (control and experimental) of 15\u201316 years old students were studied to determine the role of computer simulations in the development of functional understanding of the concepts of velocity and acceleration in projectile motions. Both groups received traditional classroom instruction on these topics; the experimental group used computer simulations also. The results presented here show that students working with simulations exhibited significantly higher scores in the research tasks. Our findings strongly support that computer \u2026",
