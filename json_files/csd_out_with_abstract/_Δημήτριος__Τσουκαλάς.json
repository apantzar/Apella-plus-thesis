            "Abstract": "Multilevel capability is greatly desired in order to attain high effective memory density. Here, we demonstrate that 3-b per memory cell storage capacity can take place by incorporating small (~3 nm diameter) Pt nanocrystals (NCs) within 45-nm TiO 2-x -based resistive random access memory. Seven low-resistance states as well one high-resistance state were achieved by setting proper compliance current (I cc ) limit between 2 and 200 \u03bcA. In striking contrast, the reference sample without NCs exhibited 2-b multilevel switching at higher operating voltages. The enhanced performance of the Pt NCs embedded sample is ascribed to the preferable creation of small conducting filaments around the NCs with high density of oxygen vacancies, due to the concentrated electric field effect, which improves the uniformity of the switching characteristics regardless of the random nature of switching effect.",

Taking into account that formation and annihilation of conducting filaments (CFs) is the driving mechanism for the switching effect, it is very important to control the regions where these filaments will evolve. Thus, homolayers of titanium oxide with different oxygen contents were fabricated in order to tune the local electrical and thermal properties of the CFs and narrow down the potential percolation paths. We show that the oxygen content in the top layer of the TiO2\u2212x/TiO2\u2212y bilayer memristors can directly influence the morphology of the layers which affect the diffusion barrier and consequently the diffusivity and drift velocity of oxygen vacancies, yielding in important enhancement of switching characteristics, in terms of spatial uniformity (\u03c3/\u03bc\u2009<\u20090.2), enlarged \u2026",

The existence of a critical thickness of the Al 2 O 3 protective film above which resistance and gauge factor variations are suppressed during humidity change was observed at different deposition temperatures.

These experiments are representative of any physical situation in which excess silicon atoms are introduced into silicon dioxide layers during silicon processing. The estimated diffusivity values are significantly higher than previously reported values for Si diffusion within a stoichiometric oxide and closer to reported values for excess Si diffusion within an oxide.

With this material configuration, we derive a stable memory window (~102), good cycling variability (\u03c3/\u03bc < 0.6) and robust pulse endurance (106). The switching phenomenon is confined in the TaOy layer because of its higher oxygen content and deeper oxygen vacancy levels in contrast to the surrounding HfOx layers that act as series resistances. This enables the manifestation of analog switching characteristics, sub-pJ energy consumption for both SET and RESET transitions, enhanced synaptic weight modulation, Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity and short-term plasticity effects of our devices that play an important role in emulating the function of a biological synapse.",

            "Abstract": "Recently, the research for new non-volatile memory in the semiconductor industry has become intense, because current flash memory technologies based on the floating-gate (FG) concept are expected to be difficult to scale down for high density, high performance devices (Lankhorst et al., 2005; Ouyang et al., 2004; Vanheusden et al., 1997). Therefore, a type of non-volatile memory using nanoparticles (NP) as floating gates has attracted much research attention because of its excellent memory performance and high scalability (Tiwari et al., 1996; Park et al., 2002). By utilizing discrete NP as the charge storage element, NP memory is more immune to local oxide defects than flash memory, thus exhibiting longer retention time and allowing more aggressive tunnel oxide scaling than conventional flash memory (Blauwe, 2002; Hanafi et al., 1996). In NP memory, the device performance and reliability depend on many factors, such as the ability to control NP size, size distribution, crystallinity, area density, oxide passivation quality, and the isolation that prevents lateral charge conduction in the NP layer (Ostraat et al., 2001). Thus, NP memory has driven extensive efforts to form NP acting as charging and discharging islands by various methods. Up to now, several techniques have been developed to form uniform NP in gate oxides. For example, Kim (Kim et al., 1999) employed low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) to fabricate Si NP with a 4.5 nm average size and 5\u00d7 1011cm-2 average density. King (King et al., 1998) fabricated Ge NPs by oxidation of a SiGe layer formed by ion implantation, and demonstrated quasi-nonvolatile memory \u2026",

The negatively charged Nickel nanoparticles were fabricated by a DC magnetron sputtering system, and were deposited on a photoresist-patterned silicon substrate. Because of the different conductance between silicon and photoresist, the charges were accumulated on the photoresist as the nanoparticles were deposited, which caused a focusing electric field to drive the nanoparticles towards the silicon substrate. We have demonstrated that the self-focusing effect of the charged nanoparticles is responsible for increasing the density of nanoparticles in the lines patterned on silicon substrate by two orders of magnitude with respect to that on photoresist. The width of the silicon line and the width ratio between photoresist line and silicon line are the two most important parameters that will affect the self-focusing effect.",

The memory effect is tested using voltage pulses on the gate of the device and monitored through drain current measurements. The nanocrystals can be charged either from the channel through the thermal oxide layer by applying pulses smaller than 5 V or from the gate through the organic insulator for higher voltage depending on the pulse duration.",

Upon exposure to analytes, the polymer covering the thin silicon membrane swells, inducing a deflection on the membrane, which is measured as a capacitance change between membrane and substrate. Five different polymer layers [poly-hydroxy-ethyl-methacrylate (PHEMA), poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA), poly-vinyl-acetate (PVAc), epoxydized novolac (EPN) and poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)] were used. Exposure to water, methanol and ethanol vapors was used for evaluating performance. Sensitivities ranging from 4.5 fF/%RH for PDMS to 29 fF/%RH for PHEMA-covered devices are reported. Devices covered with PHEMA, PVAc and PMMA also exhibit strong response upon exposure to methanol and ethanol atmospheres.",

A vacuum technique is used for room temperature nanoparticle deposition that allows control of the electrical resistance of the film, exhibiting semiconducting-like behavior when nanoparticle arrays cover the surface below a threshold value while above it a metallic behavior is prevalent. The highest sensitivity is obtained for intermediate density values of the nanoparticle assemblies, which could be explained using a tunneling and hopping current expression. The device, which exhibits more than one order of magnitude higher strain sensitivity than continuous metallic films, is fabricated at room temperature through standard lithographic processing allowing for miniaturization and easy integration in silicon technology or flexible substrates.",

With this process, we have fabricated photoresist gratings with a period from 1 to 30 \u03bcm, using the fracture induced patterning technique. Then we have performed gold nanoparticle deposition on this patterned surface by a surface functionalization technique. For that purpose, silicon dioxide (SiO2) was deposited on the sample followed by a lift-off process. The remained SiO2 lines after the lift-off were functionalized with 2,3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) for the selective deposition of the gold colloid. After the deposition, the gold nanoparticles are well organized on top of the SiO2 line patterns.",

Along these lines, we report here the direct impact of oxygen concentration as well as of the homo-bilayer material configuration of SiO 2-conductive bridge memories to the manifestation of tunable threshold and bipolar switching effects. Interestingly, while the bilayer structure of Ag/SiO x/SiO y/TiN (x< y) exhibits only bipolar switching effect, the respective single-layer structures of Ag/SiO y/TiN and Ag/SiO x/TiN operate under either threshold switching or both modes.

The sensor utilizes hybridized DNA's charge transport properties, combining them with metallic nanoparticle networks that act as nano-gapped electrodes. The DNA hybridization events can be detected by a significant reduction in the sensor's resistance due to the conductive bridging offered by hybridized DNA. By modifying the nanoparticle surface coverage, which can be controlled experimentally being a function of deposition time, and the structural properties of the electrodes, an optimized biosensor for the in situ detection of DNA hybridization events is ultimately fabricated. The fabricated biosensor exhibits a wide response range, covering four orders of magnitude, a limit of detection of 1 nM and can detect a single base pair mismatch between probe and complementary DNA.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, the working performance of Platinum (Pt), solvent-free nanoparticle (NP)-based strain sensors made on a flexible substrate has been studied. First, a new model has been developed in order to explain sensor behaviour under strain in a more effective manner than what has been previously reported. The proposed model also highlights the difference between sensors based on solvent-free and solvent-based NPs. As a second step, the ability of atomic layer deposition (ALD) developed Al 2 O 3 (alumina) thin films to act as protective coatings against humidity while in adverse conditions (ie, variations in relative humidity and repeated mechanical stress) has been evaluated. Two different alumina thicknesses (5 and 11 nm) have been tested and their effect on protection against humidity is studied by monitoring sensor resistance. Even in the case of adverse working conditions and for increased mechanical strain (up to 1.2%), it is found that an alumina layer of 11 nm provides sufficient sensor protection, while the proposed model remains valid. This certifies the appropriateness of the proposed strain-sensing technology for demanding applications, such as e-skin and pressure or flow sensing, as well as the possibility of developing a comprehensive computational tool for NP-based devices.

The application of an external electric field during deposition enhances the mean size and oxygen content of the TiO NPs as well as the high-to-low resistance (HLR) ratio of the memristive films.

For the fulfillment of the strict requirements imposed by the ITRS roadmap for the 32 nm node we have implemented two emerging techniques: non-melt laser annealing and BF3 Plasma Doping implantation (PLAD). By using PLAD, we were able to create ultra shallow and abrupt as implanted profiles. On the other hand, by performing laser annealing on the samples in the sub-melt regime, we can achieve high levels of electrical activation, while practically eliminating Boron diffusion, due to its capability to deliver low thermal budget in the sub-microsecond time scale. An Excimer KrF laser (\u03bb = 248 nm and pulse duration 38 ns) has been used. The post annealing characterization of the samples included SIMS and Van Der Pauw Sheet resistance \u2026",

This plasma treatment leads to ultra-thin (2\u20135 nm) films that consist of a fluorocarbon top layer and a sub-oxide lower layer and are appropriate for anisotropic wet etching masks. The mask resistance to anisotropic wet-etchants is studied as a function of film preparation parameters. Defect evolution is examined for two key film preparation conditions. Masks explored compare favourably with common masking materials such as SiO2 or Si3N4 in terms of achievable patterns and processing options compatible with standard silicon integrated circuit technology. In addition, the new masking method can be applied when sidewall-only wet etching of mesa patterns is desired.",

Detection of humidity and ethanol in the range of 2000\u201320,000 ppm has been made possible in all the above cases. The sensor was fabricated following a two step process utilizing ink-jet printing to deliver both nanoparticles and PHEMA on oxidized silicon substrates: first a layer of nanoparticles has been delivered on top of gold interdigitated electrodes followed by the successive deposition of PHEMA polymer. By controlling several key design parameters such as nanoparticle size, number of ink-jet printed gold nanoparticles and electrode spacing, the fabrication of chemical sensors with different sensing response and linearity is possible.",

In this study, it is demonstrated that by inserting very small NCs (\u22483\u2009nm diameter) of either Pt or Ta, resistance changes over six orders of magnitude and capacitance changes over two orders of magnitude can be induced, with promising variability due to the local enhancement of the electric field effect, while these effects are attributed to the energy band diagram configuration induced by the presence of NCs. The gradual switching pattern observed exhibits also attractive synaptic properties, offering higher design flexibility for neuromorphic applications.",

In our simulations we considered the dopant pile-up near the surface and dopant loss owing to outdiffusion during the annealing.

The effects of charge neutralization of the implanted species, energy contamination and post-implantation cleaning process on the electrical and structural properties of the processed oxides are described, with emphasis upon the technological options to control them. While much research is still required for industrial exploitation of ULE-IBS in the fabrication of competitive and reproducible memory structures, promising results for prototype devices aiming at low-voltage non-volatile memory applications have been obtained and are here reported.",

The laser experimental work was combined with simulations of the annealing process, in terms of temperature distribution evolution, in order to predetermine the optimum annealing conditions.

However, due to the inherent random nature of oxygen vacancy creation, serious variability issues may arise. In this work, we demonstrate promising multilevel capability with ultra\u2010low power consumption in the range of nW, using sub\u2010200\u2009nA operating current in a 45\u2009nm TiO2\u2212x\u2010based resistive random access memory (RRAM) with embedded small (\u22485\u2009nm in diameter) Pt nanocrystals (NCs). As the resistance values present a strong dependence on both the oxygen vacancy density and the diameter of the conducting filament (CF), hence the degree of the variability (or uniformity) can be improved by controlling one of these two parameters. It is shown here that the presence of NCs allows for the generation of multiple and dense CFs due to the concentrated electric field around the NCs \u2026",

The array is comprised of four distinctive sensing devices based on nanoparticles, each functionalized with a different gas-absorbing polymeric layer. As discussed herein, the sensing array is able to identify as well as quantify three gas-analytes, two pesticide solutions, and relative humidity, which acts as a reference analyte. All of the evaluation experiments were conducted in close to real-life conditions; specifically, the sensors response towards the three analytes was tested in three relative humidity backgrounds while the effect of temperature was also considered. The unique response patterns generated after the exposure of the sensing-array to the two gas-analytes were analyzed using the common statistical analysis tool Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The sensing array, being compact, low-cost, and highly sensitive, can be easily integrated with pre-existing crop-monitoring solutions. Given that there are limited reports for effective pesticide gas-sensing solutions, the proposed gas-sensing technology would significantly upgrade the added-value of the integrated system, providing it with unique advantages.",

The increase of bandgap as the nc diameter decreases, the quantization of energy levels and of density of states outside of the bandgap and Coulomb blockade are the most important quantum mechanical phenomena that can be exploited for ncbased electronics.

Ag nanoparticles are deposited on p-doped Si substrates using a DC magnetron sputtering process.

The evolution of plasma-induced nanoparticle ripening is studied and a clear increase in particle size and a decrease in particle density are observed with increasing plasma treatment. From the experiments, it is concluded that the initial nanoparticle density and the plasma gas mixture (Ar/O 2 ratio) are important factors that affect the ripening process.

Thermal treatment in diluted oxygen increases the thickness of the control oxide, does not affect significantly the size of the nanocrystals, and improves the integrity of the oxide. As a result, strong charge storage effects at low gate voltages and enhanced charge retention times are observed through electrical measurements of MOS capacitors. These results indicate that a combination of low-energy silicon implants and annealing in diluted oxygen permits the fabrication of low-voltage nonvolatile memory devices.",

            "Abstract": "The high deposition temperature of the order of 400 oC and more is requirement for the growth of the thermochromic phase of vanadium dioxide (VO2), limits the type of substrates that one may grow them on only to rigid ones. In this work, thermochromic VO2 films were successfully deposited on flexible Corning\u00ae Willow\u00ae glass substrates, without the use of a buffer layer, by rf sputtering at a substrate temperature of 300 oC, one of the lowest for this technique ever reported. The critical transition temperature of 80 nm thin films was Tc= 50.7 oC, transmittance hysteresis width was \u0394T= 12.1 oC, while the modulation of the transmittance at \u03bb= 2000 nm measured at 25 oC and 90 oC was around 36%, leading to a solar modulation of \u0394Trsol= 5%. In addition, an increase in transmittance at \u03bb= 600nm (visible region) of 4% was observed before and after heating, while integrated luminous transmittance remained almost constant at Trlum= 34%. The thermochromic and luminous characteristics of the VO2 films deposited on flexible glass are comparable to those deposited on rigid glass substrates. The deposition of thermochromic VO2 film on flexible glass substrates by sputtering technique opens up a new window for thermochromic applications on flexible substrates.

Very good switching memory characteristics were demonstrated for an Au/Ti/TiO2 \u2212 x/Au/SiO2/Si structure with the insertion of a Ti nanolayer at the Au/TiO2 \u2212 x interface. Due to the superb ability of Ti to absorb oxygen atoms from the dielectric matrix, a large amount of oxygen vacancies is created, which are crucial for the stable function of the memory devices. As the Ti thickness increases, a thick interfacial layer is created, which degrades the resistive switching behavior. The induced interface thickness is found also to affect the fluctuation of the ON/OFF processes.

This allows for fabrication of devices with a relatively small thermal budget and superior performance in terms of memory windows and operating voltages. At voltages as low as 8\u2009V, the memory window of the devices is as large as 5\u2009V.

Hafnium nanoparticle thin films were formed through energetic nanoparticle deposition. This technique allows for the control of the energy of charged nanoparticles during vacuum deposition. The structural and nanomechanical properties of the nanoparticle thin films were investigated as a function of the kinetic energy of the nanoparticles. The results reveal that by proper adjustment of the nanoparticle energy, hexagonal close-packed porous nanoparticle thin films with good mechanical properties can be formed, without any additional treatment. It is shown that these films can be patterned on the substrate in sub-micrometer dimensions using conventional lithography while their porosity can be well controlled.

The HfO2 films have been sputtered on n or p\u2010type Si substrate from high purity HfO2 target at low deposition rate (0.1 \u00c5/s) monitored by a quartz crystal. After deposition of the insulator aluminum has been evaporated and patterned to form MIS capacitors.

Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis shows that after short annealing times FDLs are the more stable defects if the ripening process is conservative or if the surface acts as a sink for Si interstitial atoms. On the contrary, when the surface injects Si atoms (oxidising conditions) or for long annealing times under conservative conditions, PDLs are stabilised. We have calculated the formation energies of these defects as a function of their sizes and we have found that a stability inversion occurs for sizes of about 80 nm.

In this context, the authors have fabricated and investigated the switching mechanism of TiO2 based memristors with and without the incorporation of crystalline hafnium nanoparticles. The resistive switching of the devices needs no electroforming and is dictated by electrode/film interface modifications. The results indicate that the dominant conduction mechanism is Schottky emission while in the case of hafnium nanoparticles incorporation, a synthesis of which has not been reported before, conduction prevailing mechanism changes to Fowler\u2013Nordheim tunneling. Insight on device operation can be obtained by revealing the role of nanoparticles on loss of rectifying properties, through local modification of oxygen vacancy concentration.",

The interstitials captured by the loops are measured using transmission electron microscopy. The number of Si atoms released after oxynitridation was calculated from the difference between the total number of atoms stored in the loops for oxidizing and inert ambient. We found that this number is larger compared with the same dry oxygen oxidation conditions, although the oxidation rate is lower during oxynitridation in comparison to dry oxidation. Analysis of the earlier data leads to higher supersaturation ratio of interstitials in the former case.

Nitrogen was implanted in silicon wafers at low (3 keV), and medium (25, 80, and 150 keV) energies and oxidations were performed at various temperatures (800\u2013900 \u00b0C) and times. The experiment shows that the decrease in the oxide thickness is smaller when nitrogen is implanted closer to the silicon surface. We attribute this to nitrogen out-diffusion during the ramping and the initial oxidation steps, which is more effective when nitrogen is placed closer to the surface.

Samples were Al gated metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors with hafnium oxide films deposited on SiO2 layer thermally grown on Si. During capacitance\u2013voltage measurements large hysteresis, up to 10 V, are observed in all samples.

Understanding the origin of these dynamics is very important in order to control the degree of volatility and design novel electronic devices. Here, we present a synergistic numerical and experimental approach in order to deal with that issue. The distribution of relaxation time is addressed through time-resolved pulse measurements whereas the entire switching behavior is modeled through a 2D dynamical model by taking into account the destructive interference of the drift/diffusion transport mechanisms and the Soret diffusion \u2026",

The dependence of N2+ ion implant energy on the electrical quality of the growing oxide layers is studied through capacitance, equivalent parallel conductance, and gate current measurements. Superior electrical characteristics in terms of interface state trap density, leakage current, and breakdown fields are found for oxides obtained through 3 keV nitrogen implants. These findings together with the full absence of any extended defect in the silicon substrate make the low-energy nitrogen implantation technique an attractive option for reproducible low-cost growth of nanometer-thick gate oxides.",

The review is focused on the nanoparticle memory concept as an extension of the current flash memory device. Organic nanoparticle memories are at a very early stage of research and have not yet found applications. When this happens, it is expected that they will not directly compete with mature silicon technology but will find their own areas of application.",

This plasma treatment leads to silicon surface modifications appropriate for masking purposes during anisotropic etching in ethylenediamine-pyrocatechol-water (EPW) solutions. The resistance of the mask to EPW etching solutions is studied as a function of plasma radio frequency power and pressure, plasma duration, silicon surface preparation, and aging. Mask resistance increases with increasing power density and decreasing pressure. Plasma duration has a significant effect on the temporal and spatial pattern of defects that evolve during etching and lead eventually to mask destruction.\u00a9 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

Chemical vapor deposition of MoS2 is considered a relatively simple and user-friendly technique but there are several obstacles that may hinder the growth, and might result in rather small and non-uniformly distributed triangular flakes over the substrate surface. To tackle this issue, we developed an approach for large flakes (>300 \u03bcm) grown homogeneously over two substrates at once. This is based on spin-coating one of the two substrates with an aqueous solution of Mo-based salt particles, and covering it with the other. During the growth, the particles will act as nucleation sites for both substrates. Raman and atomic force microscopy measurements show that the grown flakes are monolayer.

Main objective of this paper is the demonstration of electrically active n+-p junctions in germanium by implanting phosphorus in p-type substrate while trying to maintain minimal dopant diffusion, which is a critical issue for scaling germanium devices. In addition to the phosphorus diffusion studies, we also explore the presence of nitrogen introduced in the substrate together with phosphorus and we conclude that it can further reduce dopant movement at the expense of lower activation level. The observation is confirmed by both electrical and SIMS measurements.

In addition, under pulse experiments, fast switching time of 1 \u03bcs, good 107 cycling endurance and retention performance at 150 \u00b0C, was demonstrated. The confinement of the switching effect into the HfO 2-y  film, which has the highest oxygen content and deeper oxygen vacancy energy levels compared with the adjusting two layers of TiO 2-x  which act as two series resistances, can explain the low switching energy. The gradual modulation of the resistance permits also the manifestation of longterm potentiation synaptic plasticity, induced by the application of a train of pulses with different repetition intervals.

Compared to disk devices, semiconductor memories exhibit superior characteristics in terms of cost and performance [1]. Furthermore, due to the advantages of MOS technology in device manufacturability and miniaturization, most ultralarge-scale integration (ULSI\u2265 107 transistors on a chip) memory circuits are made at the present time using MOS memories. The most important device for MOS memory technology today is the metal\u2013oxide semiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistor (FET)[2, 3]. A simplified cross section of an n-channel MOS transistor is shown in Figure 1. It consists of a p (\u201cpositive\u201d)-type silicon substrate with a surplus of holes \u2026",

The electrical characteristics of the oxide layers annealed at different temperatures are studied through high-frequency capacitance-voltage measurements of metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors before and after the application of constant voltage stress. Measurements indicate that Ge-implanted-SiO2 undergoes a major structural change after annealing at temperatures > 910\u00b0C. The latter change is identified as a relocation of Ge towards the upper portion of the oxide with a significant fraction of them leaving the oxide.",

The results showed that the average size of the nanoparticles decreased continuously for annealing time up to 6mins followed by a more tight size distribution. After further annealing the average size increased again approaching the average size of the nanoparticles in the non-annealed sample. The samples prepared were tested as substrates for SERS of R6G molecules adsorbed on the Ag nanoparticles.

The distance between the lines ranges between 0.2 \u03bdm to 5 \u03bcm. It is shown that the kinetics of the DLs depends on the distance between them. When the distance is less than 1 \u03bcm, the DLs behave in a similar fashion like those grown in a continuous layer, under inert and oxidizing conditions. However, when the distance between the lines is increased (eg. 5 \u03bcm), the behavior of the loops is changed. Fast dissolution of the dislocations loops is observed during annealing in inert ambient, due to enhanced interstitial losses, while under oxidizing conditions the loops grow faster.",

It is shown that the formation of small CFs with high density of oxygen vacancies enhances the uniformity of the switching characteristics in spite of the random nature of the switching effect.
