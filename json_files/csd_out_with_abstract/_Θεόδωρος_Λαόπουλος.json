This method is based on measuring the instantaneous current drawn by the processor during the execution of the instructions. An appropriate instrumentation set up was established for this purpose. According to the proposed method the energy costs (base and inter-instruction costs) are modeled in relation to a reference instruction (e.g. NOP). These costs incorporate inter-cycle energy components, which cancel each other when they are summed to produce the energy consumption of a program resulting in estimates with high accuracy. This is confirmed by the results. Also the dependencies of the energy consumption on the instruction parameters (e.g. operands, addresses) are studied and modeled in an efficient way.",

The proposed approach associates the study of endianness representation with a regular challenge in 8-bit microcontroller education, that is, the assembly-level arithmetic techniques for numbers extending one-byte range. The educational objective intended to be reached in this communication is to provide to the students a better understanding of the processor's workings at the machine level, and help them in exploiting byte ordering towards to an optimum performance of a low-level system implementation.",

The objective of the tree transformation process, therefore, is to construct a minimum cost subband decomposition by maximizing the minimum masking threshold in wavelet domain in every subband.

A simple wireless ZIGBEE network consisting of three nodes (one sample from each of the typical node types) is measured with the proposed energy measuring configuration. The measurements are performed during the switch-on or switch-off operation of the nodes and the resulting waveforms provide useful information about the energy consumption of each node type, in each phase operation or \u201chandshaking\u201d.",

            "Abstract": "A comparison of three different methods for end-edge detection of the IPMC actuator as it moves is presented in this chapter, using image analysis captured by a CCD camera. The degrees of freedom for actuator move are specific and experiments were realized in underwater conditions when one end-edge is fixed-clapped and the other is free. The tracking techniques of free edge are based on three different approaches while the two recent of these use the new technology of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to reduce more the processing time. The results show that the new techniques increased by 47 and 70 times the speed of detection. Comparing the two last methods it can be concluded that they offer satisfactory reduced processing time for the speed of material which can be measured to values up to 10 KHz theoretically. The second improved method uses more calculations regarding position estimation and is slower if material bends out of the way track. The last approach is slower than second because is implemented in the entire area but handles better the bigger bending of the material within shorter execution times. A prerequisite for high speed measurements is the adequate support of the frame rate of camera.",

In the latter case, height is determined using the same pressure data obtained from the rover-in the system-altimeter. As regards differential barometric altimetry, the authors address a simple setup in order to explore sensors' output deviation under the same conditions (i.e., pressure, temperature, etc.), as well as evaluate the subsequent effect on height measurement error.

The control system is an model reference adaptive control (MRAC) based on a reference model and an adaptation that controls a 1 cm\u00d7 0.5 cm length IPMC strip based on a Nafion 117 Na+ membrane. As the reference model a second-order empirical model of the plant is used. The control system is first simulated and then experimentally implemented within the LabVIEW framework.",

The instantaneous current drawn by the processor is monitored at each clock cycle. A high performance instrumentation setup has been established for the accurate measurement of the processor current, which is based on a current sensing circuit, instead of the conventional solution of a series resistor.",

            "Abstract": "The implementation of a real-time measurement system based on visual measurements of displacement of an actuator\u2013cantilever is presented in this paper. This work is aimed at accelerating image processing for the fast tracking of small actuators based on ionic polymer\u2013metal composites using the graphics processing unit (GPU) approach. The proposed processing techniques for point tracking are based on the analysis of subsequent images of the moving item. The area-segmentation approach is used which combines region prediction, successive scanning, edge filtering and match processing. The overall implementation uses the CPU and GPU, while the results achieved indicate that the computation process speeds up by more than 40\u00d7. This is a quite useful improvement especially for real-time measurement and control applications of closed-loop systems based on IPMC materials.",
