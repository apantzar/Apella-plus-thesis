The area of this plane can be up to 15m2, further expandable if multiple transmitters are used. The position estimation method is based on comparing the number of infrared patterns received to the expected ones in a specific time interval (success rate). Using this method, no signal strength or time of flight has to be precisely measured, leading to an ultra low cost architecture. A proper topology of the infrared transmitters that optimally cover the desired area is discussed. The history of movements of the target is utilized in order to reject false estimations. The error achieved is below the half of the grid node distance. (5 pages)",

            "Abstract": "Typical memory addressing, where a row of cells that forms the memory word, is addressed every time the memory is accessed, has the disadvantage of decreased addressing flexibility, originating from the strict addressing method and leading to addressing limitations. In this work we present and implement the crossbar addressing scheme, where the memory is addressed in a two dimensional way, using two decoders on each direction. Although crossbar addressing is mentioned on references there is no known implementation on SRAM memories. We extend this scheme proposing the new Sector addressing scheme, based on crossbar addressing.",

Interaction with the user is made through a network interface. Since the end user is presented with a variety of unencrypted structural cores, each one describing an architecture with its own area, delay and power characteristics, he can choose the one that best fits his specific needs which he can further optimize or customize.

Based on a recently developed system architecture, which makes use of a noise-sensitive indoor localization system made up of ir sensors, the position estimation error is based on comparing the number of the digital ir patterns received at the moving target with the expected one. To overcome the problem of instant noise that appears despite the effective system shielding, we employ a number of rules that take into consideration the previous position estimations. These rules are based on the fact that the speed of the target is always limited and its track is smooth most of the time. The test for the rules was made by running a series of experiments on the sensors system, and as a result, we verified that the maximum absolute error in the experimental results \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Recent trends in IC technology have given rise to a new requirement, that of low power dissipation during testing, that Built-In Self-Test (BIST) structures must target along with the traditional requirements. To this end, by exploiting the inherent properties of Carry Save, Carry Propagate and modified Booth multipliers, in this paper we propose new power-efficient BIST structures for them. The proposed BIST schemes are derived by: (a) properly assigning the Test Pattern Generator (TPG) outputs to the multiplier inputs, (b) modifying the TPG circuits and (c) reducing the test set length. Our results indicate that the total power dissipated during testing can be reduced from 29.3% to 54.9%, while the average power per test vector applied can be reduced from 5.8% to 36.5% and the peak power dissipation can be reduced from 15.5% to 50.2% depending on the implementation of the basic cells and the size of the multiplier. The test application time is also significantly reduced, while the introduced BIST schemes implementation area is small.",

The block diagram of the single-paged conventional Static random-access memory (SRAM) model has been extended in order to support the enhancements of the Rapid Read-Write SRAM model. At the Read operation of the Rapid SRAM, the new Bit Line Pre-charger that the Rapid SRAM makes use of has already pre-charged the BL and BLB wirelines to a suitable voltage level for the memory, before the Write operation starts. The Rapid SRAM 6T transistor is in the data retain operation state when the word line signal is switched off.",

The proposed approach intends to cover a distance of several meters without requiring high accuracy measurements and sensors of increased precision. The digital infrared patterns that are transmitted from a constant position are recognized by a pair of sensors mounted on the moving target, with varying success rate depending on the distance and the angular displacement from the transmitter.
