These datasets are comprised of both continuous and categorical data (\u201cMixed Data\u201d), and essential variables may be unobserved in this data due to the complex nature of biomedical phenomena. Causal inference algorithms can identify important relationships from biomedical data; however, handling the challenges of causal inference over mixed data with unmeasured confounders in a scalable way is still an open problem. Despite recent advances into causal discovery strategies that could potentially handle these challenges; individually, no study currently exists that comprehensively compares these approaches in this setting. In this paper, we present a comparative study that addresses this problem by comparing the accuracy and efficiency of different strategies in large, mixed datasets with latent \u2026",

ER is known to drive breast cancer development and progression, and targeting ER has been one of the most successful targeted therapies in oncology. Given the paucity of functional DNA sequence variants (DSVs) within the ER in primary breast tumors, we asked whether DSVs in ER binding sites could contribute to altered hormone response through changes in ER recruitment to DNA.We developed a pipeline to extract DSVs in ER binding sites, and to assess their impact on ER binding in a genome-wide manner, using ChIP-seq data from hormone responsive breast cancer cells. We utilized MACS for peak calling and GATK for calling DSVs including SNVs and short indels. Using 22,143 ER binding sites which overlapped in at least six data sets, we detected 1,409,406 DSVs from 441,855,039 \u2026",

The two algorithms, ASTRO and MiMeSR, are inspired by the rank order preserving framework and the minimum mean squared residue approach, respectively. However, ASTRO and MiMeSR differ from previous approaches in that they take advantage of the relatively few number of time points in order to reduce the problem from NP-hard to linear.

The short length of the DNA patterns compared with the size of the promoter regions and the degeneracy of the patterns makes their identification difficult. One way to overcome this problem is to use evolutionary information to reduce the number of false-positive predictions. We developed a novel method for pattern identification that compares a pair of putative binding sites in two species (e.g., human and mouse) and assigns two probability scores based on the relative position of the sites in the promoter and their agreement with a known model of binding preferences. We tested the algorithm's ability to predict known binding sites on various promoters.

A limitation of existing causal learning methods is that they cannot identify indirect causal relations, those that would interact through latent mediating variables. We developed the first computational method that identifies both direct and indirect causalities, causal inference using deep-learning variable-selection (causalDeepVASE). To accurately identify indirect causalities and incorporate them with direct causalities, causalDeepVASE develops a deep neural network approach and extends a flexible causal inference method. In simulated and biological data of various contexts, causalDeepVASE outperforms existing methods in identifying expected or validated causal relations. Further, causalDeepVASE facilitates a systematic understanding of complex diseases. For example, causalDeepVASE uniquely identified a possible causal relation between IFN\u03b3 and creatinine suggested in a polymicrobial sepsis model. In future biomedical studies, causalDeepVASE can facilitate the identification of driver genes and therapeutic agents.",

TGF\u03b21 activates a signal transduction cascade that results in the transcriptional regulation of genes in the nucleus, primarily through the DNA-binding transcription factor SMAD3. The objective of this study is to identify genome-wide scale map of SMAD3 binding targets and the molecular pathways and networks affected by the TGF\u03b21/SMAD3 signaling in lung epithelial cells.   Methodology We combined chromatin immunoprecipitation with human promoter region microarrays (ChIP-on-chip) along with gene expression microarrays to study global transcriptional regulation of the TGF\u03b21/SMAD3 pathway in human A549 alveolar epithelial cells. The molecular pathways and networks associated with TGF\u03b21/SMAD3 signaling were identified using computational approaches. Validation of selected target gene expression and direct binding of SMAD3 to promoters were performed by quantitative real time RT-PCR and electrophoretic mobility shift assay on A549 and human primary lung epithelial cells.   Results and Conclusions Known TGF\u03b21 target genes such as SERPINE1, SMAD6, SMAD7, TGFB1 and LTBP3, were found in both ChIP-on-chip and gene expression analyses as well as some previously unrecognized targets such as FOXA2.

YAP1 activity was detected in biliary cells and in cells at the hepato-biliary bifurcation in single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of developing livers. Hepatoblast deletion of Yap1 led to no impairment in Notch-driven SOX9+ ductal plate formation, but prevented the formation of the abutting second layer of SOX9+ ductal cells, blocking the formation of a patent intrahepatic biliary tree. Intriguingly, the mice survived for 8 months with severe cholestatic injury and without any hepatocyte-to-biliary transdifferentiation. Ductular reaction in the perihilar region suggested extrahepatic biliary proliferation likely seeking the missing intrahepatic biliary network. Long-term survival of these mice occurred through hepatocyte adaptation via reduced metabolic and synthetic function including altered bile acid metabolism and transport. Overall, we show YAP1 as a key regulator of bile duct development while highlighting a profound adaptive capability of hepatocytes.",

Analysis of mRNA profiles distinguished proneural (PN) from mesenchymal (Mes) GSCs and revealed a pronounced correlation with the corresponding PN or Mes HGGs. Mes GSCs displayed more aggressive phenotypes in vitro and as intracranial xenografts in mice. Further, Mes GSCs were markedly resistant to radiation compared with PN GSCs. The glycolytic pathway, comprising aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family genes and in particular ALDH1A3, were enriched in Mes GSCs. Glycolytic activity and ALDH activity were significantly elevated in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "High throughput genome sequencing technologies such as RNA-Seq and Microarray have the potential to transform clinical decision making and biomedical research by enabling high-throughput measurements of the genome at a granular level. However, to truly understand causes of disease and the effects of medical interventions, this data must be integrated with phenotypic, environmental, and behavioral data from individuals. Further, effective knowledge discovery methods that can infer relationships between these data types are required. In this work, we propose a pipeline for knowledge discovery from integrated genomic and clinical data. The pipeline begins with a novel variable selection method, and uses a probabilistic graphical model to understand the relationships between features in the data. We demonstrate how this pipeline can improve breast cancer outcome prediction models, and can provide a biologically interpretable view of sequencing data.",

By contrast, the roles of the sizeable disordered N- and C-terminal regions of SIRT1 are largely unexplored. Here we identify an insulin-responsive sensor in the SIRT1 N-terminal region (NTR), comprising an acidic cluster (AC) and a 3-helix bundle (3HB), controlling deacetylase activity. The allosteric assistor DBC1 removes a distal N-terminal shield from the 3-helix bundle, permitting PACS-2 to engage the acidic cluster and the transiently exposed helix 3 of the 3-helix bundle, disrupting its structure and inhibiting catalysis. The SIRT1 activator (STAC) SRT1720 binds and stabilizes the 3-helix bundle, protecting SIRT1 from inhibition by PACS-2.

Alveolar macrophages line the alveolar spaces and are the first cells of the immune system to respond to invading pathogens. To determine the similarities and differences between the responses of mice and macaques to invading pathogens we profiled alveolar macrophages from these species following infection with two viral (PR8 and Fuj/02 influenza A) and two bacterial (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Francisella tularensis Schu S4) pathogens. Cells were collected at 6 time points following each infection and expression profiles were compared across and between species. Our analyses identified a core set of genes, activated in both species and across all pathogens that were predominantly part of the interferon response pathway. In addition, we identified similarities across species in the way innate immune cells respond to lethal versus non-lethal pathogens. On the other hand we also found several species and pathogen specific response patterns. These results provide new insights into mechanisms by which the innate immune system responds to, and interacts with, invading pathogens.",

Although every cell in an organism contains the same genetic material, its expression profile depends on the tissue type, developmental stage, and the extracellular signals it receives at the given point in time. Cells exert various ways to regulate the expression of their genes. Chromatin structure, for example, can make large parts of the genome transcriptionally silent or potentially active. Also, posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms can influence the amount and the activity of the available proteins and noncoding genes in a cell. The best studied mechanism for gene expression control, however, is the transcription regulation at the individual",

Despite extensive analyses, there remains an urgent need to delineate immune cell states that contribute to mortality in severe COVID-19. We performed high-dimensional cellular and molecular profiling of blood and respiratory samples from critically ill COVID-19 patients to define immune cell genomic states that are predictive of outcome in severe COVID-19 disease. Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) manifested increased frequencies of inflammatory monocytes and plasmablasts that were also associated with ARDS not due to COVID-19. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq)-based deconvolution of genomic states of peripheral immune cells revealed distinct gene modules that were associated with COVID-19 outcome. Notably, monocytes exhibited bifurcated genomic states, with expression of a cytokine gene module exemplified by CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) associated with survival and an interferon signaling module associated with death. These gene modules were correlated with higher levels of MIP-1\u03b2 and CXCL10 levels in plasma, respectively. Monocytes expressing genes reflective of these divergent modules were also detectable in endotracheal aspirates. Machine learning algorithms identified the distinctive monocyte modules as part of a multivariate peripheral immune system state that was predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Follow-up analysis of the monocyte modules on ICU day 5 was consistent with bifurcated \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) proteins recognize a small number of DNA sequences with high specificity and control the expression of neighbouring genes. The evolution of TF binding preference has been the subject of a number of recent studies, in which generalized binding profiles have been introduced and used to improve the prediction of new target sites. Generalized profiles are generated by aligning and merging the individual profiles of related TFs. However, the distance metrics and alignment algorithms used to compare the binding profiles have not yet been fully explored or optimized. As a result, binding profiles depend on TF structural information and sometimes may ignore important distinctions between subfamilies. Prediction of the identity or the structural class of a protein that binds to a given DNA pattern will enhance the analysis of microarray and ChIP\u2013chip data where frequently multiple putative targets of usually unknown TFs are predicted. Various comparison metrics and alignment algorithms are evaluated (a total of 105 combinations). We find that local alignments are generally better than global alignments at detecting eukaryotic DNA motif similarities, especially when combined with the sum of squared distances or Pearson's correlation coefficient comparison metrics. In addition, multiple-alignment strategies for binding profiles and tree-building methods are tested for their efficiency in constructing generalized binding models. A new method for automatic determination of the optimal number of clusters is developed and applied in the construction of a new set of familial binding profiles which improves upon TF classification \u2026",

Existing methods rely on two general approaches to address this challenge: 1) the Theorydriven approach, which utilizes prior accumulated knowledge, and 2)the Data-driven approach, which solely utilizes the data to deduce scientific knowledge. Both of these approaches alone suffer from bias toward past/present knowledge, as they fail to incorporate all of the current knowledge that is available to make new discoveries. In this paper, we show how an integrated method can effectively address the high dimensionality of big biological data, which is a major problem for pure datadriven analysis approaches. We realize our approach in a novel two-step analytical workflow that incorporates a new feature selection paradigm as the first step to handling high-throughput \u2026",

            "Abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small (20\u201323 nt), non-coding single stranded RNA molecules that act as post-transcriptional regulators of mRNA gene expression. They have been implicated in regulation of developmental processes in diverse organisms. The echinoderms, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) and Patiria miniata (sea star) are excellent model organisms for studying development with well-characterized transcriptional networks. However, to date, nothing is known about the role of miRNAs during development in these organisms, except that the genes that are involved in the miRNA biogenesis pathway are expressed during their developmental stages. In this paper, we used Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, Inc.) to sequence small RNA libraries in mixed stage population of embryos from one to three days after fertilization of sea urchin and sea star (total of 22,670,000 reads). Analysis of these data revealed the miRNA populations in these two species. We found that 47 and 38 known miRNAs are expressed in sea urchin and sea star, respectively, during early development (32 in common). We also found 13 potentially novel miRNAs in the sea urchin embryonic library. miRNA expression is generally conserved between the two species during development, but 7 miRNAs are highly expressed in only one species. We expect that our two datasets will be a valuable resource for everyone working in the field of developmental biology and the regulatory networks that affect it.

In the present study, we propose that the EVLP of diseased human lungs is a well-suited preclinical model for translational research on chronic lung diseases.

            "Abstract": "Digital transcript subtraction (DTS) was developed to subtract in silico known human sequences from expression library data sets, leaving candidate nonhuman sequences for further analysis. This approach requires precise discrimination between human and nonhuman cDNA sequences. Database comparisons show high likelihood that small viral sequences can be successfully distinguished from human sequences. DTS analysis of 9,026 20-bp tags from an expression library of BCBL-1 cells infected with Kaposi\u2019s sarcomaassociated herpesvirus (KSHV) resolved all but three candidate sequences. Two of these sequences belonged to KSHV transcripts, and the third belonged to an unannotated human expression sequence tag. Overall, 0.24% of transcripts from this cell line were of viral origin. DTS analysis of 241,122 expression tags from three squamous cell conjunctival carcinomas revealed that only 21 sequences did not align with sequences from human databases. All 21 candidates amplify human transcripts and have secondary evidence for being of human origin. This analysis shows that it is unlikely that distinguishable viral transcripts are present in conjunctival carcinomas at 20 transcripts per million or higher, which is the equivalent of approximately 4 transcripts per cell. DTS is a simple screening method to discover novel viral nucleic acids. It provides, for the first time, quantitative evidence against some classes of viral etiology when no viral transcripts are found, thereby reducing the uncertainty involved in new pathogen discovery.Although infection contributes to over 20% of human cancers worldwide, the list of confirmed \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Estrogen receptor (ER) activity is critical for the development and progression of the majority of breast cancers. It is known that ER is differentially bound to DNA leading to transcriptomic and phenotypic changes in different breast cancer models. We investigated whether single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in ER binding sites (regSNVs) contribute to ER action through changes in the ER cistrome, thereby affecting disease progression. Here we developed a computational pipeline to identify SNVs in ER binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from ER+ breast cancer models. ER ChIP-seq data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). GATK pipeline was used to identify SNVs and the MACS algorithm was employed to call DNA-binding sites. Determination of the potential effect of a given SNV in a binding site was inferred using reimplementation of the is-rSNP algorithm. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were integrated to correlate the regSNVs and gene expression in breast tumors. ChIP and luciferase assays were used to assess the allele-specific binding. Analysis of ER ChIP-seq data from MCF7 cells identified an intronic SNV in the IGF1R gene, rs62022087, predicted to increase ER binding. Functional studies confirmed that ER binds preferentially to rs62022087 versus the wild-type allele. By integrating 43 ER ChIP-seq datasets, multi-omics, and clinical data, we identified 17 regSNVs associated with altered expression of adjacent genes in ER+ disease. Of these, the top candidate was in the promoter of the GSTM1 gene and was associated with higher expression of GSTM1 in \u2026",

Using RNAseq data from 10,227 tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we evaluated 212 protein-coding transcripts from 12 cancer-related pathways. We employed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify expression pattern difference among each pathway\u2019s transcripts. We have previously used t-SNE to show that survival in some cancers correlates with expression patterns of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins and enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation. Using the above 212 transcripts, t-SNE-assisted transcript pattern profiling identified patient cohorts with significant survival differences in 30 of 34 different cancer types comprising 9350 tumors (91.4% of all TCGA cases). Small subsets of each pathway\u2019s transcripts, comprising no more than 50\u201360 from the original group, played particularly prominent roles in determining overall t-SNE patterns. In several cases, further refinements in long-term survival could be achieved by sequential t-SNE profiling with two pathways\u2019 transcripts, by a combination of t-SNE plus whole transcriptome profiling or by employing t-SNE on immuno-histochemically defined breast cancer subtypes.

            "Abstract": "Graphical causal models are an important tool for knowledge discovery because they can represent both the causal relations between variables and the multivariate probability distributions over the data. Once learned, causal graphs can be used for classification, feature selection and hypothesis generation, while revealing the underlying causal network structure and thus allowing for arbitrary likelihood queries over the data. However, current algorithms for learning sparse directed graphs are generally designed to handle only one type of data (continuous-only or discrete-only), which limits their applicability to a large class of multi-modal biological datasets that include mixed type variables. To address this issue, we developed new methods that modify and combine existing methods for finding undirected graphs with methods for finding directed graphs. These hybrid methods are not only faster, but also perform better than the directed graph estimation methods alone for a variety of parameter settings and data set sizes. Here, we describe a new conditional independence test for learning directed graphs over mixed data types and we compare performances of different graph learning strategies on synthetic data.",

            "Abstract": "Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNA regulators of protein coding genes. miRNAs play a very important role in diverse biological processes and various diseases. Many algorithms are able to predict miRNA genes and their targets, but their transcription regulation is still under investigation. It is generally believed that intragenic miRNAs (located in introns or exons of protein coding genes) are co-transcribed with their host genes and most intergenic miRNAs transcribed from their own RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter. However, the length of the primary transcripts and promoter organization is currently unknown.  Methodology We performed Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip using a custom array surrounding regions of known miRNA genes. To identify the true core transcription start sites of the miRNA genes we developed a new tool (CPPP). We showed that miRNA genes can be transcribed from promoters located several kilobases away and that their promoters share the same general features as those of protein coding genes. Finally, we found evidence that as many as 26% of the intragenic miRNAs may be transcribed from their own unique promoters.  Conclusion miRNA promoters have similar features to those of protein coding genes, but miRNA transcript organization is more complex.",

We have used theMonodelphis domestica (gray short-tailed opossum) sequence to construct the first map of a marsupial major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC is the most gene-dense region of the mammalian genome and is critical to immunity and reproductive success. The marsupial MHC bridges the phylogenetic gap between the complex MHC of eutherian mammals and the minimal essential MHC of birds. Here we show that the opossum MHC is gene dense and complex, as in humans, but shares more organizational features with non-mammals. The Class I genes have amplified within the Class II region, resulting in a unique Class I/II region. We present a model of the organization of the MHC in ancestral mammals and its elaboration during mammalian evolution. The opossum genome, together with other extant genomes, reveals the existence of an ancestral \u201cimmune supercomplex\u201d that contained genes of both types of natural killer receptors together with antigen processing genes and MHC genes.",

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically-ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes.Methods: We enrolled 453 mechanically-ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples.Results: Compared to healthy controls, ARF patients had significantly higher BDG levels (median [interquartile-range] 26 [15-49] pg/ml, p< 0.001), whereas ARF patients with high BDG levels (\u2265 40pg/ml, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (odds ratio [confidence interval] 2.88 [1.83-4.54], p< 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted p< 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Conclusions: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically-ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.",

            "Abstract": "MicroRNA s (miRNAs) are small non-coding single-stranded RNAs (20\u201323 nts) that are known to act as post-transcriptional and translational regulators of gene expression. Although, they were initially overlooked, their role in many important biological processes, such as development, cell differentiation, and cancer has been established in recent times. In spite of their biological significance, the identification of miRNA genes in newly sequenced organisms is still based, to a large degree, on extensive use of evolutionary conservation, which is not always available. We have developed HHMMiR, a novel approach for de novo miRNA hairpin prediction in the absence of evolutionary conservation. Our method implements a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) that utilizes region-based structural as well as sequence information of miRNA precursors. We first established a template for the structure of a typical miRNA hairpin by summarizing data from publicly available databases. We then used this template to develop the HHMM topology. Our algorithm achieved average sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 88%, on 10-fold cross-validation of human miRNA precursor data. We also show that this model, trained on human sequences, works well on hairpins from other vertebrate as well as invertebrate species. Furthermore, the human trained model was able to correctly classify ~97% of plant miRNA precursors. The success of this approach in such a diverse set of species indicates that sequence conservation is not necessary for miRNA prediction. This may lead to efficient prediction of miRNA genes in virtually any organism.",

            "Abstract": "Global transcript levels throughout the cell cycle have been characterized using microarrays in several species. Early analysis of these experiments focused on individual species. More recently, a number of studies have concluded that a surprisingly small number of genes conserved in two or more species are periodically transcribed in these species. Combining and comparing data from multiple species is challenging because of noise in expression data, the different synchronization and scoring methods used, and the need to determine an accurate set of homologs. To solve these problems, we developed and applied a new algorithm to analyze expression data from multiple species simultaneously. Unlike previous studies, we find that more than 20% of cycling genes in budding yeast have cycling homologs in fission yeast and 5% to 7% of cycling genes in each of four species have cycling homologs in all other \u2026",

Age is a primary risk factor in IPF, as its prevalence and incidence increase with age, and most of the hallmarks of aging have been described in IPF. Among those hallmarks, the accumulation of senescent cells reduces the regenerative potential and lung response to stress2. Senescent cells show lower levels of proliferation, resist apoptosis, express increased levels of \u03b2-galactosidase, and secrete the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In young individuals, the SASP directs the immune-mediated clearance of damaged cells and initiates tissue regeneration.

            "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to their target mRNAs through base complementarity. Predicting miRNA targets is a challenging task and various studies showed that existing algorithms suffer from high number of false predictions and low to moderate overlap in their predictions. Until recently, very few algorithms considered the dynamic nature of the interactions, including the effect of less specific interactions, the miRNA expression level, and the effect of combinatorial miRNA binding. Addressing these issues can result in a more accurate miRNA:mRNA modeling with many applications, including efficient miRNA-related SNP evaluation. We present a novel thermodynamic model based on the Fermi-Dirac equation that incorporates miRNA expression in the prediction of target occupancy and we show that it improves the performance of two popular single miRNA target finders. Modeling combinatorial miRNA targeting is a natural extension of this model. Two other algorithms show improved prediction efficiency when combinatorial binding models were considered. ComiR (Combinatorial miRNA targeting), a novel algorithm we developed, incorporates the improved predictions of the four target finders into a single probabilistic score using ensemble learning. Combining target scores of multiple miRNAs using ComiR improves predictions over the na\u00efve method for target combination. ComiR scoring scheme can be used for identification of SNPs affecting miRNA binding. As proof of principle, ComiR identified rs17737058 as disruptive to the miR-488-5p:NCOA1 interaction, which we confirmed in vitro. We also found \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The influenza A virus genome is composed of eight single-stranded RNA segments of negative polarity. Although the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes are known to play a key role in host adaptation, the polymerase genes (which encode the polymerase segments PB2, PB1, PA) and the nucleoprotein gene are also important for the efficient propagation of the virus in the host and for its adaptation to new hosts. Current efforts to understand the host-specificity of the virus have largely focused on the amino acid differences between avian and human isolates. Here we show that the folding free energy of the RNA segments may play an equally important role in the evolution and host adaptation of the influenza virus. Folding free energy may affect the stability of the viral RNA and influence the rate of viral protein translation. We found that there is a clear distinction between the avian and human folding free energy distributions for the polymerase and the nucleoprotein genes, with human viruses having substantially higher folding free energy values. This difference is independent of the amino acid composition and the codon bias. Furthermore, the folding free energy values of the commonly circulating human viruses tend to shift towards higher values over the years, after they entered the human population. Finally, our results indicate that the temperature in which the cells grow affects infection efficiency. Our data suggest for the first time that RNA structure stability may play an important role in the emergence and host shift of influenza A virus. The fact that cell temperature affects virus propagation in mammalian cells could help identify those \u2026",

Here, we demonstrate that enduring physicochemical changes of mitochondrial networks invoked by transient stress, a phenomenon we term \u2018mitoengrams\u2019, underlie the transgenerational persistence of epigenetically scripted cellular behavior. Using C2C12 myogenic stem-like cells, we show that stress memory elicited by transient, low-level arsenite exposure is stored within a self-renewing subpopulation of progeny cells in a mitochondrial-dependent fashion. Importantly, we demonstrate that erasure of mitoengrams by administration of mitochondria-targeted electron scavenger was sufficient to reset key epigenetic marks of cellular memory and redirect the identity of the mitoengram-harboring progeny cells to a non-stress-like state.

Related approaches depend on bootstrapping multiple alignments from a single sequence. However, alignment-based programs have limitations.

            "Abstract": "Ribosomopathies comprise a heterogeneous group of hematologic and developmental disorders, often characterized by bone marrow failure, skeletal and other developmental abnormalities and cancer predisposition. They are associated with mutations and/or haplo-insufficiencies of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and inefficient ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing. The resulting ribosomal stress induces the canonical p19ARF/Mdm2/p53 tumor suppressor pathway leading to proliferative arrest and/or apoptosis. It has been proposed that this pathway is then inactivated during subsequent neoplastic evolution. We show here that two murine models of hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) unexpectedly possess features that mimic the ribosomopathies. These include loss of the normal stoichiometry of RP transcripts and proteins and the accumulation of unprocessed rRNA precursors. Silencing of p19ARF, cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, binding to and inactivation of Mdm2 by free RPs, and up-regulation of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 may further cooperate to drive tumor growth and survival. Consistent with this notion, re-instatement of constitutive p19ARF expression in the HB model completely suppressed tumorigenesis. In >2000 cases of human HCC, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, RP transcript deregulation was a frequent finding. In HCC and breast cancer, the severity of this dysregulation was associated with inferior survival. In HCC, the presence of RP gene mutations, some of which were identical to those previously reported in ribosomopathies, were similarly negatively correlated with long-term survival. Taken \u2026",

This is also seen in matrisome pathway genes (LF: p=-5-16-236.01 x10; MF: p= 3.69 x10; HF: p= 5.79 x10).

Cloned DNAs from the characteristic bulbous structure at the tip of the Xchromosome in the region of the broad complex display an unusual pattern of in situ hybridization. Sequence analysis revealed that this region comprises 154 kilobases of DNA flanked by 1.2-kilobases of inverted repeats, each composed of a 350\u2013base pair satellite related element. Thus, some aspects of chromosome structure appear to be revealed directly within the DNA sequence itself.",

Current methodologies are challenged by the high dimensionality of the combined datasets, the differences in distributions across the datasets, and their integration in a plausible causal framework, beyond merely correlative biomarkers. Here we present CausER, a first-in-class two-step interpretable machine learning approach for high-dimensional multi-omic datasets, that addresses these problems by identifying latent factors and their cause-effect relationships with the system-wide outcome/property of interest. The first step consists of Essential Regression (ER), a novel data-distribution-free regression model that integrates multi-omic datasets and identifies latent factors significantly associated with an outcome. The second involves probabilistic graphical modeling of the significant latent factors to infer plausible causal associations between them and mechanisms that affect outcomes, thereby significantly moving beyond predictive associative markers. By analyzing varied human immunological multi-omic datasets, we demonstrate that CausER significantly outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art approaches. It generates novel cellular and molecular predictions in a range of contexts, including immunosenescence and sustained immune dysregulation associated with pre-term birth, that are corroborated by biological findings in model systems.",

The role for post-transcriptional regulation of the platelet transcriptome by microRNAs (miRNAs) in SCD has not been previously explored. This is the first study to determine whether platelets from SCD exhibit an altered miRNA expression profile.   Methods and Findings We analyzed the expression of miRNAs isolated from platelets from a primary cohort (SCD = 19, controls = 10) and a validation cohort (SCD = 7, controls = 7) by hybridizing to the Agilent miRNA microarrays. A dramatic difference in miRNA expression profiles between patients and controls was noted in both cohorts separately. A total of 40 differentially expressed platelet miRNAs were identified as common in both cohorts (p-value 0.05, fold change>2) with 24 miRNAs downregulated. Interestingly, 14 of the 24 downregulated miRNAs were members of three families - miR-329, miR-376 and miR-154 - which localized to the epigenetically regulated, maternally imprinted chromosome 14q32 region. We validated the downregulated miRNAs, miR-376a and miR-409-3p, and an upregulated miR-1225-3p using qRT-PCR. Over-expression of the miR-1225-3p in the Meg01 cells was followed by mRNA expression profiling to identify mRNA targets. This resulted in significant transcriptional repression of 1605 transcripts.

The most popular clustering methods such as K-means and hierarchical clustering are intuitive and easy to use, but they require arbitrary choices on their various parameters (number of clusters for K-means, and a threshold to cut the tree for hierarchical clustering). Human disease gene expression data are in general more difficult to cluster efficiently due to background (genotype) heterogeneity, disease stage and progression differences and disease subtyping; all of which cause gene expression datasets to be more heterogeneous. Spectral clustering has been recently introduced in many fields as a promising alternative to standard clustering methods. The idea is that pairwise comparisons can \u2026",

However, molecular signaling in glioma stem cells (GSCs) in individual HGG subtypes is poorly characterized. Previously we identified and characterized two mutually exclusive GSC subtypes with distinct activated signaling pathways and biological phenotypes. One GSC subtype presented with a gene signature resembling Proneural (PN) HGG, whereas the other was similar to mesenchymal (Mes) HGG. Classical HGG-derived GSCs were sub-classified as either one of these two subtypes. Differential mRNA expression analysis of PN and Mes GSCs identified 5796 differentially expressed genes, revealing a pronounced correlation with the corresponding PN or Mes HGGs. Mes GSCs displayed more aggressive phenotypes in vitro and as intracranial xenografts in mice. Further, Mes \u2026",

Moreover, alcohol dehydrogenase genes constitute potential versatile markers in insect transformation experiments. However, due to their rapid evolution, these genes cannot be cloned from other insect genera by DNA hybridization or PCR-based strategies. We have therefore explored an alternative strategy: cloning by functional complementation of appropriate yeast mutants. Here we report that two alcohol dehydrogenase genes from the medfly Ceratitis capitata can functionally replace the yeast enzymes, even though the medfly and yeast genes have evolved independently, acquiring their enzymatic function convergently. Using this method, we have cloned an alcohol dehydrogenase gene from the olive pest Bactrocera oleae. We conclude that functional \u2026",

PCA is a popular method for interpretable dimension reduction. However, it assumes a linear mapping between data and latent components and this may not be warranted in complex data. Single cell variational inference (scVI) offers a nonlinear method for latent space mapping, but the latent factors are not in general interpretable. In light of disentangled representations that learn independent data generative factors of single cell data in an unsupervised way, we propose factor variational inference (factorVI). FactorVI learns the disentangled factors among biologically relevant latent variables directly by penalizing correlations between them.

An extensive analysis of human miRNA binding sites on the viral genome led to the identification of miR-1207-5p as potential regulator of the viral Spike protein. It is known that exogenous RNA can compete for miRNA targets of endogenous mRNAs leading to their overexpression. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus can act as an exogenous competing RNA, facilitating the over-expression of its endogenous targets. Transcriptomic analysis of human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells confirmed that the CSF1 gene, a known target of miR-1207-5p, is over-expressed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. CSF1 enhances macrophage recruitment and activation and its overexpression may contribute to the acute inflammatory response observed in severe COVID-19. In summary, our results indicate that dysregulation of miR-1207-5p-target genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to uncontrolled inflammation in most severe COVID-19 cases.",

This study focuses on the evolutionary relationships between conservation of noncoding sequences, cis-regulatory elements, and biologic functions of regulated genes in opossum and eight vertebrate species. Analysis of 145 intergenic microRNA and all protein coding genes revealed that the upstream sequences of the former are up to twice as conserved as the latter among mammals, except in the first 500 base pairs, where the conservation is similar. Comparison of promoter conservation in 513 protein coding genes and related transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) showed that 41% of the known human TFBSs are located in the 6.7% of promoter regions that are conserved between human and opossum. Some core biologic processes exhibited significantly fewer conserved TFBSs in human-opossum comparisons, suggesting greater functional divergence. A new measure of efficiency in multigenome phylogenetic footprinting (base regulatory potential rate [BRPR]) shows that including human-opossum conservation increases specificity in finding human TFBSs. Opossum facilitates better estimation of promoter conservation and TFBS turnover among mammals. The fact that substantial TFBS numbers are located in a small proportion of the human-opossum conserved sequences emphasizes the importance of marsupial genomes for phylogenetic footprinting-based motif discovery strategies.

Next-generation sequencing of microbial DNA directly from patient samples may improve diagnostic accuracy for guiding antibiotic prescriptions. In this study, we hypothesized that enhanced pathogen detection using sequencing can improve upon culture-based diagnosis and that certain sequencing profiles correlate with host response. We prospectively collected endotracheal aspirates and plasma within 72 hours of intubation from patients with acute respiratory failure. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine pathogen abundance in lung samples and measured plasma biomarkers to assess host responses to detected pathogens. Among 56 patients, 12 patients (21%) had positive respiratory cultures. Sequencing revealed lung communities with low diversity (p50% relative abundance) corresponding to clinically isolated pathogens (concordance p=0.009). Importantly, sequencing detected dominant pathogens in 20% of the culture-negative patients exposed to broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics. Regardless of culture results, pathogen dominance correlated with increased plasma markers of host injury (receptor of advanced glycation end-products-RAGE) and inflammation (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-TNFR1) (p<0.05), compared to subjects without dominant pathogens in their lung communities.

MicroRNA regulation activity depends on the recognition of binding sites located on mRNA molecules. ComiR is a web tool realized to predict the targets of a set of microRNAs, starting from their expression profile. ComiR was trained with the information regarding binding sites in the 3\u2019utr region, by using a reliable dataset containing the targets of endogenously expressed microRNA in D. melanogaster S2 cells. This dataset was obtained by comparing the results from two different experimental approaches, i.e., inhibition, and immunoprecipitation of the AGO1 protein--a component of the microRNA induced silencing complex. In this work, we tested whether including coding region binding sites in ComiR algorithm improves the performance of the tool in predicting microRNA targets. We focused the analysis on the D. melanogaster species and updated the ComiR underlying database with the currently available releases of mRNA and microRNA sequences. As a result, we find that ComiR algorithm trained with the information related to the coding regions is more efficient in predicting the microRNA targets, with respect to the algorithm trained with 3\u2019utr information. On the other hand, we show that 3\u2019utr based predictions can be seen as complementary to the coding region based predictions, which suggests that both predictions, from 3\u2019utr and coding regions, should be considered in comprehensive analysis.

From serial plasma samples, we measured BDG, innate immunity and epithelial permeability biomarkers. From lower respiratory tract and stool samples we quantified bacterial and fungal DNA load using culture-independent techniques.   Results: A positive BDG test (>60pg/ml) at baseline was detected in 19% of patients.

            "Abstract": "Carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP), with or without sorafenib, result in objective response rates of 18\u201320 % in unselected chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients. Molecular predictors of survival and response to CP-based chemotherapy in metastatic melanoma (MM) are critical to improving the therapeutic index. Intergroup trial E2603 randomized MM patients to CP with or without sorafenib. Expression data were collected from pre-treatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues from 115 of 823 patients enrolled on E2603. The selected patients were balanced across treatment arms, BRAF status, and clinical outcome. We generated data using Nanostring array (microRNA (miRNA) expression) and DNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension and ligation (DASL)/Illumina microarrays (HT12 v4) (mRNA expression) with protocols optimized for FFPE samples. Integrative computational analysis was performed using a novel Tree-guided Recursive Cluster Selection (T-ReCS) [1] algorithm to select the most informative features/genes, followed by TargetScan miRNA target prediction (Human v6.2) and mirConnX [2] for network inference. T-ReCS identified PLXNB1 as negatively associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and miR-659-3p as the primary miRNA associated positively with PFS. miR-659-3p was differentially expressed based on PFS but not based on treatment arm, BRAF or NRAS status. Dichotomized by median PFS (less vs greater than 4 months), miR-659-3p expression was significantly different. High miR-659-3p expression distinguished patients with responsive disease (complete or partial response) from patients with stable \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Feature selection is used extensively in biomedical research for biomarker identification and patient classification, both of which are essential steps in developing personalized medicine strategies. However, the structured nature of the biological datasets and high correlation of variables frequently yield multiple equally optimal signatures, thus making traditional feature selection methods unstable. Features selected based on one cohort of patients, may not work as well in another cohort. In addition, biologically important features may be missed due to selection of other co-clustered features We propose a new method, Tree-guided Recursive Cluster Selection (T-ReCS), for efficient selection of grouped features. T-ReCS significantly improves predictive stability while maintains the same level of accuracy. T-ReCS does not require an a priori knowledge of the clusters like group-lasso and also can handle \u201corphan \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Present-day diagnostic criteria are largely based solely on spirometric criteria. Accumulating evidence has identified a substantial number of individuals without spirometric evidence of COPD who suffer from respiratory symptoms and/or increased morbidity and mortality. There is a clear need for an expanded definition of COPD that is linked to physiologic, structural (computed tomography [CT]) and clinical evidence of disease. Using data from the COPD Genetic Epidemiology study (COPDGene\u00ae), we hypothesized that an integrated approach that includes environmental exposure, clinical symptoms, chest CT imaging and spirometry better defines disease and captures the likelihood of progression of respiratory obstruction and mortality.Methods: Four key disease characteristics\u2013environmental exposure \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Causal structure learning algorithms are very important in many fields, including biomedical sciences, because they can uncover the underlying causal network structure from observational data. Several such algorithms have been developed over the years, but they usually operate on datasets of a single data type: continuous or discrete variables only. More recently, we and others have proposed new causal structure learning algorithms for mixed data types. However, to-date there is no study that critically evaluates these methods\u2019 performance. In this paper, we provide the first extensive empirical evaluation of several popular causal structure learning methods on mixed data types and in a variety of parameter settings and sample sizes. Our results serve as a guide as to which method performs the best in a given context, and as such they are a first step towards a \u201cmethod selection guide\u201d for those running causal modeling methods on real life datasets.",

Extent of fibrosis in each sample was assessed by microCT-measured alveolar surface density (ASD) and confirmed by histology. Regulatory gene expression networks were identified using linear mixed-effect models and dynamic regulatory events miner (DREM). Differential gene expression analysis identified a core set of genes increased or decreased before fibrosis was histologically evident that continued to change with advanced fibrosis. DREM generated a systems biology model (www. sb. cs. cmu. edu/IPFReg) that identified progressively divergent gene expression tracks with microRNAs and transcription factors that specifically regulate mild or advanced fibrosis.
