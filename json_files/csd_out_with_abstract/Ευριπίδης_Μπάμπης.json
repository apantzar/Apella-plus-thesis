            "Abstract": "We consider the traffic grooming problem in passive WDM star networks. Traffic grooming is concerned with the development of techniques for combining low speed traffic components onto high speed channels in order to minimize network cost. We first prove that the traffic grooming problem in star networks is NP-hard for a more restricted case than the one considered in [2]. Then, we propose a polynomial time algorithm for the special case where there are two wavelengths per fiber using matching techniques. Furthermore, we propose two reductions of our problem to two combinatorial optimization problems, the constrained multiset multicover problem [3], and the demand matching problem [4] allowing us to obtain a polynomial time H 2C (resp. ) approximation algorithm for the minimization (resp. maximization) version of the problem, where C is the capacity of each wavelength.",

We consider the multistage version (Eisenstat et al., Gupta et al., both ICALP 2014) of such problems: The profit function(and possibly the set of feasible solutions) may change over time. Since in many applications changing the solution is costly, the task becomes to find a sequence of solutions that optimizes the trade-off between good per-time solutions and stable solutions taking into account an additional similarity bonus.

We focus on the impact of the knowledge of the future on the quality and the stability of the returned solutions by distinguishing three settings: the off-line setting where the whole set of instances through the time horizon is known in advance, the on-line setting where no future instance is known, and the k-lookahead setting where at time t, the instances at times t + 1,. .. , t + k are known. We first consider the case without restrictions where the set of resources and the set of agents are the same for all instances and where every resource can be allocated to any agent. For the off-line setting, we show that the overtime version of the problem is much harder than the static one, since it becomes N P-hard even for families of instances for which the static problem is trivial. Then, we provide a \u03c1 \u03c1+1-approximation algorithm for the off-line setting using as subroutine a \u03c1-approximation algorithm for the static version.

A truthful mechanism can be easily obtained in this context (if we, of course, assume that the tasks cannot shrink their lengths) by scheduling the tasks following the increasing order of their lengths. The quality of a mechanism is measured by its approximation factor (price of anarchy, in a distributed system) wrt the social optimum. The previous mechanism, known as SPT, produces a (2-1/m)-approximate schedule, where m is the number of machines. The central question in this paper is the following:\u201cAre there other truthful mechanisms with better approximation guarantee (price of anarchy) for the considered scheduling problem?\u201d This question has been raised by Christodoulou et al \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Graphical games (GG) provide compact representations of multiplayer games involving large populations of agents when influences among them have some locality property. The notion of pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), not requiring randomized strategies, is a fundamental stability concept. However, recent results show that for many natural topologies, a PNE is very unlikely to exist when the number of agents is large, which challenges the relevance of PNE in large GG. In this paper, we investigate how far we can get from the notion of individual stability captured by the concept of PNE, by only requiring agents to be almost in best-response (-Nash), or by requiring almost all agents to be in best-response. We study these approximated notions of PNE for different topologies, including graphs with unbounded treewidth, like grids. This makes the problem computationnally very challenging and requires the comparison and use of several algorithmic solutions. Our results reveal surprisingly good asymptotic properties, tempering the claim that individual stability is not a relevant notion for large GG. Finally, as approximated PNE provide various tradeoffs between stability and social utility maximization, we propose an approach to construct a minimal-size e-covering of all feasible Pareto-dominant tradeoffs.",

Alternatively, the job may be executed without any query, but in that case its workload is equal to a given upper bound. This assumption is motivated for instance in applications like code optimization, or file compression. We study the problem of minimizing the overall energy consumption for executing all the jobs in their time windows.

Our goal is to find a schedule respecting the release dates and the deadlines of the jobs so that the total energy consumption is minimized. While most previous works have studied the preemptive case of the problem, where a job may be interrupted and resumed later, we focus on the non-preemptive case where once a job starts its execution, it has to continue until its completion without any interruption. We propose improved approximation algorithms for particular instances of the multiprocessor non-preemptive speed-scaling problem.",

They considered two different types of communications: the flows induced by data exchanges during computations and the flows related to Input/Output operations. Rather than taking into account these communications explicitly, they restrict the possible allocations of a job by external topological constraints. In their work, jobs are considered to be rigid: a job requires a specific number of machines in order to be executed. Here, we first adopt the same framework for the platform and the aforementioned topological constraints. We show that there is no polynomial time approximation algorithm under the rigid setting with ratio smaller than 3/2, unless P = NP. Then, we focus on the malleable setting. We show that in the proportional-malleable setting, where the work of every job remains constant \u2026",

We then consider bidirectional ring networks and investigate two problems: 1) the spectrum assignment problem under the assumption that each demand is routed along a single fixed path (e.g., the shortest path), and 2) the general case of the RSA problem whereby a routing decision along the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions must be made jointly with spectrum allocation. Based on insights from multiprocessor scheduling theory, we derive the complexity of the two problems and develop new constant-ratio approximation algorithms with a ratio that is strictly smaller than the best known ratio to date.",

Nevertheless, if the number of required machines is no more than $\\frack2$ then we propose a -approximation algorithm for the contiguous case and a -approximation for the non-contiguous case, where  (resp. ) denotes the \u2026",

Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption when both the preemption and the migration of jobs are allowed. We propose a new algorithm based on a compact linear programming formulation. Our method approaches the value of the optimal solution within any desired accuracy for a large set of continuous power functions. Furthermore, we develop a faster combinatorial algorithm based on flows for standard power functions and jobs whose density is lower bounded by a small constant. Finally, we extend and analyze the AVerage Rate (AVR) online algorithm in the heterogeneous setting.",

            "Abstract": "Power management aims in reducing the energy consumed by computer systems while maintaining a good level of performance. One of the mechanisms used to save energy is the shut-down mechanism which puts the system into a sleep state when it is idle. No energy is consumed in this state, but a fixed amount of energy is required for a transition from the sleep state to the active state which is equal to L times the energy required for the execution of a unit-time task. In this paper, we focus on the off-line version of this problem where a set of unit-time tasks with release dates and deadlines have to be scheduled in order to minimize the overall consumed energy during the idle periods of the schedule. Here we focus on the case where the tasks have agreeable deadlines. For the single processor case, an O (n 3) algorithm has been proposed in Gururaj et al.(2010) for unit-time tasks and arbitrary L.

We study the problem of optimizing the makespan under the constraint that the obtained schedule is a (pure) Nash equilibrium, i.e. a schedule in which no agent has incentive to unilaterally change her strategy (link). We consider a relaxation of the notion of equilibrium by considering \u03b1-approximate Nash equilibria where an agent does not have sufficient incentive (w.r.t. the value of \u03b1) to unilaterally change her strategy.

We completely 21 resolve this question by showing that Minimum Multistage Perfect Matching (Min-MPM) does 22 not admit an n 1\u2212-approximation, even on bipartite instances with only two time steps. 23 Motivated by this negative result, we go on to consider two variations of the problem. In 24 Metric Minimum Multistage Perfect Matching problem (Metric-Min-MPM) we are promised 25 that edge weights in each time step satisfy the triangle inequality. We show that this problem 26 admits a 3-approximation when the number of time steps is 2 or 3. On the other hand, we 27 show that even the metric case is APX-hard already for 2 time steps. We then consider the 28 complementary maximization version of the problem, Maximum Multistage Perfect Matching 29 problem (Max-MPM), where we seek to maximize the total profit of all selected edges plus the 30 total number of non-exchanged edges. We show that Max-MPM is also APX-hard, but admits 31 a constant factor approximation \u2026",

No energy is consumed in this state, but a fixed amount of energy, equal to L, is required for a transition from the sleep state to the active state.

            "Abstract": "In classical combinatorial optimization, the quality of a solution is often measured with a single objective function while, in practice, a decision is rarely made with only one criterion. Then, several conflicting criteria are necessary to measure the quality of a solution. This is the case in a number of areas including transportation, communication, biology, finance, and also computer science [1]. Multiobjective combinatorial optimization (MCO) arises in situations where at least two objective functions are simultaneously taken into account. This framework offers more freedom, and models coming from MCO better fit to real situations than those being from classical combinatorial optimization. Of course, this higher freedom has a price which often turns out to be a higher degree in complexity. In monocriterion optimization, the notion of optimality is clear while it is not the case when multiple objectives are considered. Conflicts between the competing criteria lead to a frequent situation where no feasible solution meet optimality for all objectives. Instead of a unique and ideal solution, a set of incomparable alternatives dominating all the others acts as an optimum. Many years before the emergence of computer science, Vilfredo Pareto gave a characterization of these dominating solutions known today as Pareto optima or Pareto set. The Pareto set captures the notion of trade-off and its computation is problematic for mainly two reasons:\u2022 it is typically exponential in size; and\u2022 computing one of these Pareto optima is often NP-hard.Some problems, known to be polynomially solvable in the monocriterion optimization framework, become NP-hard when two (or \u2026",

The quality of the derived solutions is measured using the worst case analysis for two global optimality criteria, namely the maximum arrival date of a packet at its destination (or makespan) and the average arrival date of the packets at their destinations.We consider the setting where n packets, each one having a size (or length) and a destination, are released from the same source.

For the nonpreemptive case, we prove that a naive implementation of list scheduling produces a schedule that can be m times far from the optimum, where m is the number of processors (equivalently, WDM channels).

The objective of every selfish task is the minimization of its completion time while the aim of the mechanism is the minimization of the sum of weighted completion times. For the model without payments, we prove that there is no -approximate deterministic truthful algorithm and no -approximate randomized truthful algorithm when the tasks\u2019 lengths are private data. When both the lengths and the weights are private data, we show that it is not possible to get an -approximate deterministic truthful algorithm for any . In order to overcome these negative results we introduce a new concept that we call preventive preemption. Using this concept, we are able to propose a simple optimal truthful algorithm with no payments for the single-machine problem when \u2026",

For this problem, there exists an optimal polynomial-time algorithm which uses as a black box an algorithm for linear programming. Here, we formulate the problem as a convex program and we propose a combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm which is based on finding maximum flows. Our algorithm runs in  time, where n is the number of jobs, U is the range of all possible values of processors\u2019 speeds divided by the desired accuracy and f(n) is the time needed for computing a maximum flow in a layered graph with O(n) vertices.",

A feasible schedule is an assignment of the tasks over time, such that the communication delays are taken into account.

Testing in such a context is made by machines that need to be often calibrated. Given that calibration costs, it is important to study policies minimizing the calibration cost while performing all the necessary tests. We focus on the single-machine setting and we extend the model proposed by Bender et al. by considering that the jobs have arbitrary processing times and that the preemption of jobs is allowed. For this case, we propose an optimal polynomial time algorithm. Then, we study the case where there are several types of calibrations with different lengths and costs. We first prove that the problem becomes NP-hard for arbitrary processing times even when the preemption of the jobs is allowed. Finally, we focus on the case of unit-time jobs and we show that a more general problem, where the recalibration of the machine is not instantaneous but takes time, can be solved in polynomial time.",

In this paper, we provide a new way of proving non-approximability results which relies on the existence of a small size good approximating set (ie it holds even in the unlikely event of P= NP). This method may be used foseveral problems but here we illustrate it for a multi-criteria version of the traveling salesman problem with distances one and two (T SP (1, 2)).

Instead of proceeding in a problem-by-problem basis, we identify a class of multiobjective optimization problems possessing a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for computing an \u03b5-approximate Pareto curve. This class contains a set of problems whose Pareto curve can be computed via a simple pseudo-polynomial dynamic program for which the objective and transition functions satisfy some, easy to verify, arithmetical conditions.

The bounded max-vertex/edge-coloring problems ask for such a coloring minimizing the sum of all color classes' weights. These problems generalize the well known max-coloring problems by taking into account the number of available resources (i.e., the cardinality of color classes) in practical applications. In this paper we present complexity results and approximation algorithms for the bounded max-coloring problems on general graphs, bipartite graphs and trees.",

            "Abstract": "We study a recently introduced generalization of the Vertex Cover (VC) problem, called Power Vertex Cover (PVC). In this problem, each edge of the input graph is supplied with a positive integer demand. A solution is an assignment of (power) values to the vertices, so that for each edge one of its endpoints has value as high as the demand, and the total sum of power values assigned is minimized. We investigate how this generalization affects the parameterized complexity of Vertex Cover. On the positive side, when parameterized by the value of the optimal P, we give an O*(1.274^P)-time branching algorithm (O* is used to hide factors polynomial in the input size), and also an O*(1.325^P)-time algorithm for the more general asymmetric case of the problem, where the demand of each edge may differ for its two endpoints. When the parameter is the number of vertices k that receive positive value, we give O*(1.619^k) and O*(k^k)-time algorithms for the symmetric and asymmetric cases respectively, as well as a simple quadratic kernel for the asymmetric case. We also show that PVC becomes significantly harder than classical VC when parameterized by the graph's treewidth t. More specifically, we prove that unless the ETH is false, there is no n^o(t)-time algorithm for PVC. We give a method to overcome this hardness by designing an FPT approximation scheme which gives a (1+epsilon)-approximation to the optimal solution in time FPT in parameters t and 1/epsilon.",

We prove that the SWA problem is NP-hard for both the preemptive and the non-preemptive cases. Furthermore, we propose two efficient approximation algorithms. The first is for the preemptive case and it is based on a natural decomposition of the problem to the classical multiprocessor scheduling and open-shop problems. For the non-preemptive case, we prove that a naive implementation of list scheduling produces a schedule that can be m times far from the optimum, where m is the number of processors (equivalently, WDM channels). Finally, we give a more refined version of list scheduling and we prove it to be a 2-approximation algorithm for both the off-line and the on-line contexts.",

In this paper we extend this result to both, planar and bipartite cases.       In particular we prove that the construction problem for perfect matchings in planar graphs       is as difficult as in the case of planar cubic graphs like it is known to be the case for the famous Map Four-Coloring problem. Moreover we prove that the existence and construction problems for perfect matchings in bipartite graphs are as difficult as the existence and construction problems for a weighted perfect matching of O(m) weight in a cubic bipartite graph.",

The goal is to minimize the makespan of the schedule, ie the time at which the last job finishes its execution, without violating a given energy budget. This situation finds applications in computer devices whose lifetime depends on a limited battery efficiency. In order to handle the energy consumption we use the energy model introduced in [Yao et al., FOCS'95], which captures the intuitive idea that the higher is the processor's speed the higher is the energy consumption. We propose a (2-1/m)-approximation algorithm improving the best known poly-log (m)-approximation algorithm for the problem [Pruhs et al., TOCS 2008], where m is the number of the processors. We also extend the simple idea used for the above problem, in order to propose a generalized framework that finds \u2026",

The processing time and the energy consumption of the jobs are machine and speed dependent. Also, every job is subject to a machine-dependent release date. Firstly, we aim to find a non-preemptive schedule of the jobs minimizing the average weighted completion time plus energy, and we propose a randomized approximation algorithm that we derandomize obtaining a deterministic approximation algorithm. We then consider the budget variant of the problem where the objective is to minimize the average completion time while the total energy consumption does not exceed a given budget.",

Our algorithm runs in  time, where  is the number of jobs,  is the range of all possible values of processors' speeds divided by the desired accuracy and  is the complexity of computing a maximum flow in a layered graph with O(n) vertices.

These algorithms use repeated maximum-flow computations that allow the partition of the set of jobs into subsets in which all the jobs are executed at the same speed. The optimality of these algorithms is based on a series of technical lemmas showing that this partition and the corresponding speeds lead to the minimization of the energy consumption. In this paper, we show that both the algorithms and their analysis can be greatly simplified. In order to do this, we formulate the problem as a convex cost flow problem in an appropriate flow network. Furthermore, we show that our approach is useful to solve other problems in the dynamic speed-scaling setting. As an example, we consider the preemptive open-shop speed-scaling problem and we propose a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Many systems have to be maintained while the underlying constraints, costs and/or profits change over time. Although the state of a system may evolve during time, a non-negligible transition cost is incured for transitioning from one state to another. In order to model such situations, Gupta et al. (ICALP 2014) and Eisenstat et al. (ICALP 2014) introduced a multistage model where the input is a sequence of instances (one for each time step), and the goal is to find a sequence of solutions (one for each time step) that are both (i) near optimal for each time step and (ii) as stable as possible. We focus on the multistage version of the Knapsack problem where we are given a time horizon t=1,2,...,T, and a sequence of knapsack instances I_1,I_2,...,I_T, one for each time step, defined on a set of n objects. In every time step t we have to choose a feasible knapsack S_t of I_t, which gives a knapsack profit. To measure the stability/similarity of two consecutive solutions S_t and S_{t+1}, we identify the objects for which the decision, to be picked or not, remains the same in S_t and S_{t+1}, giving a transition profit. We are asked to produce a sequence of solutions S_1,S_2,...,S_T so that the total knapsack profit plus the overall transition profit is maximized. We propose a PTAS for the Multistage Knapsack problem. Then, we prove that there is no FPTAS for the problem even in the case where T=2, unless P=NP. Furthermore, we give a pseudopolynomial time algorithm for the case where the number of steps is bounded by a fixed constant and we show that otherwise the problem remains NP-hard even in the case where all the weights, profits and capacities are 0 or 1.",

We assume that the time-slot at which each error will occur is not known in advance but, for every error, there exists an uncertainty area during which the error will take place. In order to find if the error occurs in a specific time-slot, it is necessary to issue a query to it. In this work, we study two problems: (i) the error-query scheduling problem, whose aim is to reveal enough error-free slots with the minimum number of queries, and (ii) the lexicographic error-query scheduling problem where we seek the earliest error-free slots with the minimum number of queries. We consider both the off-line and the on-line versions of the above problems. In the former, the whole instance and its characteristics are known in advance and we give a polynomial-time algorithm for the error-query scheduling problem. In the latter, the adversary has the power to decide, in an on-line way, the time-slot of appearance for each error. We propose then both lower bounds and algorithms whose competitive ratios asymptotically match these lower bounds.",

            "Abstract": "This volume contains the papers presented at the 14th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2015) held during June 29\u2013July 1, 2015, in Paris. SEA is an international forum for researchers in the area of design, analysis, and experimental evaluation and engineering of algorithms, as well as in different aspects of computational optimization and its applications. The preceding symposia were held in Riga, Monte Verita, Rio de Janeiro, Santorini, Menorca, Rome, Cape Cod, Dortmund, Ischia, Crete, Bordeaux, Rome, and Copenhagen. In response to the call for papers, we received 76 submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least three reviewers. The submissions were mainly judged on originality, technical quality, and relevance to the topics of the conference. On the basis of the reviews and on extensive electronic discussions, the Program Committee (PC) decided to accept 30 papers \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We propose a two-step algorithm that efficiently constructs a schedule of minimum makespan for the precedence multiprocessor constrained scheduling problem in the presence of hierarchical communications and task duplication. We consider the case where all the tasks of the precedence graph have unit execution times, and the multiprocessor is composed by an unbounded number of clusters with two identical processors each. The communication delay for transferring the data between a predecessor-task and a successor-task executed on processors of different clusters take a unit of time, while this cost becomes null whenever these tasks are executed on the same processor or on different processors of the same cluster. The first step of the algorithm computes for each task an earliest starting time of any of its copies and constructs a critical graph whereas the second step uses the obtained critical graph and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We study various discrete nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems in an online learning framework. In the first part, we address the question of whether there are negative results showing that getting a vanishing (or even vanishing approximate) regret is computational hard. We provide a general reduction showing that many (min-max) polynomial time solvable problems not only do not have a vanishing regret, but also no vanishing approximation $\\alpha$-regret, for some $\\alpha$ (unless $NP=BPP$). Then, we focus on a particular min-max problem, the min-max version of the vertex cover problem which is solvable in polynomial time in the offline case. The previous reduction proves that there is no $(2-\\epsilon)$-regret online algorithm, unless Unique Game is in $BPP$; we prove a matching upper bound providing an online algorithm based on the online gradient descent method. Then, we turn our attention to online learning algorithms that are based on an offline optimization oracle that, given a set of instances of the problem, is able to compute the optimum static solution. We show that for different nonlinear discrete optimization problems, it is strongly $NP$-hard to solve the offline optimization oracle, even for problems that can be solved in polynomial time in the static case (e.g. min-max vertex cover, min-max perfect matching, etc.). On the positive side, we present an online algorithm with vanishing regret that is based on the follow the perturbed leader algorithm for a generalized knapsack problem.",
