A growing number of teachers/researchers propose the incorporation of educational games (or serious games) in the teaching of computer programming with the aim of reinforcing instinctive motivation through challenging students, piquing their curiosity and providing them with a sense of control and imagination.

As a proof of concept, the design and implementation of an SG for learning OOP utilizing Greenfoot and a survey on the perceptions of graduates that had been introduced to SGs programming with Greenfoot in the context of a relevant Master course are presented. The results show that Greenfoot, although not developed for this purpose, can be utilized both as a tool for introducing novices to (serious) games programming and as a tool for developing SGs.",

            "Abstract": "Pair Programming (PP), as an element of Extreme Programming, has a long history in the software industry. The many benefits of PP are also considered important in the teaching of programming. Collaboration, sharing of knowledge and skills, as well as easier error detection and correction, are some of the factors that assist pairs of students in implementing programs. More recently, specially designed educational programming environments have given rise to Distributed Pair Programming (DPP), where pairs of students apply PP remotely anywhere and at anytime. A number of plugins for Eclipse IDE were built to support DPP in Computer Science Education. Although they cover the basic requirements of DPP, they could not address drawbacks of PP, such as unequal contributions from each member of the student pair.Most of the research findings concern PP and a few studies investigated DPP. Studies in the field of DPP aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of DPP in student performance, DPP versus solo programming or DPP versus co-located PP (Duque and Bravo 2008; Hanks 2008) and other studies tested productivity and code quality between DPP and PP and concluded that virtual and co-located teams can produce comparable software. Researches on pair formation and pair compatibility in DPP are few.",

            "Abstract": "The initial stage of the learning programming process is an arduous task. Novice students have to simultaneously learn the syntax of a programming language, understand the algorithmic logic that each program is based on as well as comprehend the basic concepts of the programming principles. The problems students are faced with become even greater when teachers employ complex environments with minimum graphical facilities instead of user\u2010friendly educational programming environments. At the same time, constant technological developments indicate that the global market will continue to require highly skilled computer programmers; thus, the usage of advanced educational environments to properly train future professionals is essential. This is one of the reasons why a new type of technology called Serious Games has started raising great interest in educational settings. Using serious games in education combines increased motivation of students with the incorporation of course materials within the games\u2019 tasks. The aim of this paper is to apply an educational Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) named CMX in university settings and evaluate its efficiency in successfully teaching programming elements while entertaining and engaging students in an interesting environment. The game is applied in two groups of students already familiar with basic computer programming concepts and it has been populated with units of learning regarding arrays in the C programming language. Both groups engage in and interact with the game\u2019s environment, Senseis, tasks and other players and we record their behaviours \u2026",

One reason that drives developers to rely on the dynamic features of a scripting language is to enable effortless functionality extensions. The aim of this work is twofold: initially, we (a) provide an overview of all possible dynamically extendible code patterns (i.e., either through method invocation, or object instantiation) and (b) investigate their frequency by mining the code base of ten milestone PHP projects to identify the subset of patterns that developers actually use. Next, in order to investigate whether the expected flexibility of these patterns stands in practice, we examine if code chunks \u2026",

However, empirical studies that investigate the true impact of educational games on teaching and learning programming, especially to small aged students, are limited. This article presents the results of a pilot study that utilized the educational game Run Marco for teaching basic programming concepts to primary school students. Students\u2019 performance was studied through specially designed worksheets, while their acceptance of the intervention was evaluated through a questionnaire that was based on the principles of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).

The provision of broadband Internet access gave rise to Distributed Pair Programming (DPP) enabling two programmers to collaborate remotely. To gain insight into the benefits of DPP, we performed an empirical study on an object-oriented programming course where 62 students carried out assignments through a DPP platform. The goal of the study is to investigate, in the context of DPP, whether prior programming skills (assessed at the level of student, his or her partner and pair) and pair compatibility are related to student performance. To further examine the effect of DPP on learning outcomes, we have studied whether a pair\u2019s performance on DPP assignments is related to the students\u2019 grade. The findings indicate that the student\u2019s actual \u2026",

Karel and objectKarel share the same GUI and functionalities, and thus they constitute a multi-paradigm environment. The design of the environment was based on the extended research carried out the last decades regarding the teaching of programming to novices and is the main focus of the paper. The potential uses of the environments for teaching programming concepts and techniques to various audiences and different learning contexts, as well as experiences of using them so far, are also presented.",

In this article, a proposal of a serious games design framework (GDF) that aims to assist designers and special education teachers and professionals develop successful SGs for people with ID and people with ASD, is presented. In order to create this GDF, an extraction of SGs design guidelines from existing SGs for people with ID and ASD and a comparative analysis with common GDF that are used for designing SGs in general was conducted. The proposed design guidelines and the conclusions of the comparative analysis of existing general purpose GDFs were used as a tool to design a computer-based SG that aims to improve independent living skills of people with ID and people with ASD.

            "Abstract": "Pair programming (PP) has become popular in the research and software industry as well as being studied for a number of years in computer science courses with positive findings on student performance and attitudes. Advantages of PP reported in the literature are satisfaction, design quality, code productivity, team building, and communication. More recently, distributed pair programming (DPP), which enables two programmers to work remotely, has also attracted the interest of researchers and instructors. The difference between DPP and PP is that the former allows geographically distributed teams to collaborate and share program code. Such collaboration is, thus, only feasible if an underlying infrastructure supports all necessary interactions. The integrated development environments (IDEs) for DPP should cover the basic requirements for remote software development as well as address common PP problems, such as unequal contributions from each member of a pair, feedback during DPP sessions, and communication problems. This paper presents the findings of a study on student performance and attitudes towards DPP in an object-oriented programming (OOP) course. The factors examined were student performance, in terms of assignment grade, exam grade and implementation time in relation to students\u2019 programming experience, and confidence, as well as student attitudes towards DPP, i.e., the feelgood factor, working alone or with a partner, and the perception of their partner\u2019s technical competence. The results suggest that a students\u2019 performance is associated with their programming experience and confidence in programming \u2026",

An evaluation study of a DPP system that supports collaboration scripts was conducted over one semester of a computer science course. Seventy-four students participated in the study and used the DPP model to solve programming assignments in pairs, rather than individually. Students were divided into two cohorts in order to examine how best to distribute programming tasks to students, to maximize learning outcomes. The results suggest that while the use of DPP improves pass rates and gets positive feedback from students, the use of collaboration scripts yields equal task contributions from each of the student pair. For a small number of students, overall performance was improved by the adaptive assignment of \u2026",

Extended research has been carried out, which focuses on: \u0192 proposing and/or evaluating teaching approaches (Bennedsen & Caspersen, 2004; Brusilovsky et al., 1997; Chang et al., 2001; Nevison & Wells, 2003; Proulx et al., 2002), such as objects first\u00b5, model first\u00b5, and using coding patterns, \u0192 devising educational programming environments and tools (Allen et al., 2002; Buck & Stucki, 2000; Cooper et al., 2000; K| lling et al., 2003; Sanders & Dorn, 2003; Xinogalos et al., 2006a), and \u0192 studying students\u00b7 understanding and misconceptions of object oriented programming (Carter. & Fowler, 1998; Fleury, 2000; Fleury, 2001; Holland et al., 1997; Ragonis & Ben Ari, 2005a; Truong & Bancroft, 2004; Xinogalos et al., 2006b). In most cases this research has been carried out with the form of a pilot/empirical study or an experiment in the context of an OOP course. There is little evidence of evaluating an OOP course as a whole: teaching approach (es) used; sequence of concepts presented and organization of lessons; programming environment (s) and educational tools used; students\u00b7 difficulties and misconceptions recorded and didactical situations/activities for dealing with them. Consequently, the problem for those struggling to design an effective OOP course for their students remains.In this chapter we present the long term evaluation and refinement of an OO Design and Programming course, which was initially exclusively based on the well known environment of BlueJ, the book Objects First with Java: A \u2026",

One of the most important instructional problems that are related to OOP is the fact that the object-oriented technique for the development of programs is difficult for students, since it is more abstract than the technique for structured programming and more exacting in the processes of analysis and design. Furthermore, students are not\u2013usually-motivated through the use of concepts before they are asked to consider their implementation. What is needed, in order to alleviate the problem, is to design hands-on activities for motivating students with OOP concepts before they are asked to use these concepts for implementing programs.

These suggestions are based on our experience from using the hands-on activities of the didactic microworld objectKarel [1].",

            "Abstract": "Object oriented programming (OOP) is a complex domain in the education field and requires proper technological underpinning for the facilitation of the process. However, the vast variety of available programming environments makes the selection of the most efficient technology that will cover students\u2019 needs and will lead to the teachers\u2019 desired learning outcomes a significant challenge. These technologies, such as Educational Programming Environments and Programming Microworlds, are often applied on OOP courses in order to underpin the process and help students develop internal incentives, thus foster the feeling of challenge, curiosity, active control and imagination. However, students of the 21st century are growing up in a fully digital world and therefore learn and react accordingly. Alongside the growth of the Internet, high speed access and virtual communities have contributed to a new trend development called online gaming. Therefore, computer games can be considered an appropriate means to deliver knowledge to students of most courses and increase their motivation to learn. A term that is often used when referring to computer games incorporated in the learning experience is \u201cserious games\u201d, and they can involve one or multiple players. Serious games have a higher learning value when they are used in courses that consider critical thinking, group work and decision making as essential to be developed. Therefore, it is the paper\u2019s initial intent to examine representative examples of commonly used technologies in OOP education and to derive their most prominent features that support students\u2019 successful learning \u2026",

Students might be able to write a piece of code in an OOP language, usually Java, but their conceptual grasp of object-oriented concepts seems to be limited. This leads to poor implementation of object-oriented concepts and inability to take advantage of the strengths of OOP. Various teaching approaches and specially designed programming environments have been proposed for supporting the teaching and learning of OOP. In this paper, we present our findings regarding students\u2019 conceptual grasp of OOP concepts in two distinct educational programming environments: BlueJ and objectKarel. Their special feature in comparison with similar environments is that they are highly interactive.",

This has also brought forth new knowledge that should be incorporated and new learning strategies must be adopted for the successful teaching of all sub-domains. For example, computer programming is a vital knowledge area within computer science with constantly changing curriculum and its teaching remains a difficult endeavour. On the other hand, students start from a very early age to interact with computers through games and other entertaining multimedia software. Therefore, they seem to be keen on environments with impressive special effects and graphical interfaces where they interact with the environment\u2019s elements. In response, teachers are trying to connect computer programming learning with computer operations that students are familiar with, which does not include textual editors for programming lines of code with no other interaction. Educational games used in computer programming courses are considered to benefit learning, because they motivate students towards actively participating and interacting with the game\u2019s activities. Thus, we have developed an educational multiplayer game that aims to further enhance computer programming education by addressing occurring problems. This process, however, requires proper planning during the design of educational games, and thus the availability of adequate guidelines that include all characteristics that should be incorporated in such games.

However, MMORPG require significant amounts of resources, such    as bandwidth, RAM and CPU capacity to support learning. In this paper, we    propose a new methodology to achieve monitoring and optimization of the load    balancing, so that the essential resources for the proper execution of an    educational MMORPG for computer programming can be foreseen and bestowed    without overloading the system. Moreover, we present an educational MMORPG    called CMX, which aims to teach computer programming through interactive    activities and role-playing.

The most important changes were:(i) the features of BlueJ were used more carefully, while the main method was taught much earlier in the course (4th lesson), so as to avoid specific difficulties related to object instantiation and the dynamic aspects of OOP;(ii) students started by making small changes to existing code, but soon enough they started creating small projects from scratch in order to apply the principles of good class design and Java presented to them and develop problem solving skills;(iii) two lessons were devoted to ArrayLists and arrays.",

People with Intellectual Disability (ID) and people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face more difficulties in this transition due to their limitations in daily living skills. Serious Games (SGs) are considered as a promising tool that can support the acquisition of such skills. The aim of this paper is to present the design of a new set of mini games that aim to support people with ID and ASD in acquiring skills for independent living, such as self-care, transportation and safety. Participatory design is considered important for designing serious games for the specific target group and in this sense it is our aim to incorporate anyone interested in the design process of the new game.

The main benefits of PHP are its low learning curve and the rich variety of dynamic features that it offers. These benefits have contributed towards the development of a large community of programmers around PHP, which in turn created a vast ecosystem of applications and frameworks. In this study we have empirically investigated ten famous PHP frameworks/applications and over 240 MLOC in order to explore their internal structure. More specifically, we present some demographics on method invocation and object instantiation patterns, empowered by the dynamic nature of the PHP language. To present the results we employ statistical methods inspired by ecology. In particular, we explore the diversity and dominance of these patterns \u2026",

Our goal was to examine students' perceptions of computer mediated scripted collaboration and furthermore to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive role switching in students' participation. The study showed that students' attitude toward distributed pair programming and scripted collaboration was quite positive, however they prefer to distribute tasks by themselves which led half of them not to follow system's suggestions for role distribution.",

The extensive research that has been carried out in the last decades regarding novice programmers has shown that an important factor of these difficulties is the teaching approach used. This approach, know as the classic approach, is based on a general purpose programming language, a professional programming environment and a set of problems from the area of number and symbol processing. In this paper, we present the difficulties encountered by students when they are taught programming with the classic approach. The difficulties presented are general and are not related to the programming paradigm (procedural or object-oriented). Next we review the various approaches to teaching programming to novices and the educational tools that have been developed in their context.",

            "Abstract": "The choice of the first programming language (FPL) has been a controversial issue for several decades. Nearly everyone agrees that the FPL is important and affects students\u2019 subsequent education on programming. The study presented in this article investigates the suitability of various C-like and Pascal-like programming languages as a FPL. Students from three Universities express their perceptions on the FPL through a specially designed questionnaire. The students had been introduced to programming using different FPLs and having experience on more than one language and formulated two distinct groups: a group introduced to programming with a C-like and another with a Pascal-like language. The statistical analysis of the data collected showed that the choice of the FPL does not have a deep impact on difficulties that novices may experience when learning the basics of programming. However, this result was recorded in the context of three distinct programming courses that were positively evaluated by students in relation to their content, organization and quality. Consequently, this study indicates that the overall quality of the course and the instructors have a great impact on a smooth introduction to programming no matter what the FPL is.",

            "Abstract": "Computer science is gradually changing, evolving and adapting according to the needs of each time period by incorporating the technological developments available. However, despite the occurring changes and the current progress in the domain, computer programming is still a vital chapter within computer science, and its teaching remains a difficult endeavour. On the other hand, students have changed the way with which they learn, interact with and search for knowledge. They spend significant amounts of their everyday lives from a very young age interacting with the computers by playing games. Thus, they are used to environments with impressive special effects and graphical interfaces where they have full control of the situation and interact with the environment\u2019s elements. Therefore, today\u2019s teachers are trying to connect computer programming learning with students\u2019 everyday usage of the computer, which does not include simple textual editors for programming lines of code with no other interaction functionalities. Hence, teachers face the challenge of incorporating environments that are similar to students\u2019 existing mentality and of creating tasks and assignments that can be executed within these environments and can provide students with the necessary programming knowledge and skills. A number of software solutions were developed towards facing the aforementioned difficulties. They can be classified into three main categories, namely educational programming environments, microworlds and educational games. Educational games used in computer programming courses are considered to present added value, due to their \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The tremendous popularity of mobile computing and Android in particular has attracted millions of developers who see opportunities for building their own start-ups. As a consequence computer science students express an increasing interest into the related technology of Java development for Android applications. Android projects are complex by nature and relatively large software products, while their development calls for the application of established software engineering practices and tools.Computer science and information technology curricula include software engineering as a key knowledge area (ACM 2013), and as a result, most computer science-related departments offer at least one \u201cconventional\u201d software engineering course. By conventional we mean that in most cases, the introduced concepts are exemplified on either desktop applications standing individually on a personal computer and recently on web applications employing server and/or client side development. To the best of our knowledge, there are very few courses that introduce software engineering concepts to a mobile software development course. At the same time, software development for particular platforms is often perceived and taught as a purely technological skill with no direct connections to software engineering. The consequence is that even experienced mobile application programmers do not embrace or apply software engineering practices. Moreover, the lure of Android development can serve as a vehicle for conveying software engineering concepts to computer science students in an attractive way. All these issues have resulted in interesting proposals \u2026",

            "Abstract": "People with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) are those who have low intellectual abilities and limitations in behavioural and social functioning. ID can be observed in a very early stage in their lives, while every person with ID has individual characteristics. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a mental disorder that causes issues in social, communicational and emotional behaviour. Many people with ASD have high intellectual abilities, whereas there are others with cognitive disabilities. Therapists have identified several intervention methods to provide aid and teach people with ID and ASD several skills. The traditional methods include special educational programmes, individual or team sessions with therapists and team bonding activities. However, the technological advancements have allowed therapists, organizations and researchers invent new intervention methods. Such methods include software solutions and Serious Games (SGs). In this study, the state-of-the-art in SGs that have already been developed is explored. The findings are categorized based on the limitations they try toaddress that fall into two categories, namely intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour. SGs falling in the adaptive behavior category are classified according to the categories of skills they aim to promote, namely conceptual, socialand practical skills. Finally, the SGs presented are classified according to the specific  skills (i.e. language and literacy, daily living) they aim to improve. SGs are comparatively analysed taking into account their target group, specific purpose, type/platform and evaluation results. Based on this analysis conclusions are drawn that can assist \u2026",

Such an example is the gradual use of educational games, which seem to be an exceptional means to motivate and engage students in ways that will make learning more challenging and interesting for them. However, although educational games are a very interesting tool that could be used in education, an interesting challenge that should be addressed is the identification of all the ways students' progress and results can be measured for examination. This way, there is a high demand for accountability regarding the measurement and analysis of enriched game based learning activities or game-based learning analytics (GBLA). This demand is especially highlighted in one of the most difficult areas of Computer Science, which is computer programming education. In this \u2026",
