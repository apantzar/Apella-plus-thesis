            "Abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) reconsiders the host-centric Internet paradigm with a view to information or content-based identifiers and where multicast data delivery is the norm. However, Wi-Fi, the predominant means of local wireless connectivity today, but also 3G and 4G technologies, are known to suffer from poor multicast performance. In this work, we consider exploiting content awareness, which is inherent in ICN architectures, to improve wireless multicast delivery by means of relaying. In particular, given that different types of content have different performance requirements, we provide a multi-objective optimization formulation for the problem of activating appropriate subsets of users as relays and deciding on their transmission rates, optimizing for different criteria, such as reliability, performance, and energy cost on a per-content item basis. Based on that, we propose a heuristic algorithm to select \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) appears as the de-facto standard for local area wireless connectivity. Driven from their ease of use and low cost of deployment, the number of Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) rapidly increases in urban areas. This fact leads to interference in Wi-Fi channels, since there is a small number of non overlapping ones. Considering the above situation, information about AP deployment and configuration would be extremely important for wireless providers. Given the appropriate information, providers could optimize the configuration and maximize throughput of 802.11-based Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs).Taking into account the situation depicted above the Wi-Fi alliance proposed a new standard-the 802.11 k standard. This new standard aims to provide client feedback to WLAN access points. This feedback includes the statistics that clients collect while sensing the wireless environment at their location. 802.11 k also involves sensing from the APs in order to gather information about the wireless channels. Information gathered from all network entities should be used for roaming decisions, transmit power control or channel selection. Unfortunately, 802.11 k must be supported both from clients and APs and therefore it will be a while before its impact will be left.",

While this shift towards information centric networking has been clearly demonstrated by the proliferation of file sharing and content delivery applications, it has not been reflected in a corresponding shift in network architecture. To address this issue, we designed MultiCache, an information-centric architecture aiming at the efficient use of network resources. MultiCache is based on two primitives: multicast and caching. It exploits overlay multicast as a means for content delivery and takes advantage of multicast forwarding information to locate, in an anycast fashion, nearby caches that have been themselves fed via multicast. We evaluate MultiCache against a widespread file sharing application (BitTorrent) with respect to both network resource \u2026",

Congestion control in such an environment primarily aims at enhancing the cumulative TCP throughput over the available paths, while preserving TCP-friendliness by fairly sharing the available bandwidth with single-path TCP flows in each path. While most existing multipath congestion control algorithms fulfill the TCP-friendliness objective in their steady state, their throughput convergence latency is high, rendering them ineffective for short-lived flows. We have proposed Normalized Multipath Congestion Control (NMCC), an MPTCP congestion control algorithm that achieves TCP-friendliness faster, by normalizing the growth of individual sub-flow throughput rather than the throughput itself. As NMCC can become unfriendly when it experiences sparse congestion events, in this paper we introduce the extended NMCC \u2026",

In this paper we argue that service discovery can be greatly enhanced in terms of efficiency (regarding service discoverability and energy consumption), by piggybacking service information in routing layer messages. Thus, a node requesting a service in addition to discovering that service, it is simultaneously informed of the route to the service provider. We extend the zone routing protocol in order to encapsulate service information in its routing messages and through extensive simulations we prove the superiority of our routing layer-enhanced service discovery scheme against an application layer-based flooding scheme.",

CC and WLAN systems however raise a multitude of performance issues, since environmental conditions and terrestrial obstructions and reflections lead to high and unpredictable error rates. CC and WLAN systems mostly share the characteristics of traditional wireless systems (satellite and terrestrial microwave), such as high error rates. They also share some of the characteristics of wired systems, such as low physical layer propagation delays. As a result, in order to improve their performance, a synthesis of techniques for enhancing the performance of both wired and wireless links is required, that will also take into account the requirements of the TCP/IP protocol suite. In this chapter we present the characteristics and performance limitations of various existing and emerging wireless systems and survey a wide range of approaches for enhancing TCP/IP performance over such links. Although mobility is inherently associated with CC systems, the additional problems that it induces, such as communication pauses whenever mobile devices move between cells, are covered in a separate chapter.",

We then model this framework as a graphical game, which is a special case of a non-cooperative game in which the payoff of a node is influenced only by a subset of its neighbors. We discuss two payoff models that may be used depending on the application: The first focuses only on transmitters and assigns by default a zero payoff to the receivers and the second models a non-zero payoff to both transmitters and receivers. We then present a distributed scheme that finds an efficient Nash Equilibrium (NE) under both payoff models. We evaluate its performance through extensive simulations showing that the algorithm converges fast to a NE, in a number of rounds that is proportional \u2026",

CR relies on devices that can sense their (radio) environment, understand it, and model it, so that they can exploit the spectrum through appropriate transmission parameters (in the space, time, and frequency domains) that do not interfere with legacy and/or licensed devices using the same spectrum in the same general area. According to the CR paradigm, the use of the spectrum that is not used by primary (licensed) users is opportunistic. Secondary users sense the spectrum and decide to use it on their own, possibly following additional rules and protocols. Because multiple such CR devices (secondary users) can find themselves in the same area and compete for the same spectrum, the question that arises is whether these devices behave \"fairly\" and \u2026",

One relatively recent approach to address their performance, scalability, privacy, and other problems are to use multiple different DLTs instead of relying on just one. While there are no really established standards for combining several DLTs, a few repeating patterns can be observed. In this paper, we present a survey of interledger approaches, discussing and comparing their underlying mechanisms. A shared motivation for all of the discussed interledger solutions is to move away from the \u201cone chain rules them all\u201d model to one that allows the interconnection of multiple ledgers, with different features and advantages, while also supporting innovation.

            "Abstract": "In IPFS content identifiers are constructed based on the item's data therefore the binding between an item's identifier and its data can be deterministically verified. Nevertheless, once an item is modified, its identifier also changes. Therefore when it comes to mutable content there is a need for keeping track of the \"latest\" IPFS identifier. This is achieved using naming protocols on top of IPFS, such as IPNS and DNSlink, that map a constant name to an IPFS identifier, allowing at the same time content owners to update these mappings. Nevertheless, IPNS relies on a cryptographic key pair that cannot be rotated, and DNSlink does not provide content authenticity protection. In this paper, we propose a naming protocol that combines DNSlink and decentralized identifiers to enable self-verifiable content items. Our protocol provides content authenticity without imposing any security requirement to DNSlink. Furthermore, our protocol prevent fake content even if attackers have access to the DNS server of the content owner or have access to the content owner secret keys. Our proof of concept implementation shows that our protocol is feasible and can be used with existing IPFS tools.",

The most promising approaches so far address energy efficiency by merging the service discovery process with the routing process. Actually the service information is piggy-backed into routing messages, so that a node is simultaneously informed of available services and of routes towards the corresponding service providers. This cross layering leads to improved adaptation to the network conditions and at the same time to significant energy savings. Those savings are infeasible if the two processes are implemented separately, because then each one would have to use its own messages and create additional (if not) redundant network overhead. In this paper we propose such a hybrid adaptive protocol for energy consumption-avert users. This protocol, named AVERT, is based on \u2026",

            "Abstract": "According to some studies, there are well over 300 different Internet of Things (IoT) platforms and several dozens of (so-called) standards. In practice, this has led to a situation where most of the deployed IoT systems are closed and largely incapable of communicating with other IoT systems. Furthermore, it is likely that at least a few different basic IoT communication protocols will co-exist, including the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and HTTP.In this paper, we introduce SOFIE, Secure Open Federation for Internet Everywhere. SOFIE is a proposal for applying distributed ledger technology (DLT) to securely and openly federate IoT platforms. SOFIE\u2019s approach is based on the idea of using interconnected distributed ledgers as a cornerstone to build decentralised business platforms that support the interconnection of diverse IoT systems. Among other things, the ledgers are used to provide openly accessible metadata about the individual IoT platforms, to define business and other rules on how to connect to the platforms, and to securely record audit trails that can be used to resolve disputes.",

The Internet of Things (IoT) is progressing at a fast pace, and IoT devices are becoming pervasive in our physical environments, bringing the vision of Intelligent Environments closer to reality. At the same time, the newly-introduced blockchain technology is offering for the first time ever cryptographically proven trust based on a set of mutually untrusted nodes. Blockchain technology thus has the potential to become a key component of many IoT systems, offering them an unprecedented level of accountability, transparency, and reliability. This paper first lays out the principles on which blockchain systems are operating, along with descriptions of the most noteworthy blockchain implementations. It then presents a number of systems through which blockchains may interact with external systems and third-party data sources. Finally, it provides a survey of the state-of-the-art blockchain-based systems targeting IoT applications. View Full-Text",

VCs are a secure means for expressing claims about a subject. Although VCs are ideal for encoding capabilities, the lack of standards for exchanging and using VCs impedes their adoption and limits their interoperability. We mitigate this problem by integrating VCs into the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. To this end, we propose a new form of OAuth 2.0 access token based on VCs. Our approach leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to encode VCs and takes advantage of JWT-based mechanisms for proving VC possession. Our solution not only requires minimum changes to existing OAuth 2.0 code bases, but it also removes some of the complexity of verifying VC claims by relying on JSON Web Signatures: a simple, standardized, and well supported signature format. Additionally, we fill the gap of VC generation processes by defining a new protocol that leverages the OAuth 2.0 \"client credentials\" grant.",

            "Abstract": "Due to their inherent wide coverage, dependability, resilience and global significance, Satellite Communications (SatCom) can play an integral role within several Future Internet (FI) application domains that address Grand Societal Challenges towards a sustainable and efficient economy [1-3]. Eg, SatCom can effectively support smart FI-enabled transportation systems, smart FI-enabled security and public safety systems, as well as smart FI-enabled healthcare systems.Such FI application domains refer to information collection and dissemination services/applications within the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d communication paradigm, where the real physical world is connected to the digital world through a multitude of sensors and actuators. In particular, satellite M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications, currently a relatively small market compared to that of terrestrial wireless networks, is expanding, led by the growing need to track and monitor difficult-to-reach valuable assets. Satellite M2M networking is gaining popularity in a wide range of governmental and commercial markets owing to the considerable benefits offered by the technology [4]. For certain industries, such as oil and gas, utilities, and transportation and distribution, wherein large numbers of assets are deployed in remote locations with inadequate cellular coverage, M2M becomes an expensive proposition unless satellite networks are used (and deployed, if needed). Satellite M2M is preferred for high-end applications requiring wide coverage, particularly in oceans, deserted, or rural areas, and for performing mission-critical monitoring.",

Information is brought at the center of the approach, providing several advantages: flexibility, seamless information morphing and exploitation of context, access control, and security in general.

We simulate file transfer and WWW browsing over TCP and continuous media distribution over UDP, in conjunction with various link layer schemes. Our results reveal that WWW browsing behaves differently than bulk file transfer, that some TCP aware enhancements have limited applicability and that UDP applications are best served by schemes inappropriate for TCP. We then describe a multi\u2010service link layer architecture that simultaneously enhances the performance of diverse applications by supporting multiple error recovery schemes in parallel. In order to evaluate our architecture, we repeat our previous simulations with all applications \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper shows how the multicast nature of proposed future publish/subscribe network architectures can assist mobility. Publish/subscribe is an information-centric networking paradigm. Unlike the current send/receive based Internet architecture which which favours the sender of information, the publish/subscribe paradigm leads to a more balanced relationship between entities. Publish/subscribe is considered a promising architecture for the future Internet as it can potentially address various current Internet problems, such as spam and (Distributed) Denial of Service attacks. In a pub/sub architecture all data are transmitted via multicast and end host identification, which has a less critical role to begin with, is decoupled from location identification. In such an environment, fast mobility can be supported effectively, particularly for continuous media distribution (such as mobile TV) and other types of real-time multimedia applications. In this paper, a prototype overlay multicast scheme based on Scribe is extended to support mobility. We compare this scheme against an alternative solution based on Mobile IPv6 and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the basic trade-offs.",

Together with the clear benefits of increased WLAN coverage though, new challenges have emerged; dense WLAN deployments lead to significant interference among neighbor networks, making its mitigation a matter of crucial importance for their performance. To this end, transmission power control is a natural choice to limit interference. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two algorithms (FirstMax and BestMax) for WLAN Access Points (APs) to cooperatively control their transmission power levels, leading to more fair and more efficient spectrum usage.

Thus, the implementation work started already in the beginning of the project in a close co-operation with the architecture work.The PSIRP project started to work towards a publish/subscribe solution, where even the IP-based forwarding was not considered to be a necessary part of the system. This created a need for a prototype with a different structure than existing systems. The prototype development was divided into two separate areas, namely the Lower Layer implementation (LoLI), the Upper Layer implementation (UpLI). The LoLI is motivated by the need for a new kind of data handling at the end-host as well as for forwarding data packets due to the chosen publish/subscribe approach of the architecture. This host internal publication management, APIs, as well as forwarding mechanism implementation was assigned to the LoLI development. The requirements on locating publications and managing the network topology were considered to be \u201cupper layer\u201d tasks, necessary for the system. The implementation of these components has been done in the Upper Layer implementation part. Last but not least, different applications are created on top of the upper layer implementation.",

            "Abstract": "OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. It facilitates secure service provisioning, as well as secure interoperability among diverse stakeholders. All OAuth 2.0 protocol flows result in the creation of an access token, which is then used by a user to request access to a protected resource. Nevertheless, the definition of access tokens is transparent to the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which does not specify any particular token format, how tokens are generated, or how they are used. Instead, the OAuth 2.0 specification leaves all these as design choices for integrators. In this paper, we propose a new type of OAuth 2.0 token backed by a distributed ledger. Our construction is secure, and it supports proof-of-possession, auditing, and accountability. Furthermore, we provide added-value token management services, including revocation, delegation, and fair exchange by leveraging smart contracts. We realized a proof-of-concept implementation of our solution using Ethereum smart contracts and the ERC-721 token specification.",

We take advantage of the support for bursty traffic of available technologies and design a system to effectively overcome the disconnection times, allowing various levels of Quality-of-Service guarantees, depending on assumptions about the statistics of the connection characteristics and mobility patterns. Enabling techniques are based on prefetching objects and media segments of relatively more importance to other parts of the data and dynamically selecting the appropriate medium representation and quality for the various objects and components. Scenes, media objects and streams are described by XML documents specifying their characteristics and functionality (similarly to the MPEG-4 BIFS) and objects are weighted according to their importance in the scene (through author specification) and user preferences (through dynamic profiles). Based on this information, the user device can prefetch, or the portal can push, objects in the order of their significance, when bandwidth is plentiful, anticipating congestion or disconnection periods.",

InfoRanking is a mechanism that tries to mitigate this security risk by ranking content items. In this paper, we show through analysis, fluid modeling, and simulation that when InfoRanking is used, attackers can deceive users only when they share corrupted copies of legitimate file versions. Nevertheless, as corrupted files can be immediately detected after being downloaded, this attack is only effective when users enter the system at very low rate and leave relatively fast.

Without an identity certifying authority, trustworthy accounting of transactions in the P2PWNC is challenging, but accounting is necessary in order to enforce the basic P2PWNC \u2019rule of reciprocity\u2019. We show that even though the P2PWNC accounting mechanism and its purpose-built Public Key Infrastructure are open to Sybil attacks, there exists a user authentication algorithm that excludes all free riders and that can also make the percentage of unfair exclusions it causes very small simply by using more system memory.",

We evaluate the cost and transaction delay of DLTs in a location-based mobile game ecosystem using two types of blockchains (permissioned and permissionless or public), based on defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Our evaluation shows the advantages of using both types of blockchains as well as interledger technologies that combine them. Permissioned blockchains enable high performance, eg, in terms of throughput and delay, and low cost, while permissionless (public) blockchains, through their transparency, immutability, and openness, support trust and facilitate interactions among unrelated parties. Finally, we show that the combination of IoT devices and DLTs in mobile gaming offers new business opportunities and enables innovative business models for both traditional mobile gaming companies and other participants in the ecosystem, eg, game players, cafes, malls, and similar establishments, advertising companies, and independent programmers.

We rely on reciprocity: a person participates in the WCN and provides free Internet access to mobile users in order to enjoy the same benefit when mobile. Our reciprocity scheme is compatible with the distinctive structure of WCNs: it does not require registration with authorities, relying only on uncertified free identities (public-private key pairs). Users sign digital receipts when they consume service. The receipts form a receipt graph, which is used as input to a reciprocity algorithm that identifies contributing users using network flow techniques. Simulations show that this algorithm can sustain reciprocal cooperation. We have implemented our algorithm to run on common WCN equipment, namely the Linksys WRT54GS AP.",

Detection of interference conditions is the first step towards its mitigation. We follow a client-centric approach, where wireless clients monitor and report Wi-Fi AP presence. We focus on the security aspects of such a scheme, assuming that clients may attack the reporting mechanism by submitting fake information. Our early evaluation shows that for certain attacker strategies, simple mechanisms can effectively filter invalid reports with minimal loss of information.",

The ubiquity of IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth-enabled devices and the extensive wireless coverage, especially in modern densely-populated metropolitan areas, are clear indicators of the trend towards open spectrum access. This trend is largely attributable to the fact that the aforementioned wireless technologies operate in unlicensed spectrum and have low installation and operational cost. However, deployment freedom, minimal necessary investments and ease of configuration come with a cost; current IEEE 802.11-based network deployments are usually anarchic and, combined with the scarcity of unlicensed spectrum, lead to significant interference problems and suboptimal spectrum utilization. To mitigate interference among neighbor wireless networks, intelligent schemes need to be developed, where unlicensed spectrum is shared considering the following three dimensions: space, frequency and time.With a similar motivation, that is, to increase spectrum efficiency, taking advantage of recent technological advances in the field of Software Defined Radios, and supported by observations that fixed spectrum allocation is inflexible and licensed spectrum is often underutilized [1], a significant amount of research is focused on Cognitive Radios (CR). The basic property of CRs is that they can sense their radio environment and adapt their behavior to achieve optimal performance.

However, Wi-Fi, the predominant means of local wireless connectivity today, but also 3G and 4G technologies, are known to suffer from poor multicast performance. Data destined to a broadcast or multicast address are typically transmitted at lower rates to increase reliability for clients with poor signal conditions, causing unfavorable delays for high-rate users. One approach to this problem is to designate a subset of the clients as relays who re-broadcast packets for other clients at a higher rate.

By individually naming each packet, ICN allows routers to turn their queueing buffers into packet caches, thus exploiting the network's existing storage resources. However, the performance of packet caching at commodity routers is restricted by the small capacity of their SRAM, which holds the index for the packets stored at the, slower, DRAM. We therefore propose Object-oriented Packet Caching (OPC), a novel caching scheme that overcomes the SRAM bottleneck, by combining object-level indexing in the SRAM with packet-level storage in the DRAM. We implemented OPC and experimentally evaluated it over various cache placement policies, showing that it can enhance the impact of ICN packet-level caching, reducing both network and \u2026",

PCMA seeks to maximize the number of parallel transmissions among cells by defining virtual cells in which users transmit using different reuse factors. It is demonstrated how PCMA is novel in its ability to more efficiently service users in a system with non-uniform traffic load among cells and to adapt in real-time to changes in traffic distribution. After formally stating the optimal coverage problem, a greedy algorithm is presented and used to improve substantially over PCMA with simple, uniform resource allocation.",

Unlike existing approaches, P2PWNC does not rely on central planning but on an ad hoc community of broadband Internet subscribers (the peers) with Wi-Fi access points (APs). These APs provide wireless access to peers that are away from home but within the range of another P2PWNC AP. In the P2PWNC scheme, wireless service is provided to those peers who consistently provide service to passerby peers, based on an algorithm that detects non-simultaneous multi-way peer-to-peer exchanges. This indirect reciprocity algorithm runs in isolation on every peer AP, resists Sybil attacks, and promotes cooperation without relying on trusted authorities, certified identities, or tamperproof modules. We discuss P2PWNC's design and show \u2026",

In this paper, we develop an access control system which enables offloading of complex access control decisions to third, trusted parties.

Here we study the problem of topology discovery in such dense deployments, which is necessary in order to combat interference. To this end, we apply a client-driven scheme, where client devices sense the spectrum and report overlapping cells. However, reporting entities cannot always be assumed trustworthy. We therefore study cases where reporters attack the discovery process by submitting fake information and propose simple countermeasures to tackle some attacker strategies.

Both these limitations are especially apparent in the case of real-time continuous media distribution. The publish/subscribe paradigm has been proposed as a promising alternative to the current send/receive paradigm for a future Internet architecture. In future publish/subscribe networks, multicast will be the norm, and this change of the end-to-end communication semantics will lead to a networking environment more suitable for mobility. In the context of this paradigm, this paper considers a prototype architecture \u2026",

Therefore, utility companies, governmental agencies, and various other entities with environmental concerns aim at lowering and shaping energy consumption patterns to achieve peak load reduction, load smoothing, and hence carbon emission curtailment. In this survey paper, we present an overview of approaches for engaging smart grid consumers and for providing them with information, motivation, and recommendations for energy efficiency through mobile apps. Our focus is to bring machine learning approaches closer to smart grid mobile apps so as to optimally manage consumer flexibility and enhance energy savings through detailed consumer profiling and modeling, since an increasing amount of energy consumer data is becoming available.

However, with this mode of regulation, spectrum utilization is far from efficient and the growth of wireless networks is hindered by the shortage of free frequency bands and the vast investments for the acquisition of a license. In view of this situation, we present an alternative evolution path for the unobstructed growth of wireless networks and the efficient use of spectrum. The proposed architecture is based on the use of unlicensed spectrum and the open access of users to all public networks without prior contracts with operators. We highlight and discuss the inherent technical challenges that must be tackled before the proposed solution can be realized. Special attention is paid to the inherent need for alternative interference mitigation strategies.",

In particular, all nodes are endowed with an initial budget; unsatisfied nodes randomly pick others to negotiate with for the level of their transmission powers; if a negotiation leads to an agreement, a node gives some (predefined) reward to the other and the latter reduces its power to the agreed level; the process is then \u2026",

The use of blockchains, though, does not come at no cost. Poor design of blockchain-based applications can lead to prohibitive costs, intolerable delays, and nonscalable systems. In this work we explore different architectures for blockchain-based traceability and quality control of produce, proposing, evaluating, and comparing four different scenarios. Our evaluation uses public and private Ethereum instances, and assesses the considered architectures in terms of cost and overall throughput.",

In this paper we focus on a novel way of maximization of the network throughput and the provision of fairness which are key challenges in IEEE WLANs, using Game Theory. We examine two types of power control games, namely the non-cooperative and the cooperative power control game. In the case of non-cooperative power control game we find the Nash equilibrium in a distributed way. In the case of cooperative power control game we assume that there exists a central entity called coordinator which announces the calculated Nash bargaining solution to the access points. Finally, we present the results of simulations implemented in MATLAB through a series of plots and tables.",

The variety of media types combined with the diversity of Internet connection characteristics raises momentous challenges to the achievement of this goal.

As a result, adaptive streams enjoy superior robustness and provide substantially better presentation quality than traditional, non\u2010adaptive ones, especially in variable, capacity\u2010limited environments.We examine several important factors that influence the design and optimization of the adaptation architecture. First, the location of the adaptation mechanism on the end\u2010to\u2010end path must be chosen.

Even though users increasingly focus on the desired information, the underlying network still focuses on the endpoints providing/consuming this information and in many cases this mismatch has resulted in an inefficient utilization of network resources, as demonstrated by peer-to-peer (P2P) and file sharing applications. In view of this situation, many research projects have focused on the investigation of alternative networking models centered around information. However, less attention has been paid to the transition process from the current end host centric model to an information centric one.

Our reciprocity scheme is compatible with the distinctive structure of WCNs: it does not require registration with authorities, relying only on uncertified free identities (public-private key pairs). Users sign digital receipts when they consume service. The receipts form a receipt graph, which is used as input to a reciprocity algorithm that identifies contributing users using network flow techniques. Simulations show that this algorithm can sustain reciprocal cooperation. We have implemented our algorithm to run on common APs.",

A hospital-based WSN used for this purpose, will ameliorate patients\u0413 stay in the hospital as they will not have to be restricted in a room, but will be able to move around the hospital freely and safely. Sensors deployed on patients\u0413 body will be able to monitor their vital signs as well as their position. Moreover by using their processing and interconnection capabilities those sensors will be able to detect an emergency situation and notify doctors, updating them at the same time with the patient\u0413s health status and position.To prolong autonomy and battery life and even to limit interference to other hospital devices, wireless communication should use the minimum power level possible. In order to achieve this target, sensors can create small clusters coordinated by low emission wireless access points acting as Cluster Heads (CHs). CHs will be responsible for handling sensor nodes that enter and leave the cluster, as well as for assuring the proper and secure operation of each node. Moreover CHs are chosen to be the gateways to a wired backbone network that will be used to transfer data from sensors to a central control system. Not all members of the cluster will have direct communication with the CH; in order to assure as low power transmission as possible, sensors will communicate in ad-hoc mode and the nodes that are closer to the CH will act as transit nodes for the nodes that are further away. As patients will freely move around, clusters are expected to be dynamic, with high churn.",

In this paper we propose an access control enforcement delegation scheme which enables the purveyor of an information item to evaluate a request against an access control policy, without having access to the requestor credentials nor to the actual definition of the policy. Such an approach has multiple merits: it enables the interoperability of various stakeholders, it protects user identity and it can set the basis for a privacy preserving mechanism.

Regarding strategies and the best game to be played, there is no single answer. The best solution depends on the perspective. However, the CPG is more effective in terms of clients' experienced quality of service. Our future work involves experimenting with more than two APs in the shared area and evaluating various quality of service metrics.",

ICN will make it easy for users to appoint storage nodes, in various network locations, perhaps owned or controlled by them, where shared content can be stored and disseminated from. These storage nodes should be (somewhat) trusted since not only they have (some level of) access to user shared content, but they should also properly enforce access control. Traditional forms of encryption introduce significant overhead when it comes to sharing content with large and dynamic groups of users. To this end, proxy re-encryption provides a convenient solution. In this paper, we use Identity-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (IB-PRE) to provide confidentiality and access control for content items shared over ICN, realizing secure content distribution among dynamic sets of users. In contrast to similar IB-PRE \u2026",

Wi-Fi equipment has become standard in laptops and handhelds, while Bluetooth prevails for short-range connectivity. The vision of the Internet of Things, where myriads of heterogeneous devices will interconnect over wireless sublayers, forming a huge network of networks is fast approaching its realization. In view of these advances, traditional Internet architectures at all layers will need to transform and adapt to accommodate for the increasing communication demands. Unlicensed wireless spectrum is scarce and we need agile sharing schemes to achieve its increased utilization. The cost for the lack of strict regulation is interference; for spectrum agility, thus, alternative interference mitigation strategies are necessary. A crucial step in this process is sensing the wireless environment to detect interference conditions. In this work, we focus on distributed unlicensed spectrum sensing, where information on spectrum usage conditions from multiple sources are fused to come to smart spectrum access decisions. In the heterogeneous open access environment that we envisage, multiple self-interested entities participate in the sensing and sharing processes. This poses security challenges, which we discuss in this paper.",

However, many researchers have questioned the value of in-network caching, arguing that the limited storage resources of ICN routers cannot eliminate a significant amount of redundant transmissions, hence the performance advantages of in-network caching may be similar to those of traditional edge-caches. Nevertheless, there is another potential use of in-network caching that poses less challenging storage requirements: exploiting it to enhance the efficiency of error recovery by \u2026",

The routing state in NDN can grow exponentially, not only due to the huge number of content identifiers (as opposed to network addresses) but also because it is difficult to detect \"fake\" routing advertisements. For example, in contrast to IP-based routing, a potentially valid routing entry in NDN can be advertised from multiple network locations, making NDN susceptible to Denial-of-Service attacks at the routing layer. In this paper, we leverage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to build self-verifiable \"content advertisements.\" With our solution, any router can verify that a content advertisement originates from an \"authorized\" entity, without requiring any trusted third party.

For this reason, several research initiatives, driven by both academia and industry, investigate the potential of an interoperable IoT architecture, i.e., an architecture that will provide a common and horizontal communication abstraction, which will act as interconnection layer among all prominent IoT protocols and systems. Securing such an architecture, which includes many stakeholders with diverse interests and security \u2026",

One of the most critical ICN functionalities is the efficient resolution/location of information objects i.e., name resolution.

Currently proposed solutions either rely on a DHT structure, thus ensuring load balancing and scalability at the cost of inefficient routing, or on hierarchical structures, thus preserving routing efficiency at the cost of limited scalability. In this paper, we study in detail the tradeoff between state/signaling overhead versus routing efficiency for a generic name-resolution system based on a novel DHT scheme with enhanced routing properties, and compare it to DONA, an ICN architecture based on hierarchical resolution and \u2026",

In fact, it has become a critical infrastructure for the overall society in developed countries. There are many questions today on how the Internet will or should develop in the future. What has been asserted throughout the industry and the research community is that the Internet must change, and that the degree of change must be revolutionary. However, the directions and extent of the changes are not obvious. This leads to the logical argument that new research paradigms need to be explored and more interdisciplinary research is required in this domain. The EIFFEL project supports this investigation through the organization of Think Tank meetings between international experts, debating agreed topics of investigation, such as Future Internet Architecture, Infrastructure, Security, Privacy, and Governance, as well as, sociological and economical aspects. As EIFFEL promotes discussion and interaction between the different ideas, there will be, over time, a coming together of developing vision trajectories, along different explorative and evolutionary paths, towards the common vision of a Future Networked Society. In this paper, in addition to the EIFFEL findings, we also relate the EIFFEL approach to the many Clean Slate research efforts around the Globe.",

We are motivated by the widespread availability of wireless equipment that allows individuals to offer cellular-type services to their peers. We propose a fully self-organized approach to unified hotspot roaming that assumes absolutely no central trust, and we present and evaluate the design of a decentralized system that implements a fair peering algorithm applicable to hotspot sharing. Our mechanism exploits privately owned WLANs and builds a unified roaming infrastructure without the administrative overhead that is usually associated with such efforts.",

            "Abstract": "Overlay networks are widely used for locating and disseminating information, by means of custom routing and forwarding on top of the underlying network. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based overlays provide flexibility coupled with good scalability and load balancing properties. However, this comes at the cost of inefficient routing, caused by the lack of adaptation to the underlying network: current DHT designs often overlook physical network proximity, administrative boundaries and inter-domain routing policies, or a combination thereof. In this paper we show how to construct a DHT-based overlay network that takes all these aspects into account. Based on the Pastry distributed object location and routing substrate and the Canon paradigm, we developed H-Pastry, an overlay DHT scheme that harvests the scalability and load balancing features of flat DHT designs, while also adapting to the underlying network topology, administrative structure and routing policies. We evaluate the performance characteristics of the proposed scheme through an extensive set of detailed simulations over realistic inter-network topologies. Our results show that H-Pastry substantially improves routing by reducing both overlay path stretch (by up to 50%) and routing policy violations (by up to 67%), compared to the canonical Chord DHT. In addition, the canonical design of H-Pastry keeps traffic within administrative boundaries as far as possible, while also creating excellent opportunities for the support of caching and multicast.",

The paradigm assumes users to have open access to all public networks without prior contracts with operators.

In the route-by-name approach to NRS construction, name resolution and the corresponding state follow the routing infrastructure of the underlying inter-domain network. The scalability of the resulting NRS is therefore strongly related to the topological and routing characteristics of the network. However, past work has largely neglected this aspect.

            "Abstract": "Since their conception, satellite communications have been regarded as a promising tool for all environments where the terrestrial infrastructure is limited in capacity or to take advantage of the multicasting/broadcasting capabilities inherent in satellite technology. Recent advances have seen satellite technology mature to a more prominent role in the telecommunications domain. In particular, the design of novel satellite payload concepts for Geostationary (GEO) satellite platforms, as well as renewed interest in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have made the integration of satellite and terrestrial networks almost compulsory to ensure new services meet the requirements for high user-rate and quality of experience that could not be achieved using either of the two technologies independently. From this viewpoint, convergence of satellite and terrestrial technologies also requires considering the most recent trends in networking, with special attention being paid to the potential new architectures that have been recently proposed in the framework of Future Internet.This monograph explores the main components of the scenarios above, putting particular emphasis on the networking aspects. To this end, novel protocols such as Multi Path TCP (MPTCP) and networking trends such as Information Centric Networking (ICN) are explored by demonstrating their applicability in some scenarios that deploy both satellite and terrestrial segments. Particular attention is given to smart gateway diversity schemes which advocate the use of sophisticated multi-path transmission schemes to exploit the multi-homing features offered by present day devices \u2026",

In this setup, we study how an efficient coexistence of these devices may be achieved, using a game-theoretic approach.

A P2P WLAN Consortium (PWC) is a community of WLAN Administrative Domains (ADs) that offer network access to each other's registered users. The ubiquitous network access that these roaming members of an AD could enjoy compensates for their AD's cost of providing access to visitors. Existing WLAN roaming schemes utilize central authorities or bilateral contracts to control access to resources. In contrast, a PWC forms a P2P community in which participating ADs are autonomous entities. ADs make independent decisions concerning the amount of resources (eg access bandwidth) they contribute. As a result, similarly to existing P2P systems, a PWC will suffer from abusive behavior (free riding) if no incentive mechanisms exist to ensure that ADs offer the amount of resources that is economically justified. Flexible rules on reciprocity can be set to delimit AD policies in order to bring the system to a near-optimum equilibrium, by forcing ADs to contribute in order to consume. In this paper, in addition to making the case for PWC, we discuss a number of technologies and issues related to the implementation of PWC such as rule design, security and differentiated QoS in such a distributed environment.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, the Internet connects more objects than people. These devices generate vast amounts of information. Furthermore, identification technologies - such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) - enable the association of information with identifiable objects, not necessarily connected to the Internet. All this information is organized into vertical silos. These silos usually belong to different administrative domains and use their own specific communication protocols. In this paper, we present our vision for a global, all-encompassing Internet of Things (IoT) realized through an integrating architecture relying on information and its identifiers/names. We envision the IoT as the architecture that will interconnect all these silos and will make the information generated by or associated with objects globally accessible. Moreover, we argue that the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm is the ideal candidate \u2026",

However, a full-fledged CoAP-based application requires delay-tolerant communication and support for multicast: since these properties cannot be easily provided by existing IP networks, developers cannot take full advantage of CoAP, preferring to use HTTP instead. In this demo we show how proxying CoAP traffic over an ICN network can unleash the full potential of CoAP, simultaneously shifting overhead and complexity from the (constrained) endpoints to the network.",

We also report on aspects of its performance, focusing on the performance penalty of security-related operations. The core P2PWNC scheme assumes that community members are selfish and do not trust each other and uses a secure incentive technique to encourage their contribution. It protects the real-world identities of community providers and clients by relying only on disposable opaque identifiers and does not rely on any authority to resolve disputes or control membership.

In our prior work we have developed a reciprocity-based peer-to-peer architecture for Wi-Fi sharing, where peers provide free Wi-Fi access to others in order to enjoy the same benefit when they are away from their own Wi-Fi network. Our system tries to match peer consumption with contribution and we have shown it to work well for city-scale Wi-Fi sharing communities. However, when attempting to roam outside the city boundaries, the statistics are such that there is typically a lack of consumption-contribution information between consuming and providing members \u2026",

Multipath TCP (MPTCP), the most popular multipath transport protocol in-use, allows a single receiver to exploit multiple paths from a single sender. Nevertheless, MPTCP cannot fully exploit the potential gains of multipath connectivity, as it must fairly share resources with regular, single-path TCP, without knowing whether the available paths are distinct or share bottleneck links, due to IP\u2019s design choices. We introduce a hybrid congestion control algorithm for multipath transport that enables higher bandwidth utilization compared to MPTCP, while remaining friendly to TCP-like flows. Our solution employs (i) Normalized Multiflow Congestion Control (NMCC), a novel end-to-end congestion control algorithm and (ii) an in-network module that exposes routing \u2026",

As a result, even though such applications are attractive to both content providers, due to their lower bandwidth requirements, and to end users, due to their reduced download times, they plague the underlying network with redundant packet transmissions, a significant part of which takes place over costly inter-domain links.

Under these circumstances, in the case of service disruption, a user, in the worst case, may lose the amount of money that corresponds to a single micro-service transaction in a single time slot.

In such networks, mobile nodes must rely on their own capabilities and on other peers\u2019 capabilities to perform their tasks. In this context, many service discovery protocols have been proposed in order for mobile peers to be able to discover and take advantage of each other\u2019s services. A basic building block for service discovery protocols is their service selection strategy. Especially in service-rich environments with many (possibly resource poor) mobile nodes, the service selection strategy employed is of major importance. In this paper we investigate the impact of two basic and easy to implement service selection strategies on the lifetime of mobile servers. The first strategy takes into account hop-based server proximity and promotes the selection of the nearest mobile server, while the second strategy takes into account the remaining energy of service providers and promotes the selection of the mobile server with the maximum remaining energy. Through extensive simulations, we show that the provider\u2019s remaining energy yields the best performance when used as a service selection criterion under most situations, and that the shortest path selection criterion presents very competitive performance. The performance metrics used for evaluating both service selection strategies are service and network lifetimes, service success and service discoverability ratios.",

            "Abstract": "There is an increasing number of autonomous, portable, computing devices that we use in everyday life, work and leisure alike, such as notebook computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), palmtops, mobile phones, digital cameras, etc., including combination devices. As a result, a great amount of \u201cmobile\u201d data resides on these devices in a distributed, non-integrated manner. Similarly, services not only can be made available to mobile devices, but by mobile devices.These resources are not only heterogeneous but also carry context-dependent semantics, depending on user, location, community and other parameters. Furthermore, they exhibit variable availability over time, depending on mobility parameters and network coverage. Alternatively, they can always be accessed locally, by using the device directly. As a result, a virtual super-database with a dynamic schema is formed and many new issues concerning its use arise. Traditional database (DB) management, querying, caching and indexing techniques are not directly applicable in this context and new paradigms are needed.",

            "Abstract": "Information-Centric Networking is a promising networking paradigm that overcomes many of the limitations of current networking architectures. Various research efforts investigate solutions for securing ICN. Nevertheless, most of these solutions relax security requirements in favor of network performance. In particular, they weaken end-user privacy and the architecture's tolerance to security breaches in order to support middleboxes that offer services such as caching and content replication. In this paper, we adapt TLS, a widely used security standard, to an ICN context. We design solutions that allow session reuse and migration among multiple stakeholders and we propose an extension that allows authorized middleboxes to lawfully and transparently intercept secured communications.",

PSI departs from IP thinking with respect to the core abstractions made and the functional organization of the system. PSI places information at the heart of the network layer and decouples the forwarding, path formation and topology management functionalities. This design approach can be highly beneficial for real-time communications, as it enables the network to apply sophisticated mechanisms for multicast tree construction, such as delivery of information over optimal (minimum cost) Steiner trees. Initial experiments with a proof-of-concept implementation of PSI indicate the feasibility of realizing such optimization policies.

            "Abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is receiver driven, asynchronous and location-independent, hence it natively supports client-mobility. However, post-handover delay is a problem for delay-sensitive mobile applications, as they need to (re-) submit their subscriptions and wait for them to get resolved and (probably re-) transmitted before receiving the demanded data. To avoid this problem and optimize performance, this paper proposes a Mobility-based Proactive Multicast (MPM) scheme. Unlike reactive or blind multicast solutions proposed in the past, MPM takes autonomous decisions locally at various network access points (cells) prior to the movement of mobile clients, using a semi-Markov mobility prediction model that predicts next-cell transitions, along with anticipating the duration between the transitions for an arbitrary user in a cellular network. Since cellular backhaul links are typically a bottleneck, MPM \u2026",

Nevertheless current content-based networks\u2013such as file sharing peer-to-peer (P2P) networks\u2013have been proved to be vulnerable to content pollution attacks. A significant amount of research efforts has been launched in order to mitigate this kind of attacks. The majority of these efforts focuses on users\u2019 ranking, based on their behavior, while little work has been done in ranking information itself. We show in this paper that solutions based on users\u2019 ranking can be by-passed by malicious users. Furthermore we propose inforanking, a light-weight solution for ranking information, based exclusively on positive votes. We compare our solution to Credence object-based reputation system. Our solution demonstrates significant less burden to the network and outperforms Credence in terms of polluted content isolation.",

Our analysis shows that plane cover multiple access (PCMA) provides for the greatest use of system capacity while maintaining a given level of service quality measured in either cellular overload probability or mean overload period. For instance, given a target level of quality of service of 0.001 for maximum probability of cellular overload, over twice as many calls can be accepted in the downlink under PCMA than under capture division packet access (CDPA). Furthermore, almost 2.7 times as many calls can be accepted than under one-seventh reuse. If the target quality of service metric is mean overload period then the improvements are even more extreme with improvements of up to 2.24 times the call capacity of CDPA and up to 3.27 \u2026",

When these attacks first appeared, spoofing and distributed denial-of-service attacks were treated as apocalypse for networking. Now, they are considered moderate damage, whereas more sophisticated and inconspicuous attacks, such as botnets activities, might have greater and far reaching impact. As the Internet is expanding to mobile phones and \u2018smart dust\u2019and as its social coverage is liberalized towards the realization of ubiquitous computing (with communication), the concerns on security and privacy have become deeper and the problems more challenging than ever. Re-designing the Internet as the Network of the Future is self-motivating for researchers, and security and privacy cannot be provided again as separate, external, add-on, solutions. In this paper, we discuss the security and privacy challenges of the Network of the Future and try to delimit the solutions space on the basis of emerging techniques. We also review methods that help the quantification of security and privacy in an effort to provide a more systematic and quantitative treatment of the area in the future.

This is due to the typical features of such a network, which provides access to services regardless of the user\u2019s location and movements. In a typical scenario of a user roaming among different network providers, it is essential to provide anonymity, untraceability and overall security to the user. The use of a proper authentication protocol is a way of providing security to the network and, if designed properly, protection of user\u2019s private information. In order to understand the design of such protocols we define the security and privacy requirements that they should satisfy. We present and examine several authentication protocols, which have been designed to provide user authentication in mobile networks. Some of them claim to provide anonymity and untraceability. We examine if they satisfy these basic requirements. The basic protocols are compared to each other in regard to three factors: security, privacy and computational load to the user. It is shown that most protocols can\u2019t protect anonymity and untraceability of the user without sacrificing basic security requirements.",

Multipath TCP (MPTCP), the most popular multiflow protocol on the Internet, allows receivers to exploit multiple paths towards a single sender. Nevertheless, MPTCP cannot fully exploit the potential gains of multipath connectivity, as it must fairly share resources with (single-flow) TCP, without a clear understanding of whether the available paths do share any bottleneck links. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid congestion control algorithm for multisource and multipath transport that enables higher bandwidth utilization compared to MPTCP, while remaining friendly to TCP-like flows. Our solution employs (i) an in-network module that offers essential topological information and (ii) Normalized Multiflow Congestion Control (NMCC), a novel end-to-end congestion control algorithm.
