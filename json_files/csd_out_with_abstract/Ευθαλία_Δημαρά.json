A sample of 76 small rural businesses in lagging areas of insular Greece is included in the present survey, and ranks thirteen possible business growth instruments. It is found that business development instruments are ranked according to each firm's economic and human capital characteristics. Furthermore, most firms need the concurrent provision of more than one instrument. Likewise, a mixture of business specific schemes, regulatory interventions and infrastructure projects, better serves their business development needs. Results from the present survey indicate that an integrated business development strategy in lagging areas of Greece should be supported by modern, flexibly tailored combinations of assistance, using complex \u2026",

As international scientific literature indicates a wide range of factors leading to the adoption of the ISO 9000 schemes, the impact of this adoption should be viewed and examined in a framework of the firms\u2019 strategic orientation. A sample of Greek businesses that adopted the ISO 9000 scheme in the early 1990s is classified into three categories of strategic orientation, namely cost leadership, market differentiation and focus strategy. If all the firms are pooled together, there is no significant difference in their financial performance indicators after a period of six years following the adoption of ISO 9000. However, if the firms are examined separately and according to their strategic orientation, those firms pursuing a cost leadership strategy present statistically significant growth of financial profitability \u2026",

The business survey was complemented by a survey of institutions that have in various ways involved with business networks. The overall aim of this thematic study was to examine the impact of business networking and innovation on the operation of businesses and to the development of the regions in which they operate. Business networks and innovation are thought of as factors assisting businesses to overcome regional (locational) disadvantages and operate independently (aspatially) of location. Thus, the major research question dealt with location. Why certain remote areas (areas of type A) present higher economic dynamism from certain less remote areas (areas of type B)? Can these differences in economic development be attributed to factors that act independently \u2026",

The present paper analyses the ways in which a region's image is incorporated into the tourist products and the overall tourism experience. Regional image is acknowledged to entail elements of the socio-cultural, environmental and historical heritage of a region. The latter affect the quality of the tourist product as perceived by the tourists. Consequently, they also affect the tourist's subjective judgement of satisfaction based on the quality of the tourism experience they have 'consumed'. The present paper utilizes data drawn from an EU Research Project (SPRITE QLK5-CT-2000-01211) survey conducted in two regional sites of rural tourism in Greece. Analysis and results focus especially on comparisons between the two study regions. Further, policy implications as regards the development of the rural tourism product, are also discussed.",

Technical and scale efficiency scores are computed within a data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework and are used as explanatory variables in a parametric (Weibull) survival model. High technical efficiency increases the median survival time and lowers the hazard rate of exit. As the scale efficiency of a firm operating either at increasing or decreasing returns to scale approaches one (1), its theoretically maximum value, the expected median survival time, is maximized for all types of exits. Developments in biotechnology, the evolution of alternative food supply networks, innovations in the food sector and competition policy are likely to affect technical and scale efficiency of food manufacturing firms. Results unraveling the effects of technical and scale efficiency on the survival of firms in the food sector are of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Business networks are associated to increased business performance and are regarded as a major factor influencing the development of rural and lagging areas. It is assumed that businesses access many networks in order to pursue their short and long term entrepreneurial objectives. The most important spatial features of this business-network relationship are firstly the spatial coverage of the network and secondly the location of the business in relation to its markets. As concerns the spatial coverage of the networks we distinguish between vertical and horizontal business networks. Vertical networks allow local enterprises to forge alliances with externally located consumers, suppliers, distributors, retailers and institutions, while horizontal networks provide relationships with locally based producers, institutions, and consumers. As concerns the location of the business in relation to its markets we distinguish between firms located in accessible locations and firms located in less accessible and peripheral locations in relation to their output markets. A survey of 160 businesses in the manufacturing and services sectors in two areas of Greece (one remote and one more accessible) is used to test empirically the effects of the spatial features of the business-network relationship on firm performance. Business performance is approximated through a series of measures capturing conventional firm growth and other less conventional managerial objectives. The analysis demonstrates that a significantly high proportion of successful businesses located in the remote area simultaneously access vertical and horizontal networks while in the less remote area \u2026",

The basic assumption is that firms that have exhausted scale economies are in non-increasing returns to scale. The same firms are also assumed to have a size greater than MES estimated on sales (total turnover), employment or fixed assets. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used, on a sample of firms in three Greek manufacturing industries, to classify firms in operation according to increasing or non-increasing returns to scale. On the basis of the results of the DEA input oriented model, the MES measure correctly predicts over 85% of the cases. A probit model is applied to those cases that are not identically predicted by MES concerning returns to scale. Results indicate that technical efficiency, size and age are the factors that compel MES to yield the same prediction as the DEA \u2026",

The recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK has starkly illustrated the fragility of localized systems which depend heavily on consumers travelling to them. Within such a context, the importance of successful marketing strategies has become even more apparent. This paper reports on a questionnaire survey which investigated promotional and marketing strategies among a diverse range of producers and service providers in marginal agricultural areas of the EU. The findings suggest that many producers are situated towards the \u201cformal\u201d end of a marketing continuum \u2026",

Quality wine, which is an image product, to a great extent, is used for examining consumer preferences towards these two sets of cues. A sample of 744 Greek wine consumers is used to assess the factors influencing consumer attitudes towards these quality cues. An ordered probit model with sample selectivity reveals that these quality cues are valued by consumers and are perceived to be highly important.

European rural development policy has supported the production of local and regionally denominated food as a means to differentiate agricultural production, and rural tourism as a means to diversify rural employment. The aim of the present work is to address tourists' decision to buy local food products while visiting lagging rural areas and the amount of money spent over these products. The findings should be of particular interest to practitioners of rural development as they point out to possible market segmentation and communication potentials, and reflect on differences between accessible and less accessible rural areas.",

This paper examines the effects of consumer demographic, psychographic and behavioral characteristics influencing a two-stage decision making process including participation and support to a towel reuse program. A meta-analysis shows that 53% of customers are willing to financially support green hotels. A survey of 1304 Greek and foreign hotel customers in tourism hot spots in Greece reveals that 72% of hotel customers would adopt a towel reuse program while 44.1% are willing to pay extra an average of 2.15 euros per day to support it. Younger customers and customers that book high-priced hotels or with higher length of stay exhibit higher willingness to pay extra for towel reuse programs. As rising water and energy shortages in specific tourism hotspots bring hotels' environmental integration under increased scrutiny, the focal findings hold \u2026",

Certification conveys a wide range of signals to both consumers and producers. For producers in particular, certification may be viewed either as a protection or as a promotion mechanism, or both. Evidence shows that, despite the active support offered to the policy, producers have not been convinced that certification is an important quality indicator bearing marketing advantages. Furthermore, producers valuing certification as an important quality indicator form a clear segment in the population of producers. Policy should attempt to raise awareness of the promotion advantages of quality certification among producers, and employ a mechanism that will reduce the free-riders issue by involving the producers in the certification acquisition process.",

The proposed methodology takes account of extensive censoring of job creation among assisted rural firms, endogeneity of the capital stock change resultant from capital subsidies, and the extensive part\u2010time and seasonal job requirements in rural areas. Capital stock change, as a result of grant aid is negatively related to the decision to create new jobs and to the extent of job creation given that some employment is created. Evidence of this work provides the ground for discussing the effectiveness and implications of using capital subsidies as a job creation instrument within rural development policies.",

            "Abstract": "Greek regional development policy has a long history in the provision of financial incentives to firms. In 1982 the Greek law 1262/82 provided a coherent framework for the financial support of firms comprised of a combination of grant-aid incentives and interest rate subsidization or tax allowances and increased depreciation rates. In 1990, Greek law 1982/90 replaced the previous regional development framework by completing and amending the provided incentives. Thus, the operation of financial incentives to firms may be regarded as almost smoothly continuous up to date. Research on the impacts of financial aid provision to firm survival is not well developed in the regional economics literature. However, it is ascertained that financial aid may have significant impacts on firm survival per se, as well as on quantitative and qualitative attributes of firm death such as the time length to failure, and the type of failure. Firm failure to survive in its current form and structure may be due to three",

The effects of adopting an ISO 9000 scheme on firm performance and especially on certain dimensions of profitability are not significant in a period of 5-6 years after adoption. Evidence suggests that the adoption of an ISO 9000 quality assurance scheme, being a continuous process of improvement, is beneficial in the long term and does not necessarily improve financial ratios in the short term. Active support policies for the promotion and dissemination of quality standards in the manufacturing and service sectors of Greece can be reconsidered and a more targeted policy should be implemented.

Local businesses are considered as agents who realize and/or create economic opportunities and develop new goals and strategies. Businesses are not viewed as independent entities, but as actors whose actions are embedded in structures of ongoing relations. As such, similar resources and activities based in rural tourism destinations do not necessarily have the same consequences at different times and places. Business networking is a crucial factor in organizing activities and resources at the local level, leading to spatially different levels of integration. Such differences are focused on here, using illustrative examples and findings from the case-study regions in the UK, Spain and Greece.",

            "Abstract": "Business networks are associated to increased business performance and are regarded as a major factor influencing the development of rural and lagging areas. It is assumed that businesses access many networks in order to pursue their short and long term entrepreneurial objectives. The most important spatial features of this business-network relationship are firstly the spatial coverage of the network and secondly the location of the business in relation to its markets. As concerns the spatial coverage of the networks we distinguish between vertical and horizontal business networks. Vertical networks allow local enterprises to forge alliances with externally located consumers, suppliers, distributors, retailers and institutions, while horizontal networks provide relationships with locally based producers, institutions, and consumers. As concerns the location of the business in relation to its markets we distinguish between firms located in accessible locations and firms located in less accessible and peripheral locations in relation to their output markets. A survey of 160 businesses in the manufacturing and services sectors in two areas of Greece (one remote and one more accessible) is used to test empirically the effects of the spatial features of the business-network relationship on firm performance. Business performance is approximated through a series of measures capturing conventional firm growth and other less conventional managerial objectives. The analysis demonstrates that a significantly high proportion of successful businesses located in the remote area simultaneously access vertical and horizontal networks while in the less remote area \u2026",

The analysis employs a stochastic production frontier function and allows agglomeration economies to enter as inputs and/or as factors reducing inefficiency. Results re-confirm that the effects of agglomeration economies are industry specific. In our study, the machineries industry benefits from MAR type agglomeration economies and the textiles industry benefits from Jacob's type agglomeration economies. Agglomeration economies may exercise a twin effect on firms' productive efficiency. First, as in the case of the machineries industry in our study, MAR agglomeration economies may act as a new input and affect the kernel of the production frontier. Second, agglomeration economies may act as a factor reducing technical inefficiency with non-neutral effects with labour and capital as in the case of both the machineries and the textiles industries in our study. Finally, it is indicated that agglomeration economies establish a type of \"path dependence\" for firms. Firms that make significant use of agglomeration economies survive to the next period at higher percentages in comparison to other firms in the same industry. At the same time, entrants are favoured by MAR type agglomeration economies while incumbents are favoured by Jacob's type agglomeration economies.",
