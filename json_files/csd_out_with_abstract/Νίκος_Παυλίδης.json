            "Abstract": "Nash equilibrium constitutes a central solution concept in game theory. The task of detecting the Nash equilibria of a finite strategic game remains a challenging problem up-to-date. This paper investigates the effectiveness of three computational intelligence techniques, namely, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies, particle swarm optimization, as well as, differential evolution, to compute Nash equilibria of finite strategic games, as global minima of a real-valued, nonnegative function. An issue of particular interest is to detect more than one Nash equilibria of a game. The performance of the considered computational intelligence methods on this problem is investigated using multistart and deflection.",

Recent software advances have allowed collections of heterogeneous computers to be used as a concurrent computational resource. In this work we explore how differential evolution can be parallelized, using a ring-network topology, so as to improve both the speed and the performance of the method. Experimental results indicate that the extent of information exchange among subpopulations assigned to different processor nodes, bears a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, not all the mutation strategies of the differential evolution algorithm are equally sensitive to the value of this parameter.",

In light of the present financial crisis, such methods will become even more important. One of the outstanding issues in credit risk classification is population drift. This term refers to changes occurring in the population due to unexpected changes in economic conditions and other factors. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for the classification of credit applications that has the potential to adapt to population drift as it occurs. This provides the opportunity to update the credit risk classifier as new labelled data arrives. Assorted experimental results suggest that the proposed method has the potential to yield significant performance improvement over standard approaches, without sacrificing the classifier's descriptive capabilities.",

Combining this input space partitioning methodology with feedforward neural networks acting as local predictors for each identified cluster helps alleviate the problem of nonstationarity frequently encountered in real-life applications.

            "Abstract": "Dynamic model averaging (DMA) combines the forecasts of a large number of dynamic linear models (DLMs) to predict the future value of a time series. The performance of DMA critically depends on the appropriate choice of two forgetting factors. The first of these controls the speed of adaptation of the coefficient vector of each DLM, while the second enables time variation in the model averaging stage. In this paper we develop a novel, adaptive dynamic model averaging (ADMA) methodology. The proposed methodology employs a stochastic optimisation algorithm that sequentially updates the forgetting factor of each DLM, and uses a state-of-the-art non-parametric model combination algorithm from the prediction with expert advice literature, which offers finite-time performance guarantees. An empirical application to quarterly UK house price data suggests that ADMA produces more accurate forecasts than the benchmark autoregressive model, as well as competing DMA specifications.",

We show that the optimal univariate projection based on spectral connectivity converges to the vector normal to the maximum margin hyperplane through the data, as the scaling parameter is reduced to zero. This establishes a connection between connectivity as measured by spectral graph theory and maximal Euclidean separation. The computational cost associated with each eigen problem is quadratic in the number of data. To mitigate this issue, we propose an approximation method using microclusters with provable \u2026",

The learning goal is to associate the covariate with the optimal action at each instance, essentially learning to partition the covariate space adaptively. Applications of sensor management are frequently in environments in which the precise nature of the dynamics is unknown. In such settings, the sensor manager tracks the evolving environment by observing only the covariates and the consequences of the selected actions.

The model is built using robust functional principal component and least squares regression estimators. The performance of the functional linear regression model depends on the number of principal components used. We therefore introduce a consistent robust model selection procedure to choose the number of principal components. Our robust functional linear regression model can be used alongside an outlier detection procedure to effectively identify abnormal functional responses.

Unsupervised clustering algorithms have the desirable property of deciding on the number of partitions required to accurately segment the input space during the clustering process, thus relieving the user from making this ad hoc choice. Artificial neural networks, on the other hand, are powerful computational models that have proved their capabilities on numerous hard real-world problems.

In this work, we first propose a novel spectral-based subspace clustering algorithm that seeks to represent each point as a sparse convex combination of a few nearby points.

Our motivation for developing such a framework stems from the fact that typically either a small amount of labelled data is available in advance; or it is possible to label some points at a cost. The latter scenario is typically encountered in the process of validating a cluster assignment.

Complex binary sequences are derived by applying two binary transformations on realvalued sequences generated by the well known tent map. To identify short-term predictors we employ Genetic Algorithms. The dynamics of the tent map depend strongly on the value of the control parameter, r. The experimental results suggest that the same is true for the number of predictors. Despite the chaotic nature of the tent map and the complexity of the derived binary sequences, the results reported suggest that there exist settings in which an unexpectedly large number of predictive rules exists. Furthermore, rules that permit the risk free prediction of the value of the next bit are detected in a wide range of parameter settings. By incorporating noise in the data generating process, the rules that allow the risk free prediction of the next bit are eliminated. However, for small values of the variance of the Gaussian noise term there exist rules that retain much of their predictive power.",

The methods are unified by the approach of defining an optimal hyperplane to separate clusters, and deriving a projection index whose optimiser is the vector normal to this separating hyperplane. Divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms that can detect clusters defined in different subspaces are readily obtained by recursively bi-partitioning the data through such hyperplanes. Projecting onto the vector normal to the optimal hyperplane enables visualisations of the data that can be used to validate the partition at each level of the cluster hierarchy. PPCI also provides a simplified framework in which the clustering models can be modified in an interactive manner. Extensions to problems involving clusters which are not linearly separable, and to the problem of finding maximum hard margin hyperplanes for clustering are also discussed.",

The proposed minimum density hyperplane minimises the integral of the empirical probability density function along it, thereby avoiding intersection with high density clusters. We show that the minimum density and the maximum margin hyperplanes are asymptotically equivalent, thus linking this approach to maximum margin clustering and semi-supervised support vector classifiers. We propose a projection pursuit formulation of the associated optimisation problem which allows us to find minimum density hyperplanes efficiently in practice, and evaluate its performance on a range of benchmark data sets.

We therefore suggest modelling the dependency between speed and temperature in the process of identifying abnormalities. The engine temperature has a delayed response with respect to the engine speed, which we will model using robust functional regression. We then apply functional depth with respect to the residuals to rank the samples and identify the outliers. The effectiveness of the outlier detection algorithm is shown in a simulation study.

            "Abstract": "We propose a self\u2013adaptive probabilistic neural network model, which incorporates optimization algorithms to determine its spread parameters. The performance of the proposed model is investigated on two protein localization problems, as well as on two medical diagnostic tasks. Experimental results are compared with that of feedforward neural networks and support vector machines. Different sampling techniques are used and statistical tests are conducted to calculate the statistical significance of the results.",

            "Abstract": "The difficulty of measuring trade costs is well documented. We propose a nonlinear statespace model that enables us to extract information about changes in trade costs directly from real exchange rates. The model is well grounded in theory and nests numerous widely used empirical real exchange rate models. By employing two centuries of data on the Dollar-Sterling rate, we provide evidence of substantial variation in trade costs over time. Our results indicate that the process of economic integration that started after World War II has stopped during the last decades. We also contrast our results with a measure from the gravity literature and explore implications for the Purchasing Power Parity puzzle.",

            "Abstract": "We introduce an approach to divisive hierarchical clustering that is capable of identifying clusters in nonlinear manifolds. This approach uses the isometric mapping (Isomap) to recursively embed (subsets of) the data in one dimension, and then performs a binary partition designed to avoid the splitting of clusters. We provide a theoretical analysis of the conditions under which contiguous and high-density clusters in the original space are guaranteed to be separable in the one-dimensional embedding. To the best of our knowledge there is little prior work that studies this problem. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data sets show that hierarchical divisive clustering algorithms derived from this approach are effective.",

            "Abstract": "Advances in data technology have enabled streaming acquisition of real\u2010time information in a wide range of settings, including consumer credit, electricity consumption, and internet user behavior. Streaming data consist of transiently observed, temporally evolving data sequences, and poses novel challenges to statistical analysis. Foremost among these challenges are the need for online processing, and temporal adaptivity in the face of unforeseen changes, both smooth and abrupt, in the underlying data generation mechanism. In this paper, we develop streaming versions of two widely used parametric classifiers, namely quadratic and linear discriminant analysis. We rely on computationally efficient, recursive formulations of these classifiers. We additionally equip them with exponential forgetting factors that enable temporal adaptivity via smoothly down\u2010weighting the contribution of older data. Drawing on ideas \u2026",
