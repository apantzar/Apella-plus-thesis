In order to apply a median operator, some kind of ordering of vectors is required. Thus, a vector ordering scheme in the HSV color space using fuzzy if-then rules is described and then the median value operator is defined. The weighted fuzzy median is also studied. This filter performs significantly better in impulse noise removal, compared to other reported median filters. Experimental and comparative results of the application of the proposed filter and other similar reported filters, exhibit the superiority of the proposed method when applied to degraded color images.

In this paper a detailed discussion of different reported digital membership functions generators is presented.

The extensive and successful application of ICA in both the statistical and the signal processing community has helped us to realize that the independence property of these two primary signals facilitates the application of ICA for deconvolution by maximizing their statistical independence.

An efficient tool, which is widely used in CBIR, is that of color image histograms. The classic method of color histogram creation results in very large histograms with large variations between neighboring bins. Thus, small changes in the image might result in great changes in the histogram. Moreover, the fact that each color space consists of three components leads to 3-dimensional histograms. Manipulating and comparing 3D histograms is a complicated and computationally expensive procedure. The need, therefore, for reduction of the three dimensions to one could lead to efficient approaches. This procedure of projecting the 3D histogram onto one single-dimension histogram is called histogram linking. In this paper, a new fuzzy linking method of color histogram \u2026",

In case of multiple robotic systems, the complexity of such systems increases proportionally with the number of robots, due to the fact that all robots must act as one unit to complete one composite task, such as retaining a specific formation. The proposed path planner employs a combination of Cellular Automata (CA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) techniques in order to create collision-free trajectories for every robot of a team while their formation is kept immutable. The method reacts with obstacle distribution changes and therefore can be used in dynamical or unknown environments, without the need of a priori knowledge of the space.

            "Abstract": "Feature extraction from seismic accelerograms is a key issue in characterization of earthquake damage in structures. Until today, a number of effective classical parameters such as peak ground acceleration (PGA) and Arias intensity have been proposed for analyzing the earthquake motion records. The aim of this paper is to search for new crucial characteristic seismic parameters which provide information pertinent to the damage indicators of the structures. The first proposed parameter is the maximum amplitude (AHHT max) and the second is the mean amplitude (AHHT mean). Emphasis of our work has been placed on the use of the Hilbert\u2013Huang transform (HHT). A set of 13 natural accelerograms from worldwide well-known sites with strong seismic activity have been used. The HHT has been applied to the nonlinear and non-stationary data (earthquake recordings). Each complex seismic accelerogram is decomposed into several simple components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Using the IMFs a three-dimensional time\u2013frequency distribution of earthquake excitation is computed and two new seismic parameters are proposed and evaluated. After the numerical computation of all the seismic parameters (classical and proposed), nonlinear dynamic analysis is carried out to provide the post-seismic damage status of the structure under study. Two structural damage indices are utilized and the degree of interrelation among them and the seismic parameters is provided by correlation coefficients. Furthermore, two different reinforced concrete structures are examined. Results indicate the high correlation of the new seismic parameters \u2026",

The algorithm is applicable to both greyscale and colour images and outperforms similar reported techniques.The need to obtain a noise free image after transmission through a noisy channel or because of image capture devises malfunction is important for its further process. Several impulse detection algorithms that utilise fuzzy logic have been presented in the literature. An indeed efficient technique suitable for impulse noise detection and removal using fuzzy techniques has been reported in [I]. This first detects possible noise contaminated pixels in the image and then it uses a special kind of information redundancy-long range correlation within different parts of the image in order to suppress noise. The algorithm proposed in this paper uses more advanced fuzzy techniques in the noise detection part. Each pixel is characterised by a fuzzy flag that indicates the degree of noise presence by a more effective membership function. Furthermore, the shape of the function is modified, leading to a better discrimination against impulse noise affected pixels. The noise elimination part that follows operates only on the pixels that have been detected previously and its function is to add or subtract an appropriate value from the noisy pixels and restore them to their former state before noise contamination. According to the PSNR (peak-signal-to-noise-ratio) and MSE (Mean-squared-error) indexes, the proposed algorithm is effective and outperforms \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This research provides a comparative study of intelligent systems in structural damage assessment after the occurrence of an earthquake. Seismic response data of a reinforced concrete structure subjected to 100 different levels of seismic excitation are utilized to study the structural damage pattern described by a well-known damage index, the maximum inter-story drift ratio (MISDR). Through a time-frequency analysis of the accelerograms, a set of seismic features is extracted. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of three different techniques for the set of the proposed seismic features: an artificial neural network (ANN), a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system (FIS), and a Sugeno-type FIS. The performance of the models is evaluated in terms of the mean square error (MSE) between the actual calculated and estimated MISDR values derived from the proposed models. All models provide small MSE \u2026",

In this paper, an integrated evacuation system is described. The proposed system comprises three stages. The main stage includes an efficient computational tool based on Cellular Automata (CA) capable of simulating main features of pedestrian dynamics during the evacuation of large areas, supported by a multi-parameterised graphical-user interface (GUI). Moreover, an image-processing tracking algorithm is used for the calibration of the system providing all the necessary information about the number of individuals and their distribution in the under test area. Finally, the VLSI implementation of the proposed model is straightforward due to the simplicity of the CA rule, thus leading to the design of a dedicated processor.",

The method employs illumination estimation filtering, in order to assess the degree of \u201cwellexposedness\u201d of the pixels in the original image sequence. These initial estimations are then modulated by membership functions, which assign specific weights to the pixels of the image sequence. The membership functions favor the well-exposed pixels from each exposure, in order to maximize the visual information in the final result. The fused image is derived by interpolating between all the pixels, using the weights assigned by the membership functions. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm preserves well the information from each exposure of the sequence, resulting to an image with extended information both in the shadows and in the highlights.",

Fuzzy if-then rules for these two functions are presented to carry out the interpolation task.

Such noise tends to corrupt images and to obstruct any further analysis. An algorithm to detect and cancel such noise, using statistical methods, is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm is an adaptive mean filter, which filters out image regions that are found to be noise corrupted. The efficiency of the proposed filter was examined both qualitatively and quantitatively, by software simulation in several noisy conditions. The main advantage of the filter in hand is that it is appropriate for hardware implementation and can be easily incorporated to smart cameras. The hardware implementation of the filter is also presented in this paper. This implementation aims at time critical applications such as machine vision, inspection and visual surveillance.",

In addition, one new evaluation method is proposed which is directly related to ground truth optically scaled images. Digital image scaling is classified into the general interpolation scheme. However, due to the unique characteristics and wide applications of image scaling, a separate study of their evaluation methods is crucial. Two main classes of criteria are used as the basis for the assessments: The fidelity criteria and the computational complexity criteria. All methods are briefly described and comparative discussions are provided. This survey is helpful for an appropriate use of existing evaluation methods and for improving their performance as well as for systematically designing new evaluation methods.",

The aforementioned analysis is carried out only to those signal components which have a direct impact on the damages of the construction under study. A correlation study is conducted and shows that the extracted seismic intensity parameters are strongly correlated to the structural damage. Therefore, the new seismic intensity parameters constitute an efficient data set, which can be utilized to represent the seismic intensity of signals in an intelligent system for structural damage estimation.The aforementioned research is essentially the background work for creating a model for structural damage assessment. Having artificially generated accelerograms of any desired intensity available, along with an efficient data set of seismic parameters strongly related to structural damage, the research is completed with the implementation of a system suitable for damage estimation. All extracted seismic parameters and damage indices refer to a certain reinforced concrete (RC) frame model utilized throughout the present project. However, the research methodology is structured in such a way as to be general in nature thus, being in a form that renders it ready to be implemented in different engineering design provisions with only minor changes.",

Then, using a SOFM the dominant color components of each primary color band are obtained and a look up table is constructed containing all possible color triplets. The final dominant colors are extracted from the look-up table entries using a SOFM by specifying the number of output neurons equal to the number of the dominant colors. Thus, the final image has all the dominant color classes. Experimental and comparative results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed technique.",

A variety of embedded systems equipped with a digital image sensor, such as handheld cameras, mobile phones, and robots, can produce image sequences with an observed motion caused by two different types of movements: the smooth camera motion (intentional) and the unwanted shaking motion (jitter). The HHT has been successfully employed in applications for disaggregating signals into smaller portions with specific features (e.g., biomedical applications). Subsequently, for DIS, local motion vectors of an image sequence are calculated, and they are processed by the HHT in order to define both signals. The original signal is \u2026",

Aristotle first recognized the primacy of red, green and blue and stated that other colors are intermediate between these three, either mixtures of them or result from contrast between them. Twenty centuries later Young proposed the trichromatic theory of vision. He suggested that there exist three different kinds of receptors in the human eye each one tuned to one of the primary colors. In 1872, Maxwell demonstrated the reproduction of color scenes by projecting a scene simultaneously through red, green and blue filters. Hering's opponent-color theory suggests the existence of six independent color dimensions, which are perceived by three opponent color systems: black-white, red-green and yellow-blue. For many years the above theories were considered to be in competition until Mueller suggested that both Young's and Hering's theories \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Depth perception is one of the important tasks of a computer vision system. Stereo correspondence by calculating the distance of various points in a scene relative to the position of a camera allows the performance of complex tasks, such as depth measurements and environment reconstruction (Jain et al., 1995). The most common approach for extracting depth information from intensity images is by means of a stereo camera setup. The point-by-point matching between the two images from the stereo setup derives the depth images, or the so called disparity maps,(Faugeras, 1993). The computational demanding task of matching can be reduced to a one dimensional search, only by accurately rectified stereo pairs in which horizontal scan lines reside on the same epipolar plane, as shown in Figure 1. By definition, the epipolar plane is defined by the point P and the two camera optical centers OL and OR. This plane POLOR intersects the two image planes at lines EP1 and EP2, which are called epipolar lines. Line EP 1 is passing through two points: EL and PL, and line EP2 is passing through ER and PR respectively. EL and ER are called epipolar points and are the intersection points of the baseline OLOR with each of the image planes. The computational significance for matching different views is that for a point in the first image, its corresponding point in the second image must lie on the epipolar line, and thus the search space for a correspondence is reduced from 2 dimensions to 1 dimension. This is called the epipolar constraint. The difference on the horizontal coordinates of points PL and PR is the disparity. The disparity map consists of all \u2026",

The proposed method is applied to three spatial scales by employing different surround sizes. As a result, contrast enhancement is performed in different spatial frequencies of the original image.

In the second approach, a set of parameters are derived from each signal through computer analysis.

Soft morphological filters form a class of filters with many desirable properties.

In this paper a framework for soft morphological color image processing using a fuzzy model is presented and implemented in hardware. The basic morphological operations of soft erosion and dilation are defined by means of a vector ordering scheme that uses fuzzy if-then rules. Experimental results of the application to real color images demonstrate that the proposed operators are less sensitive to image distortion and to small variations in the shape of the objects and perform significantly better in impulse noise removal problems, compared to standard morphological operators \u2026",

Moreover, the level of structural damage caused by a severe earthquake depends on the characteristics of the oscillated structure. The aim of this study is to propose new crucial ground-motion parameters, which reflect the damage potential of the seismic excitations.

            "Abstract": "Crowd evacuation from constructions can be modelled with the use of Cellular Automata. The crowd consists of individuals and its behaviour is modelled by the response of each individual to a simple updating rule that directs a person to the nearest exit as facilitates any object avoidance. Individual interactions are defined locally while the crowd motion evolves. In this paper, this motion approach is based on the concept of virtual potential fields that are defined by the location of exits, other pedestrians or objects. Electric charges located at exit and obstacle positions generate such fields. Characteristic features of crowd dynamics, such as incoherent-to-coherent pedestrian motion, blockings in front of exits and mass behaviour are successfully simulated. Finally, the paper presents the main architectural concepts of the corresponding dedicated FPGA processor, as the major structural part of an integrated \u2026",

In this paper, pedestrian dynamics during the evacuation of large areas is simulated using a computational intelligent technique, based on Cellular Automata.

The crowd behaviour is artificially formatted by the response of each of these parts to the rule according to which each pedestrian reaches one of the possible exits. Furthermore, an efficient graphical user interface has been developed, in order to study various hypotheses concerning the pedestrians\u2019 activity features.

This paper examines the on-chip realisation of the proposed model. The hardware implementation of the CA model is based on FPGA logic. CA cells obtain discrete values, thus indicating their status; either free or occupied. Significant parameters of the local CA rule, such as the number and the allocation of the exits or the obstacles are inputs of the dedicated processor.

The features used for retrieval can be either primitive or semantic, but the extraction process must be predominantly automatic [1].

As a result, there is a huge amount of information which cannot be accessed or made use of unless it is organized [3].

Ganglion cells with four receptive field sizes tuned to different spatial frequencies are employed, which, adopting a new activation function, are independent of gradual illumination changes, such as shadows. The Otsu technique is then used for thresholding the outputs of the ganglion cells, resulting to the final segmentation of the characters from the background. The proposed method was quantitatively and qualitatively tested against other contemporary adaptive binarization techniques in various shadow levels and noise densities, and it was found to outperform them.",

In addition, they are compatible with the design spectra of a chosen seismic area. Results reveal that the seismic parameters of the synthetic earthquake accelerograms provide the same degree of correlation with the used damage indices as the natural earthquakes.

Results indicate that the proposed model is suitable for adaptive predictive control of the behavior of the construction for seismic signals and its accuracy rates up to 89.5%. The proposed method is compared to previous reported fuzzy techniques. Further study attempts to decrease the number of parameters used and maintain the same level of classification performance.",

However, the quantization error introduced in discrete signals presents problems, especially when dealing with small-size images. This results in the fact that the invariant properties of moments are compromised. In this paper, we present a technique suitable for the calculation of moments from a continuous signal, derived by piecewise polynomial interpolation of the corresponding discrete one. The computed moments exhibit significantly increased accuracy while requiring trivial computational effort. Zernike moments are then computed using the proposed scheme and are shown to display increased stability to geometrical transformations.",

These processing elements are a new set of orientation kernels appropriate for the discrete lattice of the hypercolumns. The Gestalt laws of proximity and continuity that describe the process of saliency extraction in the human brain are encoded by means of weights. These weights interconnect the kernels according to a novel connection pattern based on co-exponentiality. The output of every kernel is modulated by the outputs of its neighboring kernels, according to a new affinity function.

Moreover, the computational burden of all the systems carried out was compared and discussed both in terms of CPU time and number of computations.

A center-surround operator similar to the receptive fields of the ganglion cells of the retina is employed to create a new form of color histogram, the center-surround histogram (CSH). Unlike other proposed color histograms, the CSH takes into consideration only the visual signal surrounding the zero-crossings of an image. This reduces the processed amount of visual information and minimizes the computational burden. Furthermore, a combination of spatial and chromatic information of the image is also achieved. The method is compared to other contemporary methods for image retrieval, exhibiting better results in shorter computational times",

The aim of this paper is to present a new hardware-efficient disparity map computation, which is based on disparity space image processing using discrete dynamic systems. The hardware architecture of the proposed system was implemented on a high-end field programmable gate array (FPGA) device, offering real-time 3-D reconstruction speeds using a hardware aware architecture based on parallelism and process pipelining. The proposed architecture fulfills the requirements of real-world applications regarding resource usage, frame rates, and disparity resolution, while its implementation on an Altera Stratix IV family FPGA device can extract disparity maps of up to 1280 \u00d7 1024 pixels with up to 128 disparity \u2026",

The model combines electrostatic-induced potential fields to incorporate flexibility in the movement of pedestrians.

The method is divided into two steps; in the first step the K nearest neighbours are found using a fast procedure, whereas in the second step the test pattern is classified using a fuzzy distance measure. The fast K-NN algorithm proceeds in finding a region containing at least K neighbours around the test sample by utilising an ordered search procedure of the test point from three reference points. In the sequence the found region is modified in such a way that the real K nearest neighbours of the given point will be always inside it. Then a small number of distance calculations are required to identify the true K-nearest neighbours and the fuzzy measure is applied to classify the test pattern.

To achieve this, the binary images are first decomposed in a set of non-overlapping rectangular blocks of foreground pixels that have predefined maximum dimensions. Then off-line dilation and erosion of all rectangular blocks are arbitrary obtained and stored into suitable look-up array tables. By using the look up tables, the results of the morphological operations to the rectangular blocks are directly obtained. Thus, first all image blocks are replaced by their look-up array tables.

Lipschitz constants can be easily derived for simple functionals of the empirical measures, such as the Shannon or the Tsallis entropy. However, obtaining tight bounds for more generalized entropy functionals which cannot be decomposed into sums of identical terms is much more involved. The goal in this paper is the derivation of (empirical) Lipschitz constants for the maximum likelihood estimator of the family of Renyi entropies of order \u03bb > 0, \u03bb \u2260 1. Analytic solutions for the optimal constants are obtained for the most important special cases; namely, for 0 <; \u03bb <; 1, for 1 <; \u03bb <; 2 as well as for \u03bb = 2 (collision entropy) and \u03bb = 3 \u2026",

The proposed method describes chromaticity through a set of KCDMs applied on the associated chromaticity distribution function in the L* a* b* color space. The computational requirements of this approach are relatively small, compared to other methods addressing the issue of image retrieval using color features. This has a direct impact on the time required to index an image database. Furthermore, due to the short-length of KCDMs feature vector, there is a straight reduction on the time needed to retrieve the whole database. Comparing to previous relative works, KCDMs provide a more accurate representation of the L* a* b* chromaticity distribution functions, since no numerical approximation is involved in deriving the moments. Furthermore, unlike other orthogonal moments, Krawtchouk moments can be employed to extract local features of a chromaticity diagram. This property makes them more analytical near the centre of mass of the chromaticity distribution. The theoretical framework is validated by experiments which prove the superior performance of KCDMs above other methods.",

            "Abstract": "This chapter presents the development of a number of different and complimentary pattern classification techniques, based on parallel cellular automata architectures. The concepts of pattern classification and recognition are extremely crucial in the diverse fields of today's technology. The ability to successfully classify and to recognize patterns is an imperative issue in intelligent and expert systems. A pattern is defined as a set of data, ordered in any number of dimensions. A pattern class is a collection of patterns that share some common features and characteristics. Patterns may represent images, sound data, data describing the input and output of a control system, the inference rules of an expert system and, in general, any ordered set of data. The appropriate solution for applications that involve complex pattern classes and require fast and accurate classification is the development of parallel \u2026",
