Our methods include the Weierstrassian representation of the nth derivative, properties of the Laguerre-P\u00f3lya class of entire functions, and the Laguerre inequalities. Some similar results for the zeros of the first and second derivative of the Struve function of the first kind H\u03bd are also proved. The main results obtained in this paper generalize and complement some classical results on the zeros of Bessel functions of the first kind. Some open problems related to Hurwitz theorem on the zeros of Bessel functions are also proposed, which may be of interest for further research.",

            "Abstract": "Recently R. Diaz and E. Pariguan introduced [2] the k-generalized Gamma function \u0393k (x), Beta function Bk (x, y) and Zeta function \u03b6k (x, s) and gave some identities which they satisfy. We give some more properties and inequalities for the above k-generalized functions.",

            "Abstract": "We prove that for  all zeros of the  th derivative of the Bessel function of the first kind  are real. Moreover, we show that the positive zeros of the  th and  th derivative of the Bessel function of the first kind  are interlacing when  and  is a natural number or zero. Our methods include the Weierstrassian representation of the  th derivative, properties of the Laguerre-P\u00f3lya class of entire functions, and the Laguerre inequalities. Some similar results for the zeros of the first and second derivatives of the Struve function of the first kind  are also proved. The main results obtained in this paper generalize and complement some classical results on the zeros of Bessel and Struve functions of the first kind. Some open problems related to Hurwitz's theorem on the zeros of Bessel functions are also proposed.",

The authors have used different methods and the obtained results have been compared each other. All of these are given in [2] and [12]. So we mostly refer them and compare our results with the bounds given in [2, 9\u201312].",
