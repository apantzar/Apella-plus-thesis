In particular, we measure the received signal strength (RSS) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of acoustic signals reflected by an underwater target. Measurements from different positions of the transmitter with respect to the UICSA are organized in a three mode real-valued tensor. Then, the conformity of each entry with respect to all other data points in the tensor is calculated based on recursively refined calculations of L1-norm tensor subspaces. Conformity values are then used for the detection of an underwater target. We evaluate the data conformity of RSS and AoA recordings acquired from the testbed deployment of a seven-element UICSA prototype and three underwater acoustic transmitters at Florida Atlantic University. We show for the first time that conformity \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Based on the theory of locally optimum detection we identified a spread-spectrum receiver architecture that consists of an adaptive non-linear chip-level pre-processor followed by an adaptive linear filter post-processor. The non-linear front-end protects against impulsive, non-Gaussian disturbance. The adaptive linear filter post-processor suppresses unknown highly correlated spread-spectrum SS interference. To achieve adaptive, rapid, and effective SS interference suppression from a small number of input observations, we defined a new class of linear filters that we called Auxiliary-Vector AV filters. We view this development as a breakthrough in the field of adaptive signal processing theory. When the input autocorrelation matrix is unknown and estimated from a limited set of input data as in all real-life adaptive signal processing applications, Auxiliary-Vector filters are shown to outperform all other filter estimator means in the literature. We addressed successfully the critical problem of determining an automated, theoretically derived, rule for the selection of the best number of auxiliary vectors AVs for a given data record of input observations. We anticipate that this development will attract a great deal of interest in the Auxiliary-Vector filtering technique. Based on the principles of AV-filtering we proposed and analyzed theoretically structures that are self-synchronized in the sense that adaptive synchronization and demodulation are viewed and treated as an integrated receiver operation. As a major application, we addressed the problem of navigation data demodulation by an adaptive jam-resistant GPS receiver that utilizes a bank of linear-tap \u2026",

However, despite its many strengths, PCA is known to have a major drawback: it is very sensitive to the presence of outliers among the processed data. To counteract the impact of outliers in data analysis, researchers have been long working on robust modifications of PCA. One of the most successful (and promising) PCA alternatives is L1-PCA. L1-PCA relies on the L1-norm of the processed data and, thus, tames any outliers that may exist in the dataset. Experimental studies in various applications have shown that L1-PCA (i) attains similar performance to PCA when the processed data are outlier-free and (ii) maintains sturdy resistance against outliers when the processed data are corrupted.

However, a signature set that is TSC-optimum (i.e. achieves the lower bound on TSC), doesn't necessarily have a low cross-correlation spectrum. Hence, for various system loads there may be users that experience high probability of error due to high cross-correlation of their assigned signature to others in the set. In this paper we present a search method to obtain new optimum TSC binary signature sets with low cross-correlation spectrum. We also show, based on our search method, that if we relax the TSC optimality constraint, codes with better cross-correlation spectrum may be found.

In this present work, closed-form expressions are derived for the MSC, C/sub sum/, and TAE of minimum-TSC binary signature sets.

Furthermore, orthogonal chirp transform (OCT) and discrete orthogonal chirp transform (DOCT) are developed for continuous and discrete implementations of MCDM systems. In addition, we design a maximum likelihood (ML) receiver capable of synchronization, channel estimation, and symbol detection. MU-MCDM systems consider factors, including preamble length, number of subcarriers, portion of pilots, guard period, and multiuser access scenarios to adapt time-variant UW-A channels. The bit-error-rate (BER) performance and adaptive transmission are evaluated in simulation studies. Therefore, we have demonstrated MCDM modulation systems in simulations that they improve performance of UW-A communications adaptively and support multiple users. Moreover, MCDM architectures can be applied in higher order modulations for providing higher transmission rates in UW-A channels.",

We establish that, under a (colored) Gaussian assumption on the transform domain host data, the same derived signature minimizes host distortion for any target message recovery error rate and maximizes the Shannon capacity of the covert steganographic link. Then, we derive jointly optimal signature and linear processor designs for SS embedding in linearly modified transform domain host data and demonstrate orders of magnitude improvement over current SS steganographic practices. Optimized multisignature/multimessage embedding in the same host data is studied as well",

Neither the original host nor the embedding signature is assumed available. We demonstrate that for hidden messages of sufficient length (data sample support), recovery can be achieved with probability of error close to what may be attained with known embedding signature and known original host autocorrelation matrix. For small hidden messages, the signature estimate calculated by the iterative generalized least squares procedure can be fed as initial value to a (computationally costly) expectation-maximization signature identification scheme that we derive. Message recovery can again be carried out successfully by means of a linear sample-matrix-inversion minimum-mean-square-error receiver.",

Computationally, the algorithm is a simple, noninvasive, recursive procedure that avoids any form of explicit autocorrelation matrix inversion, decomposition, or diagonalization. Theoretical analysis reveals basic properties of the algorithm and establishes formal convergence. When the input autocorrelation matrix is replaced by a conventional sample-average (positive definite) estimate, the algorithm effectively generates a sequence of MVDR filter estimators; the bias converges rapidly to zero and the covariance trace rises slowly and asymptotically to the covariance trace of the familiar sample-matrix \u2026",

We further simplify the requirements of the relay node by employing amplify-and-forward relaying where the relay amplifies the incoming signal and retransmits at a different frequency assignment. We implemented DAF relaying using the GNU Radio software platform and Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs).

Thus, a different number of chips per bit can be used for the transmission of each scalable layer. For a given fixed energy value per chip and chip rate, the selection of a spreading code length affects the transmitted energy per bit and bit rate for each scalable layer.

Combined with the power limitations of THz transceivers, this results in very short communication distances. Moreover, the absorption by water vapor molecules further splits the THz band in multiple transmission windows, which shrink as the transmission distance increases.

Robust direction finding of underwater acoustic signals transmitted from known locations may enable accurate localization of a receiver node underwater, as well as enhance link communication rate by instructing the receiver to listen for transmissions from a specific direction. We propose to estimate the DoA of underwater acoustic signals via subspace methods, executed at a receiver array, that involve performing what is known as principal-component analysis (PCA) for finding the L2-norm principal vector subspace of the recorded signal snapshots. However, in practice coherence loss, which typically arises from dynamic wavefront fluctuations due to internal waves, scattering from the sea surface and/or bottom and other unknown environmental parameters, may result in recorded signal snapshots that may be corrupted by faulty measurements, leading to an inaccurate estimation of the DoA and source position. We propose to model the loss of coherence as multiplicative random noise applied to the measured acoustic signal. In such cases, L2-norm PCA methods suffer from significant performance degradation. Motivated by the resistance of novel L1-norm-derived subspaces against the impact of irregular, highly deviating points in reduceddimensionality data approximations, we propose to employ L1-norm (absolute error) maximumprojection PCA of the antenna array measurements and evaluate the performance of a novel, outlierresistant DoA estimation algorithm.

An SS receiver structure is proposed that consists of a vector of adaptive chip-based Hampel nonlinearities followed by an adaptive auxiliary-vector linear tap-weight filter. The nonlinear receiver front end adapts itself to the unknown prevailing noise environment providing robust performance over a wide range of underlying noise distributions. The adaptive auxiliary-vector linear tap-weight filter allows rapid SS interference suppression with a limited data record.

The procedure starts with the linear transformation of the array response scanning vector by the input autocorrelation matrix. Then, successive orthogonal maximum cross-correlation auxiliary vectors are calculated to form a basis for the scanner-extended signal subspace. As a performance evaluation example, our studies for uncorrelated sources demonstrate a gain in the order of 15 dB over MUSIC, 7 dB over ESPRIT, and 3 dB over the grid-search maximum likelihood DOA estimator at probability of resolution 0.9 with a ten-element array and reasonably small observation data records.

A solution for joint routing and spread-spectrum channelization is proposed as a localized approximation of the throughput-maximizing problem.

Consider an arbitrary input signal vector space and a given information bearing signal vector to be protected or recovered in the presence of multiuser or other forms of heavy interference. Based strictly on statistical conditional optimization principles, we developed an iterative algorithm that starts from the conventional matched-filter correlator and generates a sequence of linear filters auxiliary-vecto filters that converges to the exact MS-optimum solution. At each iteration step, the filter is given as a direct function of the input autocorrelation matrix, the signal vector waveform to be protected, and the filter at the previous iteration. When the autocorrelation matrix is sample-average estimated from a short data record, this procedure offers the means for effective control over the filter estimator bias versus co-variance trade-off. For a fixed data record size the filter estimators in this sequence have rapidly decreasing bias and gracefully increasing variance. They outperform other known estimators such as Sample-Matrix-lnversion SMI, Diagonal-Loading DL SMI, RLS, LMS, reduced-rank eigenvector decomposition, and multistage nested Wiener filter. While all of the above estimators converge to the optimum MMSEMVDR solution for infinitely long data records, for any given finite data set there is at least one AV filter estimator in the sequence that outperforms all SMI, DL-SMI, RLS, LMS, reduced-rank eigenvector and multistage nested Wiener filter estimators.

The closed-form expression is valid for any maximum number of (re-)transmission rounds L allowed by the protocol and may play a key role thereafter in optimizing power allocation. Since the closed-form expression is complicated for large L, an approximation of the average total transmission power is developed which is asymptotically tight at high SNR.

Input voice (or other) signals are modeled as non-stationary processes. The technical problem under consideration becomes blind deconvolution with non-stationary inputs, as it manifests itself in the specific application of digital audio recording equipment classification. Experimental results demonstrate over 99.2% accuracy in identification of the recording devices.",

The developments are oriented specifically toward the low cost-yet effective-decoding of (high rate) finite geometry LDPC codes. The decoding procedure updates the hard-decision received vector iteratively in search of a valid codeword in the vector space. Only one bit is changed in each iteration and the bit selection criterion combines the number of failed checks and the reliability of the received bits. Prior knowledge of the signal amplitude and noise power is not required. An optimal mechanism to avoid infinite loops in the search is also proposed. Our studies show that the algorithm achieves an appealing performance versus complexity trade-off for finite geometry LDPC codes.",

In this paper, we consider the adaptive optimization of the user signature assignment such that the output SINR of the MMSE filter is maximized under a transmitter power constraint. In the context of binary signatures, the complexity of the signature optimization procedure is exponential in the processing gain. A low-cost suboptimum adaptive binary signature assignment algorithm is derived based on conditional optimization principles.

Neither the original host nor the embedding signatures are assumed available.

            "Abstract": "n this paper, we consider the transmission of video over wireless direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) channels. A layered (scalable) video source codec is used and each layer is transmitted over a different CDMA channel. Spreading codes with different lengths are allowed for each CDMA channel (multirate CDMA). Thus, a different number of chips per bit can be used for the transmission of each scalable layer. For a given fixed energy value per chip and chip rate, the selection of a spreading code length affects the transmitted energy per bit and bit rate for each scalable layer. An MPEG-4 source encoder is used to provide a two-layer SNR scalable bitstream. Each of the two layers is channel-coded using Rate-Compatible Punctured Convolutional (RCPC) codes. Then, the data are interleaved, spread, carrier-modulated and transmitted over the wireless channel. A multipath Rayleigh fading \u2026",

We have demonstrated effectiveness of MCDM systems both in simulation and experimental results, comparing to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

We consider two scenarios. First, we optimize the relay location for the DAF cooperative relaying with any given power assignment at the source and the relay. Second, we further consider relay location optimization with optimum power assignment in which the performance of the DAF relaying is further enhanced with the price of higher complexity.

A new method for the optimization of binary spreading codes under a rank-2 approximation of the inverse interference autocovariance matrix is presented where the rank-2-optimal binary code is obtained in lower than quadratic complexity. Significant SINR performance improvement is demonstrated over the common binary hard-limited eigenvector design which is seen to be equivalent to the rank-1-optimal solution.",

The procedure generates iteratively channel estimates and data decisions with guaranteed convergence. No pilot signaling is required (blind/unsupervised scheme), except for one-shot overall data frame sign/phase ambiguity resolution. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by field tests with SM-975 Teledyne-Benthos SMART modems. Experimental results show that the proposed JOCEDD procedure can efficiently recover transmitted data and significantly enhance reliability of underwater acoustic communications.",

For classification, we seek a non-negative sparse representation in the final low-dimensional tensor subspace and determine the class of an unknown face image by minimum sparse representation error.

            "Abstract": "L1-norm Principal-Component Analysis (L1-PCA) of real-valued data has attracted significant research interest over the past decade. L1-PCA of complex-valued data remains to date unexplored despite the many possible applications (in communication systems, for example). In this paper, we establish theoretical and algorithmic foundations of L1-PCA of complex-valued data matrices. Specifically, we first show that, in contrast to the real-valued case for which an optimal polynomial-cost algorithm was recently reported by Markopoulos, Karystinos, and Pados, complex L1-PCA is formally NP-hard. Then, casting complex L1-PCA as a unimodular optimization problem, we present the first two suboptimal algorithms in the literature for its solution. Extensive experimental studies included in this paper illustrate the sturdy resistance of complex L1-PCA against faulty measurements/outliers in the processed data.",

As a performance evaluation example, our studies for uncorrelated sources demonstrate a gain in the order of 15dB over MUSIC, 7dB over ESPRIT, and 3dB over the grid-search maximum likelihood DOA estimator at probability of resolution 0.9 with a ten-element array and reasonably small observation data records.

Our algorithmic developments toward spectrally-efficient cognitive networking are software optimized on heterogeneous multi-core general-purpose processor-based SDR architectures by \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Second-order multipath channel estimation procedures for direct-sequence code-division-multiple-access (DS/CDMA) communications induce phase ambiguity that necessitates differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) modulation and detection. The maximum likelihood (ML) single-symbol multiuser DPSK/CDMA detector is derived with direct generalization to multiple-symbol (block) multiuser DPSK/CDMA detection. Exponential complexity requirements limit the use of the ML rule to theoretical lower-bound bit-error-rate benchmarking. Linear filter DPSK demodula-tors are viewed as a practical alternative. Phase-ambiguous RAKE filtering followed by RAKE-output differential detection is considered. The familiar minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) PSK/CDMA filter (de-signed for minimum filter output energy under the constraint of distortionless response in a given RAKE vector direction) adds the valuable feature of active interference suppression; however, minimum disturbance variance at the differential logic output can be claimed formally only in the absence of multipath (no inter-symbol-interference). Short-data-record adaptive alternatives to costly and slow adaptive MVDR implementations are sought in the context of auxiliary-vector (AV) filtering. Numerical and simulation studies illustrate the developments.",

The Tanner graph of a generalized polygon LDPC code is highly symmetric, inherits the diameter size of the parent generalized polygon, and has minimum (one half) diameter-to-girth ratio. We show formally that when the diameter is four or six or eight all codewords have even Hamming weight. When the generalized polygon has in addition equal number of points and lines, we see that the non-regular polygon based code construction has minimum distance that is higher at least by two in comparison with the dual regular polygon code of the same rate and length. A new minimum distance bound is presented for codes from non-regular polygons of even diameter and equal number of points and lines. Finally, we prove that all codes derived from finite classical generalized quadrangles are quasi \u2026",

In this paper, we show that we can efficiently and effectively approach the error rate performance of the optimum multiuser detector as follows. We utilize a multiuser zero-forcing or MMSE filter as a pre-processor whose output magnitude provides a reliability measure for each user bit decision.

We prove, however, that the case of engineering interest of fixed dimension D and asymptotically large sample support N is not and we present an optimal algorithm of complexity O(N(exp D)). We generalize to multiple L1-max-projection components and present an explicit optimal L1 subspace calculation algorithm in the form of matrix nuclear-norm evaluations.

The developments are oriented specifically toward low-cost, yet effective, decoding of (high-rate) finite-geometry (FG) LDPC codes. The decoding procedure updates iteratively the hard-decision received vector in search of a valid codeword in the vector space. Only one bit is changed in each iteration, and the bit-selection criterion combines the number of failed checks and the reliability of the received bits. Prior knowledge of the signal amplitude and noise power is not required. An optional mechanism to avoid infinite loops in the search is also proposed. Our studies show that the algorithm achieves an appealing tradeoff between performance and complexity for FG-LDPC codes.",

A set of equations is derived that describe the optimal transmission power sequence and its optimality is shown based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Theorem. The set of equations enables an exact recursive calculation of the optimal transmission power per round, and the calculation complexity is fixed regardless of the maximum number of (re)transmission rounds allowed in the H-ARQ protocol. Compared to the conventional equal power assignment strategy, the optimal power assignment scheme achieves the same average delay with much less total transmission power.

Our optimality criteria are Host distortion, recovery error rate, and the Shannon capacity of the covert channel. Additionally, we introduced for the first time the concept of multiusermulti-signature steganography. Then, we developed counter-measures to optimal multiuser steganography in the form of active message extraction and passive stegonon-stego decision steganalysis. We concluded that optimal data hiding, as described in the report, offers vast improvement in recovery error rateShannon capacity versus medium distortion and enables highly effective multi-signature embedding different-potentially-hidden messages for different POCs along the chain of command etc.. In the context of active steganalysis, the developed M-IGLS hidden message extraction algorithm can destroy conventional SS steganography. However, our own optimal SS embedding is resistant to M-IGLS steganalysis attacks, especially for small hidden messages. Our new passive binary hypothesis testing steganalysis procedure offers close to 95 identification success rate at about 1 false alarm rate when used on hosts with conventionally embedded messages.Descriptors:",

In contrast, arguably against common expectation, the widely used Kasami sets are not PTSC optimal in general.
