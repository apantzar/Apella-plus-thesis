The analysis shows that the best upper limit for the interval coincides with the one for the original version. The lower limit for the interval remains a free variable of the process. We provide experimental results that indicate practical values for that bound.

We prove a similar result in the case that the multipliers are chosen uniformly at random from (ZZ/NZZ)\u00d7 and N is the product of two distinct primes. The last result holds in the more general case when N is squarefree and a technical condition related to the prime factors of N holds. The condition is related to the distribution of the solutions of a linear equation modulo N. The Hidden Number Problem modulo the product of two primes, with multipliers chosen from (ZZ/NZZ)\u00d7, is related to the bit security of the most significant bits of the RSA and Rabin functions. Our solution of the Hidden Number Problem implies that computing roughly (log (N)) 1/2 bits of the RSA and Rabin functions is equivalent to computing the entire values.",

We present the multiplication tables and complexities of Gauss periods of type (n, t) for all n and t = 3, 4, 5 over any finite field and give a slightly weaker result for Gauss periods of type (n, 6). In addition, we give some general results on the so-called cyclotomic numbers, which are intimately related to the structure of Gauss periods. We also present the general form of a normal basis obtained by the trace of any normal basis in a finite extension field. Then, as an application of the trace construction, we give upper bounds on the complexity of the trace of a Gauss period of type (n, 3).",

To establish the exact complexity, not only of the discrete logarithm problem but also of its relatives, the Diffie\u2013Hellman (DH) problem and the decision DH problem, is of some importance. These problems can be set in a variety of groups, and in some of these they can assume different characteristics. This work considers the bit complexity of the DH and the decision DH problems. It was previously shown by Boneh and Venkatesan that it is as hard to compute O (n) of the most significant bits of the DH function, as it is to compute the whole function, implying that if the DH function is difficult then so is computing this number of bits of it. The main result of this paper is to show that if the decision DH problem is hard then computing the two most significant bits of the DH function is hard. To place the result in \u2026",

This work similarly determines provable upper bounds on the sizes of the two key parameters in the DSA for which the system can be broken. Specifically if about half of the total number of bits in the secret and ephemeral keys, assuming contiguous unknown bits in each key, are known, the system can be shown to be insecure. The same technique shows that if about half of the total number of bits in two ephemeral keys are known, again assumed contiguous unknown bits in each key, but with no knowledge of the secret key, the system can be shown to be insecure.",

Using the trace of an optimal normal element in  , we provide low complexity normal elements in  , with m = n/k. We give theorems for Type I and Type II optimal normal elements. When Type I normal elements are used with m = n/2, m odd and q even, our construction gives Type II optimal normal elements in  ; otherwise we give low complexity normal elements. Since optimal normal elements do not exist for every extension degree m of every finite field  , our results could have a practical impact in expanding the available extension degrees for fast arithmetic using normal bases.",

It is shown that if the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem is hard in these groups, then the two most significant bits of the Diffie-Hellman function are secure. Under the weaker assumption of the computational (rather than decisional) hardness of the Diffie-Hellman problems, only about (log p)1/2 bits are known to be secure.",

            "Abstract": "The discrete logarithm problem has been the basis of numerous cryptographic schemes. The security of those cryptosystems is based on the presumed intractability of the discrete logarithm problem in some group. The subject of this thesis is the discrete logarithm problem in the multiplicative group of finite fields and in the group of points of elliptic curves over finite fields. The most successful algorithm for computing discrete logarithms in finite fields is the index calculus method. A significant parameter of the method is the factor base, which has invariably been chosen to contain all irreducible elements up to some size. Until now, this choice had not been questioned. We attempt a rigorous study of the behavior of the algorithm in the case that a different factor base is used. This leads us to generalize the notion of smoothness, and prove density theorems for those generalized smooth polynomials analogous to the existing once for smooth polynomials. Subsequently, we use them to analyze the index calculus method, that operates with a non-smooth factor base. The analysis shows that the more general version of the method has the same asymptotic running time, as the traditional version. For the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves, our goal is to obtain a polynomial time reduction to the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields. A complete such reduction has been given by Frey and R\u00fbck. Our reduction is a generalization of that of Menezes, Okamoto, and Vanstone.We present a generalization of the Weil pairing, that is parameterized by an isogeny   y . Then we specialize the isogeny to 1 - [straight phi], where [straight phi] is the Frobenius \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We review the construction of a generalization of the Weil pairing, which is non-degenerate and bilinear, and use it to construct a reduction from the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves to the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields. We show that the new pairing can be computed efficiently for curves with trace of Frobenius congruent to 2 modulo the order of the base point. This leads to an efficient reduction for this class of curves. The reduction is as simple to construct as that of Menezes et al. (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 39, 1993), and is provably equivalent to that of Frey and R\u00fcck (Math. Comput. 62 (206) (1994) 865).",

The relationship of this result to the enumeration of certain types of irreducible polynomials over fields of characteristic two or three and to the weights in the dual of a Melas code is considered. It is argued that the expressions obtained for the trace functions, while simply related to the Kloosterman sums, can be more directly useful than the exponential sums themselves in certain applications. In addition, they enjoy properties that are of independent interest.",
