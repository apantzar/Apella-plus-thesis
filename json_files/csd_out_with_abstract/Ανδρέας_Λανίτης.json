In this paper we describe a method for generating 3D models representing medical structures, using data derived from a single image showing a single cross-section of an object. The proposed method utilizes a 3D deformable model that is allowed to deform in order to approximate the shape of a medical structure as seen in a single cross-section, allowing in this way the estimation of the complete 3D structure of the object. Experimental results using synthetic data prove the potential of this approach in generating 3D pelvis models.",

In particular we focus our attention on the development of a contact-less interactive system that can be used for the exploration and visualization of artefacts with archeological interest, using a GIS-based system. The basis of our approach is a tracking algorithm that is able to track head movements of the user. Based on head motion it is possible to move a cursor and select different options, in order to enable data exploration and presentation. The work for this project is in progress. We are currently in the process of implementing an information retrieval system that allows users to retrieve and view information related to Cypriot archaeological artefacts. Although the primary scope of our work is to develop a system that can be used in museums, it is possible to use such systems in other environments such as airports, information kiosks and for general internet browsing. The only extra requirement for using our system is a standard web camera used for capturing images of the user. When compared with other systems currently is use in similar applications (i.e. systems using touch screens), the proposed system offers similar functionality at significantly reduced cost. The results of a preliminary experimental investigation, demonstrate the potential of using the proposed system in applications involving the dissemination of cultural heritage related information.",

            "Abstract": "The use of 3D data in face image processing applications received increased attention during the recent years. However, the development of efficient 3D face processing applications (i.e face recognition) relies on the availability of appropriate 3D scanning technology that enables real time, accurate, non-invasive and low cost 3D data acquisition. 3D scanners currently available do not fulfill the necessary criteria. As an alternative to using 3D scanners, 3D face reconstruction techniques, capable of generating a 3D face from a single or multiple face images, can be used. Although numerous 3D reconstruction techniques were reported in the literature so far the performance of such algorithms was not evaluated in a systematic approach. In this paper we describe a 3D face reconstruction performance evaluation framework that can be used for assessing the performance of 3D face reconstruction techniques. This approach is based on the projection of a set of existing 3D faces into 2D using different orientation parameters, and the subsequent reconstruction of those faces. The comparison of the actual and reconstructed faces enables the definition of the reconstruction accuracy and the investigation of the sensitivity of an algorithm to different conditions. The use of the proposed framework is demonstrated in evaluating the performance of two 3D reconstruction techniques. Springer ScienceBusiness Media B.V. 2010.",

The problem of dissemination of child pornographic material could be addressed using dedicated image detection algorithms capable of rating the inappropriateness level of images exchanged through computer networks so that images with inappropriate content involving children are blocked. However, the complexity of the image detection task coupled with the nonexistence of suitable datasets, inhibit the development of efficient algorithms that can be used for detecting offensive images containing children. To deal with the problem, we propose a methodological approach that can be used for supporting the development of child pornography detectors through the generation of synthetic datasets and through the \u2026",

Typical examples include the recognition of criminals whose facial images are captured by surveillance cameras. In such cases a significant part of the subjects face is occluded making the process of identification extremely difficult, both for automatic face recognition systems and human observers. In this paper we propose a face recognition algorithm, which can be used for identifying individuals with hidden facial parts. During the face recognition procedure, occluded facial regions are detected so that the model-based face recognition algorithm implemented makes use of information only from the non-occluded facial regions. With our approach information from occluded facial regions is not utilized during the process of face recognition hence the occlusions do not destruct the recognition process and as a result the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Magnetic Resonance (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) and Ultrasound (US) are three of the most commonly used clinical imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to establish a Quality Assurance program for MRI, CT and US scanners. A well-designed quality assurance program is of utmost importance in the clinical setting, because it indicates whether diagnostic imaging modalities meet the minimum criteria of acceptable performance and because it helps determine those scanner parameters that need adjustment in order to ensure optimum performance. Quality assurance programs that rely on manual data collection and analysis are tedious and time consuming and are often abandoned due to the significant workload required for their implementation. In this paper we describe an integrated software system for automating the process of data collection and management in Quality Assurance for diagnostic radiological imaging. The developed system is comprised of two main units: The Image Processing Unit (IPU) and the Data Management Unit (DMU). The IPU is used for analysing images from different diagnostic modalities in order to extract measurements. The IPU is dynamically linked to the DMU so that measurements are transferred directly to the DMU. This process allows the generation of quality assurance reports for all such modalities.",

The e-learning and pedagogical effectiveness of multimedia projects with Byzantine art content, the visualisation of Byzantine imagery, the deeper and devoted research in issues like the aesthetics of Byzantine art, the spiritual communication of Byzantine art promote the need of a technocultural approach synthesized by two distinct elements, multimedia and Byzantine art. With a proposed evaluation experiment for a website with a Byzantine theme, we investigate the reactions and perceptions of young people for Byzantine art, in order to create design guidelines applied on future projects with relevant content. The results of this survey evaluation study, targeting a group of Cypriot young people 15-30 age, superimpose the argument that multimedia e-learning projects specialising in Byzantine art, should promote design strategies that will enchase the communication of Byzantine art in new media.",

The ability to produce accurate age progressed faces is important in a number of key applications including the identification of missing persons, development of age-invariant face recognition systems and automatic update of photographs in smart documents. Automatic age-progression is a challenging task, mainly due to the diversity of aging variation and the dependence of the aging process on external factors that include health conditions and hereditary trends. Recently an escalated research interest in the area is recorded and as a result a number of face aging algorithms were reported in the literature. In this paper we present key techniques reported in the literature with emphasis on techniques developed by the author. In particular we present a face-aging algorithm based on the definition of aging trajectories (the so called aging functions) and algorithms based on modelling the distributions of faces belonging to different subjects and different age groups. Special emphasis is given to the topic of performance evaluation of age progression methodologies based on dedicated metrics. Work in this area is considered an important research direction in the field, since it will enable the evolution of the most promising age progression methodologies.",

Biometric systems aim to extract information about attributes such as identity, emotional state and age or to interpret human actions such as speech, handwritten text and behaviour.The endless possibilities in embedding biometric modules in existing systems along with the great potential of developing contemporary applications involving biometric units have caused a dramatic rise in the market share of biometric systems. At the same time, the general topic of biometrics has attracted a considerable amount of interest by researchers who aim to develop new methods for extending the effectiveness, accuracy and scope of application of biometric systems. Among different possible applications of biometric systems the problem of secure access is regarded as a major problem and as a result on many occasions biometric systems are associated with identity recognition and/or verification. Indeed the increased need for fast, secure and automatic access to real and electronic sites has prompted the development of biometric systems that can replace traditional identity verification methods. The major difficulty in developing biometric systems is the variability encountered in biometric traits that causes variation in biometric features belonging to the same class, a situation known as intra-class variation. A successful biometric system should be able to isolate and use the right type of variability for a particular application while other types of variation, which impede the process of correct interpretation \u2026",

Usually these techniques require human expertise for initializing the search and in addition they require high quality, noise free images so that the image-based landmark location is successful. With our work we propose the use of neural network methods for learning the geometry of sets of points so that it is possible to predict the positions of all required landmarks based on the positions of a small subset of the landmarks rather than using image-data during the process of landmark-location.

Given a damaged face, the complete three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the face is reconstructed using data from the non-damaged facial parts and the texture of the damaged areas is restored. A key aspect of the proposed method is the use of a customized 3D deformable face model suitable for representing the geometry of Byzantine faces, the so-called Byzantine Style Specific Model (BSSM). A BSSM is generated by enforcing rule-based constraints on a deformable model trained using 3D scans of human faces. The use of a BSSM ensures that the Byzantine style is preserved during the process of shape restoration.",

This paper addresses the possibility to cultivate reflection and empathy skills using a VR based framework targeting to maximize the professional development of teachers. Reflection and empathy are skills of paramount importance for teachers and an integral part of their professional development. The current research aims to investigate possible differences in cultivating reflection and empathy skills between participants who used a VR system and the control group who were trained in a real classroom environment. Experimental results indicate that the participants using the virtual classroom environment were able to better reflect and empathize with the students whereas participants from the control group tended to be more undecided. Moreover, the VR system gave the participants the opportunity to enter the students' virtual body and understand the different perspectives affecting at a higher level the reflection process than the control group.",

In this paper we describe a prototype system that aims to provide paraplegics the opportunity to use computer systems without the need for additional invasive hardware. The proposed system is a multi-modal system combining both visual and speech input. Visual input is provided through a standard web camera used for capturing face images showing the user of the computer. Image processing techniques are used for tracking head movements, making it possible to use head motion in order to interact with a computer. Speech input is used for activating commonly used tasks that are normally activated using the mouse or the keyboard. Speech input improves the speed and ease of executing various HCI tasks in a hands free fashion. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using a number of specially designed test applications. According to the quantitative results, it is possible to perform most HCI tasks with the same ease and accuracy as in the case that a touch pad of a portable computer is used. Currently our system is being used by a number of paraplegics.",

A number of diagnostic studies have been conducted in order to validate the compatibility of the tuned shape models with the corresponding age groups. The shape age-simulation process utilizes agespecific shape models that incorporate age-related constraints during a 3D shape reconstruction phase. Age simulation is completed by predicting the texture at the target age based on a recursive PCA method that aims to superimpose age-related texture modifications in a way that preserves identity-related characteristics of the subject in the source image.

In this paper we demonstrate how residual information can be incorporated in the model building process in an attempt to generate models robust to local occlusions and models that can deal effectively with subtle types of variation. With our approach we first train a statistical appearance model using the standard technique and then estimate the residual obtained by reconstructing the samples from the training set. The analysis of the residual information allows us to define the areas of the object that the model fails to model correctly. Further statistical analysis is applied locally to such areas of the object. Quantitative results prove that statistical appearance models built using the proposed method are capable of reconstructing more accurately the appearance of previously unseen objects belonging to the same class.",

As part of the proposed work, teachers are given the opportunity to participate in a virtual class in the role of students that face certain deficiencies allowing them to experience problems faced by students so that teachers learn how to deal effectively with such cases in real classrooms \u2026",

A major issue for the implementation of 3D face processing systems is the accurate and real time acquisition of 3D faces using low cost equipment. In this paper we provide a survey of 3D reconstruction methods used for generating the 3D appearance of a face using either a single or multiple 2D images captured with ordinary equipment such as digital cameras and camcorders. In this context we discuss various issues pertaining to the general problem of 3D face reconstruction such as the existence of suitable 3D face databases, correspondence of 3D faces, feature detection, deformable 3D models and typical assumptions used during the reconstruction process. Different approaches to the problem of 3D reconstruction are presented and for each category the most important advantages and \u2026",

The face image synthesis method is based on a statistical face model that enables the reversible representation of face images using a small number of parameters. By manipulating the parameters of the face model it is possible to generate di.erent instances of faces. We describe how the mathematical relationship between the model-based representation of faces and facial attributes of interest can be de.ned and used for transforming a set of facial attributes to model parameters, so that a face image consistent with the description provided can be synthesized. Our methodology can be applied to the problem of generating facial images of suspects \u2026",

Classrooms have become more complex and dynamic environments and thus teachers need to constantly adapt their practices to the needs of individual learners and groups. Nevertheless, research reveals that teachers are not trained for the demanding and constantly changing requirements of the profession. Additionally, the lack of university-school connection deprives beginning teachers from learning through mentoring from experienced colleagues.   To address the above challenges, our work aims to contribute to the strengthening of the profile of the teaching profession through the enhancement of teachers\u2019 professional development, using a contemporary virtual reality-based framework. Virtual Reality (VR) offers engaging and immersive experiences, allowing teachers to experience real world classroom situations which require rapid thinking and quick analysis for effective management. The long term goal is to offer, a contemporary, safe and low-cost in-service and pre-service teacher VR-based training instrument that allows users to learn from their mistakes without consequence for the students. The project approach is both innovative and complementary towards other projects already carried out as well as focused on teacher training.

Moreover, a second objective is to investigate whether there are significant differences between training in a VR classroom and a real physical classroom and how this affects the trainee teacher. The overall conclusion of the experiment is that the design of the VR classroom environment influenced the levels of immersion and presence. Moreover \u2026",

Since then a number of researchers used the database for carrying out research in various disciplines related to facial aging. Based on the analysis of published work where the FG-NET aging database was used, conclusions related to the type of research carried out in relation to the impact of the dataset in shaping up the research topic of facial aging, are presented. In particular we focus our attention on the topic of age estimation that proved to be the most popular among users of the FG-NET aging database. Through the review of key papers in age estimation and the presentation of benchmark results the main approaches/directions in facial aging are outlined and future trends, requirements and research directions are drafted.",

The damage detection process involves the estimation of residuals obtained after the coding and reconstruction of face image regions using trained Principal Component Analysis (PCA) texture models. Shape restoration is accomplished using a model-based approach that employs a 3D shape model generated by taking into account a set of geometrical rules adopted by Byzantine style iconographers. Texture restoration is performed using a customized version of the recursive PCA technique. For this purpose dedicated PCA texture models representing different categories of faces appearing in icons, are used. All methods developed as part of the project are incorporated into a user-friendly application, which can be utilized by both amateurs and professionals \u2026",

We describe how the effects of aging on facial appearance can be explained using learned age transformations and present experimental results to show that reasonably accurate estimates of age can be made for unseen images. We also show that we can improve our results by taking into account the fact that different individuals age in different ways and by considering the effect of lifestyle.

Within person facial variations distort the appearance of faces leading to inconsistencies between facial features stored in templates and features derived from a face, of the corresponding subject, captured at a different instance. For this reason a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to the development of methods for eliminating within person-variations during face recognition/authentication. Among all types of within-person variations encountered, aging-related variations display unique characteristics that make the process of dealing with this type of variation a challenging task. In this paper we describe experiments that enable the quantification of the effects of aging on the performance of face recognition systems.

Production of Commandaria in Cyprus is associated with historical and political events that took place at the island, especially during the last millennium, hence studies related to Commandaria are heavily related to the culture and history of Cyprus. Unfortunately up to now the issue of preserving the history and traditions related to the production of Commandaria over the years did not receive adequate attention and as result the danger of losing important aspects of the relevant Cypriot cultural heritage is obvious. With our work we aim to develop an interactive system through which the history of the production of Commandaria at different areas in Cyprus and different time periods will be presented along with historical events that took place in the island and can be related with Commandaria production. As part of the project we will establish a multimedia digital library that will contain items related to the history and production of Commandaria in Cyprus. All multimedia database entries will be sorted according to various criteria, including the chronological period, the geographical location they refer to and the actual contents of the item, and could be searched via semantic-based queries with the aid of an ontology. In addition, an interactive application will be created where users will have the opportunity to explore the history of Commandaria in Cyprus at different geographical locations and different time periods.

In this context, the perceived age of the subjects in the training and test images is modified before the training and classification procedures, so that ageing variation is eliminated.

            "Abstract": "According to a number of studies, the use of personalized avatars in virtual environments can enhance the immersion experience of users and the effectiveness of communication between different players. The benefits of using personalized avatars in conjunction with recent technological developments in Virtual Reality (VR) prompted an increasing demand for low-cost systems that are capable of fast and easy generation of personal avatars for use in VR applications. In this paper we present a novel model-based technique that is capable of generating personalized full-body 3D avatars from orthogonal photographs. The proposed method utilizes a statistical model of human 3D shape and a multi-view statistical 2D shape model of its corresponding silhouettes. Our technique is automatic, requiring minimal user intervention, and does not need a calibrated camera. Each component of our proposed \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Virtual restoration of Cultural Heritage (CH) artefacts is an important task that aims to re-create the original appearance of damaged items. In this paper we describe a method that can be used for virtual restoration of faces appearing in cultural heritage artefacts. Given a damaged face appearing in a 2D image we estimate the complete 3D shape of a face using data from the non-damaged face and we predict the texture of the damaged regions. As a result it is possible to generate a restored 3D model of the face which can be mapped back on the 2D image in order to complete the restoration process. Both visual and quantitative results prove the potential of the proposed method.",

            "Abstract": "The proper use of high-visibility safety apparel (HVSA) increases conspicuity and reduces accident rates. The main factor affecting daytime conspicuity is the color contrast between HVSA and the ambient background environment. Selecting HVSA without considering their contrast to the worksite environment may result in unsafe situations where HVSA not only fail to provide the desired conspicuity but also act as camouflage. One such situation is the use of red HVSA on oil tankers with brown decks. This paper presents a methodology for selecting the most effective HVSA color for a particular worksite. Using image analysis techniques, we can assess the contrast between a set of high-visibility colors and the colors present at a worksite in order to determine the most effective HVSA color for the particular site. The methodology was experimentally validated with the help of 50 volunteers and the use of a purpose-built \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Aging effects cause significant changes in the functionality and abilities of the elderly that affect the overall interaction of elder people with their environment and other people. However, since the aging process occurs gradually in a person\u2019s life, it is not possible for humans who belong to younger generations to experience the effects of aging. Towards this end we propose the use of a Virtual Reality (VR) based application that allows users to experience the effects of aging before such changes affect their body and mind. The proposed application targets two main objectives: The first objective is to allow product and software designers to experience problems faced by the elderly so that they design products friendly to older people. The second objective is to increase the appreciation and social inclusion towards the elderly. The development of this application relies on an extensive study of the literature that \u2026",
