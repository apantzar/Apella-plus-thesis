After brightness normalization, the fingerprint lines are eliminated using the 2D dimensional discrete wavelet transformation. A set of twelve directional kernels is constructed, based on a dyadic wavelet transform, and is used to enhance the directional properties of veins. From maximum filters' response, a neighborhood thresholding derives a binary segmented image to produce reliable patterns of finger veins. A post-processing module is used in case where low-quality images are segmented. Preliminary evaluation experiments of the proposed method demonstrate a number of advantages, compared to recently published methods.",

Initially, it is proved that the subtraction of the logarithm of the inverse response function of any pair of pixels is invariant to the integration time and equal to the logarithm of the ratio of the camera responses. Based on this property, the proposed method estimates the response function in a non-iterative manner, solving an appropriately set linear system of equations. The direct solution, evaluated under a representative set of experiments, shows that even in the case of unknown exposure times, the mean absolute error of the camera's estimated response function is lower than 0.020 in all simulation experiments and 0.018, 0.021, and 0.023 for the RGB channels of the Olympus 5050Zoom digital camera",

The task of the end-effector is to manipulate a randomly located fabric on a table and feed it to the sewing needle along the desired seam. Using Genetic Algorithms, the curve is approximated by a polygon section. The main goal is to find the polygonal approximation of the curve with the minimal number of vertices, such that the approximation error is no more than a specified value and move the fabric so that the seam coincide with the polygonal line.

            "Publication url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1075680",
            "Abstract": "A non-invasive technique for condition monitoring of brushless DC motor drives is proposed in this study for Hall-effect position sensor fault diagnosis. Position sensor faults affect rotor position feedback, resulting in faulty transitions, which in turn cause current fluctuations and mechanical oscillations, derating system performance and threatening life expectancy. The main concept of the proposed technique is to detect the faults using vibration signals, acquired by low-cost piezoelectric sensors. With this aim, the frequency spectrum of the piezoelectric sensor output signal is analyzed both under the healthy and faulty operating conditions to highlight the fault signature. Therefore, the second harmonic component of the vibration signal spectrum is evaluated as a reliable signature for the detection of misalignment faults, while the fourth harmonic component is investigated for the position sensor breakdown fault, considering both single and double sensor faults. As the fault signature is localized at these harmonic components, the Goertzel algorithm is promoted as an efficient tool for the harmonic analysis in a narrow frequency band. Simulation results of the system operation, under healthy and faulty conditions, are presented along with the experimental results, verifying the proposed technique performance in detecting the position sensor faults in a non-invasive manner.

The proposed OBSS system uses basic NxN Blind Speech Separation networks that process in parallel all different combinations of the available mixture signals in the frequency domain, resulting to lower computational complexity and faster convergence. Extensive experiments using an array of two to ten microphones and two simultaneous speakers in a simulated real room, showed that when the number of the microphones increases beyond two, the separation performance is improved and the phoneme recognition accuracy of an HMM based decoder increases drastically (more than 6%).

The brightness dynamic region is increased using a non-linear transformation function, which is adapted from the local contrast. In a new approach, the local contrast is defined in every central pixel, using a four direction masking method and a statistical estimation of the local contrast value. Two adaptive thresholds locate the exact pixel positions where the proposed contrast adjustment algorithm is used to improve the image quality. In the evaluation process, several artificially distorted images are enhanced and the mean square error and peak noise ratio between the restored and the original images are estimated. The experimental results show both objective and subjective improvements in the image quality.",

The task of the end-effector is to handle a randomly located fabric on a table and feed it to the sewing needle along the desired seam. The proposed system is capable of handling fabrics having straight-line edges and curved edges with arbitrary curvatures. The vision system identifies the type of the fabric edges and the system decides the procedure that should be followed, so that the fabric is successfully handled. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is an effective and efficient method for guiding the fabric towards the sewing machine, sewing each one (straight- or curved) edge and rotating it around the needle. The system demonstrates flexibility, since fabric of any shape, size, or color can be sewed without requirements in special geometrical computations. Fuzzy \u2026",

Advance array processing methods are used to detect and locate the wide-band sources in the near and far-field including array calibration and energy based beamforming techniques. Moreover, oversampling techniques are adopted to increase the acquired signals accuracy and to also decrease the quantization noise. The classifier is based on the nearest neighbor rule of a normalized Power Spectral Density, the acoustic signature of the UAV spectrum in short periods of time.

The selection of the filters incorporated to the system affects the spectral response which in turn affects substantially the accuracy of the reflectance reconstruction task. When the number of available filters is large, the full search method becomes computationally expensive. This chapter defines the filter selection problem as a dimensionality reduction process by selecting the filters that contains most of the essential information, using the same criteria as the Principal Component Analysis. This method is expanded by processing multiple filter estimations to improve the stability and the quality of the results. The filter selection methods are evaluated under the CIE standard illuminants A and D65 using 160 filters and a spectral reflectance database of 1269 curves.",

In this paper, a novel approach to solve this problem is assessed, which is based on autoencoders.

The genetic evaluation produces an error-free neural network DDoS detector using only 14 features.

Focusing on Hall-effect position sensorbased drives, a data-driven approach for the unbalanced system operation diagnosis is presented. To improve the fault detection accuracy under multiple faults, a multi-source database is synthesized, exploiting voltage and current sensors along with piezoelectric sensors for the vibration analysis. The frequency spectra of the electronic controller input and output power signals and the piezoelectric sensor signals are analyzed for the fault diagnosis. Thus, a multi-sensor control scheme is presented and different configurations of misaligned position sensors, with either positive or negative commutation angle errors, are investigated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault \u2026",

It is shown that using a tiny network configuration and a small set of robust features, selected automatically by the K-means algorithm from a superset of 90 signal parameters, the location of a single event can be classified efficiently into three typical areas found in ship hulls. In simulation experiments, where a stiffened plate model is partially sunk into the water, the localization rate of acoustic emission events in a noise-free environment is 100% using four sensors and only four features per sensor. In the proposed method, the feature set is adapted and estimated automatically in cases of noisy environments. Robust acoustic emission localization rates, greater than 90%, are achieved using less than ten features per sensor in case of additive white Gaussian noise at 0 dB SNR or more.",

The proposed method consists of two steps: First, a feature extraction module utilizes two dimensional discrete transforms based on ART, Shapelets and Gabor filters to extract low-level visual descriptors of ROS. In addition, semantic mammogram information provided by radiologists, is encoded into a 16-bit length word used as high-level feature vector.

This method involves four steps: preprocessing which performs local normalization of the image intensity, image enhancement, image segmentation, and finally postprocessing for image cleaning. In the image enhancement step, an image which will be both smooth and similar to the original is sought. The enhanced image is obtained by minimizing the objective function of a modified separable Mumford Shah Model. Since, this minimization procedure is computationally intensive for large images, a local application of the Mumford Shah Model in small window neighborhoods is proposed. The finger veins are located in concave nonsmooth regions and, so, in order to distinct them from the other tissue parts, all the differences between the smooth neighborhoods, obtained by the local application of the model, and the corresponding windows of the original image are added. After that, veins in the enhanced image have been sufficiently emphasized. Thus, after image enhancement, an accurate segmentation can be obtained readily by a local entropy thresholding method. Finally, the resulted binary image may suffer from some misclassifications and, so, a postprocessing step is performed in order to extract a robust finger vein pattern.",

            "Abstract": "The diagnosis of brain neoplasms has been facilitated by the emerging of high-quality imaging techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), while the combination of several sequences from conventional and advanced protocols has increased the diagnostic information. Treatment planning and therapy follow-up require the detection of neoplastic and edematous tissue boundaries, a very time consuming task when manually performed by medical experts based on the 3D MRI data. Automating the detection process is challenging, due to the high diversity in appearance of neoplastic tissue among different patients and, in many cases, similarity between neoplastic and normal tissue. In this paper, we propose an automatic brain tumor segmentation method based on a multilabel multiparametric random walks approach initialized by an outlier detection scheme. Segmentation assessment is \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Acoustic emission (AE) is one of the most important non-destructive testing (NDT) methods for materials and constructions. Using AE testing, the location of a single event (crack) can be classified efficiently into three typical areas in a ship hull. The problem is a typical classification problem based on the use of features extracted from piezo-sensors' signal. As in most classification problems, the extraction and selection of the most appropriate set of features plays a major role in the overall performance of the system. In this research work we investigate the use of an evolutionary algorithm to extract new features from a set of primitive features in a lower dimensional space through a linear transformation. These features are subsequently fed into a probabilistic neural network (PNN) that performs the classification. In simulation experiments, where a stiffened plate model (SPM) is partially sank into water, the localization \u2026",

A small number of features are estimated by the pixels\u2019 intensity projection into an RBC-space. The basis of the RBC-space is derived using the singular vectors of a set of known RBCs. The nearest neighbor rule is used to classify any image projection to the known RBC coordinates. Since, the dimension ability of the RBC-space is significantly lower than the whole scattering image-space, it is easier to compare projections than original images. Considering the above idea, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach is implemented in this work. The database includes 1188 simulated scattering images, obtained by means of the Boundary Element Method (BEM).

The design of an efficient Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) system has been an attractive problem and for this reason many researchers rely on experiments to extract the necessary data for the ATR system. In this paper, a new method for extracting the radar cross-section (RCS) data has been proposed, which uses the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to efficiently compute the RCS values of different objects at any point of the coordinate system in a short period of time, without need of any experiment. Multiple RCS values in the presence of noise are used for the training and the evaluation of two ATR systems, based on the nearest neighbor classification rule or a multilayer Neural Network.",

The localization algorithm extracts a set of candidate direction-of-arrival (DOA) for the signal sources using array signal processing methods in the frequency domain. A minimum variance (MV) beam-former identifies the speech signal DOA in the direction where the signal's spectrum entropy is minimized. A fine tuning process detects the MV direction which is closest to the initial estimation using a smaller analysis window. Extended experiments, carried out in the range of 20-0 dB SNR, show significant improvement in the recognition rate of a moving speaker especially in very low SNRs (from 11.11% to 43.79% at 0 dB SNR in anechoic environment and from 9.9% to 30.51% in reverberant environment).",

Several vessel measurements and processes are applied, including the second-order local statistical information contained in the Hessian matrix and the matched filter applied in the direction of the largest curvature. Edge suppression reduces sharp brightness changes at finger borders and image contrast is non-linearly increased through fuzzy enhancement.

The feature vector, which acts as input to the first stage, consists of numerical and non-numerical linguistic features extracted from text. The extended feature vector is obtained by appending the phone duration predictions estimated by the FCs to the initial feature vector. Experiments on the American-English KED TIMIT and on the Modern Greek WCL-1 databases validated the advantage of the proposed two-stage scheme, improving prediction accuracy over the best individual predictor, and over a two-stage scheme which just fuses the first-stage outputs \u2026",

This paper presents a novel molecular-biology name detection system for gene, protein and cell-type. The system consists of sequentially connected modules, a tokenizer: the text is split into tokens, a preprocessor: a set of token transformation rules is applied in a specific order, and a gene/protein/cell type dictionary-based recognizer: a dictionary of 217125 genes/proteins names is used to identify and classify each token taking into account the presence of prefixes and suffixes and synonyms. The proposed method has been evaluated in 300 manually annotated MEDLINE abstracts related to the K-Ras gene, giving 0.968 precision, and 0.975 recall rates. The standard measure for named entity recognition F-score was 0.9515.",

Several challenging image processing and recognition problems are met in DAS; the detection of the traffic lights is among the most difficult tasks. Around the word, manufactures produce different traffic lights in shape, size, and layout. Even worse, traffic lights are install in different positions and typically are operating continously, introducing a variety of adverse environmental conditions ie partial occlusion, detection at night, in low vision conditions, etc. Although traffic lights have been design to be highly visible, the outdoor nature of the detection problem greatly increases the illumination and the image backgound variations. In this paper, a method for detecting the position of the traffic lights in video sequencies is presented and evaluated using a well-known video database. Our implementation include a sequence of digital image processing elements and a convolutional neural network classifier:",

The multi-scale image map is derived after combining the individual image maps along scales, containing the pixels confidence to belong in a vessel. The initial vessel network is derived after map quantization of the multi-scale confidence matrix. Median filtering is applied in the initial vessel network, restoring disconnected vessel lines and eliminating noisy lines. Finally, post-processing removes erroneous areas using directional attributes of vessels and morphological reconstruction.The experimental evaluation in the publicly available DRIVE database shows accurate extraction of vessels network.

The inspection of angiogenesis in the human body can be used for early diagnosis of several diseases, both in healthy tissue for healing wounds and for restoring blood flow to tissues after injury or insult. Also, inspection of the retinal vasculature may reveal hypertension, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke. In the problem of finger vessel pattern extraction from infrared images, the veins appear darker than the surrounding tissue, due to strong absorption of light from the hemoglobin molecules, and they have a concave shape cross sectional profile. This property can be used to facilitate the segmentation process and several researchers use the concave shape of the vessel to achieve better segmentation accuracy [6-7, 8, 12].

In this direction, this paper proposes a new fully automatic algorithm that combines both time and spatial information using the efficient random-walker algorithm (RWA) as a segmentation tool. A novel technique for automatic seed selection is proposed, utilizing features derived from a shadow-resistant optical flow estimator using the  c 1  channel of the  c 1 c 2 c 3  color space, along with a priori information and previous frame segmentation results. The proposed system is qualitatively assessed using video sequences in both typical and adverse conditions, including heavy traffic, shadows, tunnels, rain \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The correction of non-uniform illumination and the elimination of shading artifacts is an important preprocessing task used in a great number of image processing applications such as segmentation, registration or quantitative analysis. Although, a careful and accurate set up of the image acquisition system may degrade the importance of a brightness normalization algorithm, non-uniform illumination appears due to the interaction of objects and light on the scene requires retrospective shading correction. The image formation process and the corresponding shading effects are described by a linear image formation model, which consists of a multiplicative and an additive shading component.In this paper a novel brightness normalization method is proposed to eliminate the non-uniform illumination effects. The method is based on the application of a fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) only on the background part of the acquired image, where the objective function is modified to take into account local information of each pixel in the estimation of the multiplicative and the additive shading components. The modified FCM algorithm is iterative, as the standard FCM, and at each iteration the multiplicative and the additive shading components are re-estimated based on the cluster centers and the membership of each pixel in a specific cluster. Brightness correction is performed by the inverse of the image formation model after FCM convergence.",

Currently this task is accomplished by human experts considering five grades of quality. The proposed method estimates surface roughness of seam specimens producing robust and efficient novel features highly correlated to quality grades (QGs). At the initial stage, oblique illumination is applied and two-dimensional images of the specimens are acquired. The images are automatically rotated and centered in respect to the seam line and segmented into four regions. Each region produces an intensity curve through averaging, and roughness estimation is performed based on intensity mean deviation. Finally, a QG is assigned to each specimen using a k-nearest neighbor classifier (kNNc). A data set containing 211 seam specimens, created by two different kinds of fabric, has been used for testing \u2026",

As in most classification problems the extraction and selection of the most appropriate set of features plays a major role in the overall performance of the method and it is by no means a trivial task. Once a suitable set of features is extracted even ldquosimplerdquo classification models can perform adequately whereas a non-informative set of features even combined with sophisticated classifiers can lead to disappointing results. Here, we exploit the multi-resolution capabilities of wavelet decomposition, so that a set of features is extracted which it is then combined with a simple classifier. The \u2026",

In this paper an automated algorithm for detection of preceding vehicles is proposed, based on the detection of rear vehicle lights. Unlike many systems which make use of static threshold boundaries for the red color segmentation of rear lights, our method combines color and radial symmetry cues while the threshold is dynamically adapted. The extracted candidate rear lights are morphologically paired in order to define possible areas where vehicles are present. The verification of vehicle presence is then carried out through axial symmetry check. Experimental results that demonstrate the system's high detection rates and robustness even in adverse illumination and weather conditions are finally presented.",

In the second, a novel clustering algorithm named nearest neighbor clustering algorithm (NNCA), which is unsupervised and has been recently proposed for retinal vessel segmentation, is used. As feature vectors for the classification process in both cases two features are used: the multidirectional response of a matched filter and the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix. The response of the multidirectional filter is essential for robust classification because offers a distinction between vein-like and edge-like structures while Hessian based approaches cannot offer this.

The separation networks that are used, are feedforward and recurrent neural networks, along with a proposed hybrid network. These networks perform separation of convolutive speech mixtures in the time domain, without any prior knowledge of the propagation media, based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) criterion. The proposed separation networks improve more than 30dB the Signal to Interference ratio in a two simultaneous speaker environment, even under the presence of a noise source (more than 15dB improvement in a 0 dB SNR noisy environment). In addition, the recognition accuracy of a continuous phoneme-based speech recognition system was improved more than 20% in all adverse mixing situations with high interference from competing speakers and noise. Therefore, the proposed separation networks can be used as a front-end processor for continuous speech recognition of simultaneous speakers in real reverberant rooms.",

A typical hull inspection requires dry-docking processes, which is sensitive to human errors, costly and the ship should be out-of-order for many days. In case of transport oil ships, the environmental consequences of a ship accident are incalculable, as huge mass of oil spillage into the sea wasted the ecological system and harmed the Flora and Fauna of the sea and coasts for many years. Recently, Acoustic Emission (AE) method has been used to inspect large offshore structures using a relatively small number of sensors.

Extensive experiments involving speech recognition of two simultaneous speakers in an anechoic room environment showed very high separation performance with a phoneme recognition improvement reaching a mean value of 18% and a Signal to Interference ratio (SIR) improvement of 55dB for both separated speech signals, in comparison to the corresponding mixed signals acquired by the microphones.

As feature vectors for the classification process in both cases two features are used: the multidirectional response of a matched filter and the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix. The response of the multidirectional filter is essential for robust classification because offers a distinction between vein-like and edgelike structures while Hessian based approaches cannot offer this.
