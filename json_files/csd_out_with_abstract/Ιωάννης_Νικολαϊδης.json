            "Abstract": "Dear readers, welcome to the September 2008 issue of IEEE Network. The sound of trucks, the heavy duty disposal bins on the curb, and the thud and bang of construction are all elements of a \"quiet\" summer, full of renovations, in my neighborhood. Resisting this Siren's call is difficult even if I swore off any renovations for the rest of my life, given past experience. I naively thought that this time it wouldn't be that bad. After all, this time it looks like a much smaller job than last time. Of course, I neglected a key conservation law: if a job is small, the additional delays for various reasons will expand it to be roughly equal the total time of a \"big\" job (more professionally managed one might argue, and hence with much less slack). What I was not prepared to experience is the shift in attitudes caused by the widespread adoption of many \"information\" appliances in today's household.",

In contrast to the commonly assumed collision channel, in the MPR channel with channel capacity K, it is possible to decode up to K packets whose transmissions overlap in time. In order to exploit the MPR capability, the additive-increase multiplicative-decrease MAC (AIMD-MAC) protocol is designed to adaptively adjust the access probabilities of the independent nodes based on their local transmission histories. The examined performance metrics for evaluating this protocol include aggregate throughput, average packet delay and system fairness. Extensive simulations show that the performance of AIMD-MAC is superior to that of S-Aloha* under light traffic loads and achieves the optimum level after the system is saturated. With a suitable parameter set, AIMD-MAC \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of increasing the data collection frequency of aggregation convergecast. Previous studies attempt to increase the data collection frequency by shortening the completion of a single data collection cycle. We aim at increasing the frequency at which data collection updates are collected by the use of pipelining and, consequently, increasing the overall data collection frequency and throughput. To achieve this, we overlap the propagation schedule of multiple data snapshots within the same overall schedule cycle, thus increasing parallelism through pipelining. Consequently, the effective data collection time of an individual snapshot may span over multiple, successive, schedule cycles. To this end, we modify the aggregation convergecast model, decoupling schedule length, and data collection delay, by relaxing its precedence constraints. Our solution for this new problem involves the unconventional approach of constructing the schedule before finalizing the exact form of the data aggregation tree, which, in turn, requires that the schedule construction phase guarantees that every node can reach the sink. We compare our results using snapshot pipelining against a previously proposed algorithm that also uses a form of pipelining, as well as against an algorithm that though lacking pipelining, exhibits the ability to produce very short schedules. The results confirm the potential to achieve a substantial throughput increase, at the cost of some increase in latency.",

            "Abstract": "A part of the Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL) technology is based on advances in the area of Multicarrier Modulation (MCM), an area which still receives the attention of intense research with the potential of more breakthroughs in the future. The book by John Bingham is targeted at engineers who are involved in the design of DSL systems, and MCM modems in particular. The book provides an exciting personal view about the important future work in the area, motivated by the fact that its retiring author will not be working on them while feeling the importance for new research in certain areas. The chapters include sections describing the \u201cUnfinished Business\u201d of the corresponding topic. Clearly,, graduate students and researchers will appreciate the guidance provided. A further feature to satisfy the intellectual appetite of readers are references to patents, that may not be known to the wider audience. The curious reader finds abundant material that explains the particular complexities of high-speed data uses of the local loop, stemming from the impairments of the local loop (presented in chapter 3). Two chapters introduce DSL systems in general and MCM respectively. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based MCM is presented in the sixth chapter, followed by a chapter on alternative types of MCM (frequency domain spreading, filtering, time domain shaping and discrete wavelet multitone) discussing the tradeoffs of each technique. The implementation of DMT in ADSL is the topic of chapter 8. The coexistence of ADSL with other services such as voice-band services, echo-canceled ISDN, and TDD ISDN are the subject of the next chapter. The \u2026",

To James Carlson\u2019s advantage, PPP is a very well-known protocol that has already reached a remarkable level of maturity. To the general audience considering PPP, still an alternative to SLIP, it should be pointed out that PPP currently provides load balancing between different lines, multilink capabilities, forms of bandwidth management, and so on, and can routinely be tunneled around the Internet or sent over Ethernets.

A set of elementary equations were developed to describe single-channel interference based on radio transmissions within a unit disk (UD) under random mobility conditions. The distinguishing feature of the model is that it introduces micro-models for three elementary sources of interference: inter-path, intra-path, and common origin interference. Simulation experiments found that the proposed session-based model generates throughput results consistent with existing approaches for modeling single path (SP) throughput performance within a unit area disk. However, we go one step further to use the SP throughput equations as the basis for developing a set of equations that model multiple path (MP) throughput \u2026",

What is missing? Deviating from the usual focus on routing and energy efficiency, Building Sensor Networks: From Design to Applications attempts to stitch together the path from conceptual development of applications, on one end, to actual complete applications at the other. With this change in perspective, the book examines important facets of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that are not often discussed in the literature. From Design Practices to the Networking Protocols that Glue Applications Together Organized into three sections, the book presents insights from international experts representing both industry and academia. The first section, on design practices, explores alternative ways to approach the tasks of developing a suitable WSN solution to an application and assisting that development in a manner that is not necessarily tied to a particular application. The second section, on networking protocols, illustrates the impact of the intermediaries\u2014the\" glue\" of putting applications together. Chapters look at ways to address traffic, delays in network clustering, and the coexistence of a WSN with other systems on a frequency band. The final section of the book delves into experiences with applications in chemical sensing, defense, global trade and security, and ecosystem monitoring. Although these applications may fail the purist definition of an ideal WSN, they offer valuable lessons for the future development and deployment of WSNs. Challenge Your Thinking \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Many recent proposals for the support of Video-on-Demand (VoD) use a form of periodic broadcast scheduling and assume Constant Bit-Rate (CBR) encoded videos [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10]. The few existing proposals [5, 9] for support of the more efficient Variable Bit-Rate (VBI: t) video encoding schemes, employ forms of lossy multiplexing. Thus they can be used for VBR video but at the cost of data losses. In this paper we address the issue of the VBR encoded video broadcast and we propose an inherently Loss-Less and Bandwidth-Efficient (LLBE) scheme. Given ample client storage, LLBE can satisfy any a-priori prescribed per-video startup latency, w. In LLBE, the bandwidth necessary for the transmission and downloading of a video is minimized through an optimization process. We also note that minimization of the server bandwidth can be stated as a shortest path problem and solved in polynomial time.",

Inspired by this observation, we propose two randomized forwarding strategies and demonstrate their advantages over deterministic schemes. Notably, their advantage becomes more pronounced when traffic patterns are biased, where the primary advantage of nondeterminism is in circumventing hot spots.",

Using a data set with sensor readings collected from one-person and two-person sessions engaged in a variety of activities of daily living, we investigate the relative merits of relying solely on anonymous sensors, solely on eponymous sensors, or on their combination. We examine how the lack of synchronization across different sensing sources impacts the quality of location estimates, and discuss how it could be mitigated without resorting to device-level mechanisms. Finally, we examine the trade-off between the sensors\u2019 coverage of the monitored space and the quality of the location estimates. View Full-Text",

First, the shortcomings of tree\u2013based P2P schemes are discussed. Subsequently, a scalable swarm\u2013based scheme is introduced that avoids maintaining a rigid logical topology. Peers self\u2013organize into an unstructured overlay in an ad-hoc fashion. Stream data are divided into small\u2013sized units and distributed in a fashion that fully utilizes the upload capacity of all peers. A credit\u2013based incentive scheme is introduced to encourage peers to contribute their capacity. The incentive scheme operates based exclusively on local information. We evaluate the proposed scheme through simulations in a dynamic and heterogeneous environment. A key benefit of the proposed scheme is its ability to operate under resource\u2013constrained conditions where traditional tree\u2013based approaches typically fail.",

However, exploiting data diversity requires the development of particular protocols that incite the cooperation of nodes. A feature of the protocols we propose is that, instead of assuming all nodes to be interested in the same data item, we assume different per-node data items of interest and a large population of data items (files) with a popularity that follows a Zipf distribution. We also consider dynamic environments where, over time, new nodes join the network (and others depart). Together with a one-for-one reciprocal exchange policy, we observe the impact of density and per-node initial file sets.

Unlike previous proposals we consider the exact top-k values query problem, ie, where one seeks to find exactly all k highest unique values in the network regardless of how many nodes report it. Previous proposals also did not pay due attention to the underlying logical tree topology used for data aggregation and forwarding. In this context, this paper presents two main contributions:(1) we propose the use of a particular tree topology, based on Dominating Sets, which is well suited to explore the network\u2019s physical topology for processing top-k queries efficiently; and (2) we propose EXTOK, a filtering-based algorithm for processing the exact top-k values query, we also prove its correctness and investigate its performance with respect to a number of parameters, including network link failures. In all examined cases, EXTOK performs consistently well while effectively exploiting the proposed logical tree topology and it is also resilient to link failures.",

The resulting scheme, called MINT, is a family of heuristics whose performance is controlled by a candidate link selection strategy. We report on the best found combination of MINT and candidate link selection strategy which specifically attempts to minimize the \u201ccost\u201d incurred by a scheduled transmission where the cost is the number of blocked transmissions that could have occurred in the same timeslot.

Different types of sensors are installed at different locations in 12 apartment units in a building in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada to assess occupant energy usage, thermal performance of the building envelope, and indoor air quality (IAQ). The relationship between heating energy consumption and the thermal performance of building envelope and occupant comfort level is investigated by analyzing the monitoring data.

The interference patterns visible on a given channel depend on the particular devices competing for the spectrum. Meanwhile, the modern transceivers incorporated into wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes have the ability to measure the background noise/interference and change channels. This combination of capabilities suggests the need to better understand the noise and interference encountered in urban environments so that devices can make better decisions to avoid it. In this paper, we explore the noise and interference patterns found on 256 frequencies in an urban environment\u2019s 900 MHz ISM and non-ISM bands. We begin the process by using off-theshelf WSN hardware to sample the environment at 5 kHz from 16 locations simultaneously. From these samples, we identify five prevalent patterns and then hand-classify the 4096 traces of noise and interference. Finally, we extract a variety of statistics from the traces and use them in a Bayesian network classifier.",

In particular, we formulate the problem of deciding where to forward traffic, in order to benefit the most from potential aggregation, while also splitting the resulting traffic (once aggregated) on the way to the Sink for the sake of load balancing. Load balancing across multiple paths results in a corresponding balanced energy consumption and therefore prolongs the lifetime of WSNs. The optimization formulation leads to an IP/LP model where the objective is that of maximizing the lifetime of the WSN. Heuristics are proposed for assigning an efficient data aggregation node for each sensor source. Simulation results show that our schemes significantly improve performance both in terms of longer system lifetime and less total data received (indicating more aggressive aggregation) at the Sink.",

Raj Pandya\u2019s book is mostly addressed to people involved in planning, design, and operating networks with WLL subsystems. It attempts to cover a substantial part of available technologies, explain relevant acronyms, and outline the features of a few of the most significant current commercial offerings. Specifically, the following products are reviewed in more detail: STAREX-WLL (from LG), Air-Loop (from Lucent), corDECT (from Midas), and Internet FWA (from Nortel). A notable characteristic of the book is the inevitable mix of topics seemingly separate from WLLs, but clos, ely related. Thus, in addition to a chapter on the fundamentals of radio svstems (access svstems) we also find a and cordless (DECT\u2019and PHS) technologies. Another chapter provides a refresher in radio access characteristics and radio planning, and how they relate to the overall system capacity, including elements from cellular nctwork planning, such as cell sectoriration, which is linked to WLL\u2018s spatial reuse planning.

            "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are subject to interference from other users of the radio-frequency (RF) medium. If the WSN nodes can recognize the interference pattern, they can benefit from steering their transmissions around it. This possibility has stirred some interest among researchers involved in cognitive radios, where special hardware has been postulated to circumvent non-random interference. Our goal is to explore ways of enhancing medium access control (MAC) schemes operating within the framework of traditional off-the-shelf RF modules applicable in low-cost WSN motes, such that they can detect interference patterns in the neighbourhood and creatively respond to them, mitigating their negative impact on the packet reception rate. In this paper, and based on previous work on the post-deployment characterization of a channel aimed at identifying \u201cspiky\u201d interference patterns, we describe \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We study the separation of TCP flows into short lived and long lived ones, and the subsequent allocation of bandwidth to reflect the dynamically changing load due to short lived flow fluctuations. Three schemes are presented to assist in determining and allocating the bandwidth to short lived flows. Each one represents a different compromise in terms of state and execution complexity. However, all three share the common assumption that they can exploit knowledge of the statistical properties of what constitutes a \u201ctypical\u201d short lived TCP flow. We argue that this assumption is totally within reason and hinges on the fact that short lived TCP flows are HTTP connections that have been extensively studied and their statistics are increasingly well understood. We finally present an evaluation of the three proposed schemes against DropTail and RED and determine that all three provide, to varying degrees, reduced response time to the short lived flows. Since short lived flows are predominantly instantiated by interactive applications, we argue that the reduced response time demonstrated by the proposed schemes is in good agreement with the most pressing performance concern of these applications, ie, short delays.",

Our approach treats the localization algorithm as a \u201cblack box\u201d and, hence, its applicability is broad. However, for the purpose of exposition and to generate absolute performance metrics, a particular profiling-based localization algorithm is used.

The scheduler replaces high-interference peer-to-peer transmission with low-interference multi-hop transmissions by interference-aware multi-hop routing, which reduces both interference and energy consumption of transmission. To maximize channel reuse, a multi-hop maximal-weighted-matching grouping scheme is applied to arrange concurrent transmissions. For successful signal decoding, the accumulated interference among concurrent transmissions is taken into account to ensure that signal reception occurs with sufficient SINR.",

The lumped matrix provides a simpler to understand description of the channel utilization behavior and naturally includes the persistence in one lumped state which resembles the characteristic behavior of naive predictors (where predicted state equals the current state). We demonstrate that treating the lumped states as classes allows good prediction models to be built using Logistic Regression and Neural Network models.

Additionally, one can construct network coding (NC) schemes that allow a single transmissions to be of value to more than one receiver. In this paper, we account for the impact of duty-cycling by modeling the transmissions (for which the intended receiver was not awake) as a form of packet losses. We then use a specifically designed NC scheme to recover those losses. We compare the energy performance and network throughput against continuous (no duty-cycling) operation. The results demonstrate that the particular combination of NC and duty-cycling can provide gains in terms of energy efficiency but these gains are meaningful in particular configurations and under \u2026",

The current HCA supply will not keep up with this increasing demand without fundamental changes in their work environment. One possible solution to some of the workflow challenges and workplace stress of HCAs is hand-held tablet technology. In order to introduce the use of tablets with HCAs, simulations were developed. Once an HCA was comfortable with the tablet, a simulated client was introduced. The HCA interacted with the simulated client and used the tablet applications to assist with providing care. After the simulations, the HCAs participated in a focus group. HCAs completed a survey before and after the tablet training and simulation to determine their perception and acceptance of the tablet.

            "Abstract": "For more than a decade, ad hoc wireless networks have galvanized the interest and sparked the imagination of researchers. Such networks consist of a set of nodes equipped with wireless interfaces and they are designed to form self-organizing and spontaneous networks. They are usually multi-hop in nature, collectively forwarding and processing data to accomplish an application task. In addition, their topologies can be highly dynamic due to the potential mobility of the nodes. All these properties, in isolation and combination, pose a plethora of research challenges as well as new application opportunities. The International Conference on Ad-Hoc Networks and Wireless (ADHOC-NOW) serves as one of the premier venues for researchers and industrial practitioners to exchange ideas in this exciting area. Following previous ADHOC-NOW conferences in Murcia, Spain (2009), Sophia Antipolis, France (2008), Morelia, Mexico (2007), Ottawa, Canada (2006), Cancun, Mexico (2005), Vancouver, Canada (2004), Mo-real, Canada (2003), and Toronto, Canada (2002), the ninth ADHOC-NOW conf-ence took place at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, during August 20\u201322, 2010. As the capital city of the Province of Alberta, Edmonton is a cultural, governmental, and educational center and offers year-round world-class f-tivals, including the Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival. Edmonton is also home to North America's largest indoor shopping mall, the West Edmonton Mall. The summer in Edmonton is particularly joyful and has mild temperature and long, sunny daytime.",

We introduce a collection of\u00a2-shortest path routing schemes and investigate their performance under a variety of traffic conditions and network configurations. We subsequently demonstrate that\u00a2-shortest path routing offers a lower blocking probability in all scenarios and more balanced link utilization than other routing methods discussed in the literature.

A maximal-weighted-matching based scheduling scheme is designed to arrange simultaneous transmissions in each single channel and a multichannel assignment scheme is proposed to obtain the ultimate schedule in each superframe. For successful signal decoding, accumulated interference among simultaneous transmissions is taken into account to ensure that signal reception occurs with sufficient SINR. To improve the efficiency of channel reuse, the scheduler fragments each transmission request to multiple requests with the equal duration. An analysis is given of the optimal way to implement such process according to online traffic load and overhead. Simulations are used to evaluate the performance and to compare against existing schemes.",

The few existing proposals for support of the bandwidth-efficient family of Variable-Bit-Rate (VBR) encoded media objects are available at the cost of data loss due to overflow of the broadcast link capacity by the aggregate traffic of the simultaneouslytransmitted segments of the media contents [3, 8]. In this paper, we investigate a novel broadcast scheme, called StairCase Broadcast (SCB), for VBR encoded media contents, which can guarantee, by its design, zero data loss and predictable service delay with minimal required de-coupled server and client bandwidth.",

Focusing on the MAX queries we first argue that the underlying tree topology plays a very important role in the query processing cost. We then propose the use of a particular tree topology, based on Dominating Sets that is well suited to explore the network's physical topology for processing MAX queries efficiently. Experimental results obtained using real and synthetic datasets confirm that by simply replacing the tree topologies used in previous proposals with the Dominating Set-based Tree (DST) one can reduce the transmission cost of MAX queries by up to 70% and \u2026",

In this paper we study a set of proposed data imputation methods, and their variations, on a real data set. We determine the tradeoffs involved in the proposed techniques. A common characteristic of the studied techniques is that they depend on the recent behavior of the data stream and do not make specific assumptions about the long-term stochastic behavior of the data.

Interior sensor nodes along a data collection tree can remove redundancies and reduce the required bandwidth for the aggregate data. Assuming that the sensed information is propor-tional to the sensed area, we propose heuristic algorithms to build data gathering trees in order to reduce communication costs. The algorithms are completely distributed and are based on finding shortest hop paths and employing particular tie-breaking mechanisms. The mechanisms can be divided into two categories: those that use simple knowledge of the cardinality of a neighbor's neighbor set and those that rely on knowledge of a distance-monotonic metric to a neighbor. We compare five heuristics based on communication cost and also on energy and processing costs. For smaller configurations, the performance of the heuristics are also compared to the optimal. With the proposed approaches, it is possible to build a cost efficient data gathering tree which takes advantage of the data redundancy among closely located sensors.",

For the throughput reduction problem, in this paper, we consider the application of XOR-pairwise network coding (NC) approach to by combining packets destined for distinct users. Through numerous simulation studies and in comparison with the per-flow rates produced by the optimization step without NC, we found that the NC is really efficient and applicable to arbitrary topology DC WSNs for improving the total throughput of the networks although it may change the maxmin rate allocation to individual flows.",

In response, researchers have developed a number of lowfootprint operating systems that take non-traditional approaches to network abstractions, but at the same time, still simplify software development. In these approaches, some elements of modularity are valuable to retain, eg, packet buffer management, which can be factored out of the layers and supported by a generic interface. In this paper, we describe the PicOS operating system with its versatile network interface (VNETI) and describe our experience using it. VNETI\u2019s approach to the problem, where it acts as a mediator between (a) the application programming interface (API),(b) protocol plug-ins, and (c) a physical input/output (I/O) module, allows for an intuitive component-based design with low overheads.

A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is formulated for the problem of determining the optimal FH aggregation nodes that maximise network lifetime. Heuristics are proposed to obtain significant aggregation and to prolong the system lifetime. To facilitate performance evaluation, we adopt a flow loss multiplier that depends on the spatial relationship among sensed areas.

We aim at minimizing the energy costs incurred due to the transmission of the feature vectors among collaborating sensors within a cluster. To this end, we present schemes to generate effective feature vectors of low dimension. An experimental study has been conducted using real acoustic signals of military vehicles recorded during DARPA\u2019s Sensit/IXOs project. The features generated through our proposed schemes are evaluated using K-Nearest Neighbor (-NN) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. Performance results indicate that the proposed schemes are effective in terms of classification accuracy, and can even outperform previously proposed approaches, but, in addition, they are also efficient in terms of communication overhead.",

            "Abstract": "Arterial blood pressure is one of the important biomedical waveforms that possess lots of important clinical and pathological information. This paper aims in designing a technique, which is called characteristic compression method, to perform almost loss less data compression for the continuous arterial blood pressure waveforms. This method uses the spline function to interpolate the original waveform at preselected sample points first. A fourth order spline function is considered with associated formulas in describing the coefficients of the function. A second stage compression is accompanied by using 12-bit digital data representation to store sample points and coefficients for each interval. Numerical simulation confirms that the proposed technique is feasible and does provide a very high compression rate and almost loss less reconstruction for the continuous arterial pulse wave.",

            "Abstract": "Spanning trees rooted at a sink node are often employed for data collection in sensor networks. The node's double task of sensing and forwarding traffic from other nodes results in energy depletion which is dependent on the constructed spanning tree. The approach taken in this paper is to extend the lifetime of a sensor network by judiciously recalculating the data collection tree to adjust it pro-actively before nodes fail due to total energy depletion. The proposed scheme attempts to make energy-critical nodes leaf nodes, or, as a last resort, to balance the traffic load handled by them. Additionally, an exponentially decaying threshold is used for adaptively characterizing nodes as critical. Simulations demonstrate significantly improved network lifetime but also point to the need to carefully set the thresholds for characterizing nodes as critical.",

We consider an aspect of tracking: the classification of targets based on the acoustic signals produced by vehicles. In this paper, we present a naive classifier and simple distributed schemes for vehicle classification based on the features extracted from the acoustic signals. We demonstrate a novel way of using Aura matrices to create a new feature derived from the power spectral density (PSD) of a signal, which performs at par with other existing features. To benefit from the distributed environment of the sensor networks we also propose efficient dynamic acoustic features that are low on dimension, yet effective for classification. An experimental study has been conducted using real acoustic signals of different vehicles in an urban setting. Our proposed schemes using a naive classifier achieved highly accurate results in classifying different vehicles into two classes. Communication and computational costs were also computed to capture their trade-off with the classification quality.",

We study the properties exhibited by RWP, with a focus on the impact of the rectangular boundary and the speed of the mobile nodes moving within the boundary. The most notable result is that the average node density within the rectangle is non-uniform, contrary to what is frequently assumed. The density, in fact, does depend on the speed of the nodes. Only at high mobility speeds, and in the asymptotic sense, does the density become approximately uniform. The direct implications of the non-uniformity are studied from the point of view of network connectivity. It is found that higher mobility speed results in better connectivity. We also find that irrespective of the speed, when multiple connected components are present, they typically consist of a very large component and (potentially several \u2026",

In the age of mobile computing devices, less space, less memory, and simpler architecture are strong selling points. The ARM architecture is at the center of power-efficient computing. ARM processor cores are found today in cell phones, palmtops, and numerous other embedded devices. Steve Furber\u2019s book covers the architecture, instruction set, assembly programming, and support mechanisms for high-level languages and building operating systems. However, several chapters of the book are devoted to the particular features of the ARM architecture and how they can be exploited. One such characteristic of ARM processors is the so-called Thumb instruction set, the specific instruction set \u201ccompression\u201d approach that gives ARM an edge over other RISC architectures. Thumb instructions are 16 bits long. The result is a40percent faster code compared to plain ARM code and, even more important, a 30 percent less external memory power compared toplain ARMcode.

In the recent past, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have emerged as a promising means to improve the current construction localization applications due to the ease of deployment and expandability to large scale construction projects, low cost, and capacity to function efficiently under dynamic and rough environments. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based localization is a popular technique especially for indoor environments, where satellite based positioning is infeasible. This study evaluates multilateration localization, a popular localization technique, in construction environments as well as a second, profiling-based, localization technique. Both techniques RSSI values collected in a WSN. Indoor experiments were conducted and their results reveal that acceptable position accuracy can be obtained with the profiling-based architecture.",

We note that optimistic space\u2014parallel PDES algorithms (Time Warp) allow the arbitrary overlap between computation and communication, but suffer in terms of performance because of (a) the frequent communication between the Logical Processes (LPs), (b) the frequent calculation of a distributed snapshot (in the form of the Global Virtual Time (GVT)), and (c) the inherent limit up to which any model can be topologically decomposed.

Our primary contribution in this context is EXTOK, a provably correct and topology-independent new filtering-based algorithm for processing exact top-k queries. As a secondary contribution we confirm a previous result of ours by showing that the efficiency of top-k query processing algorithms, including EXTOK, can be further improved by simply choosing a proper underlying logical tree topology. We examine EXTOK's performance with respect to a number of parameters and different logical tree topologies while using both synthetic and real data sets. Our simulation reveal that EXTOK consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm by a very significant margin and regardless of the underlying logical tree \u2026",

Dense urban environments are increasingly facing RF spectrum congestion, in particular in the ISM bands. The Internet of Things is only expected to add to the pressures. In this work we outline an architecture that will analyze and resolve spectrum congestion. We are motivated by the adaptive and modifiable nature of existing protocols, inspired by existing capacity planning and channel allocation schemes from cellular networks, and emboldened by the synergies possible via software\u2013defined radios. The cloud computing infrastructure can be leveraged to perform most compute-intensive tasks required towards this goal. We are encouraged that the approach is viable by the relatively static, in the local sense, topology \u2026",

The architecture determines the location of mobile sensor nodes by evaluating radio signal strengths (RSS) received by stationary sensor nodes. Only a limited quantity of reference points with known locations and pre-calibrated RSS in relation to pegs are used to lock on the most likely position coordinates of a tag. Indoor experiments were conducted, revealing that acceptable position estimation with 1-2 m accuracy can be obtained with this flexible sensor network architecture. To simulate the dynamic setting of a construction site, controlled experiments were also conducted by parking a car at various locations in the testing environment in order to evaluate the impact of imposed obstacles on location estimation performance.

SensorGIS provides an integrated service-oriented architecture for collecting, archiving, analyzing, and visualizing sensor network data in a geographic information system (GIS). By using an extendible GIS framework as one of its user views, SensorGIS can contextually communicate the collected data, its trends, and distinct values of interest. In addition, it is designed in the service-oriented style and hence is extendible in terms of the analyses and visualizations. Finally, it integrates an online collaborative forum that enables annotation of the collected data with the users\u2019 observations and interpretations.",

            "Abstract": "In the simple devices used for wireless sensor networks, the costs associated with a layered approach can be significant. Small-footprint operating systems have been developed by adopting non-traditional approaches to network abstractions while still aiming to simplify software development. In these approaches, some elements of modularity are valuable to retain, eg, packet buffer management, which can be factored out of the layers and supported by a generic interface. In this paper, we describe the PicOS operating system with its versatile network interface (VNETI) and describe our experience using it. VNETI\u2019s approach to the problem, where it acts as a mediator between (a) the application programming interface,(b) protocol plug-ins, and (c) a physical input/output module, allows for an effective component-based design with low overheads. With our essentially layer-less approach to networking, we have found it intuitive to incorporate even the simplest devices into nontrivial networks.",

            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of transmission scheduling in wireless networks. A good transmission scheduling scheme should not only be conflict-free, in the sense of resolving collisions and the hidden terminal problem, but should also provide fairness and transmission efficiency to each node. We propose a class of scheduling schemes that rely on the logical ordering of the schedule update operations. The ordering is imposed by the precedence relationship of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Two examples of establishing the logical DAG are given: (a) one relies on a distributed spanning tree construction; (b) one is based on location information. A separate mechanism ensures that nodes do not behave in a greedy fashion and monopolize the schedule slots. We prove the correctness of DAG-based schemes and provide simulation results that demonstrate their fairness and efficiency attributes.",

Previous proposals also did not pay due attention to the underlying logical tree topology used for data aggregation and forwarding. In this context, this paper presents two main contributions:(1) we propose the use of a particular tree topology, based on Dominating Sets, which is well suited to explore the network\u2019s physical topology for processing top-k queries efficiently; and (2) we propose EXTOK, a filtering-based algorithm for processing the exact top-k values query, we also prove its correctness and investigate its performance with respect to a number of parameters, including network link failures. In all examined cases, EXTOK performs consistently well while effectively exploiting the proposed logical tree topology and it is also resilient to link failures.",

The goal is to be able to verify those applications exhaustively before programming the hardware, such that no further (field) tests are necessary.

Existing aggregation convergecast algorithms do not capture the volatile nature of energy reserves of energy harvesting nodes. We therefore propose, and evaluate, new scheduling schemes to address this gap. We also introduce metrics to capture the impact of the inevitable energy depletion on the quantity of aggregated data received at a sink node. Specifically, we consider node behaviors where the inability to perform prompt communication due to energy depletion results in a reduction of the sampling rate (including for aggregated data) and, if it persists, loss of data. The performance evaluation is based on heat flow data collected from an apartment building in the Canadian North. The collected heat flow data are used to approximate the energy harvesting output of thermoelectric harvesters.",

The design and evaluation of such algorithms necessitates a prudent and comprehensive approach since these algorithms require a tight integration of power and communication systems. A simple link failure or a sophisticated cyberattack launched against the grid's monitoring, communication, and control infrastructure could rapidly grow out of control, making the grid unstable. We investigate the design and implementation of a high-fidelity smart grid simulation platform which integrates a network simulator and a power flow simulator using the Mosaik co-simulation framework. The platform allows for evaluating the performance of new control algorithms and understanding dynamics of modern distribution grids \u2026",

The book is primarily aimed at programmers implementing PPP or users and administrators troubleshooting PPP installations. To James Carlson\u2019s advantage, PPP is a very well-known protocol that has already reached a remarkable level of maturity. To the general audience considering PPP, still an alternative to SLIP, it should be pointed out that PPP currently provides load balancing between different lines, multilink capabilities, forms of bandwidth management, and so on, and can routinely be tunneled around the Internet or sent over Ethernets.

We extend our previous work in which we collected received signal strength traces using mote-class synchronized receivers at sample rates that are, to the best of our knowledge, higher than previously described in the literature. These traces contain distinct interference patterns, each with a different potential for being exploited by cognitive radio strategies. In order to exploit a pattern, however, a node must first recognize it. Given the energy and space constraints of a node, we explore succinct decision tree classifiers for the two most disruptive patterns.

All transmissions required for a completed data collection to the sink node are to be scheduled in a single TDMA frame. Concurrent transmissions are possible within each TDMA slot as long as no collisions occur at the intended recipients of each transmission. We observe that previously proposed heuristics to solving the aggregation convergecast scheduling problem rely on a decomposition into two phases. The first phase is the construction of an aggregation tree, typically a Shortest Path Tree (SPT), and the second phase is scheduling transmissions. We express the constraints of the aggregation convergecast problem in a manner compatible with a constraint programming solver, and extract solutions for small sized instances. The, admittedly sparse, evidence suggests that the resultant aggregation \u2026",

The wide use of many varieties of intrusion detection systems reveals a certain degree of acceptance that, despite our best intentions for building secure systems, there is always enough opportunity for attacks, possibly exploiting weaknesses of the very systems we thought to be secure. Moreover, even though attacks usually follow patterns that can be subsequently used to detect them, they also happen to be the product of intelligent adversaries - humans. The ability to orchestrate ever more elaborate attacks, exhibiting patterns not seen before, means that we expect an IDS to be ready to discern new patterns found to be conceivably detrimental to the security requirements of a system.

We observe that existing schemes adopt essentially a two phase approach, consisting of, first, a tree construction and, second, a scheduling phase. Following a similar approach, we propose two new improvements, one to each of the two phases. Starting with a new lower bound on the schedule length, we make use of it in the tree construction phase. The tree construction phase consists of solutions to instances of bipartite graph semi-matchings. The scheduling phase is a weight-based priority scheme that obeys dependency (tree) and interference constraints. Our extensive experiments show that, overall, our proposed solution not only outperforms all previously proposed solutions in terms of schedule length, but it also significantly extends the network\u2019s lifetime.",

Our simulation experiments strongly suggest that the single\u2013path paradigm of implementing network\u2013layer virtual circuits neither yields the best utilization of network resources (buffer space) nor is it able to provide the best end-to-end service in terms of loss rate and delay. Instead, it turns out that the dynamic exploration of alternative paths at the packet level, ie, asynchronous deflection routing assisted with small buffer space at the routers, results in a more efficient, and also more economical, delivery. By the latter we mean the lower overall buffer space requirements, aggregated over the routers as well as the end\u2013points of the isochronous sessions.",

            "Abstract": "A key requirement for the successful deployment of Video-on-Demand (VoD) systems is to maintain both bandwidth efficiency as well as tolerable startup latency. The startup latency is defined as the interval between the point a user \u201ctunes\u2013in\u201d to (starts downloading) the video content and the point at which the uninterrupted playout of the video can start. Periodic broadcast schemes have been proposed to solve the VoD distribution problem for the set of the most requested videos. However, the current proposals for periodic broadcast schemes assume CBR encoded videos. The few existing proposals for support of the bandwidth\u2013efficient family of VBR encoded videos are available at the cost of data loss due to overflow of the broadcast link capacity by the aggregate traffic of the simultaneously transmitted segments. In this paper we address the issue of the VBR encoded video broadcast and we propose LLBE (a Loss\u2013Less Bandwidth\u2013Efficient scheme), which, in contrast to previous techniques for VBR video, is an inherently loss\u2013less broadcast distribution scheme. Given ample client storage, LLBE can satisfy any a\u2013priori prescribed per\u2013video startup latency. In LLBE, the bandwidth necessary for the transmission and downloading of a video is minimized through an optimization process. We observe that the minimization of the server bandwidth can be stated as a shortest path problem. Finally, example performance results of LLBE and a discussion of some issues related to its implementation are presented.",

Assuming that the sensed information is proportional to the sensed area, we propose heuristic algorithms to build data gathering trees in order to reduce communication costs. The algorithms are completely distributed and are based on finding shortest hop paths and employing particular tie-breaking mechanisms. The mechanisms can be divided into two categories: those that use simple knowledge of the cardinality of a neighbor\u2019s neighbor set and those that rely on knowledge of a distance\u2013monotonic metric to a neighbor.

The really interesting parts start with data link protocols where bit stuffing, CRC, and ARQ protocols are presented along with a corresponding project for each. MAC protocols are represented by two chapters and an equal number of projects, one on Ethernet and one on token rings. Similarly, two chapters and two projects are related to the network layer, one dealing with shortest path calculation and one with link state updates. The transport layer includes only one project: naturally, building a reliable end-to-end protocol. The pleasant surprise is the inclusion of a project in multicasting, which boilsdown to theconstruction processof amulticast tree.

Since location and movement constitute meaningful evidence for many everyday tasks (e.g., presence in the bathroom correlates with personal hygiene activities), we are motivated to develop an efficient, accurate, and noninvasive occupant-localization method. To this end, we propose a methodology for planning the deployment of an array of privacy-respecting binary motion sensors. In particular, given the geometric constraints of the deployment space, we generate a model of indoor mobility patterns typical for a single occupant.

Thirdly, a density-based clustering algorithm is presented to solve the ambiguity of the target appearing area. Based on which, a two-stage centroid localization algorithm is proposed, which is especially useful for the case of irregular appearing area of the target.

In addition to collecting data from the vehicle's sensors, an OBU can collect data from other, visited, sources, e.g., sensor networks operating within range.

In this paper, we explore the noise and interference patterns found on 256 frequencies in an indoor urban environment's 900 MHz ISM and non-ISM bands. We begin the process by using off-the-shelf WSN hardware to sample the environment at 5 kHz from 16 locations simultaneously. From these samples, we identify five prevalent patterns and then hand-classify the 4096 traces of noise and interference. Finally, we extract a variety of statistics from the traces and use them in a Bayesian network classifier.",

In addition, we explicitly model bandwidth capacity constraints. The capacity constraints reflect the fact that, from the perspective of a single node, traffic includes data that the nodes originate and forward, as well as traffic they receive and is of no interest to them. This last class of traffic is unavoidable due to the transmission radius of nearby stations.

We therefore focus on studying the performance of a DC-WSN with respect to its throughput. We assume a deterministic DC behavior. Our elementary notion of traffic is that of a traffic flow, routed via multiple hops from a source to a destination node. Since DC results in different network\" links\" to be present at different points in time (a\" link\" exists only if both adjacent nodes are ON at the same time), the topology of the network varies over time. In this paper, we propose a general approach of modeling time-varying topologies of duty-cycled networks via node phases by dividing node cycles into unchanged-topology stages, in which the rates allocated to multi-hop flows can be expressed as solution of a max-min problem (assuming predetermined routing) and the rates computed via the max-min programming \u2026",

The lifetime is optimized using a LP (linear programming) framework built on a multicommodity network flow model to which we introduce the concept of flow loss multiplier to express the impact of data aggregation over correlated data. To balance energy consumption across the network, data aggregation is performed only at the first hop (FH) transmission. Heuristics are proposed to obtain significant FH aggregation, accordingly prolonging system lifetime. Simulation results show that FH aggregation possesses characteristics that make it suitable under certain data collection applications/scenarios",

SCTP is motivated by the inconveniences of TCP\u2019s ordered byte stream service model.

Furthermore, the idea of multihomed IP hosts (as exhibited by IPv6) is not exploited by TCP, and TCP is also vulnerable to certain denial of ser-vice attacks. SCTP essentially provides a solution to these issues, while maintaining the same congestion control logic as TCP.

The book by Uyless Black includes the IP protocols as well as data link protocols and an assortment of protocols that appear to be interesting and related to the Internet. The book emphasizes the informal description of the protocols and their corresponding operational aspects. Assuming no prior specialized knowledge for the reader, it provides a mixture of undergraduate networking textbook material and a description of very specific protocols with which the casual reader may be familiar. After a brief historical overview, a one-chapter description of some of the Internet\u2019s most important components is given. In a little more than 60 pages, a summary of the IPv4 address structure, IP routing, and DNS is given. Naturally, the breadth is limited, but is later expanded in subsequent chapters dedicated to individual components of the Internet architecture. Chapter two deals with the data link layer, which also illustrates the difference between the end-to-end error control concept as applied to a transport protocol (TCP) and the hop-by-hop error control using point-to-point data link protocols. The third chapter is devoted to the particular set of LAN MACS, with the usual assortment of Ethernet (at various speeds), Token Ring, and FDDI.

In this paper, we report on a data centric language extension based on a tuple-space abstraction, akin to Linda [2], applied to PicOS [5], a programming environment for wireless sensor networks (WSN's). The extension improves state and context management in a multi-tasking environment suffering from severe memory limitations. The solution integrates tuple operations into the model--for networking, event handling, and thread contexts. We demonstrate how tuple constructs improve coding and reduce code overhead. We also show how thread's context-tuples can be used as interface arguments for extension by modular aspect constructs.",

The multiple\u2013path routing compensates for the inaccurate link state (LS) information. It is found that the frequency of LS dissemination is not the only factor to influence performance. For large LS update periods, the nature of the LS information also has a dramatic effect. For example, LS information that inhibits the use of certain links, ie, links found to be congested when sampled in the last LS update, can block several future requests. We study the problem by considering exceptional additions to the periodic LS updates, when the residual link bandwidth decreases or increases dramatically. We subsequently examine the resulting blocking rate improvement and its corresponding control message overhead. Our findings indicate that certain schemes result consistently in blocking rate improvements for a small amount of additional control overhead.",

Real-world evaluation of alternative possible sensor-deployment configurations is labor-intensive, costly, and time-consuming, which implies the need for a simulation-based methodology. In this work, we report on such a methodology that supports the modeling of indoor spaces, the activities of their occupants, and the behaviors of different types of sensors. We argue that, in order for a simulation to be useful for the purpose of evaluating a sensor deployment configuration, it has to generate realistic event streams of individual sensors over time, as well as realistic compositions of sensor events within a time window. We have evaluated our simulator for smart indoor spaces, S I M s i s toolkit, in the context of our Smart-Condo ambient-assisted living platform, supporting the observation and analysis of activities of daily living (ADLs). Our findings indicate that S I M s i s produces realistic agent traces and sensor readings, and has the potential to support the process of developing and deploying sensor-based applications.

The framework supports anonymous transfers, to protect user privacy, as well as pre-authentication of data to be received, to reduce the likelihood of spoofs and the resulting bandwidth wastage. Divalia is composed of two parts: the hash set dual-request protocol, to challenge a would-be provider to prove the possession of the requested file; and, a form of Direct Anonymous Broadcast, for anonymous acquisition of information to be used for the challenge. One goal of this paper is to demonstrate how an original and secure P2P system can be constructed within the constraints and opportunities of mobile wireless ad-hoc networks through the use of well known and extensively studied component cryptographic methods",

            "Abstract": "Among available undergraduate networks texts, the one by Zhcng and Akhtar follows a particularly interesting structure. First, two example applications introduce corresponding architectures: voice'communication for telephone networks on one hand, clientserver applications for packet-switched networks on the other. Mechanisms are presented to illustrate how such networks operate. The examples lead to more detailed information, such as the distinction along the lines of topology and the need for standards. The second part deals with the principles of data communications at the level of signals and modulation but is, oddly, complemented by a section on videoconferencing (applications and standards). The OS1 reference model is next, but once more the chapter includes, oddly enough (since a separate chapter on the topic exists), an introduction to network performance. The OS1 model is followed by LAN technologies (the majori-ty of which is a description of the IEEE 802 standards), including hardware aspects, with the somewhat misplaced addition of LAN operating systems. A single chapter describes TCP/IP, from addressing to IP to essentials of routing and transport layer protocols (TCP and UDP), ending with applications (SMTP, FTP, POP3, Telnet, DNS) as well as dialup data link protocols (SLIP, PPP). What is surprising is the relatively sparse information on HTTP despite a section devoted to Web applications. The next theme discusses access and high-speed technologies. This is really a chapter on both the last mile, as well as on LAN and WAN protocols, namely ISDN, DSL, SMDS, Frame Relay, FDDI, High Speed Ethernet, FDDI \u2026",

In effect, we are studying how the agreement of nodes, eg, via consensus, on the class of a channel can be linked to the cross-correlation statistic and to what extent. We find that the particular class impacts the degree to which we can confidently claim that the channel observed independently by each node, and classified to belong to the same class, indeed behaves the same way.",

We study the effect of reducing the RSSI value to a single bit, essentially turning the RSSI measurement into a proximity indicator. We consider systems where a device, that needs to be localized, transmits and the transmission is received by a number of receivers placed at fixed and known locations. We consider two modes of 1-bit quantization: one (global) where the quantization is defined uniformly across all signal receivers, and one (local) where the RSSI is quantized separately for each receiver. We compare the effects of 1-bit quantization across three profiling k-NN-based localization algorithms, comparing them with each other in addition to comparing against results when no quantization is performed. We furthermore consider the case of global 2-bit quantization. Our study is based on profiling \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of localizing and tracking multiple occupants in an indoor space, where the occupants are tagged with RFID tags and the space is embedded with anonymous (Passive Infrared, PIR) motion sensors and identity (RFID reader) sensors. Our localization method uses the RFID readings to disambiguate the occupants' trajectories recognized by the motion sensors. Due to their high cost and generally cumbersome placement requirements, RFID readers must be judiciously placed; in this paper, we study the placement of the readers such that the occupants' trajectory ambiguity is reduced. We rely on a heatmap representing the frequency with which individuals visit locations as they move through the indoor space and on models of coverage for the PIR sensors and RFID readers and develop a heuristic for the RFID reader placement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via simulations.",

            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of aggregation convergecast scheduling as it applies to wireless networks. The solution to aggregation convergecast satisfies the aggregation process, expressed as precedence constraints, combined with the impact of the shared wireless medium, expressed as resource constraints. Both sets of constraints influence the routing and scheduling. We propose an aggregation tree construction suitable for aggregation convergecast that is a synthesis of a tree tailored to precedence constraints and another tree tailored to resource constraints. Additionally, we show that the scheduling component can be modeled as a mixed graph coloring problem. Specifically, the extended conflict graph is introduced, and through it, a mapping from aggregation convergecast to mixed graphs is described. In the mixed graph, arcs represent the precedence constraints and edges represent the resource \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We exploit the relatively predictable nature of wireless sensor networks that exhibit fixed topology and fixed application demands for off-line construction of TDMA schedules. In particular, we are able to account for the duty cycling (DC) behavior of the nodes, and hence for the time-varying properties of the underlying communication graph. The novelty lies in pursuing an alternative to a genuinely algorithmic, but notoriously computationally hard, scheduling approach. Specifically, we leverage the fact that the system is virtually a deterministic one and use a pre-simulation technique, detecting when the system has reached steady state, past which point the behavior is essentially periodic. We extract from the pre-simulation a periodic schedule template which can be subsequently used, with minor adjustments, as the TDMA schedule of all nodes in the network. We study the properties of the technique and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The objective of increasing capacity in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) by exploiting the mobility of nodes has produced interesting but rather unrealistic results. The throughput improvement is not followed by reasonable delay performance, and in realistic settings there is a need to compensate for the potentially low mobility of all, or parts of, the network. We explore the throughput/delay tradeoff by attempting to utilize all possible service (transmission) opportunities that may exist. To this end, a measure of redundancy is introduced and its impact characterized. The definition of redundancy admits both the replication of data items as well as the traversal of paths. We study three schemes, where the third is a new proposal for a hybrid scheme that balances off a limited form of routing with relayed packet propagation. We find that the hybrid is resilient to the impact of mobility, providing good performance even at low \u2026",

Focusing on the particular case of smart homes with multiple occupants, we developed a location-and-movement recognition method using many inexpensive passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors and, a small number of, more costly RFID readers. In our method, PIR sensors, placed throughout the space, recognize movement while RFID readers, placed in key locations, recognize tags worn by individuals as they pass through their coverage area. The RFID readings are used to disambiguate the trajectories constructed based on PIR sensor readings. We evaluate through simulations the effectiveness of our method under different occupancy conditions.",

We introduce a scheme, FairShare, that handles the long-lived flows and achieves global max\u2013min fairness. The short-lived flows are bundled together and a separate family of mechanisms, DAS, dynamically allocate bandwidth to match the load of newly instantiated short flows. Thus, two different objectives are met: fairness for the long flows, as well as reduced response times and reduced response time variance for the short flows. We argue that the applications are better served this way. Namely, applications generating short transfers are predominantly interested in short response times (e.g. HTTP requests/responses) while those generating long transfers (e.g. long FTP transfers) are at least provided a guarantee they are not penalized compared to other similar connections \u2026",

Legacy MAC protocols based on CSMA/CA are overly restrictive in the interest of avoiding collisions, and are unable to exploit the MPR capability of receivers. We demonstrate how a combination of mechanisms, based on well-known techniques, such as Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD), and the back--pressure (BP) principle, can be used to effectively control medium access in multi-hop MPT/MPR networks. The AIMD component is used to regulate the size of\" bundles\" of simultaneously transmitted packets, while back--pressure provides the basis for prioritizing, locally, which flows' packets should be transmitted in a bundle. We study the performance of the proposed protocol, AB-MAC, under three different models of node coordination in static wireless \u2026",

In this paper, we address the problem of cost-efficient sensor placement for highquality indoor localization, taking into account sensors with diverse coverage footprints, and the occlusion effects due to obstructions typically found in indoor environments. The objective is the placement of the smallest number of sensors with the right combination of footprints. To address the problem, and motivated by the vast search space of possible placement and footprint combinations, we adopt an evolutionary technique. We demonstrate that our technique performs faster and/or produces more accurate results (depending on the application) when compared to previously proposed greedy methods. Furthermore, our technique is flexible in that adding new sensor footprints can be trivially accomplished.",
