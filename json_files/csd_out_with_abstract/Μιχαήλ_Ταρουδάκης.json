            "Abstract": "The feasibility and efficiency of inversions in ocean acoustic travel-time tomography critically relies on the ability to accurately model and predict the reception of an acoustic source at a distant receiver in the time domain (arrival pattern), as well as its perturbations due to changes in the sound-speed distribution. The present work introduces an approximation method for wave-theoretic arrival-pattern predictions in general range-dependent ocean environments based on Born and Rytov approximations of the second order. The range-dependent ocean environment is considered as a perturbation of a range-independent reference state, for which the acoustic field of a point source in the frequency domain, ie the Greens function, is modelled using normal-mode theory. Then using the Born and Rytov approximations the perturbed Greens function, corresponding to the perturbed ocean environment, is expressed in terms of the unperturbed Greens function and the medium (sound-speed) perturbation for each frequency within the source bandwidth. Using the normal-mode representation for the unperturbed Greens function, closed-form expressions for the first and second Born and Rytov approximations are derived, generalizing previous results for Green\u2019s function perturbations in range-independent environments, and indicating that the effects of range dependence on the acoustic field in the time domain are of second order. To cope with the multi-modal nature of ocean acoustic propagation, a variation of the standard Rytov method is applied, proposed by J. Keller, according to which the Rytov approximation is applied to each modal component \u2026",

This scheme aims at the definition of a set of stochastic observables that could characterize the signal. To this end, the signal is decomposed into several levels using the stationary wavelet packet transform. The extracted wavelet coefficients are then modeled by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gaussian emission distributions. The association of a signal with a representative HMM is performed utilizing the expectation-maximization algorithm. Eventually, the signal is characterized by the set of parameters that describe the HMM. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed as the similarity measure of two signals, comparing their corresponding HMMs. To validate the performance of the proposed characterization scheme, which is denoted as the probabilistic signal characterization scheme \u2026",

The study addresses the varying response of the processor to changes in the values of geoacoustic parameters, in different frequencies and ranges from the source. It is shown that certain parameters are better estimated in low frequencies and shorter ranges. This observation led to the development of a two-stage algorithm which searches for certain sets of parameters in different frequencies and ranges. Thus, the complexity and dimensionality of the problem are reduced, improving the efficiency of a genetic algorithm search, both in terms of quality of the results and computational cost.

In this work we will compare two of these techniques namely the \u201cwarping\u201d, that resamples the original signal in a non-uniform manner that accounts for the dispersion, and the \u201creassignment\u201d, that sharpens the initial energy distribution of the acoustic field in the timefrequency domain. Both can be applied to spectrograms and scalograms in order to provide a better characterization of the modal structure of the acoustic field in comparison with the classical representations. Since mode identification is essential for inverse problems of acoustic oceanography, these techniques provide a significant improvement of the resolution of the signal \u201cobservables\u201d which are associated with the dispersion and the modal character of the waveguide. The comparison of these techniques will be based on both real and simulated acoustic signals and an initial assessment of their potential as signal processing tools in inverse problems of acoustical oceanography, including geoacoustic inversion, will be discussed.",

Mode identification is important for inverse procedures in underwater acoustics. An efficient way to recognize the modal structure of the acoustic field when a single hydrophone is available is to refer to the time frequency analysis of the recorded signal using wavelet transform. However, the standard wavelet transform in some cases may result in an obscure representation of the dispersion curves. Thus, a reassigned process is proposed which brings important improvements in the time frequency representation of the signal. This is achieved by moving the calculation point of the scalogram in the center of gravity of the energy concentration, associated with each one of the propagating modes. This argument is supported by two illustrative examples corresponding to propagation of \u2026",

At both experiments low-cost autonomous systems for underwater acoustic recordings have being used. These recorders were developed and manufactured at the laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Measurements of the Institute of Applied and Computational Mathematics of FORTH using custom made and off the shelf components. The systems were calibrated so that they can be used for measurements of ambient noise along with other potential applications. In this paper the systems components and their operation and features will be briefly descripted. Results of initial tests at the laboratory including calibration of the system in air at low frequencies will be presented. Finally results of the first two pilot experiments near Heraklion port will be presented and discussed. Comparing the ambient noise measured in the two experiments, the seasonal change between summer and winter of the ambient noise-at 1/3 octave bands-will be shown and discussed.",

Acoustic signals are efficient carriers of information on the medium through which they have propagated. By appropriate processing of the acoustic field due to some acoustic source measured in the marine environment, the properties of the sea-bed and/or the water column can be estimated. The estimation of the water column properties (mainly the sound speed profile but also the water currents) has been the main objective of Ocean Acoustic Tomography, whereas the recovery of the sea-bed parameters, a concept introduced in acoustical oceanography and the sea-bed exploration longer time ago, is the main objective of the geoacoustic inversion applications.This presentation concerns sea-bed reconstruction by acoustic means. This area is associated with numerous applications. Oil exploration, assessment of the rigidity of the sea-bed for off-shore constructions, geological surveys of the sea-bed, seismic studies, are among the applications associated with the use of acoustics for estimating the sound speed, the shear speed and the density of the sediment layers and the substrate, the acoustic attenuation, the location of the interfaces determining the sea-bed layers etc.",

            "Abstract": "Recordings of pulsed sounds (clicks) from Cuvier\u2019s beaked whales are presented. Such recordings have not been reported in the literature before. Spectrogram analysis of data collected off SW Crete (Greece) from 1998 to 2000 revealed numerous sequences of clicks. Click pulses had durations of about 1 ms and their energy content in the audible spectrum presented a narrow peak between 13 and 17 kHz. Sequences of 35\u2013105 clicks, with duration 15\u201344 s, were separated by short intersequence pauses of 3\u201310 s. Interclick intervals appeared fairly constant, primarily oscillating between 0.40 and 0.50 s. Characteristics of Cuvier\u2019s beaked whale clicks were consistent with echolocating cetaceans, suggesting that this species do echolocate.",

            "Abstract": "Protection against noise is one of the six essential requirements of the European Construction Product directive. In buildings, airborne sound insulation is used to define the acoustical quality between rooms. In order to develop wall structures with optimal sound insulation, an understanding of the physical origins of sound transmission is necessary. The purpose of this thesis was, firstly, to study and compare the validity of existing physical models to predict the sound insulation of wall structures, and, secondly, to study the benefits of the sound intensity measurement method for determining the sound insulation. To develop the kind of knowledge that is applicable to the improvement of real wall and door structures was the motive behind this study.Five main results are summarized in the following. I. It was possible to measure wall structures with a considerably, up to 22 dB, higher sound reduction index with the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "It is well known that internal waves in the ocean are an important source of environmental variability which has serious effects in the structure of an acoustic field due to a known source. When measurements of the acoustic field form the input data for an inversion procedure aiming at the recovery of the environmental parameters, the information they carry on includes the internal wave effects. It is therefore natural to assume that neglecting the effects of the internal waves in an inversion procedure based on acoustic field measurements, errors are induced in the inversion. The paper deals with this problem and addresses the case of inversion schemes using travel time information of an acoustic signal. Using a statistical 2D model of the internal waves, based on the Garrett and Munk spectrum, the spatial and temporal evolution of the internal waves field as well as the fluctuations of the sound speed profile is \u2026",

Most of the experiments that have been conducted so far are related to local transmission-reflection phenomena which are encountered in problems of bottom reflectivity and bottom or material recognition. The experimental tank at the Laboratoire de Mecanique et d'Acoustique in Marseilles, provides an ideal environment for testing long range propagation codes. The tank is relatively long and the water depth is adjustable in order to simulate real propagation experiments in environments of variable depths. The purpose of this paper is to describe the experimental procedure for the realization of a long range propagation experiment in the tank using sources of appropriate frequency. The water bottom is simulated, using real sand with well known properties. The measured \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Acoustical signals in applications of acoustical oceanography, such as ocean acoustic tomography and sea-bed classification using acoustic signals emitted from known sources, are optimally exploited if they are noise free. The effect of blur in acoustic signals has not been well studied, although the blurring mechanism might introduce severe problems in the use of the acoustic signals for specific applications, especially, those using the full signal as the carrier of the relevant information. Deblurring of the signals in addition to denoising is therefore essential for the effective use of the signals. In our work, we apply a Statistical Optimal Filtering method that uses the Singular Value Decomposition of a first estimate of the blurring matrix and statistics to deblur the signal in an efficient and effective way and to quantify uncertainty for the recovered signal. In this talk, we will present the method and discuss its effectiveness \u2026",

Following the work by Taroudakis et al. (JASA 119 (2006) 1396\u20131405) the acoustic signal is characterized using the statistics of the wavelet sub-band coefficients, which obey a certain statistical law, described by an Alpha-Stable distribution. Thus, the signal observables are the set of the parameters of the appropriate distributions at the various levels of the signal decomposition. In this work an inversion procedure based on a Genetic Algorithm and the statistical characterization of the acoustic signal, is described. The quality of a certain population of candidate model parameters (properties of the water columns and/or the sea-bed) is evaluated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of the \u2026",

Acoust. Soc. Am. 119, 1396\u20131405 (2006)] using data from an experiment at sea. The data were collected during the Shallow water '06 (SW06) experiment off the New Jersey Continental Shelf and the inversion results (sea-bed geoacoustic parameters and source range) are compared with those reported from the same data by Bonnel and Chapman [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 130(2), EL101\u2013EL107 (2011)]. The comparison and the signal reconstruction using estimated values of the model parameters are satisfactory indicating that the new signal characterization method is useful for practical applications of acoustical oceanography.",

            "Abstract": "Inverse problems have a long history in acoustics, optics, electromagnetics and geophysics, but only recently have the signals provided by ocean acoustic sensors become numerous and sophisticated enough to allow for realistic identification of the ocean parameters. Acoustic signals propagating for long distances in the water column and reflections of underwater sound from the ocean boundaries provide novel problems of interpretation and inversion. The chapters in this volume discuss some of the contemporary aspects of these problems. They provide recent and useful results for bottom recognition, inverse scattering in acoustic wave guides, and ocean acoustic tomography, as well as a discussion of some of the new algorithms, such as those related to matched-field processing, that have recently been used for inverting experimental data. Each chapter is by a noted expert in the field and represents the state of the art. The chapters have all been edited to provide a uniform format and level of presentation.",
