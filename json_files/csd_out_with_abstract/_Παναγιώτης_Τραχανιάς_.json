            "Abstract": "Internet security is an arms race between attackers and the whitehat community. Honeypots are a valuable asset that helps researchers and security experts obtain knowledge for both known and unknown attacks. Honeypots are specially designed hosts set up to act as decoys for attackers and automated attacking tools. Since a single honeypot host can only receive a small portion of the unsolicited internet traffic and thus has limited chances to be the victim of a cyber attack, a distributed monitoring infrastructure of cooperative honeypots is needed.Network of Affined Honeypots (NoAH) aims to develop and deploy a large scale system of honeypots which cooperate in order to identify new and analyze existing attacks. NoAH is composed of a core that is comprised of low and high interaction honeypots, which are responsible for interacting with the attackers and analyze the received traffic. Apart from the core, there are tunneling and funneling mechanisms that collect and direct traffic from participating honeypots to the NoAH core. Moreover, home users and small enterprises can participate in NoAH infastructure through Honey@ Home tool. Honey@ Home listens to the unused address space of a home or enterprise network and forwards received traffic to the NoAH core. In this thesis we present a prototype deployment of the NoAH infastructure along with some experimental results and record our experiences with the NoAH infrastructure. Results suggest that we can build a robust and effective infrastructure with moderate resource requirements.",

Accordingly, the introduced framework is established as a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) process that enables the reproduction of either learned or novel actions. Mapping of human actions to the respective robotic ones is achieved via an indeterminate depiction, termed latent space representation. The latter accomplishes a compact, yet precise abstraction of action trajectories, effectively representing high dimensional raw actions in a low dimensional space. Extensive experimentation with a real robotic arm demonstrates the robustness and applicability of the introduced framework.",

The proposed system utilizes upper body part tracking in a 9-dimensional configuration space and two Multi-Layer Perceptron/Radial Basis Function (MLP/RBF) neural network classifiers, one for each arm. Classification is achieved by buffering the trajectory of each arm and feeding it to the MLP Neural Network which is trained to recognize between five gesturing states. The RBF neural network is trained as a predictor for the future gesturing state of the system. By feeding the output of the RBF back to the MLP classifier, we achieve temporal consistency and robustness to the classification results. The proposed approach has been assessed using several video sequences and the results obtained are presented in this paper.",

This suggests that to observe an action, these primates employ their motor and somatosensation areas in order to simulate it internally. In line with this finding, in the current paper, we examine relevant neuroscientific evidence in order to design a computational agent that can facilitate observational learning of reaching movements. For this reason, we develop a novel motor control system, inspired from contemporary theories of motor control, and demonstrate how it can be used during observation to facilitate learning, without the active involvement of the agent\u2019s body. Our results show that novel motor skills can be acquired only by observation, by optimizing the peripheral components of the agent\u2019s motion.",

            "Abstract": "This paper considers the problem of a robot navigating in a crowded or congested environment. A robot operating in such an environment can get easily blocked by moving humans and other objects. To deal with this problem it is proposed to attempt to predict the motion trajectory of humans and obstacles. Two kinds of prediction are considered: short-term and long-term. The short-term prediction refers to the one-step ahead prediction and the long-term to the prediction of the final destination point of the obstacle's movement. The robot movement is controlled by a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). POMDPs are utilized because of their ability to model information about the robot's location and sensory information in a probabilistic manner. The solution of a POMDP is computationally expensive and thus a hierarchical representation of POMDPs is used.",

Unfortunately, such measurements commonly suffer from outliers in a dynamic environment, since frequently it is assumed that only the robot is in motion and the world is static. To this end, robust state estimation schemes are mandatory in order for humanoids to symbiotically co-exist with humans in their daily dynamic environments. In this article, the robust Gaussian Error-State Kalman Filter for humanoid robot locomotion is presented. The introduced method automatically detects and rejects outliers without relying on any prior knowledge on measurement distributions or finely tuned thresholds.

Specifically, we introduce a new computational framework for modelling partial brain areas following a coevolutionary agent-based approach. Properly formulated neural agents are employed to represent brain areas. A cooperative coevolutionary method, with the inherent ability to co-adapt substructures, supports the design of the models, and additionally provides a consistent methodology to achieve their integration. The implemented models are successfully embedded in a simulated robotic platform which supports environmental interaction. The proposed approach is utilized to design two distinct models: one for primary motor cortex able to drive the robot in a purposeless wall avoidance mode, and one for hippocampus which supports selflocalization. These models are further integrated by adding at the same time prefrontal structures, in order to drive the robot in a purposeful mode, accomplishing a DMS task in a cross (+) maze.",

For each body part a set of hypotheses is generated and tracked over time by a Particle Filter. To evaluate each hypothesis, we employ a novel metric that considers the reprojected Top View of the corresponding body part.

We carried out a novel experiment with five groups tracking the brain frequency states of people while relaxing or performing certain sensorimotor tasks in an interactive, immersive 3D environment. The primary aim of this novel research is human cognition augmentation and improvement of task performance via a unique VR-induced entrainment methodology. In most of our experimental groups, we witnessed the transition of the beta-wave to the alpha-wave state. The brainwave entrainment at alpha frequency (10Hz) and relaxation via modern VR, using our open s/w framework, allowed us to verify for the first time enhanced task performance in a fast-learning setup. These first results empower us to plan future studies concerning clinical treatments in VR entrainment using modern wearable devices.",

Their emotional state, the difficulty of the activity performed during this interval, and the attention that it required were also assessed, together with their subjective experience of the passage of time. The results showed that the mean time estimates and their variability increased linearly with increasing interval duration, indicating that the fundamental scalar property of time found for short durations also applies to very long durations of several minutes. In addition, the emotional state and difficulty of the activity were significant predictors of the judgment of long durations. However, the awareness of the passage of time appeared to play a crucial role in the judgment of very long duration in humans. A theory on the emergence of the awareness of the passage of time and how it affects the judgment of interval durations lasting several minutes is therefore discussed.",

            "Abstract": "This letter presents a novel cascade state estimation framework for the three-dimensional (3-D) center of mass (CoM) estimation of walking humanoid robots. The proposed framework, called State Estimation RObot Walking (SEROW), fuses effectively joint encoder, inertial, feet pressure, and visual odometry measurements. Initially, we consider the humanoid's Newton-Euler dynamics and rigorously derive the nonlinear CoM estimator. The latter accurately estimates the 3D-CoM position, velocity, and external forces acting on the CoM, while directly considering the presence of uneven terrain and the body's angular momentum rate and, thus, effectively coupling the frontal with the lateral plane dynamics. Furthermore, we extend an established floating mass estimator to take into account the support foot pose, yielding in such a way the mandatory, for CoM estimation, affine transformations and forming a cascade state \u2026",
