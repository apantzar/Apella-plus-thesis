This integration means that different service and network providers will have to interoperate in order to offer their services to end users. This multidomain environment poses serious threats to the end user who has contract with, and trusts only a limited number of operators and service providers. One such threat is end users\u2019 privacy on which we will focus in this paper. Probably the most promising protocol for multimedia session management is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which is an application layer protocol and thus can operate on top of different lower layer technologies.

            "Abstract": "In many cryptographic applications it is necessary to generate elliptic curves (ECs) whose order possesses certain properties. The method that is usually employed for the generation of such ECs is the so-called Complex Multiplication method. This method requires the use of the roots of certain class field polynomials defined on a specific parameter called the discriminant. The most commonly used polynomials are the Hilbert and Weber ones. The former can be used to generate directly the EC, but they are characterized by high computational demands. The latter have usually much lower computational requirements, but they do not directly construct the desired EC. This can be achieved if transformations of their roots to the roots of the corresponding (generated by the same discriminant) Hilbert polynomials are provided.

After surveying related work, we propose a novel public key management scheme using the well-known web-of-trust or trust graph model. Our scheme is based on a binary tree formation of the network's nodes. The binary tree structure is proved very effective for building certificate chains between communicating nodes that are multihops away and the cumbersome problem of certificate chain discovery is avoided.

Although desktop and high-end server security seems to be under control by the use of current security technology, securing the low-end embedded computing systems is a difficult long-term problem. This is mainly due to the fact that the embedded systems are constrained by their operational environment and the limited resources they are equipped with. Recent research activities focus on the deployment of lightweight cryptographic algorithms and security protocols that are well suited to the limited resources of low-end embedded systems. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) offers an interesting alternative to the classical public key cryptography for embedded systems (eg, RSA and ElGamal), since it uses smaller key sizes for achieving the same security level \u2026",

Nowadays, this security gap has been addressed by two cryptographic mechanisms: DNSSEC and DNSCurve. They both utilize public key cryptography and extend the core DNS protocol. Although the second mechanism is still in its infancy while the first is well-standardized, they are both promising and are quite likely to compete with each other in the near future to gain acceptance.

Electronic lotteries at a national level are a viable cost effective alternative to mechanical ones when there is a business need to support many types of \u201dgames of chance\u201d and to allow increased drawing frequency. Electronic lotteries are, in fact, extremely high risk financial application: If one discovers a way to predict or otherwise claim the winning numbers (even once) the result is huge financial damages. Moreover, the e-lottery process is complex, which increases the possibility of fraud or costly accidental failures. In addition, a national lottery must adhere to auditability and (regulatory) fairness requirements regarding its drawings. Our mechanism, which we believe is the first one of its kind to be described in the literature, builds upon a number of cryptographic primitives that ensure the \u2026",

Since medical services and the associated to them information are considered particularly sensitive, the employment of wireless sensors in medical environments poses many security issues and challenges. However, security services and the underlying key management mechanisms cannot be seen separately from the efficiency and scalability requirements. Network clustering used in both routing and group key management mechanisms can improve the efficiency and scalability and therefore can also be envisioned in medical environments. This paper introduces a general framework for cluster-based wireless sensor medical environments on the top of which efficient security mechanisms can rely. We describe two different scenarios for infrastructure and infrastructure \u2026",

In the paper, we will demonstrate the security properties of the new GKA protocol and present its communication/computation efficiency.

Among all known class polynomials, Weber polynomials constructed with discriminants\u2212 D\u2261 1 (mod 8) have the smallest height and require the least precision for their construction.

A crucial step of this method is to compute the roots of a special type of class field polynomials with the most commonly used being the Hilbert and Weber ones, uniquely determined by the CM discriminant D. In attempting to construct prime order ECs using Weber polynomials two difficulties arise (in addition to the necessary transformations of the roots of such polynomials to those of their Hilbert counterparts). The first one is that the requirement of prime order necessitates that D \u2261 3 (mod 8), which gives Weber polynomials with degree three times larger than the degree of their corresponding Hilbert polynomials (a fact that could affect efficiency). The second difficulty is that these Weber polynomials do not have roots in . In this paper we show how to overcome the above difficulties and \u2026",
