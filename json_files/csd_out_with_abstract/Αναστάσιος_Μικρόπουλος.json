This study investigates the impact of these factors on social presence in an Educational Virtual Environment. Eighty two students participated in a 2x2 experiment (embodiment vs. non-embodiment x voice-chat vs. text chat), which was designed as a guided-teaching activity in Second Life. Results show that embodiment of the communicative other does not affect social presence and other presence dimensions, while communicating via voice elicits higher levels of social presence than communicating via text. More research is needed in order to identify the role of each one of the above factors to social presence in Educational Virtual Environments.",

Conventional teaching methods usually cannot overcome these difficulties, which we consider may be because of the lack of appropriate teaching aids. The purpose of the present study is the design and development of an educational virtual environment for the support of the teaching of planetary phenomena, particularly of the movements of the Earth and Sun, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. Our interactive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment was based on the results of an empirical study of 102 secondary school students and provides students with new experiences, personal involvement and close-up examination of the phenomena under study.

Many issues regarding the educational affordances of MUVEs and the learning experience of users are still under research. Presence is an important phenomenon users experience when interacting with and via virtual environments and seems to play an important role in learning. This chapter presents empirical data gathered from an exploratory study regarding a problem-based physics learning activity in Second Life (SL). Our aim is to gain knowledge and experience about the sense of presence (spatial and social) that emerges while students collaborate in MUVEs. Students (n = 30) collaborated \u201cin-world\u201d to solve a problem. Data were gathered using the Temple Presence Inventory questionnaire. Results indicate higher scores of social presence than spatial presence. Correlations \u2026",

The programming language itself is not as much a challenge as the concepts and structures, which define it. This paper explores the use of educational robotics to introduce basic programming concepts through meaningful teaching and learning activities with the hands-on use of bee-bots. The results from an empirical study show that students can successfully develop algorithmic thinking and programming skills based on their knowledge acquired by the bee-bots. Thanks to the tactile interaction with robots, students developed their creativity and imagination as built systems with Lego WeDo, all the while enjoying the course through teamwork activities. ",

The cognitive processes can be detected through neuroimaging techniques and contribute to a better understanding of the environmental stimuli used in science education. Electric brain activity of 15 female students was analysed at theta and alpha frequency bands while interacting with affective visual stimuli in a digital learning environment for earthquake precaution measures. The participants recognized all the ten objects, showed visual awareness and mental effort and distinguished their meaning as useful and non-useful items. These results indicate that brain activity can be used for the design and assessment of digital learning environments and contribute to the field of educational neuroscience.",

The Arduino Uno board is programmed to act as a data acquisition device that receives and processes data from analogue or digital sensors and transmits the results to a computer via a USB connection. At the same time, on the computer, the libreMBL-GUI application, developed with the Python programming language, enables serial communication to be set up for interactive user-system communication, the start and end control of real-time graphical representation of the measurements, interactive student navigation on graphs, and data storage for later processing. The proposed system is open-source, cross-platform, and transparent to the material. Thus, it can support different Arduino types, while it can display the measurements of any compatible sensor connected to the Arduino \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Children generally find it traumatic to change schools. They fear losing their way or arriving late at classes as a result of their not knowing the spatial layout of the new school campus. Spatial disorientation is a source of anxiety and probably delays their academic progress. This may be especially so for children with motoric or cognitive disabilities, or children who are temperamentally unsuited to coping with change. There is great potential for the use of virtual environments to provide groups of children with the opportunity to explore the school environment before they arrive. Each \u201cVE\u201d child will be provided with a virtual version of their new school which they can navigate at ease within their own home, as many times as they like, prior to the start of their first term. Previous studies have confirmed that children (including pupils with disabilities) do acquire extremely good\" cognitive spatial maps\" of schools from virtual exposure alone. Following VE exposure, children will be tested for their spatial knowledge in school, emotional responses to school attendance, speed of settling-in, attitudes to teachers and other pupils, feelings of confidence, and anxiety level, also the speed with which they make academic progress in the first weeks at the new school. The VE-trained children will be compared with equivalent control groups given either a tour of the real campus, or no prior exposure. Subgroups of children might particularly benefit from virtual spatial pre-training, including children with disabilities or having poor directional sense.",

The aim of the study was the evaluation of virtual learning environments using the above methodology in addition to the standard methodology of social sciences and educational research, namely quantitative and qualitative empirical research. Twelve university students, undergraduates and postgraduates, were asked to perform the same task in a real and a virtual environment. During the two processes, their brain signals were recorded and analyzed. Eye-movement measurements showed that all the subjects were more attentive when navigating in the virtual world. The difference between alpha and beta rhythms for the virtual task indicated that students placed more attention in the virtual environment and were more \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Learning computer programming can be challenging for primary school students due to its abstract concepts. While teachers seek effective ways to introduce such concepts, the application of learning objects (LOs) can potentially reduce the effort of creating new material from and allows teachers to adapt LOs to students\u2019 needs. Although numerous LOs have been developed for multiple disciplines, there is a current research gap using LOs in teaching and learning computer programming at the primary school level. The current paper aims to explore the quality of five Scratch-based LOs created to facilitate teaching and learning programming in primary education. We followed a single instrumental case study collecting data from 25 in-service teachers and 91 primary school students, who, using the LORI instrument, evaluated Scratch-based LOs created in real learning contexts.

Some of them refer to robotics education, rather than educational robotics. Others follow a constructionist approach, but give emphasisonly to design skills, creativity and collaboration. Some studies use robotics as an educational tool in engineering education, science and programming learning implying mindtools, but they do not give evidence of mindtool characteristics. This work proposes educational robotics as mindtools based on constructivism and especially constructionism. The positive learning results from two case studies on physics and programming teaching indicate that educational robotics can be used as mindtool ssupporting knowledge construction through the design of meaningful authentic projects, learning by doing in both the virtual and real world, facing cognitive conflicts and learning by reflection and collaboration.",

Their main contribution comes from their technological characteristics, the ways they record, represent, manage and transfer information. These characteristics concern the management of high volume of data and information in a short time, information presentation through dynamic interactive and multiple representations, as well as the communication and motives they provide. The essential contribution of ICT to the learning process comes indirectly, through their pedagogical exploitation and certain features that arise for the technological characteristics. This mainly involves tasks for the active participation of students and teachers, action and counteraction through interactive activities, as well as processes that support the creation of mental models.",

            "Abstract": "Studies showed that two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) educational content contributes to learning. Although there were many studies with 3D stereoscopic learning environments, only a few studies reported on the differences between real, 2D, and 3D scenes, as far as cognitive load and attentional demands were concerned. We used electroencephalographic measurements to study and compare the theta (\u03b8), alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2) and gamma (\u03b3) frequency bands of 36 adult female participants. The participants observed three environments with the same content, a real, a 3D and a 2D environment. Brain activity was recorded for each environment and their two versions, ie, a before version and an after version, where the position of specific objects changed. Our study\u2019s findings indicated that all participants perceived the three environments, their depicted objects, and the change of the objects\u2019 position. The participants\u2019 cognitive load and attentional demands were higher in all environments before the change of the objects\u2019 position. Working memory load, working and spatial memory, were also higher in the two digital environments (3D and 2D) before the change of the objects\u2019 position. However, the opposite was observed in the case of the real environment. This was attributed to the participants observing the real environment firstly. Overall, we propose that empirical studies with biometric data on cognitive load and attentional demands will support the design of better learning environments.",

The review categorized articles into three categories, namely theoretical approaches, technological approaches and evaluation studies. The review showed that open and distance learning is mainly technology driven. Researchers exploit the technological features of Information and Communication Technologies for the design and development of ODL environments, without paying much attention to and applying theoretical models, pedagogical principles and instructional goals. They rather seem to follow the conventional, general instructional design guidelines concerning stand-alone educational software applications, mostly based on hypermedia systems. The main theoretical approach implied by the majority of the published work is constructivism together with collaborative learning, without referring to or applying social constructivism. Our proposal for effective open and distance learning environments is the exploitation of the tools Information and Communication Technologies offer in a constructivist environment involving specific didactic goals and learning outcomes.",

This study investigates the learning activities conducted in Second Life, the most popular and widely used among the \"sandbox\" type MUVE platforms, as reported in 205 empirical studies, by associating them with the learning affordances they enact. As necessary step towards this goal, the study proposes a new classification of learning affordances of MUVEs and a new concrete set of learning activities based on the literature review.

Numerous machine learning techniques and especially supervised learning algorithms have been applied to develop accurate models to predict student's characteristics which induce their behavior and performance. In this work, we examine and evaluate the effectiveness of two wrapper methods for semisupervised learning algorithms for predicting the students' performance in the final examinations. Our preliminary numerical experiments indicate that the advantage of semisupervised methods is that the classification accuracy can be significantly improved by utilizing a few labeled and many unlabeled data for developing reliable prediction models.",

Secondly, EEG recordings were used to examine how the game element of feedback for earned and lost points would be best incorporated in the game and how these elements affect players\u2019 experience. The results from the Delphi survey showed that the most important features to be included in the games are constructive elements, learning environments suitable for authentic learning, as well as elements which promote fun. Moreover, the experts highlighted that learning objectives should be included in activities in a way that the learners will not realize the actual learning process, but feel that they participate in everyday life experiences and examples. Bloom\u2019s taxonomy was also proposed as a way to match the learning elements with the game elements. EEG data combined with empirical data from questionnaires showed that players prefer to have audio feedback when gaining or loosing points during the gameplay rather than visual feedback or no feedback at all and contributed to the development of our digital educational game design guidelines.",

The aim of this study was to design a VE for culinary education and evaluate it in terms of user experience with two different levels of immersion: low (desktop) and high (head-mounted display\u2014HMD). Twenty-four students and graduates of an Institute of Vocational Training specializing in either ICT or culinary arts participated in this study. Results showed no significant differences in terms of spatial presence, usability, and workload between the two groups. Nevertheless, participants using the HMD interface needed more time to complete a recipe and experienced much higher simulator sickness. It seems that the lower immersion interface is more appropriate for this specific  VE.",

The goal of this study was to design specialized tasks with the use of virtual reality, as a screening process of characteristic memory difficulties for undergraduate students diagnosed with dyslexia. Results showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the performance of students with dyslexia and students without dyslexia, a finding which highlights the development and successful use of compensatory memory strategies by individuals with dyslexia. Taking into consideration the realistic design of the specialized and targeted assessment tasks, the study's insight results and the recorded positive attitude of the participants, it seems that use of such virtual environments, like our VIRDA-MS, could mark a significant breakthrough in the \u2026",

Many issues regarding the educational affordances of MUVEs and the learning experience of users are still under research. Presence is an important phenomenon users experience when interacting with and via virtual environments and seems to play an important role in learning. This paper presents empirical data gathered from an exploratory study regarding a problem-based physics learning activity in Second Life (SL). Our aim is to gain knowledge and experience about the sense of presence (spatial and social) that emerges while students collaborate in MUVEs. Students (n= 30) collaborated \u201cin-world\u201d in order to solve a problem. Data were gathered using the Temple Presence Inventory (TPI) questionnaire. Results indicate higher scores of social presence than spatial presence. Correlations were found between dimensions of presence, subjective computer expertise and tendency to become involved in activities.",

This work presents the first comparative results of adult women on the effects of stereoscopic perception in three different static environments; a real, a two dimensional (2D) and a stereoscopic three dimensional (3D), all with the same content. Electric brain activity of 36 female students was analyzed at \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 frequency bands. Results in alpha rhythm as well as alpha desynchronization showed that the topology of cerebral activity is the same in the three environments. The participants experienced three similar and non-demanding environments without specific memory requirements and information encoding. Statistical differences in theta activity showed that the real and 3D environments caused similar cognitive processes, while the 2D caused an increase of anxiety indicating that perhaps participants were looking for the third dimension. Beta and gamma activity showed that participants perceived the third dimension of the stereoscopic environment as in the real one, something that did not happen in the 2D environment. Our findings indicate that stereoscopic 3D virtual environments seem to approximate the real ones as far as it regards the cognitive processes they cause. Three dimensional stereoscopic environments increase users\u2019 attention over the 2D and cause less mental effort. These experimental results support the new field of educational neuroscience and its potential to the design of digital learning environments.",

            "Abstract": "Although problem-based learning (PBL) has many advantages, it often fails to connect to the real world outside the classroom. The integration with the laboratory setting and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been proposed to address this deficiency. Multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) like Second Life (SL) are 3D collaborative virtual environments that could act as complementary or alternative worlds for the implementation of laboratory PBL activities offering low-cost, safe, and always available environments. The aim of this study was to compare a simple laboratory PBL activity implemented in both the real and virtual worlds, in terms of learning outcome, satisfaction, and presence. The sample consisted of 150 undergraduate university students. The results show that the MUVE provided similar learning outcome and satisfaction to the real-world condition. Presence was positively correlated to satisfaction but not to the learning outcome. Finally, there are indications that the MUVE was perceived as more pleasurable and informal learning environment, while reality was perceived as more stressful. [Author abstract]",

            "Abstract": "This work investigates the effects of a special designed multimedia gloss on learning outcomes concerning vocabulary learning in German as a second language in elementary school pupils. The gloss involves annotations of unknown words in three different representations: text translation from German into Greek, presentation of the word in German and its translation pronounced in Greek, and word interpretation by using a picture. Thirty one pupils of ages 10-11 years interacted with the multimedia gloss and participated in computer-based learning activities. The outcomes on vocabulary learning were positive, with the majority of pupils to prefer the aural annotations of the unknown words. The attitude of all pupils towards use of the multimedia gloss and activities was also positive. Our findings support Mayer\u2019s cognitive theory of multimedia learning in the field of language learning.",

It proposes the study of brain waves coming from different areas of the cortex and their spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transforms for the understanding of various cognitive processes taking place during specific tasks of users interacting with computer-based educational environments, and especially virtual reality (VR) systems. The model proposed is supported by recent experimental findings reflecting greater alertness and task \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In today\u2019s knowledge economy formal education establishments are faced with a number of challenges regarding the improvement of students\u2019 learning. With respect to the need for promoting educational reforms, technology can play a catalytic role by providing unique opportunities for creating effective learning environments. Digital games constitute an example of a technological facilitator that can be exploited for the design and implementation of pedagogical innovations. Existing research provides evidence for the effectiveness of digital games with respect to achieving subject-speci\ufb01c learning objectives. However, there are relatively few efforts concerned with the investigation of their impact on the development of higher-order cognitive skills, as well as emotional and motivational outcomes. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate game-based assessment methods makes imperative the need for further research that will allow for establishing evidence-based conclusions about the learning effectiveness of digital games. Within this context, the aim of this book chapter is to provide an overview of research issues related to digital game-based learning with an emphasis on its application in formal education settings identifying differences between school and higher education.",

During the last decades, a variety of accurate models has been developed to monitor students\u2019 future progress, while most of these studies are based on supervised classification methods. In this work, we propose an ensemble semi-supervised algorithm for the prediction of students\u2019 performance in the final examinations at the end of academic year. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm compared to some classical classification algorithms, in terms of accuracy.",

This article tries to give an overall approach proposing three groups of interconnected factors for the design and evaluation of educational software. These are the information content, the context, and the evaluation process. These groups of factors are represented in three-dimensional graphs. The space under each graph integrates the design and evaluation criteria for educational software.",

In this paper, we present a new user-friendly decision support tool for predicting students\u2019 performance concerning the final examinations of a school year. Our proposed tool is based on a hybrid predicting system incorporating a number of possible machine learning methods and achieves better performance than any examined single learning algorithm. Furthermore, significant advantages of the presented tool are that it has a simple interface and it can be deployed in any platform under any operating system. Our objective is that this work may be used to support student admission procedures and strengthen the service system in \u2026",

With respect to the need for promoting educational reforms, technology can play a catalytic role by providing unique opportunities for creating effective learning environments. Digital games constitute an example of a technological facilitator that can be exploited for the design and implementation of pedagogical innovations. Existing research provides evidence for the effectiveness of digital games with respect to achieving subject-specific learning objectives. However, there are relatively few efforts concerned with the investigation of their impact on the development of higher-order cognitive skills, as well as emotional and motivational outcomes. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate game-based assessment methods makes imperative the need for further \u2026",
