Specifically, for a radially symmetric problem with monotonic initial data, it is shown that the solution quenches, so that touchdown occurs in the device, in a situation where there is no steady state. It is also shown that quenching occurs at a single point and a bound on the approach to touchdown is obtained. Numerical simulations illustrating the results are given.",

It is considered that during the melting of such a material a mushy region is formed and initially the behaviour of the material at the microscale is analysed. Then with the method of averaging a phase field type model is constructed for the macroscale, which consists of a system of partial differential equations and this is solved numerically. Finally the results are used to simulate the signal of MTDSC.",

The model simulates the anchovy biomass by combining an age-specific growth equation and a continuous age-structured population model based on the McKendrick\u2013Von Foerster equation. Model predictions were compared to the biomass estimates and annual catches during the period 2003\u20132008. The present work provided direct evidence for the significance of the prespawning period as a critical life period for the management of anchovy stock in the Aegean Sea. It was found that the introduction of additional management measures could increase the profits in the long run for the fishery. However, for these to become apparent they will require a minimum of four years \u2026",

These models are derived from averaging using the multiple-scales method applied on microscopic Stefan-type problems to capture the effects of the microscopic transformation of calcite into gypsum. The resulting macroscopic model for the diffusion and production of the sulphate inside the concrete is coupled with a time-dependent Eikonal equation describing the evolution of the reaction at each point of the concrete wall. In certain cases and for specific geometries of the microstructure, the Eikonal equation admits analytical solutions, and the model takes the form of a macroscopic non-local problem. The models derived are solved numerically with the use of a finite-element method, and the results for various microstructure \u2026",

At the level of the pore scale, we extend an existing model for colloidal dynamics  including the  evolution of free interfaces separating  colloidal particles deposited on solid boundaries (solid spheres) from the colloidal particles transported through the gaseous parts of the porous medium.  As a result of deposition, the solid spheres grow, therefore reducing the space available for transport in the gaseous phase. Upscaling procedures are applied and several classes of macroscopic models together with effective transport tensors are obtained, incorporating explicitly the local growth of the solid spheres. The resulting models are solved numerically and various simulations are presented. In particular, they are able to detect clogging regions \u2026",

The solid matrix of this porous medium is assumed to be made out of circles of not-necessarily uniform radius. The growth or shrinkage of these circles, which are governed by an ODE, has direct feedback to the macroscopic diffusivity via an additional elliptic cell problem. The reaction\u2013diffusion system describes the macroscopic diffusion, aggregation, and deposition of populations of colloidal particles of various sizes inside a porous media made of prescribed arrangement of balls. The mathematical analysis of this two-scale problem relies on a suitable application of Schauder\u2019s fixed point theorem which also provides a convergent algorithm for an iteration method to compute finite difference approximations of smooth solutions to our multiscale model \u2026",

The  rst challenge was how to optimally recharge the aquifer in order to compensate for the extraction of drinking and irrigation water whilst preventing sea water intrusion. In order to address this challenge we developed model for the water in the aquifer. Note that by exploiting the long, thin nature of the aquifer we only develop two-dimensional models in this work. We  rst develop a simple model based on Darcy  ows for porous media which gives the water table height for given dam seepage rate, recharge and extraction rates; we neglect seawater intrusion. We then use the steady version of this model to develop an optimized recharge strategy with which we can identify minimal recharge required for a desired extracted water volume such that the minimum prescribed water table is respected. We explore 4 di erent scenarios and we  nd that in certain cases there can be a considerable reduction in the amount of recharged water compared to the current empirical strategy the Water Development Department is employing, where water is recharged and extracted in equal proportions. To incorporate the e ects of seawater intrusion, which can be very damaging to the water quality, we next develop transient two- dimensional models of saturated-unsaturated groundwater  ow and solve them numerically using the open source software SUTRASuite and the commercial package ANSYS FLUENT; the \u2026",

First we establish local existence of the solutions of the problem for any \u03bb> 0. Then we focus on the singular behaviour of the solution, which occurs through finite-time quenching, ie when|| u (\u00b7, t)||\u221e\u2192 1 as t\u2192 t\u2217\u2212<\u221e, investigating both conditions for quenching and the quenching profile of u.

Finally, using a finite difference scheme, we solve the problem numerically, illustrating the preceding results.",

The numerical solution is obtained through a policy iteration like contraction scheme, the convergence properties of which are studied in detail. Furthermore, the expected time until the optimal stopping of the campaign is estimated. Finally, a combined optimal stopping and control problem for the optimization of the advertisement effectiveness is also proposed and solved numerically.

Next for some particular versions of the model, regarding its boundary conditions, we derive quenching results as well as estimations of the probability for such singularity to occur. Additional numerical study of the problem in one dimension follows, investigating the problem further with respect to its quenching behaviour.",

Corrosion of monuments is an important aspect that should be studied in relation with the conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. There are a lot of factors that cause this process and in general it is quite difficult to determine all of them together with their significance and study the problem in its full complexity. Certainly one of them is air pollution. Various pollutants existing in the atmosphere especially in big cities like Athens, Rome, etc can react, under certain conditions, with calcium carbonate and create damage, corrosion in natural building stones, marble monuments etc.",

Furthermore an extension of this model is constructed allowing the formation of a mushy region, i.e. a region in which the material is only partly corroded throughout the process. This more general model is derived via an averaging process by microscopic considerations and has the form of a macroscopic phase field model. The derived model in its various forms is solved numerically with a finite element method and the results, predicting corrosion within a reasonable range, are presented.",

More specifically there is emphasis on the variation of the overall diffusion resulting from the changing shape of a single pore due to corrosion process and on the resulting volume expansion of the material as the outcome of the transformation of calcium carbonate to gypsum. These models are derived by averaging, with the use of the multiple scales method applied on microscopic moving-boundary problems. The latter problems describe the transformation of calcium carbonate into gypsum in the microscopic scale.
