The switching is achieved through the variation of the refractive index and the losses of the micro rings with current injection, which alters the overall output spectral response. The switch is suitable for optical burst switching systems and metro architectures as it provides fast optical switching in the ns scale with contrast ratio higher than 30 dB for 10 Gbps intensity modulated signals. Its potential applications to a metro network node are discussed.",

Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that using our method, four 10 Gb/s random bit streams are obtained from a SC pulse source with verified randomness.

By a single-hop communication design between On-Rack Switches, 3D P-Torus achieves great latency and throughput performance, as calculated through detailed simulations. All buffering needs are covered through electronic buffering, avoiding hard to implement and expensive optical buffering. 3D P-Torus can support, with no need for amplification, medium-sized-DCs up to 10k servers, making it an excellent candidate for Edge Data Centers, taking into account its excellent low end-to-end latency.",

The key point for the regenerator's operation is related to the fact that a high-power intensity modulated signal depletes the continuous wave pump in such a manner that the latter becomes intensity modulated and inverted compared to the signal. Using a cascade of two such devices a non-inverted, either wavelength converted or not, amplitude modulated output, which exhibits regenerative characteristics with respect to the input signal can be provided. Extended numerical simulations have been carried out on one hand to estimate the transfer characteristics of the regenerator and on the other hand to assess the cascadability performance on a typical 40Gb/s transmission system.

Calculation of the mean synchronization error and Q-factor values obtained from the corresponding eye diagrams has been carried out for two encoding methods (chaotic modulation and chaos shift keying) and two repetition rates (2.4 and 5 Gbps). It is shown that transmission impairments including chromatic dispersion, fiber nonlinearity, fiber losses, and amplified spontaneous emission noise of the inline amplifiers degrade significantly the synchronization quality especially when high-bit-rate message encoding is applied.

The unique property of phase sensitive processes that differentiate them from other regeneration techniques is the perfect phase quantization they offer in two discrete phase states differing by \u03c0. When higher order modulation formats are targeted, for instance QPSK, either two typical PSAs should be incorporated, each for each quadrature, or a multi-format PSA, which however is not capable of providing ideal quantization [2].

An evaluation of the above technique at 10 Gb/s including fiber transmission over 10 and 20 km indicates that microring lasers could efficiently operate as low-cost directly modulated transmitters in metro/access networks.",

Nanophotonic structures such as photonic crystals may be used to manipulate light thereby adding intelligence in the optical physical layer. All-optical applications like optical buffering, optical switching, signal regeneration etc. are only a few applications that can be considered in future network nodes with integrated photonic crystal devices. Slow light propagation, ie reducing the group velocity of the propagating optical signals in photonic crystal waveguides can further enhance the signal processing capabilities of nanophotonic devices. Slow light is ideal for realizing optical buffers in integrated form while at the other hand it can lead to large increase of nonlinearities.

In parallel, optical forces originating from modes and cavities can reach to outstandingly large values when sizes drop into the nanoscale. In this work, we propose the exploitation of large gradient optical forces generated between suspended silicon beams and optomechanical transduction as a means of converting signals from the mid-infrared to the near-infrared region.

One potential way to mitigate against nonlinear phase noise is to use phase-sensitive amplifiers (PSAs) that have been demonstrated to help remove such phase noise as well as to provide simultaneous signal amplitude noise suppression when operated in saturation. Recently, we have shown that a PSA-based signal regenerator based on degenerate four-wave mixing could be implemented in a network-compatible manner in which only the (noisy) signal is present at the device input (black-box operation). However, this scheme was tested only with relatively high-frequency deterministic perturbations applied to the signal.

            "Abstract": "Quantum cascade lasers are the most promising optical source for emission in the mid-infrared and THz region, and they are already used in a large number of applications such as free-space communications, absorption spectroscopy, sensing and so on. In all these applications, the noise properties of the optical sources are critical for the system performance. In this work, the authors present a theoretical study on the intensity noise characteristics of quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) under external non-coherent optical injection. The injection locking has been proven in the past beneficial for noise properties of bipolar lasers, and thus this technique is utilized here in quantum cascade lasers. With the help of various analytical and numerical models, it is shown that intensity noise reduction can be achieved in the operation of the so-called locked slave laser compared to its free-running values. The detailed analysis reveals the contribution of the various noise sources to the intensity noise of the laser and how they affect the injection locking process. Using different numerical models, two distinct schemes are investigated, analysed and discussed, injection on the lasing mode or on non-lasing residual modes of the slave laser cavity.",

The most straightforward scheme is the use of a fiber spool playing the role of a long-time optical delay line which requires either direct or indirect amplitude modulation to maintain the bit timing [1].

Negative signal and idler NFs are measured, and <2 dB NF at >16 dB PS gain is estimated when considering the combined signal and idler input, which is believed to be the lowest measured NF of a non-degenerate PS amplifier to this date. The limitation of the RIN subtraction method attributed to pump transferred noise and Raman phonon induced noise is also discussed.",

The degree of complexity of a chaotic signal can be assessed by means of the Lyapunov exponents from which the Kaplan-Yorke dimension (d KY), and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy are calculated [2]. In this paper, the encryption efficiency of the chaotic carrier, which is defined as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the encrypted message after filtering the combined signal of chaos and signal, is considered as the basic measure of the offered security. Hence, the lower the SNR of the filtered signal is, the higher the encryption efficiency of the system that is achieved.

The obtained results indicate that the locked slave laser may operate under reduced intensity noise levels compared with the free running operation. In addition, optimization of the locking process leads to further suppression of the intensity noise when the slave laser is biased close to the free-running threshold current. The main factors that significantly affect the locking process and the achievable noise levels are the injected optical power and the master-slave frequency detuning.",

Traditional data center network architectures, through the use of electrical packet switches in a multi-tier topology, has fundamental weaknesses such as oversubscription and cabling complexity. Wireless intra-data center interconnection solutions have been proposed to deal with the cabling problem and can simultaneously address the over-provisioning problem by offering efficient topology re-configurability. In this work we introduce a novel free space optical interconnect solution for intra-data center networks that utilizes 2D optical beam steering for the transmitter, and high bandwidth wide-area photodiode arrays for the receiver. This new breed of free space optical interconnects can be developed on a photonic integrated circuit; offering ns switching at sub-\u03bcW consumption. The proposed interconnects together with a networking architecture that is suitable for utilizing those devices could support next generation intra-data center networks, fulfilling the requirements of seamless operation, high connectivity, and agility in terms of the reconfiguration time.

The scheme can be monolithic integrated in a straightforward manner and alleviates the need for external optical injection, as the data can be directly applied on the on-chip phase modulator placed between the two lasers. The scheme also offers the benefit of increasing the nodes compared to a reservoir computing system using either one laser under feedback or laser under feedback and optical injection. Numerical simulations assess the performance of the integrated reservoir computing system in dispersion compensation tasks in short-reach optical communication systems. We numerically demonstrate that the proposed platform can recover severely distorted 25 Gbaud PAM-4 signals for transmission distances exceeding 50km and outperform other competing delay-based reservoir computing systems relying on optical feedback. The proposed scheme, thanks to its compactness and simplicity, can play the role of a monolithic integrated hardware accelerator in a wide range of application requiring high speed real time processing.",

The                         efficiency of data recovery of the conventional and chaos encrypted channels                         is analyzed. 1.25 Gb/s data sequences, that are completely hidden propagate                         along the transmission link, are finally \u2026",

In comparison with previous schemes through off-line analysis of the power of different optical spectral components in the supercontinuum, this, to the best of our knowledge, is the first demonstration of such functionality online in the time domain. Moreover, the extinction ratio among the quantized outputs can exceed 10 dB, which further confirms the feasibility of the proposed quantization scheme.

In this way it is found that in the chaos regime the low-frequency energy of the single-mode output is enhanced by about 25 dB comparing with that of the multi-mode output. Moreover, the associated 3-dB chaos bandwidth can reach around 6 GHz for the single mode case.

The properties of the limiter and their impact on the quantization performance are highlighted. The regenerative operation is demonstrated numerically by showing that a regenerated differentially decoded quaternary shifted keyed signal exhibits almost identical bit error rate performance with homodyne detection.",

Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent multiband emission of quantum-dot devices revealed by the existence of multiple lasing thresholds, a significant enhancement in the neurocomputational capabilities, such as spiking duration and firing rate, is observed. Spike firing rate increased by an order of magnitude that leads to an enhancement in processing speed and, more importantly, neural spike duration was suppressed to the picosecond scale, which corresponds to a significant temporal resolution enhancement.

The regenerator FP laser is injection locked to one of its longitudinal modes by the incoming intensity-modulated light carrying the microwave-frequency standard. The light of a local CW laser is also injected in the regenerator FP, locking it to an adjacent mode. The dual-injection locked laser reproduces the sinusoidal microwave-frequency standard on both wavelengths. The regenerated original signal is transmitted to the next node, whilst the local wavelength is fed back to the previous node for phase error extraction and link compensation. The performance of the proposed regenerator is demonstrated with Allan deviation and phase-noise measurements.",

The spiking neurons used are typical two-section quantum-well vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers that exhibit isomorphic behavior to biological neurons, such as integrate-and-fire excitability and timing encoding. The isomorphism of the proposed scheme to biological networks is extended by replicating the retina ganglion cell for contrast detection in the photonic domain and by utilizing unsupervised spike dependent plasticity as the main training technique. Finally, in this work we also investigate the possibility of exploiting the fast carrier dynamics of lasers so as to time-multiplex spatial information and reduce the number of physical neurons used in the convolutional layers by orders of magnitude. This last feature unlocks new possibilities, where neuron count and processing speed can be interchanged so as to meet the constraints of different applications.",

It is shown that proper adjustment of the operating conditions of a wavelength converter based on four-wave mixing (FWM) in dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) results in significant extinction ratio enhancement and noise suppression of the converted signal. The key issue in the proposed idea is the application of the modulation bitstream on the input pump wave. Detailed numerical simulation shows that it is possible to achieve a wavelength-converted output with extinction ratio of 20 dB when the extinction ratio of the input signal is 10.5 dB, while at the same time, the improvement in the Q-factor is almost 6 (from 6.5 at the input, it becomes more than 12 at the output).
