Existing quantum algorithms can natively solve complex problems, such as the prime number factorization and searching of unstructured databases, in a fast and efficient way. The main obstacle towards building large and efficient quantum computers is decoherence, which produces errors that have to be continuously corrected using quantum error correcting codes. Beyond the realisation of quantum computing systems with actual quantum hardware, quantum algorithms have been developed based on quantum logic gates that can be described and utilised by classical computers and proper interfaces based on linear algebra operations. Furthermore, memristive grids have been proposed as novel nanoscale and low-power hardware accelerators for the time-consuming matrix-vector multiplication and tensor products \u2026",

Memristor-based crossbar architecture has been shown to be the best implementation for ReRAM. However, it faces a major challenge related to the sneak current (current sneak paths) flowing through unselected memory cells, which significantly reduces the voltage read margins. In this paper, five alternative architectures (topologies) are applied to minimize the impact of sneak current; the architectures are based on the introduction of insulating junctions within the crossbar.

            "Abstract": "During the last years, a well studied biological substrate, namely Physarum polycephalum, has been proven efficient on finding appropriate and efficient solutions in hard to solve complex mathematical problems. The plasmodium of P. polycephalum is a single-cell that serves as a prosperous bio-computational example. Consequently, it has been successfully utilized in the past to solve a variety of path problems in graphs and combinatorial problems. In this work, this interesting behaviour is mimicked by a robust unconventional computational model, drawing inspiration from the notion of Cellular and Learning Automata. Namely, we employ principles of Cellular Automata (CAs) enriched with learning capabilities to develop a robust computational model, able of modelling appropriately the aforementioned biological substrate and, thus, capturing its computational capabilities. CAs are very efficient in modelling biological systems and solving scientific problems, owing to their ability of incarnating essential properties of a system where global behaviour arises as an effect of simple components, interacting locally. The resulting computational tool, after combining CAs with learning capabilities, should be appropriate for modelling the behaviour of living organisms. Thus, the inherent abilities and computational characteristics of the proposed bio-inspired model are stressed towards the experimental verification of Physarum's ability to model Logic Gates, while trying to find minimal paths in properly configured mazes with food sources. The presented simulation results for various Logic Gates are found in good agreement, both qualitatively and \u2026",

In the hardware approach, each cell of the automaton is treated as a physical entity as it is represented as a component with its own inputs and outputs.

The 88 revised papers were carefully selected from numerous submissions. In order to give a perspective in which both theoretical and applicational aspects of cellular automata contribute to the growth of the area, this book mirrors the structure of the conference, grouping the 88 papers into two main parts. The first part collects papers presented as part of the main conference and organized according to six main topics: theoretical results on cellular automata; cellular automata dynamics, control and synchronization; cellular automata and networks; modeling and simulation with cellular automata; cellular automata-based hardware and architectures; codes, pseudorandom number generators and cryptography with cellular automata. The second part of the volume is dedicated to contributions presented during the ACRI 2012 workshops on theoretical advances, specifically asynchronous cellular automata, and challenging application contexts for cellular automata: crowds and CA, traffic and CA, and the satellite Workshop on cellular automata of cancer growth and invasion.",

            "Abstract": "The recent discovery of the memristor has renewed the interest for fast arithmetic operations via high-radix numeric systems. In this direction, a conceptual solution for high-radix memristive arithmetic logic units (ALUs) was recently published. The latter combines CMOS circuitry for data processing and a reconfigurable \u201csegmented\u201d crossbar memory block. In this paper we build upon such a conceptual design and propose a 3D extension of the classic crossbar topology via 2T1M cross-points which still permits the parallel creation of partial products for faster multiplication with lower circuit complexity. Furthermore, we present a binary to high-radix data conversion circuit to complement the stateprogramming module of the previous work. A simulation-based validation of read/write multi-level memory operations from/to the 2T1M 3D memristive crossbar was performed using SPICE and a thresholdtype switching model of a bipolar voltage-controlled memristor. Such realization of in-memory computations could lead to faster arithmetic algorithms in future memristive ALUs.",

Digital image scrambling is often used for image encryption and its aim is to transform a meaningful image into a meaningless one to enhance the ability to resist invalid attack and in turn improve security.

The results prove the system to be more efficient compared to popular and contemporary methods such as the histogram intersection, joint histograms and the scalable color histogram of the MPEG-7 standard.

            "Abstract": "This study deals with the evacuation of areas that involve people with disabilities. A crowd evacuation model has been developed using the Cellular Automata (CA) parallel computing tool. This model is capable of simulating and evaluating human behavior and special features that exist when people with disabilities are included in the process of evacuation. During the experimental process, the model simulates the evacuation of a secondary school for disabled children in the prefecture of Xanthi. After attendance and observation of an earthquake safety exercise organized by this school, the total evacuation time is recorded. At the end of this study, the developed model is validated on the basis of actual data and useful conclusions are drawn for the specific application area. In addition, with the modification of the original data, the model is applicable to every building case.",

            "Abstract": "During the last years, a well studied biological substrate, namely Physarum polycephalum, has been proven efficient on finding appropriate and efficient solutions in hard to solve complex mathematical problems. The plasmodium of P. polycephalum is a single-cell that serves as a prosperous bio-computational example. Consequently, it has been successfully utilized in the past to solve a variety of path problems in graphs and combinatorial problems. In this work, this interesting behaviour is mimicked by a robust unconventional computational model, drawing inspiration from the notion of Cellular and Learning Automata. Namely, we employ principles of Cellular Automata (CAs) enriched with learning capabilities to develop a robust computational model, able of modelling appropriately the aforementioned biological substrate and, thus, capturing its computational capabilities. CAs are very efficient in modelling biological systems and solving scientific problems, owing to their ability of incarnating essential properties of a system where global behaviour arises as an effect of simple components, interacting locally. The resulting computational tool, after combining CAs with learning capabilities, should be appropriate for modelling the behaviour of living organisms. Thus, the inherent abilities and computational characteristics of the proposed bio-inspired model are stressed towards the experimental verification of Physarum's ability to model Logic Gates, while trying to find minimal paths in properly configured mazes with food sources.

            "Abstract": "Signal synchronization of large scale Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) circuits is one of the most complex QCA design challenges. More specifically, the QCA circuits synchronization problem, especially in the large circuits, is characterized as rather complex due to technology constraints. In this paper, by extensively analyzing the most important properties of the signal synchronization problem in QCA circuits, we propose an efficient design methodology to tackle the problem, based on the well-known from computer science, Firing Squad Synchronization Problem (FSSP). Comparing FSSP with the QCA circuits synchronization problem many similarities can be found. Among the numerous FSSP's algorithmic solutions in literature, the Mazoyer algorithm has proven to be the most efficient one. In this paper, a novel design and implementation in QCA technology of this algorithm is presented. Moreover, by the \u2026",

In this context, threshold-type switching devices show great retention and switching speed, but still poor controllability. To this end, in this work we use one-dimensional (1-D) networks of anti-serially connected threshold-type memristors, as means to create voltage-controlled ternary memristive switches (TMS). We demonstrate that the number of memristors and their polarity define the memristance corresponding to the different stored information. We present a simulation-based study of their performance using a threshold-type switching model of bipolar voltage-controlled memristors, and comment on the applied programming-pulse characteristics and the most important device-level properties.",

In this work, we put effort on increasing the performance of memristive networks by incorporating external additive noise that will be proven to have a beneficial role for the memristor devices and networks.

The distance between neighboring spikes in a train of spikes is c. 30min. Typically, there are 4\u20136 spikes in a train of spikes.

It has been demonstrated that they can accelerate the solution of various problems exponentially compared to today\u2019s classical computers, harnessing the properties of superposition and entanglement, two resources that have no classical analog. Since quantum computer platforms that are currently available comprise only a few tenths of qubits, as well as the access to a fabricated quantum computer is time limited for the majority of researchers, the use of quantum simulators is essential in developing and testing new quantum algorithms. Taking inspiration from previous work on developing a novel quantum simulator based on memristor crossbar circuits, in this work, a framework that automates the circuit design of emulated quantum gates is presented.

In this chapter, we present an edge-directed method which exploits the simplicity and the inherent parallelism of the Cellular Automata (CA) computational tool to generate high resolution images from low resolution acquired images. This task is accomplished with the help of the Canny Edge Detector so as to discriminate the edge regions from the homogenous ones.

Although classical cellular automata are models of universal classical computation, this is not the case for their quantum counterpart, which is limited by the no-coning theorem and the no-go lemma. Here we combine quantum walks, which reproduce unitary evolution in space with quantum cellular automata, which reproduce unitary evolution in time, to form a new model of quantum computation.

In our attempt to approach this issue we focus solely on the mechanisms of mutagenesis and deliberately disregard the role of natural selection. Hence, in this analysis, evolution refers to the accumulation of genetic alterations that originate from mutations and are transmitted through generations without being subjected to natural selection. We have developed a software tool that allows modelling of a DNA sequence as a one-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) with four states per cell which correspond to the four DNA bases, i.e. A, C, T and G.

Cellular Automaton (CA) is a uniform array of finite-state machines that update their states in discrete time depending on states of their closest neighbors by the same rule. Arrays of MFCs could, in principle, act as massive-parallel computing devices with local connectivity between elementary processors. We provide a theoretical design of such a parallel processor by implementing CA in MFCs. We have chosen Conway\u2019s Game of Life as the \u2018benchmark\u2019 CA because this is the most popular CA which also exhibits an enormously rich spectrum of patterns. Each cell of the Game of Life CA is realized using two MFCs. The MFCs are linked electrically and hydraulically. The model is verified via simulation of an electrical circuit demonstrating equivalent behaviours. The design is a first step towards future implementations of fully autonomous biological computing devices with massive parallelism. The energy independence of such devices counteracts their somewhat slow transitions\u2014compared to silicon circuitry\u2014between the different states during computation.",

In addition, the basic fundamentals of Cellular Automata were adopted in order to achieve better performance both in terms of processing time as well as in image quality. By creating appropriate transition rules, the direction of the edges is considered so that every unknown pixel is processed based on its neighbors in order to preserve the quality of the edges.

We used a similar approach to grow slime mould on a three-dimensional template of Moon to speculate on potential colonization scenarios. The slime mould imitated the propagation of colonisation in an exploratory mode, ie without any definite targets. Additional transportation hubs/targets were added after the initial network was formed, to imitate the development of colonies in parallel with slime mould growth. We provide analyses of proximity graphs representing colonisation networks and support the findings with Physarum-inspired algorithms to inform supply chain design.

A novel circuit design methodology is described where the computing systems comprise passive memristors interfaced with active CMOS circuitry, working under already known circuit design principles from the CMOS technology. The accuracy and completeness of this straightforward methodology is demonstrated through SPICE simulations which are based on a threshold\u2010type device model for memristors.

The unique electrical characteristics associated with them, along with the advantages of crossbar structures, have the potential to revolutionize computing architectures. Being associated with the totally nonlinear behavior of individual memristive elements, circuits of multiple memristors may work in very complicated way, quite difficult to predict, due to the polarity-dependent nonlinear variation in the memory resistance (memristance) of individual memristors. A well defined and effective memristor model for circuit design combined with a design paradigm which exploits the composite behavior of memristive elements, based on well understood underlying logic design principles, would certainly accelerate research on nanoscale circuits and systems.

Their nanoscale dimensions and low power consumption enable the further design of various nanoelectronic processing circuits and corresponding computing architectures, like neuromorphic, in memory, unconventional, etc. One of the possible ways to exploit the memristor\u2019s advantages is by combining them with Cellular Automata (CA).

Current research efforts have focused mainly on resistive switching devices, the electronic analog of synapses in artificial neural networks (ANNs), and the crossbar nanoarchitecture, for its huge connectivity and maximum integration density. In this context, this work presents the design and simulation of a memristive crossbar-based ANN for text recognition tasks, implementing a novel computing algorithm. In such case study, important issues during the application mapping process are identified and properly addressed at device and circuit level. The computing capabilities of the proposed system are highlighted through SPICE-level circuit simulations, which show excellent agreement with theoretical simulation results.",

To facilitate the trend and produce ever smaller, faster and cheaper computing devices, the size of nanoelectronic devices is now reaching the scale of atoms or molecules - a technical goal undoubtedly demanding for novel devices. Following the trend, we explore an unconventional route of implementing a reservoir computing on a single protein molecule and introduce neuromorphic connectivity with a small-world networking property. We have chosen Izhikevich spiking neurons as elementary processors, corresponding to the atoms of verotoxin protein, and its molecule as a \u2018hardware\u2019 architecture of the communication networks connecting the processors.

Among the most promising candidates, memristor demonstrates advantageous characteristics, which open new pathways for the exploration of advanced computing paradigms. In this work we propose the design of a novel crossbar geometry, which is heterogeneous in terms of its cross-point devices, allowing for the realization of true in-memory digital logic computations. More specifically, it is a combination of two stacked crossbar arrays with a shared intermediate nanowire layer. The variety of available cross-points types allows the execution of parallel memristive logic computations, where the logic state variable is voltage. Moreover, the utilization of insulating patterns in the crossbar arrays, at the expense of a small area-overhead, permits the simultaneous parallel read/write memory operation of two memory words. Memory/logic operation is determined through control signals driven from the peripheral CMOS-based driving circuitry, which also comprises row/column decoders, tri-state drivers, and summing/sense amplifiers to allow for the proper programming/reading of the memristive cross-points.",

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for visual multimedia content encryption using Cellular Automata (CA). The encryption scheme is based on the application of an attribute of the CLF XOR filter, according to which the original content of a cellular neighborhood can be reconstructed following a predetermined number of repeated applications of the filter.  The encryption is achieved using a key image of the same dimensions as the image being encrypted. This technique is accompanied by the one-time pad (OTP) encryption method, rendering the proposed method reasonably powerful, given the very large number of resultant potential security keys. The method presented here makes encryption possible in cases where there is more than one image with the use of just one key image. A further significant characteristic of the proposed method is that it demonstrates how techniques from the field of image retrieval can be used in the field of image encryption. The proposed method is further strengthened by the fact that the resulting encrypted image for a given key image is different each time. The encryption result depends on the structure of an artificial image produced by the superposition of four 1-D CA time\u2013space diagrams as well as from a CA random number generator.  A semi-blind source separation algorithm is used to decrypt the encrypted image. The result of the decryption is a lossless representation of the encrypted image. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed encryption method. The proposed method is implemented in C# and is available online through the img(Rummager) application.",

Moreover, an image-processing tracking algorithm is used for the calibration of the system providing all the necessary information about the number of individuals and their distribution in the under test area.

The scope of the method is to derive principal characteristics of collective motion of biological organisms, such as flocks, swarms or herds and to apply them to the simulation of crowd movement. Thus, the study focuses on the massive form of the movement of individuals, which is lastingly detected macroscopically, during urgent circumstances with the help of some form of guidance. Nevertheless, on a lower level, this formation derives from the application of simple local rules that are applied individually to every single member of the group. Hence, the adoption of CA-based formation has allowed the development of a micro-operating model with macro-features. Furthermore, the model takes advantage of the inherent ability of CA to represent sufficiently \u2026",

The majority of retrieval systems are based on descriptors created by aggregating certain amounts of a specific feature from the image itself, thus creating a representation of its content. Over the years, many conventional probabilistic methods have been proposed that attempt to solve the problem of image retrieval. In this chapter, a variety of such methods are presented to pave the path that eventually will lead to an answer of whether or not artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as fuzzy logic are the correct way to proceed to enhance the image retrieval process.

            "Abstract": "Resistance switching devices are of special importance because of their application in resistive memories (RRAM) which are promising candidates for replacing current nonvolatile memories and realize storage class memories. These devices exhibit usually memristive properties with many discrete resistance levels and implement artificial synapses. The last years, researchers have demonstrated memristive chips as accelerators in computing, following new in-memory and neuromorphic computational approaches. Many different metal oxides have been used as resistance switching materials in MIM or MIS structures. Understanding of the mechanism and the dynamics of resistance switching is very critical for the modeling and use of memristors in different applications. Here, we demonstrate the bipolar resistance switching of silicon nitride thin films using heavily doped Si and Cu as bottom and top-electrodes, respectively. Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics reveal that under space-charge limited conditions and appropriate current compliance setting, multi-level resistance operation can be achieved. Furthermore, a flexible tuning protocol for multi-level resistance switching was developed applying appropriate SET/RESET pulse sequences. Retention and random telegraph noise measurements performed at different resistance levels. The present results reveal the attractive properties of the examined devices.",

            "Abstract": "The use of memristors and resistive random access memory (ReRAM) technology to perform logic computations has drawn considerable attention from researchers in recent years. However, the topological aspects of the underlying ReRAM architecture and its organization have received less attention, as the focus has mainly been on device-specific properties for functionally complete logic gates through conditional switching in ReRAM circuits. A careful investigation and optimization of the target geometry is thus highly desirable for the implementation of logic-in-memory architectures. In this paper, we propose a crossbar-based in-memory parallel processing system in which, through the heterogeneity of the resistive cross-point devices, we achieve local information processing in a state-of-the-art ReRAM crossbar architecture with vertical group-accessed transistors as cross-point selector devices. We primarily focus on the array organization, information storage, and processing flow, while proposing a novel geometry for the cross-point selection lines to mitigate current sneak-paths during an arbitrary number of possible parallel logic computations. We present an analysis of circuit resources, integration density, and logic computation parallelism and prove the proper functioning and potential capabilities of the proposed architecture through SPICE-level circuit simulations of half-adder (HA) and sum-of-products logic functions.",

Using CAs can be justified by the emergence of global behaviour from local interactions, a rule that applies also on the real slime mould.

This issue is solved in this paper by adopting a memristor crossbar architecture for adaptive synchronization. The functionality of the structure is demonstrated, with respect to different switching characteristics, via a simulation-based evaluation using a behavioral threshold-type model of voltage-controlled bipolar memristor. In addition, we show that the architecture is robust to device variability and faults: quite surprisingly, when faults are localized, the performance of the approach may also improve as adaptation \u2026",

In our algorithm, a traffic flow between any two cities is estimated using a gravity model. The flow is imitated by the model of the slime mould. The algorithm model converges to a steady state, which represents a solution of the problem. We validate our approach on examples of major transport networks in Mexico and China. By comparing networks developed in our approach with the man-made highways, networks developed by the slime mould and a cellular automata model inspired by slime mould, we demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of our approach.",

The combination of these traits allows us to model employee interactions to a satisfactory extent for a realistic model of the working environment. Secondly, we define two metrics illustrating the policies adopted by the organization either to restrain unwanted or impose desirable behavioral patterns. Finally, the corresponding Cellular Automaton (CA) model enables us to utilize the aforementioned parameters and to simulate the under study workplace.

A very powerful and promising memristor-based computing structure, which implements analog parallel computations, is the memristor network.

In this chapter we explore this computing concept via numerical and circuit simulations for the purpose of investigating the network dynamics, utilizing the well-documented physics of single devices and known network topologies. We address two of the probably most well-known inherently complex problems, in terms of computation time, i.e. the shortest path and the maze-solving problems, via computations in memristor networks.

Those limitations in the device's R MAX /R MIN  ratio suppress the wide use of memristors in memory or logic applications, thus, this work presents the enhancement of this ratio on actual memristor devices, namely Knowm memristors, due to the introduction of external noise as a beneficial disturbance, following the nonlinear system phenomenon known as Stochastic Resonance.",

The inductors and capacitors emulate the oscillation of the rocks, whereas the memristors engage the circuit's energy loss and act as the memory that the data affecting the earthquake propagation process is stored.

However, this stands in contrast to the ultimate biological example for these robots: us humans. Indeed, humans seem perfectly capable to navigate in a complex, dynamic environment using primarily vision as a sensing modality. This observation inspired us to investigate visually guided intelligent mobile robots.In order to understand and reason about its environment, an intelligent robot needs to be aware of the three-dimensional status of this environment. The problem with vision, though, is that the perceived image is a two-dimensional input. Recovering 3D-information has been in the focus of attention of the computer vision community for a few decades now, yet no all-satisfying method has been found so far. Most attention in this area has been on stereo-vision based methods, which use the displacement of objects in two (or more) images. Where stereo vision must be seen as a spatial integration of multiple viewpoints to recover depth, it is also possible to perform a temporal integration. The problem arising in this situation is known as the\" Structure from Motion\"(SfM) problem and deals with extracting 3-dimensional information about the environment from the motion of its projection onto a twodimensional surface.",

Even the most simple of living organisms, like slime mould, is typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response to ensure their evolution and safety in the best possible way. On the other hand, evacuation of a place can be easily characterized as one of the most stressful situations for the individuals taking part on it. Taking inspiration from the slime mould behaviour, we are introducing a computational bio-inspired model crowd evacuation model. Cellular Automata (CA) were selected as a fully parallel advanced computation tool able to mimic the Physarum\u2019s behaviour. In particular, the proposed CA model takes into account while mimicking the Physarum foraging process, the food diffusion, the organism\u2019s growth, the creation of tubes for each organism, the selection of optimum tube for each human in correspondence to the \u2026",

As such Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms have been introduced as a metaheuristic optimization technique arriving from the swarm intelligence methods family and applied to several computational and combinatorial optimization problems. However, long before ACO, Cellular Automata (CA) have been proposed as a powerful parallel computational tool where space and time are discrete and interactions are local. It has been proven that CA are ubiquitous: they are mathematical models of computation and computer models of natural systems and their research in interdisciplinary topics leads to new theoretical constructs, novel computational solutions and elegant powerful models. As a result, in this chapter we step forward presenting a combination of CA with ant colonies aiming at the introduction of an unconventional computational model, namely \u201cCellular Automata Ants\u201d. This rather theoretical approach is stressed in rather competitive field, namely clustering. It is well known that the spread of data for almost all areas of life has rapidly increased during the last decades. Nevertheless, the overall process of discovering true knowledge from data demands more powerful clustering techniques to ensure that some of those data are useful and some are not. In this chapter it is presented that Cellular Automata Ants can provide efficient, robust and low cost solutions to data clustering problems using quite small amount of computational resources.",

Memristor-based crossbars for integrating memory units have received considerable attention, though little work has been done concerning the implementation of logic. In this work we focus on memristor-based complex combinational circuits. Particularly, we present a design methodology for encoder and decoder circuits. Digital encoders are found in a variety of electronics multi-input combinational circuits (e.g. keyboards) nowadays, converting the logic level \u20181\u2019 data at their inputs into an equivalent binary code at the output. Their counterparts, digital decoders, constitute critical components for nanoelectronics, mainly in peripheral/interface circuitry of nanoelectronic circuits and memory structures. The proposed methodology follows a CMOS-like design scheme \u2026",

As a result, the proposed model can be used to predict the Photovoltaic Systems output of the HYRES and provide valuable feedback for PMSs of the understudy autonomous system. To do so a flexible network based design of the HYRES is used and, moreover, applied to a specific system located on Olvio, near Xanthi, Greece, as part of SYSTEMS SUNLIGHT S.A. facilities. As a result, the RNN after training with meteorological data of the aforementioned area is applied to the specific HYRES and successfully manages to enhance and optimize its PMS based on the provided solar radiation prediction.",

A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an electro-chemical reactor using the metabolism of bacteria to drive an electrical current. In a CNN model of the MFC, each node takes a vector of states which represent geometrical characteristics of the cell, like the electrodes or impermeable borders, and quantify measurable properties like bacterial population, charges produced and hydrogen ion concentrations. The model allows the study of integral reaction of the MFC, including temporal outputs, to spatial disturbances of the bacterial population and supply of nutrients. The model can also be used to evaluate inhomogeneous configurations of bacterial populations attached on the electrode biofilms.",

Earthquake activity modeling, especially in areas known to experience frequent large earthquakes, could lead to improvements in infrastructure development that will prevent possible loss of lives and property damage. An earthquake process is inherently a nonlinear complex system and lately scientists have become interested in finding possible analogues of earthquake dynamics. The majority of the models developed so far were based on a mass-spring model of either one or two dimensions. An early approach towards the reordering and the improvement of existing models presenting the capacitor-inductor (LC) analogue, where the LC circuit resembles a mass-spring system and simulates earthquake activity, was also published recently.

In this paper, this motion approach is based on the concept of virtual potential fields that are defined by the location of exits, other pedestrians or objects. Electric charges located at exit and obstacle positions generate such fields.

It is based on the capability of simpler, locally interacting units, i.e. the CAs cells, to evolve in time, giving rise to emergent computation, suitable to model physical system behavior, prediction of natural phenomena and multi-dimensional problem solutions. Moreover, at the same time CAs constitute a promising computing platform, beyond the von Neumann architecture. In this paper, a memristor device is considered to be the basic module of a CA cell circuit implementation, performing as a combined memory and processing element to implement CA-based circuits, able to model sufficiently systems and applications as mentioned above, targeting tentatively to a more energy efficient design compared to the conventional electronics.

In order to avoid such catastrophic scenarios, their prediction is of utter significance. Underground water systems are highly complex and the water flow is extremely dynamic, thus making the prediction of this phenomenon a difficult task. For this reason, a two dimensional Cellular Automaton (CA) was designed enabling both the qualitative and quantitative simulation and illustration of the saltwater intrusion into an unconfined coastal aquifer. The presented results ensure the robustness of the proposed CA model taking full advantage of its inherent parallelism and local connectivity.",

The presented method has been applied on short nucleotide sequences as well as on eleven complete genes of various origins.

More specifically, a twofold bio-inspired approach is proposed, taking into advantage the emergent computation that arrives from swarms able to find solutions to complex mathematical problems which keep computers busy for days. In the proposed approach, artificial bumblebees are used to determine the number of requested cameras needed to maximize the coverage of an available space subject under the safety specifications dictated by the crowd analysis application, while artificial spiders following the way they wave their webs indicate the exact positions of the aforementioned cameras in the under study crowd environment. Experimental results show that the algorithm is capable of producing promising results where 95% coverage of the given room is possible.",

The process is entirely automatic with the exception of some systems which take into consideration human relevance feedback to enhance the efficiency. Most up-to-date retrieval systems are based on probabilistic methods that measure certain amounts of a specific (or more) feature (s) from the image itself, thus creating descriptors that represent its content. Over the years, many conventional probabilistic methods have been proposed that attempt to solve the problem of image retrieval. This chapter presents a variety of these methods to pave the path that will eventually lead to an answer of whether or not artificial intelligence (AI) methods are the correct way to proceed to enhance the image retrieval (IR) process. Furthermore, since a multitude of swarm intelligence techniques have been used to find a solution for many nondeterministic polynomial time-complete problems, a discussion is held concerning the possibility of successfully applying these methods to CBIR. In this chapter, an attempt is made to answer these questions by presenting part of the evolution in IR methods. Section 1 provides references of straightforward conventional methods and goes on to determine how AI techniques, such as fuzzy logic and artificial ant colonies, can be used to construct an intelligent IR system that may be optimized by using relevance feedback in Section 2.

Inspired by the cellular ants algorithm of Vande Moere and Clayden which has designed for clustering purposes, a corresponding cellular ants model was developed in order to overcome some of the previous model limitations and to provide new insights in cellular ants based clustering.

Therefore energy efficient processors are required that can process the cloud applications efficiently without consuming excessive power. This paper presents a performance evaluation of the processors that are mainly used in high performance embedded systems in the domain of cloud computing. Several representative applications based on the widely used MapReduce framework are mapped in the embedded processor and are evaluated in terms of performance and energy efficiency. The results shows that high performance embedded processors can achieve up to 7.8x better energy efficiency than the current general purpose processors in typical MapReduce applications.",

Tuning their state accurately, repeatedly and in a wide range, makes memristors well-suited for multi-level (ML) resistive memory cells and analog computing applications. In this brief, the tuning approach based on a memristor-resistor voltage divider (VD) is validated here experimentally using commercial memristors from Knowm Inc. and a custom circuit. Rapid and controllable multi-state SET tuning is shown with an appreciable range of different resistance values obtained as a function of the amplitude of the applied voltage pulse. The efficiency of the VD is finally compared against an adaptive pulse-based tuning protocol, in terms of circuit overhead, tuning precision, tuning time, and energy consumption, qualifying as a simple hardware solution for fast, reliable, and energy-efficient ML resistance tuning.",

Quantum simulators are quantum systems that can perform specific quantum computations, or software packages that can reproduce most of the aspects of a general universal quantum computer on a general purpose classical computer. Development of quantum simulators using digital circuits, such as FPGAs is very difficult, mainly because the unit of quantum information, the qubit, has an infinite number of states, whereas the classical bit has only two. On the other hand, analog circuits comprising R, L and C elements have no internal state variables that can be used to reproduce and store qubit states.

            "Abstract": "Oil spills in sea waters are considered as a major threat for ecosystems with numerous accidents recorded each year. Consequently, models for oil slick behavior are important in environmental engineering, and Cellular Automata (CA) have been successfully used in modeling physical systems and processes in the past. Models based on CA can be implemented in hardware (HW) in a straightforward manner, and also lead to fast execution of algorithms especially when implemented on FPGA platforms. In this paper, we demonstrate the dedicated FPGA implementation of a CA-based algorithm for the prediction of oil slick movement and spreading. The presented dedicated processor is able to process various scenarios of weather conditions, and it provides the possible form and location of the oil slick front in future times. Combined with the necessary electronic communication equipment, it could efficiently support a real-time decision support system to facilitate appropriate response in case of oil slick environmental emergency.",

Much research has been conducted on such devices with one rectangular top gate and one back gate with very encouraging results. Recently, graphene p\u2013n junctions with two rectangular top gates have been proposed and their study revealed a rich behaviour that allows their use in both analogue and digital nanoelectronic circuits. Here we study graphene p\u2013n junctions with two trapezoid top gates and a common back gate with special focus to the effect of the angle and the distance between the two top gates. Furthermore, trapezoid top gates with angles of 45\u00b0 make use of the Veselago lens effect, allowing an effective control by tuning density of states and carrier density. We simulated these devises using the non-equilibrium Green\u2019s \u2026",

The model combines electrostatic-induced potential fields to incorporate flexibility in the movement of pedestrians.

In particular, the photo-responsive paint would sense the buildings internal and external environment while the nano-material-concrete composite material would be capable of sensing the building environment and implement massive-parallel information processing resulting in distributed decision making.

            "Abstract": "Continued dimensional and functional scaling of Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology is driving information processing into a broadening spectrum of new applications. Many of these applications are enabled by performance gains and/or increased complexity realized by scaling. The performance of the components and the final application can be measured in many different ways; higher speed, higher density, lower power, more functionality, etc. Traditionally, though, dimensional scaling had been adequate to bring about these performance merits but it is no longer so. Since dimensional scaling of CMOS will eventually approach fundamental limits, several new alternative information processing devices and architectures for existing or new functions are being explored to sustain the historical integrated circuit scaling cadence and the reduction of cost/function in the next decades [1 \u2026",

The adoption of Manhattan distance as the reference metric provides calculation simplicity, computational speed and improves significantly computational performance. Moreover, the model applies an efficient method to overcome obstacles. The latter is based on the generation of a virtual field along obstacles. A pedestrian moves along the axis of the obstacle towards the direction that the field increases its values, leading her/him to avoid the obstacle effectively.

Stereo correspondence by calculating the distance of various points in a scene relative to the position of a camera allows the performance of complex tasks, such as depth measurements and environment reconstruction (Jain et al., 1995). The most common approach for extracting depth information from intensity images is by means of a stereo camera setup. The point-by-point matching between the two images from the stereo setup derives the depth images, or the so called disparity maps,(Faugeras, 1993). The computational demanding task of matching can be reduced to a one dimensional search, only by accurately rectified stereo pairs in which horizontal scan lines reside on the same epipolar plane, as shown in Figure 1. By definition, the epipolar plane is defined by the point P and the two camera optical centers OL and OR. This plane POLOR intersects the two image planes at lines EP1 and EP2, which are called epipolar lines. Line EP 1 is passing through two points: EL and PL, and line EP2 is passing through ER and PR respectively. EL and ER are called epipolar points and are the intersection points of the baseline OLOR with each of the image planes. The computational significance for matching different views is that for a point in the first image, its corresponding point in the second image must lie on the epipolar line, and thus the search space for a correspondence is reduced from 2 dimensions to 1 dimension. This is called the epipolar constraint. The difference on the horizontal coordinates of points PL and PR is the disparity. The disparity map consists of all \u2026",

An enhanced vector-specific incarnation of register renaming is proposed to facilitate dynamic hardware loop unrolling and alleviate instruction dependencies. Moreover, a cost-efficient decoupled execution scheme splits instructions into execution and memory-access streams, while hardware support for reductions accelerates the execution of key instructions \u2026",

            "Abstract": "For the first time, the model of a physical nano-scale memristor is integrated analytically. A closed-form expression for the time evolution of the device memristance during the turn-on process is mathematically derived. The complexity of the inverse imaginary error function-based analytical formula clearly reflects the high degree of nonlinearity in the nano-device switching kinetics, which may typically span several orders of magnitude and is critically dependent on input and initial condition. The excellent agreement between the analytical solution and numerical simulation results clearly demonstrates the correctness of the theoretical derivation. The introduction of this formula represents the first step towards a systematic approach to circuit design with memristors.",

In the case of Belousov & ndash;Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, this was achieved by using collision-based techniques and by exploiting the light sensitivity of BZ. In order to unveil the computational capacity of the light sensitive BZ medium and the possibility to implement re-configurable logic, the design of multiple logic gates in a fixed BZ reservoir was investigated. The three basic logic gates (namely NOT, OR and AND) were studied to prove the Turing completeness of the architecture. Namely, all possible Boolean functions can be implemented as a combination of these logic gates. Nonetheless, a more complicated logic function was investigated, aiming to illustrate further capabilities of a fixed size BZ reservoir. The experiments executed within this study were implemented with a Cellular Automata (CA)-based \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Memristors as emergent nano-electronic devices have been successfully fabricated and used in non-conventional and neuromorphic computing systems in the last years. Several behavioral or physical based models have been developed to explain their operation and to optimize their fabrication parameters. All existing memristor models are trade-offs between accuracy, universality and realism, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is purely characterized as quantum mechanical, despite the fact that quantum mechanical processes are a major part of the memristor operation. In this paper, we employ quantum mechanical methods to develop a complete and accurate filamentary model for the resistance variation during memristor's operating cycle. More specifically, we apply quantum walks to model and compute the motion of atoms forming the filament, tight-binding Hamiltonians to capture the filament structure and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method to compute the conductance of the device. Furthermore, we proceeded with the parallelization of the overall model through Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate our computations and enhance the model's performance adequately. Our simulation results successfully reproduce the resistive switching characteristics of memristors devices, match with existing fabricated devices experimental data, prove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed model in terms of multi-parameterization, and provide a new and useful insight into its operation.",

            "Abstract": "Stereo vision, resulting in the knowledge of deep information in a scene, is of great importance in the field of machine vision, robotics and image analysis. As a result, in order to address the problem of matching points between two images of a stereo pair several algorithms have been proposed so far. In this paper, an explicit analysis of the existing stereo matching methods, up to date, is presented in full detail. The algorithms found in literature can be grouped into those producing sparse output and those giving a dense result, while the later can be classified as local (area-based) and global (energy-based). The presented algorithms are discussed in terms of speed, accuracy, coverage, time consumption and disparity range. Comparative test results concerning different image sizes as well as different stereo data sets are presented. Furthermore, the usage of advanced computational intelligence techniques such as neural networks and cellular automata in the development and application of such algorithms is also considered. However, due to the fact that the resulting depth calculation is a computationally demanding procedure, most of the presented algorithms perform poorly in real-time applications. Towards this direction, the development of real-time stereo matching algorithms, able to be efficiently implemented in dedicated hardware is of great interest in the contexts of 3D reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), virtual reality, robot navigation and control. Some possible implementations of stereo-matching algorithms in hardware for real-time applications are also discussed in details.",

The sparse nature of such network-based computations, though, resembles certain operational features and computing capabilities of Cellular Automata (CA), a powerful parallel computational model which leads to scalable hardware (HW) architectures with very high device densities. When CA-based models are implemented in HW, the circuit design reduces to the design of a single cell and the overall layout results regular with exclusively local inter-connections. Moreover, the models are executed fast by exploiting the parallelism of the CA structure. This chapter focuses on a circuit-level CA-inspired approach for in-memory computing schemes using memristors \u2026",

The generalization abilities of neural networks and their close proximity to eye and sensory processing units in human brain lays foundations for building neural vision chips capable of performing object detection, classification, and predictions. In real-time settings, often the information visible to a camera does not meaningfully capture all the relevant context, object dynamics, and behaviors, making smart camera solutions complex and energy hungry. Learning from images is a continuous process in the human brain while consuming extremely low energy, and these properties have proven to be the benchmarks of the ideal neural vision chips. Offloading the intelligent data processing and image processing to edge devices using neural vision chips offers several advantages of speed, lower \u2026",
