            "Abstract": "Morphological transformations are commonly used to perform a variety of image processing tasks. However, morphological operations are time-consuming procedures since they involve ordering and min/max computation of numbers resulting from image interaction with structuring elements. This paper presents a new method that can be used to speed up basic morphological operations for binary images. To achieve this, the binary images are first decomposed in a set of non-overlapping rectangular blocks of foreground pixels that have predefined maximum dimensions. Then off-line dilation and erosion of all rectangular blocks are arbitrary obtained and stored into suitable look-up array tables. By using the look up tables, the results of the morphological operations to the rectangular blocks are directly obtained. Thus, first all image blocks are replaced by their look-up array tables. Then the morphological \u2026",

Reducing the risk of a ship accident is therefore vital to all socio-economic and environmental sectors. This paper presents a maritime data analytics platform for policy recommendation. The online tool focuses on extracting aggregated vessel risks using spatiotemporal analysis of multilayer information: vessel trajectories, vessel data, meteorological data, bathymetric/ hydrographic data as well as information regarding environmentally important areas (e.g. protected high-risk areas, etc.).

In this paper, we present a goal-oriented rectification methodology to compensate for undesirable document image distortions aiming to improve the OCR result. Our approach relies upon a coarse-to-fine strategy. First, a coarse rectification is accomplished with the aid of a computationally low cost transformation which addresses the projection of a curved surface to a 2-D rectangular area. The projection of the curved surface on the plane is guided only by the textual content's appearance in the document image while incorporating a transformation which does not depend on specific model primitives or camera setup parameters. Second, pose normalization is applied on the word level aiming \u2026",

However, in order to become practical in daily life, sentiment recognition techniques should analyze data collected in an unobtrusive way. For this reason, analyzing audio signals of human speech (as opposed to say biometrics) is considered key to potential emotion recognition systems. In this work, we expand upon previous efforts to analyze speech signals using computer vision techniques on their spectrograms. In particular, we utilize ORB descriptors on keypoints distributed on a regular grid over the spectrogram to obtain an intermediate representation. Firstly, a technique similar to Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) is used, where a visual vocabulary is created by clustering keypoint descriptors, but instead a soft candidacy score is used to construct the histogram descriptors of the signal. Furthermore, a technique which takes into account the temporal structure of the spectrograms is examined, allowing for effective model regularization. Both of these techniques are evaluated in several popular emotion recognition datasets, with results indicating an improvement over the simple BoVW method.",

A great advantage of the SOM method is that document collections can be ordered in such a way so that documents with similar content are positioned at nearby locations of the 2-dimensional SOM lattice. The resulting ordered map thus presents a general view of the document collection which helps the exploration of information contained in the whole document space. The most notable example of such an application is the WEBSOM method where the document collection is ordered onto a map by utilizing word category histograms for representing the documents data vectors. In this paper, we introduce the LSISOM method which resembles WEBSOM in the sense that the document maps are generated from word category histograms \u2026",

Statistics show that a significant part of Web text information is encoded in Web images. Since Web images have special characteristics that sometimes distinguish them from other types of images, commercial OCR products often fail to recognize Web images due to their special key characteristics. This paper proposes a novel Web image processing algorithm that aims to locate text areas and prepare them for OCR procedure with best results. According to this algorithm, first the Web color image is converted to gray scale in order to record the transitions of brightness that are perceived by the human eye. Then, an edge extraction technique facilitates the extraction of all objects as well as of all inverted objects. A conditional dilation technique applied with several iterations helps to choose text and inverted text objects among all objects. Experimental results, obtained from a large corpus of Web images, demonstrate the improvement in recognition accuracy after applying the proposed text area identification algorithm.",

The derivation is carried out for networks with an arbitrary number of hidden and output nodes and is, therefore, a generalization of previous work valid for networks with only two hidden nodes and one output node. The Jacobian matrix of the system is obtained, whose eigenvalues characterize the evolution of learning. Flat minima correspond to critical points of the phase plane trajectories and the bifurcation of the eigenvalues signifies their abandonment. Following the derivation of the dynamical model, we show that identification of the hidden nodes clusters using unsupervised learning techniques enables the application of a constrained application \u2026",

The segmentation procedure is based on a hierarchical watershed-driven algorithm that extracts meaningful regions automatically. In this framework, the proposed robust feature extraction and the many-to-many region matching along with the novel region weighting for enhancing feature discrimination play a major role.

The hybrid nature of the method is two-fold. First, a combination of 2D and 3D features is used as the shape descriptor of a 3D model and second, two alternative alignment techniques, CPCA and NPCA, are employed for rotation normalization. The 2D features are Fourier coefficients extracted from three pairs of depth buffers which are computed for each Cartesian plane capturing the model's thickness along each axis. The 3D features are spherical harmonic coefficients extracted from a spherical function based representation that captures the model's surface as well as volume information.",

The latter may as well include a broad spectrum of modalities which are strongly associated with consciously or subconsciously communicating human emotional state such as visual cues, gestures, body postures, gait, or facial expressions. Typically, emotion discovery from speech signals not only requires considerably less computational complexity than other modalities, but also at the same time in the overwhelming majority of studies the inclusion of speech modality increases the accuracy of the overall emotion estimation process. The principal algorithmic cornerstones of emotion estimation from speech signals are Hidden Markov Models, time series modeling, cepstrum processing, and deep learning methodologies, the latter two being prime examples of higher order data processing. Additionally, the most known datasets which serve as emotion recognition benchmarks are described.",

For the purposes of our study, an ASTER satellite image was used, acquired on 5 October, 2001, with 14 spectral bands resampled at the spatial resolution of 15 m. The study area concerns the geographic area of the water basin of Lake Vegoritis, that is located in the northern part of Greece. A variety of industrial and agricultural activities take place in the Vegoritis lake basin, which result to constant lowering of the lake water table and the change of land use, and subsequently, lead to degrading of the lake environment.Besides the intensity level of the original bands, several features were created including spectral indices (eg NDVI), band ratios and products among selected bands, and Haralick texture features together with their second order combinations. The total of the features was used as input to a novel feature selection process, the Greedy Non-Redundant (GreeNRed) feature selection algorithm. This algorithm is based on information theory, and greedily selects features with no redundant information. The algorithm succeeded in keeping the complexity at low levels by restraining evaluations in one-dimensional feature spaces, whereas non-redundancy is achieved by a boosting-like sample weighting.",

In this paper, a two-step approach for efficient dewarping of camera document images is presented. At a first step, a coarse dewarping is accomplished with the help of a transformation model which maps the projection of a curved surface to a 2D rectangular area. The projection of the curved surface is delimited by the two curved lines which fit the top and bottom text lines along with the two straight lines which fit to the left and right text boundaries. At a second step, fine dewarping is achieved based on words detection. All words are pose normalized guided by the lower and upper word baselines.

This chapter presents a machine learning method for extracting complex semantics stemming from multimedia sources. The method is based on transforming the inference problem into a graph expansion problem, expressing graph expansion operators as a combination of elementary ones and optimally seeking elementary graph operators. The latter issue is then reduced to learn a set of soft classifiers, based on features each one corresponding to a unique graph path. The advantages of the method are \u2026",

In this paper we propose a methodology for the detection of when a human has changed clothes. Our non-contact unobtrusive monitoring system is built upon the Microsoft Kinect depth camera. It uses the OpenNI SDK to detect a human skeleton and extract the upper and lower clothes\u2019 visual features. Color, texture and edge descriptors are then extracted and fused. We evaluate our system on a publicly available set of real recordings for several users and under various illumination conditions. Our results show that our system is able to successfully detect when a user changes clothes, thus to assess the quality of the corresponding ADL.",

Using properties of spherical harmonics, scaling and axial flipping invariance is achieved. Rotation normalization is performed by employing the continuous principal component analysis along with a novel approach which applies PCA on the face normals of the model. The 3D model is decomposed into a set of spherical functions which represents not only the intersections of the corresponding surface with rays emanating from the origin but also points in the direction of each ray which are closer to the origin than the furthest intersection point. The superior performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a comparison against state-of-the-art approaches on standard databases.",

To complete this task, a number of steps have to be followed, from segmentation of the newspaper image to optical character recognition and linking of different items belonging to the same article. In this paper, an evaluation of different information retrieval techniques is presented that aim at linking textual parts of an article that can be found on different pages of a newspaper issue. Three document matching techniques are evaluated, namely title-to-title, title-to-text and text-to-text matching. In addition, the effect on the matching accuracy of using a stemmer and of employing appropriate conflict resolution techniques is studied for each of the above approaches. Experimental results involving a number of issues of a Greek newspaper show that the best technique, namely text-to-text matching augmented with a stemmer and conflict resolution, can reach a high linking accuracy rate of 96%.",

This method exploits the benefits of particle filters to tackle the multimodal distributions emerging from cluttered scenes. The tracked object is described by several models of different complexity, which are probabilistically linked together. The parameter update for each model takes place hierarchically so that the simpler models, which are updated first, can guide the search in the parameter space of the more complex models to relevant regions. This strategy improves the target representation because of the multiple models and reduces the overall complexity. The likelihood for each object model is calculated using one or more visual cues thus increasing the robustness of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we use the technique of minimum bounding box area in order to combine a horizontal with a new reinforced vertical projection profile method. We are motivated by the fact that the horizontal and the novel vertical projection profiles are found to be complementary to each other. We claim that the proposed approach has more accurate performance compared with other state-of-the-art skew detection algorithms; it deals with all the drawbacks of the projection profile methods; it is more noise and warp resistant and gives accurate \u2026",

There are certain application requirements and available datasets to which any research effort has to be adapted. Our dataset includes aerial orthophotos, with a spatial resolution 20 cm, and a digital surface model generated from LiDAR, with a spatial resolution 1 m and an elevation resolution 20 cm, from an area of Athens, Greece. The aerial images are fused with LiDAR, and we classify these data with a multilayer feedforward neural network for building block extraction. The innovation of our approach lies in the preprocessing step in which the original LiDAR data are super-resolution (SR) reconstructed by means of a stochastic regularized technique before their fusion with the aerial images takes place.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of recognizing early Christian Greek manuscripts written in lower case letters. Based on the existence of closed cavity regions in the majority of characters and character ligatures in these scripts, we propose a novel, segmentation-free, fast and efficient technique that assists the recognition procedure by tracing and recognizing the most frequently appearing characters or character ligatures. First, we detect closed cavities that exist in the character body. Then, the protrusions in the outer contour outline of the connected components that contain the character closed cavities are used for the classification of the area around closed cavities to a specific character or a character ligature. The proposed method gives highly accurate results \u2026",

The aim of this work is to leverage state-of-the-art techniques in digital image binarization and text identification for digitized documents allowing further content exploitation in an efficient way.

The method has been developed in the framework of the Hellenic GSRT- funded R&D project, D-SCRIBE, which aims at developing an integrated system for digitization and processing of old Hellenic manuscripts. After testing of the proposed method on numerous low quality historical manuscripts, it has turned out that our methodology performs better compared to current state-of- the-art adaptive thresholding techniques.",

When considering the implementation of ER capable systems, if they are to be widely adopted in daily life, one must take into account that methods for emotion recognition should work on data collected in an unobtrusive way. Out of the possible data modalities for affective state analysis, which include video and biometrics, speech is considered the least intrusive and for this reason has drawn the focus of many research efforts. In this chapter, we discuss methods for analyzing the non-linguistic component of vocalized speech for the purposes of ER. In particular, we propose a method for producing lower dimensional representations of sound spectrograms which respect their temporal structure. Moreover \u2026",

Reducing the risk of a ship accident is therefore vital to all socio-economic and environmental sectors. This paper presents an online long-term marine traffic monitoring work-flow that focuses on extracting aggregated vessel risks using spatiotemporal analysis of multilayer information: vessel trajectories, vessel data, meteorological data, bathymetric/hydrographic data as well as information regarding environmentally important areas (eg protected high-risk areas, etc.). A web interface that enables user-friendly spatiotemporal queries is implemented at the frontend, while a series of data mining functionalities extracts aggregated statistics regarding:(a) marine risks and accident probabilities for particular areas (b) trajectories clustering information (c) general marine statistics (cargo types, etc.) and (d) correlation between spatial environmental importance and marine traffic risk. Towards this end, a set of data clustering and probabilistic graphical modelling techniques has been adopted.",

Then, morphological filtering is used, based on geometrical constraints, in order to connect the vertical edges and discard false alarms. A connected component analysis is performed to the filtered edge map in order to determine a bounding box for every candidate text area. Finally, horizontal and vertical projections are calculated on the edge map of every box and a threshold is applied, refining the result and splitting text areas in text lines. The whole algorithm is applied in multiresolution fashion to ensure text detection with size variability. Experimental results prove that the method is highly effective and efficient for artificial text detection.",

This paper presents a method for automatic recognition of the soundscape quality of urban recordings. Towards this end, the ATHens Urban Soundscape has been used, which is a dataset of audio recordings of ambient urban sounds, annotated in terms of the corresponding perceived soundscape quality. In order to automatically recognize the soundscape quality, both hand-crafted and deep features have been adopted. Experimental results have demonstrated that the performance of the final classifier that combines hand-crafted and deep context-aware audio features is boosted by almost 2%.",

            "Abstract": "The K-NN classifier is one of the earliest classifiers used for pattern recognition tasks. Its popularity stems from its conceptual simplicity and from the fact that it does not require elaborate training, since it stores training instances and performs evaluations only on queries (lazy learning). However, its performance and efficiency depend highly on the feature input space and on the number of training instances. A large number of variations of K-NN have been proposed to solve these problems. In this paper, we focus on the feature input space representation and propose an algorithm that aims at suitably transforming input features to improve classification performance. The algorithm is novel in that it integrates local relevance information on the features, by means of a deforming transform. The algorithm is thus decoupled from K-NN and can be viewed as au seful preprocesing of features and used with other classifiers as well.",

The paper introduces a two-dimensional mapping of Allen's relations, based on orthogonal characteristics of interval relations, namely relative position and relative size. The hourglass-shaped mapping also represents limit cases that correspond to durationless intervals. Based on this mapping, we define two sets of primitive interval relations in terms of the relative positioning and relative size of intervals. These primitives are then used to derive a probabilistic set of Allen's relations. A number of example cases are presented to illustrate how the proposed approach can improve the robustness of interval relations.",

            "Abstract": "Air quality has become a major issue during the last decades for a great number of cities and a matter of concern for both citizens and scientists. The quality of life has deteriorated in urban regions due to high pollution levels and a large number of people suffer from pollution effects on health. The prediction of air pollution episodes is very useful in that it enables the local authorities to give a warning against high pollutant concentrations or to take limitation measures on the emission sources. In the past, efforts for pollution level forecasting have been reported using mathematical models (simulating the physical process) or statistical methods (Zannetti, 1990). The mathematical model operation requires high computational capacity, meteorological data and emission inventory. The required meteorological data are very difficult to collect and process, while the creation of an emission inventory is not an easy task. A statistical approach has the advantage that no knowledge of the mechanism of pollution dispersion is needed. Most statistical forecasting work dealing with urban airpollution utilizes traditional well known techniques such as linear regression models, time-series analysis etc.(Zannetti, 1990; Finzi and Tebaldi, 1982; Inoue et al., 1986). However, conventional statistical techniques suffer from several drawbacks. The statistical distribution of the pollution data is not a priori known and therefore parametric regression techniques that assume a given distribution, such as multivariate Gaussian, may not work optimally. Linear regression techniques in general are not capable of capturing the inherently non-linear nature of the problem, while non \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a grid structure used as a base layer for a multi-objective algorithm used to solve the bi-criteria time constrained shortest path problem in ship routing. We also accelerate this algorithm by following two completely different approaches. First, we split the initial grid structure into multiple partitions with uniform weather conditions, in order to reduce the complexity of routing through them. Second, we transform the initially used label setting multi-objective algorithm into a multi-objective A* algorithm and give an efficient heuristic function for doing so. Our experiments show that there is a significant speedup of the algorithm, especially in the second case, where the run time is reduced substantially.",

The method uses word portions located at the beginning and end of each segmented word of the processed documents and try to estimate the position of the first and last characters in order to reduce the list of candidate words. Since DTW can become computational intensive in large datasets the proposed method manages to significantly prune the list of candidate words thus, speeding up the entire process. Word length is also used as a means of further reducing the data to be processed. Results are improved in terms of time and efficiency compared to those produced if no pruning is done to the list of candidate words.",

Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals, tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents.",

The algorithm follows successive steepest descent directions with respect to the perceptron cost function, taking care not to increase the number of misclassified patterns. The problem of finding these directions is stated as a quadratic programming task, to which a fast and effective solution is proposed. The resulting algorithm has no free parameters and therefore no heuristics are involved in its application. It is proved that the algorithm always converges in a finite number of steps. For linearly separable problems, it always finds a hyperplane that completely separates patterns belonging to different categories. Termination of the algorithm without separating all given patterns means that the presented set of patterns is indeed linearly inseparable. Thus the algorithm provides a natural criterion for linear separability. Compared to other state of the art \u2026",

Within this system an one-class support vector machine decides short-term behaviour abnormality, while we propose a methodology that lets a continuous Hidden Markov Model function as an one-class classifier for trajectories. Furthermore, an approximation algorithm, referring to the Forward Backward procedure of the continuous Hidden Markov Model, is proposed to overcome numerical stability problems in the calculation of probability of emission for very long observations.

The update of each object model takes place hierarchically so that the lower dimensional object models, which are updated first, guide the search in the parameter space of the subsequent object models to relevant regions thus reducing the computational complexity. A method for object model adaptation is also developed.

Word image normalization is performed by using as a reference point the geometric center of the word image as well as by placing the baseline of the word in the center of a rectangular box. Additionally, image pre-processing is performed in order to correct word skew, word slant as well as to normalize the stroke thickness. At a next step, two types of features are combined in a hybrid fashion. The first one, divides the word image into a set of zones and calculates the density of the character pixels in each zone. In the second type of features, we calculate the area that is formed from the projections of the upper and lower profile of the word. The performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated after testing with the reference IAM cursive handwriting database.",

Based on assumptions for the probability distribution of the classification data, we obtain sufficient conditions under which two or more of the above criteria coincide. It is shown that these conditions also suffice for Bayes optimality of the criteria. Our approach results in an information-theoretic derivation of linear discriminant analysis and heteroscedastic discriminant analysis. Finally, regarding linear discriminant analysis, we discuss its relation to multidimensional independent component analysis and derive suboptimality bounds based on information theory.",

A constrained optimization framework is introduced for incorporating these types of knowledge into the learning formalism. We present three examples of improvement in the learning behaviour of neural networks using additional knowledge in the context of our constrained optimization framework. The two network specific examples are designed to improve convergence and learning speed in the broad class of feedforward networks, while the third problem specific example is related to the efficient factorization of 2-D polynomials using suitably constructed sigma-pi networks.",

            "Abstract": "Most of the approaches which address the problem of 3D object retrieval, use global descriptors of the objects which fail to consistently compensate for the intra-class variability of articulated objects. In this paper, a retrieval methodology is presented which is based upon a graph-based object representation. This is composed of a meaningful new mesh segmentation along with a graph matching between the graph of the query object and each of the graphs that correspond to the objects of the 3D object database. The graph matching algorithm is based on the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) similarity measure which is calculated using a new ground distance assignment. The superior performance of the proposed methodology is shown after an extensive experimentation comprising alternative descriptors for the constituent components of the 3D object as well as comparison with state of the art retrieval algorithms.",
