            "Abstract": "In recent years smart cards have become one of the most common secure computing devices. Their uses include such diverse applications such as: providing secure wireless communication framework, banking and identification. Direct threats to smart card security can be invasive (attacks that alter the chip inside the card), analysis of a side channel, induced faults, as well as more traditional forms of attack. This chapter will describe the various attacks that can be applied to smart cards, and the subsequent countermeasures required in software to achieve a secure solution. Invasive attacks are considered beyond the scope of this chapter and can be mitigated with software countermeasures. A case study on the various generations of the European mobile telephone networks is given as an example of how the deployment of countermeasures has changed due to the various attacks described in this chapter.",

After examining the existing ldquoYoking Proofrdquo protocols of RFID, this paper proposes a protocol called ldquoSelect-Responserdquo Grouping Proof. Instead of waiting the computation result from the tags as previous protocols, the new protocol uses a new mechanism that the reader actively selects the demanded tags to fulfill the verification. With this fundamental change, our protocol neutralizes the threats of denial of service attack, which is suffered by the ldquoYoking Proofrdquo protocols, and provide collision-free and missing tag identification properties, which would offer great help in the practical applications.",

With ever growing use of computing platforms (i.e. mobile phones, tablets and embedded devices, etc.) the potential for compromising the security and privacy of an individual is increased. The Trusted Platform Module is restricted to integrity measurement and cryptographic operations, which is crucial in its own right. On the contrary, smart cards provide a general-purpose execution environment, but traditionally they are under a centralised control, which if extended to the other computing platforms may not be appropriate. Therefore, in this paper we analyse the rationale for a general-purpose cross-platform user centric tamper-resistant device based on the smart card architecture, its applications in different computing environments, along with the ownership management framework.",

Remote e-voting via the Internet provides the convenience of voting on the voter's own computer or mobile device, but Internet voting systems are vulnerable to many common attacks, affecting the integrity of an election. Distributing the processing of votes over many web servers installed in tamper-resistant, secure environments can improve security: this is possible by using the Smart Card Web Server (SCWS) on a mobile phone Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). This paper proposes a generic model for a voting application installed in the SIM/SCWS, which uses standardised Mobile Network Operator (MNO) management procedures to communicate (via HTTPs) with a voting authority to vote.

Our protocol, PMM, utilizes a hash function and a pseudorandom number generator that can be hardware implemented in a low-cost RFID tag.

Some of these applications allow access to services including healthcare, financial, online social networks and are becoming common in the smart phone environment. From a security and privacy point of view, this seismic shift is creating new challenges, as the smart phone environment is becoming a suitable platform for security-and privacy-sensitive applications. The need for a strong security architecture for this environment is becoming paramount, especially from the point of view of Secure Application Execution (SAE). In this chapter, we explore SAE for applications on smart phone platforms, to ensure application execution is as expected by the application provider. Most of the proposed SAE proposals are based on having a secure and trusted embedded chip on the smart phone. Examples include the \u2026",

However security of these systems still remains unsatisfactory if a strong adversary model with a high attack potential (i.e. the adversary has capabilities and knowledge to capture a UAV, to perform side-channel or fault injection or other physical, software or combined attacks in order to gain access to some secret data like cryptographic keys, mission plan, etc.) is considered. The aim of this position paper is to draw security requirements for this kind of adversaries and to propose theoretical solutions based on an embedded Secure Element (SE) that could help to accommodate these requirements. Finally, our proposal on how to use these SEs to secure Autonomous UAVs fleets is presented.",

Using a mobile device as a tool can offer added security features as well as giving flexibility to the process. Automotive security is of high importance as it is critically related to the safety and reliability of the vehicle. We propose a secure OTA firmware update (FOTA) protocol to offer flexibility to the firmware update process, while meeting the required security requirements.

However, sequentially authenticating individual tags one by one might not be desirable, especially when considering that a reader often has to deal with multiple tags within a limited period, since it will incur long scanning time and heavy communication costs. To address these problems, we put forward a novel efficient group authentication protocol where a group of tags can be authenticated simultaneously with only one challenge and one response. The protocol is built on a new designed symmetric key based algorithm and the bit-collision pattern technique, so that authentication responses transmitted by multiple tags in a group at the same time will result in a verifiable bit-collision pattern that represents the authentication response for the entire group.

To satisfy the stringent level of criticality, each UAV in the fleet must trust the other UAVs with which it communicates to get assurance of the trustworthiness in information received and to be sure not to disclose information to an unauthorized party. In addition, to be protected against an attacker willing to eavesdrop and/or modify the exchanged data, the communication channel needs to be secured, i.e. it has to provide confidentiality and integrity of exchanges. The work presented here is based on our previous research which concluded that it is required that each UAV includes a Secure Element (which we called ARFSSD standing for Active Radio Frequency Smart Secure Device) to withstand an adversary with a high attack potential.

During this process, the respective card issuer reveals the identity of the smart card user to the individual application providers.

However, with introduction of the Trusted Service Manager (TSM) architecture there might be valid cases where revealing the card user's identity is not necessary. At the moment, the secure channel protocols for traditional smart card architecture including the TSM does not preserve the privacy of the card users.

To counter these, a number of methods have been proposed that rely primarily on ambient sensors as a proximity detection mechanism (also known as an anti-relay mechanism). In this paper, we, for the first time in academic literature, empirically evaluate a comprehensive set of ambient sensors for their effectiveness as a proximity detection mechanism. We selected 15 out of a total of 17 sensors available via the Google Android platform for evaluation, with the other two sensors unavailable on widely-used handsets. In existing academic literature, only 5 sensors have been proposed with positive results as a potential proximity detection mechanism. Each sensor, where feasible, was used to record the measurements of 1000 contactless transactions at four different physical locations. A total of 252 random users, random sample of the university student population, were involved during the field trails. The analysis of these transactions provides an empirical foundation to categorically answer whether ambient sensors provide a strong proximity detection mechanism for security sensitive applications like banking, transport and high-security access control. After careful analysis, we conclude that no single evaluated mobile ambient sensor is suitable for such critical applications in realistic deployment scenarios. Lastly, we identify a number of potential avenues that may improve their effectiveness.",

It is much more difficult to expect fair- ness in e-commerce transactions using Bitcoin due to anonymity and transaction irreversibility.

The proposed proto- col guarantees strong-fairness while preserving anonymity of the consumer and the merchant, using Bitcoin as a payment method which addresses the aforementioned concern. The involvement of the trusted third party (T T P ) is kept to a minimum, which makes the protocol optimistic and the exchanged product is not revealed to T T P . It achieves dispute resolution within the protocol run without any intervention of an external judge.

We introduce a new cube algorithm based on the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure.

The firewall mechanism is well defined and studied in the Issuer Centric Smart Card Ownership Model (ICOM), in which a smart card is under total control of its issuer. However, it is not analysed in the User Centric Smart Card Ownership Model (UCOM) that delegates the smart card control to their users. In this paper, we present UCOM\u2019s security requirements for the firewall mechanism and propose a generic framework that satisfies them.",

If the inter-connecting wires are physically secured so that a malicious user cannot access them directly, then this enforces (at least partially) the security of the network. However, substituting the wired network with a wireless network - which in this context is referred to as an Avionics Wireless Network (AWN) - brings a number of new challenges related to assurance, reliability, and security. The AWN thus has to ensure that it provides at least the required security and safety levels offered by the equivalent wired network. Providing a wired-equivalent security for a communication channel requires the setting up of a strong, secure (encrypted) channel between the entities that are connected to the AWN.

Because tags cannot support strong cryptography, security must rely on low-computational solutions. Privacy protection is often an additional requirement for acceptance of the technology by end-users. Thus, dedicated lightweight algorithms and protocols need to be designed. In this paper, we propose a set of extremely lightweight (optionally mutual) authentication protocols between a tag and a database (sharing a secret value) which protect the identity of the tag. However, if, for some practical reasons, the identity of the tag needs to be revealed to the reader, an additional optional last step can be added at the end of our protocols to satisfy this requirement. Our proposals are inspired by a protocol of Chien et al. but they are more efficient, since they operate in O(1 \u2026",

It has been claimed that the Song protocol is able to resist weak attacks, such as denial of service (DoS) attack; however, we found that a weak attacker is able to desynchronise a tag, which is one kind of DoS attack. Moreover, the database in the Song protocol must use a brute force search to retrieve the tag\u2019s records affecting the operational performance of the server.

While Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) systems (eg, blockchain) have been proposed to enhance security, an attacker could damage other parts of the model, such as its infrastructure: an adversarial attacker could target the communication between entities by, eg, eavesdropping or modifying data. The main goal of this paper is to propose a model for a decentralised P2P marketplace for trading energy, which addresses the problem of developing security and privacy-aware environments. Additionally, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture is presented with a focus on security and sustainability. In order to propose a solution to DLT\u2019s scalability issues (ie, through transaction confirmation delays), off-chain state channels are considered for the energy negotiation and resolution processes. Additionally, a STRIDE (spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege) security analysis is conducted within the context of the proposed model to identify potential vulnerabilities.",

TEEs are envisaged to provide sensitive IoT deployments with robust assurances regarding critical algorithm execution, tamper-resistant credential storage, and platform integrity via remote attestation. However, the challenge of remotely managing credentials between TEEs remains largely unaddressed in existing literature. Here, credentials must remain protected against untrusted system elements and transmitted over a secure channel with bi-directional trust assurances of their authenticity and operating states. In this paper, we present novel protocols for four key areas of remote TEE credential management using mutual attestation: backups, updates, migration, and revocation. The proposed protocols are agnostic to the TEE implementation and network architecture, developed in line with the requirements and threat model of IoT TEEs, and subjected to formal symbolic verification using Scyther, which found no attacks.",

            "Abstract": "The Issuer Centric Smart Card Ownership Model (ICOM) gives complete control of smart cards to their respective card issuers, enabling them to install, modify or delete applications remotely, in a secure manner. However, the User Centric Smart Card Ownership Model (UCOM) delegates the ownership of smart cards to their users, entitling them to install or delete any application according to their requirements. In the UCOM there might be no off-card relationship between a smart card and an application provider, referred to as a Service Provider, which is the cornerstone of the ICOM security framework. Therefore, this creates unique security issues like the simulator problem, in which a malicious user may simulate the smart card environment on a computing device and requests installation of an application. Following this, it might be possible to retrieve sensitive application data by reverse engineering. In this paper \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A pay-TV system is a digital broadcasting system, where content providers charge subscribers a subscription fee. Such a system is a combination of a Conditional Access System (CAS), a smart card and a Set-Top-Box (STB). The current Pay-TV system business model follows a circle of dependency, wherein the service provider, the CAS vendor and the STB manufacturer have to work in a restricted vertical market. Furthermore, the unilateral communication channel between the transmitting and receiving ends makes distinguishing compromised cards (keys) and identifying the corresponding subscribers difficult. Additionally, the subscribers are compelled to be bound into using one specific STB pre-determined by the service provider, as such they can not access their entitlements via arbitrary STBs or receive content from other service providers. In this paper, we briefly analyse the existing CAS, the advantages and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a particular RFID application called a grouping-proof, where an entity such as an RFID reader generates a proof that two or more tags have been scanned simultaneously. This proof is then verified by the server, which processes the tags' data in the system. However, designing a grouping-proof protocol is challenging for two reasons. Firstly, in some cases, the server that authenticates the tags is offline during the scanning process, thus the tags' data need to be assembled in a valid grouping-proof to be authenticated later. Secondly, a number of recent grouping-proof protocols are either prone to attacks, or they are not efficient in terms of performance. In this paper, we present an offline two rounds grouping-proof protocol that provides immunity against well-known attacks on RFID protocols and improves tag's memory and computing performance.

            "Abstract": "The anticipated widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) raises significant safety and security concerns, including trespassing in restricted areas, colliding with other UAVs, and disrupting high-traffic airspaces. To mitigate these risks, geofences have been proposed as one line of defence, which limit UAVs from flying into the perimeters of other UAVs and restricted locations. In this paper, we address the concern that existing geometric geofencing algorithms lack accuracy during the calculation of complex geofences, particularly in dynamic urban environments. We propose a new algorithm based on alpha shapes and Voronoi diagrams, which we integrate into an on-drone framework using an open-source mapping database from OpenStreetMap. To demonstrate its efficacy, we present performance results using Microsoft's AirSim and a low-cost commercial UAV platform in a real-world urban environment.",

The application sharing mechanism in smart cards facilitates corroborative and interrelated applications to co-exist and augment each other\u2019s functionality. The already established application sharing mechanisms (e.g. in Java Card and Multos) do not fully satisfy the security requirements of the UCOM that require a security framework that provides runtime authentication, and verification of an application.

The growing trend of services convergence fuelled by the Near Field Communication and smartphones has made multi-application smart cards a tangible reality. In such an environment, cardholders might have number of applications on their smart cards and in case they lose the smart card, they would lose all of the applications. Currently, the recovery of a smart card based service might take from a day to a week at best, during which time the service provider might lose on business from the user because she is not able to access the respective services. The proposed framework in this paper enables a user to acquire a new smart card as she desires and then migrate/restore all of her applications onto it - facilitating her to recover from her lost digital wallet in a secure, efficient, seamless and ubiquitous manner.",

The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) generates a growing interest in coping with such challenges, along with new business opportunities. As a result, it is expected to see the number of drone-based applications to rise at a very fast pace, entailing new cybersecurity risks to emerge. In this paper, we propose to tackle the problem of secure communication among untrusting parties with a certificateless-group authenticated key agreement (CL-GAKA) scheme. The intent is to enable confidentiality, message integrity, and authenticity in UAV-to-UAV communication.

This has particular importance when a device cannot be trusted by a third-party, such as a corporation, that controls access to assets based on that decision. A software compromise, either on the scheme implementation or platform, may enable an adversary to modify authentication scores to alter the status of the device in reality, give insights into user behaviour, or gain unauthorised access to restricted assets.

Smart cards provide secure services, even in malicious environments, to end-users with a fairly straightforward limited usage pattern that even an ordinary user can easily deal with. The way the smart card industry achieves this is by limiting users\u2019 interactions and privileges on the smart cards they carry around and use to access different services. This centralised control has been the key to providing secure and reliable services through smart cards, while keeping the smart cards fairly useable for end-users. However, as smart cards have permeated into every aspect of modern life, users have ended up carrying multiple cards to perform mundane tasks, making smart card-based services a cumbersome experience.

However, substituting the wired network with a wireless network - also referred to as an Avionics Wireless Network (AWN) - brings a set of new challenges related to assurance, reliability, and security; even for a specific set of well-defined and non-critical tasks. The AWN has to ensure that it provides at a minimum the existing required levels of safety offered by the equivalent wired network. These challenges are underpinned by a necessity to boot the AWN to a secure and trusted state, before it can be used to bridge different parts of the IMA in an aircraft. In this \u2026",

On Android devices, the highest requested sampling frequency is returned to all applications even if other applications request measurements at lower frequencies. In this paper, we demonstrate that this design choice exposes practically exploitable side-channels based on frequency-key shifting. By carefully modulating sensor sampling frequencies in software, we show that unprivileged malicious applications can construct reliable spectral covert channels that bypass existing security mechanisms, e.g. Android's permissions framework. Moreover, we present a variant of this technique that allows an unprivileged malicious observer app to fingerprint other device applications and user interactions at a coarse-grained level. Both techniques do not impose any assumptions beyond application installation and accessing standard mobile services via the Android Sensors SDK. As such, they open a powerful attack vector that exploits subtle yet insecure design choices in mobile sensor stacks.",

With ever changing landscape of smart card technology and advancements towards a true multi-application platform, verifying the current state of the smart card is significant to the overall security of such proposals. The initiatives proposed by GlobalPlatform Consumer Centric Model (GP-CCM) and User Centric Smart Card Ownership Model (UCOM) enables a user to download any application as she desire-depending upon the authorisation of the application provider. Before an application provider issues an application to a smart card, verifying the current state of the smart card is crucial to the security of the respective application. In this paper, we analyse the rationale behind the remote attestation mechanism for smart cards, and the fundamental features that such a mechanism should possess. We also study the applicability of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for the remote attestation mechanism and propose two algorithms to achieve the stated features of remote attestation. The proposed algorithms are implemented in a test environment to evaluate their performance.",

As multiple workloads are executed concurrently, conflicts in memory resource occur, resulting in observable timing variations during execution. Malicious tenants can intentionally manipulate the hardware platform to devise a covert channel, enabling them to steal the data of co-residing tenants. This paper presents two new microarchitectural covert channel attacks using the memory controller. The first attack allows a privileged adversary (ie process) to leak information in a native environment. The second attack is an extension to cross-VM scenarios for unprivileged adversaries. This work is the first instance of leakage channel based on the memory controller. As opposed to previous denial-of-service attacks, we manage to modulate the load on the channel scheduler with accuracy. Both attacks are implemented on cross-core configurations. Furthermore, the cross-VM covert channel is successfully tested across three different Intel microarchitectures. Finally, a comparison against state-of-the-art covert channel attacks is provided, along with a discussion on potential mitigation techniques.",

In this paper, we investigate whether it is feasible to implement a Gesture Recognition system on a personal limited device such as a smart card. To do this, we set out an experiment using sample gestures based on practical results of gesture authentication trials and an optimised version of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to analyse the data captured. We implemented them on both a contact Smart Card (SC) and the more \u2026",

Fleets of such vehicles (drones) are prophesied to assume multiple roles from mundane to high-sensitive applications, such as prompt pizza or shopping deliveries to the home, or to deployment on battlefields for battlefield and combat missions. Drones, which we refer to as UAVs in this paper, can operate either individually (solo missions) or as part of a fleet (group missions), with and without constant connection with a base station. The base station acts as the command centre to manage the drones' activities; however, an independent, localised and effective fleet control is necessary, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for \u2026",

This paper combines the 'Yoking Proof' idea and the 'Select-Response' mode from previous publications. The 'Yoking Proof' is generated between subgroups and within each subgroup, and as a result, the failure rates are greatly reduced. The 'Select-Response' mode is used for subgroup verification.",

Such schemes utilize the characteristics of the wireless channel to generate the shared key from the device-to-device channel.

However, most research works in this area use passive attack models whereas active attacks that aim at manipulating the channel and key are also possible. Physical-layer key agreement with User Introduced Randomness (PHYUIR) is a solution similar to the Diffie-Hellman protocol against such a kind of active attack. The users (devices) introduce their own randomness to help to prevent active attacks.

As the diverse demands for network access and value added services increase, so does the importance of maintaining secure and consistent access controls. A critical and well-proven component of the GSM and UMTS security solution is the smart card in the form of the SIM or USIM respectively.

Peer-to-peer applications for mobile devices are receiving increased interest and in some cases these services are relying on NFC communication. It has been suggested that NFC systems are particularly vulnerable to relay attacks, and that the attacker\u2019s proxy devices could even be implemented using off-the-shelf NFC-enabled devices. This paper describes how a relay attack can be implemented against systems using legitimate peer-to-peer NFC communication by developing and installing suitable MIDlets on the attacker\u2019s own NFC-enabled mobile phones. The attack does not need to access secure program memory nor use any code signing, and can use publicly available APIs. We go on to discuss how relay attack countermeasures using device location could be used in the mobile \u2026",

There are, however, domains in which UAVs may help to increase the safety of airplanes and the management of flights and airport resources that often require substantial human resources. For instance, Paris Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG) has more than 7,000 staff and supports 30,000 direct jobs for more than 60 million passengers per year (as of 2016). Indeed, these new systems can be used beneficially for several purposes, even in sensitive areas like airports. Among the considered applications are those that suggest using UAVs to enhance safety of on-ground airplanes; for instance, by collecting (once the aircraft has landed) data recorded by different systems during the flight (like the sensors of \u2026",

There is a growing trend in which traditional smart-card based services like banking, transport and access control are being provisioned through smartphones. Smartphones with Near Field Communication (NFC) capability can emulate a contactless smart card; popular examples of such services include Google Pay and Apple Pay. Similar to contactless smart cards, NFC-based smartphone transactions are susceptible to relay attacks. For contactless smart cards, distance-bounding protocols are proposed to counter such attacks; for NFC-based smartphone transactions, ambient sensors have been proposed as potential countermeasures. In this study, we have empirically evaluated the suitability of ambient sensors as a proximity detection mechanism for contactless transactions. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we also collected relay attack data to ascertain whether ambient sensors are able to thwart such attacks effectively. We initially evaluated 17 sensors before selecting 7 sensors for in-depth analysis based on their effectiveness as potential proximity detection mechanisms within the constraints of a contactless transaction scenario. Each sensor was used to record 1000 legitimate and relay (illegitimate) contactless transactions at four different physical locations. The analysis of these transactions provides an empirical foundation on which to determine whether ambient sensors provide a strong proximity detection mechanism for security-sensitive applications like banking, transport and high-security access control.",

Their powerful architecture can also be used to mount attacks against live Real World servers, by using malicious VW objects. Researching these attacks in commercial VWs would not be acceptable, as it would be contrary to the terms of conditions which govern acceptable behaviour in a particular VW. So in this paper, attacks were conducted/analysed in a laboratory-based test bed VW implementation developed specifically for the research, with custom built attack and analysis tools: commercial VWs were used for data gathering only. Results of these experiments are presented, and appropriate countermeasures proposed which could reduce the likelihood of the attacks succeeding in live VWs.",

            "Abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are rapidly emerging as a root-of-trust for protecting sensitive applications and data using hardware-backed isolated worlds of execution. TEEs provide robust assurances regarding critical algorithm execution, tamper-resistant credential storage, and platform integrity using remote attestation. However, the challenge of remotely managing credentials between TEEs remains largely unaddressed in existing literature. In this work, we present novel protocols using mutual attestation for supporting four aspects of secure remote credential management with TEEs: backups, updates, migration, and revocation. The proposed protocols are agnostic to the underlying TEE implementation and subjected to formal verification using Scyther, which found no attacks.",

Similar to smart cards, NFC-based transactions are susceptible to relay attacks. Distance bounding protocols have been proposed for smart cards to counter relay attacks. However, this may not be effective in the field of mobile transactions, due to their requirement of high time-delay sensitivity and specialised hardware. A number of proposals are being put forward that show that sensing the natural ambient environment is an effective anti-relay mechanism. Existing literature neither involves a threat actor in their analysis nor they are in compliance with EMV's transaction requirement of 500ms. In this paper, we look at the anti-relay mechanism from a different point of view. Instead of measuring the natural ambience, we generate and measure a unique artificial ambient \u2026",

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range contactless technology allowing mobile devices to act primarily as either a reader or a token. Relay attacks exploit the assumption that a contactless token within communication range is in close proximity, by placing a proxy-token in range of a contactless reader and relaying communication over a greater distance to a proxy-reader communicating with the authentic token. It has been theorised that NFC-enabled mobile phones could be used as a generic relay attack platform without any additional hardware, but this has not been successfully demonstrated in practice. We present the \ufb01rst generic practical implementation of a contactless relay attack by using only NFC-enabled mobile phones, requiring only suitable mobile software applications. This implementation reduces the complexity of relay attacks and therefore has potential security implications for current contactless systems.",

Our approach takes advantage of the attacker\u2019s reluctance to significantly alter the elements that characterise an application without notably impacting the application\u2019s distribution. These elements include the application\u2019s name and icon. The detection is initiated from the client side, prior to an application\u2019s installation, making it application store agnostic.

Both advancements have dramatically complicated the use of physical attacks, which has recently led to the development of specialised attack methods. In this survey, we consolidate recent developments in physical fault injections (FIAs) and side-channel attacks (SCAs) on modern mobile devices. In total, we comprehensively survey over 50 fault injection and side-channel attack papers published between 2009-2021. We evaluate the prevailing attack methods, compare existing attacks using a common framework, identify several challenges and shortcomings, and suggest future directions of research.",

To illustrate the feasibility of these actions we also show how to practically skim and emulate certain tokens typically used in payment and access control applications with a NFC mobile phone. Although such attacks can also be implemented on other contactless platforms, such as custom-built card emulators and modified readers, the NFC-enabled mobile phone has a legitimate form factor, which would be accepted by merchants and arouse less suspicion in public.

We show an effective man-in-the-middle attack against the HB-MP protocol where the attacker utilizes the predictable rotation of the secret key. We enhance the HB-MP protocol by randomizing the rotation of the secret key, which eliminates the vulnerability. We also propose the use of round keys that may be produced by rotation or, more generally, by a one-way function.

            "Abstract": "With the advances in mobile phone technology there is a lot of interest in being able to automatically access information or trigger a service by bringing the phone close to an object. One of the most obvious ideas is to use the phone camera to read and interpret a simple 1-Dimensional barcode, a capability which has subsequently been extended to deal with barcodes containing more information eg 2-Dimensional barcodes such as Quick Response codes (QR code)[1]. In parallel with the development of QR codes there has been significant advances in Near Field Communication (NFC)[2][3][4][5], which amongst other things allows a mobile phone to interact with Radio Frequency ID (RFID)[6] tags that may be attached to objects. The interaction is achieved simply by bringing the phone within a few cm of the NFC compatible RFID (which we will also refer to as an NFC tag in this paper). The availability of different technologies (optical and Radio Frequency) with overlapping service capabilities can cause some confusion for potential Service Providers (SP) and customers alike, and the wrong choice can affect system security, usability, cost and logistics. In this paper we briefly consider the technologies and their capabilities, and attempt to clarify their strengths and weaknesses. We begin by introducing QR codes and NFC tags before making service comparisons and finally offering some suggestions and conclusions.",

We introduce a new cube algorithm based on the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. The proposed system employs elliptic curve cryptography, which is more efficient for thin clients where processing power and energy are significant constraints. The algorithm is designed for MANETs with dynamic changing topologies due to continuous flow of incoming and departing nodes.",

However, in a few instances it has been utilised for extracting other information about the internal state of a computing device. In this paper, we show how to create a precise instruction-level side channel leakage profile of an embedded processor. Using the profile we show how to extract executed instructions from the device\u2019s leakage with high accuracy. In addition, we provide a comparison between several performance and recognition enhancement tools. Further, we also provide details of our lab setup and noise minimisation techniques, and suggest possible applications.",

At a strategic level there will be high level requirements for security that will safeguard the system, which must ultimately translate to practical solutions and physical implementations. This chapter focuses on the technical implementation of security requirements and, in particular, the use of smart cards as trusted security tokens. In particular, it examines the significance of tamper resistance by exploring the different hardware and software platforms in relation to smart card attacks. It also highlights certain issues around the deployment of smart card technology in the financial industry.",

We show how an attacker could use an NFC mobile phone as such an attack platform by exploiting the existing security controls of the embedded SE and the available contactless APIs. To illustrate the feasibility of these actions, we also show how to practically skim and emulate certain tokens typically used in payment and access control applications with a NFC mobile phone. We also discuss how to capture and analyse legitimate transaction information from contactless systems. Although such attacks can also be implemented on other contactless platforms, such as custom-built card emulators and modified readers, the NFC enabled mobile phone has a legitimate form factor, which would be accepted \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has an enormous potential but also downsides. One downside of many DLT systems, such as blockchain, is their limited transaction throughput that hinders their adoption in many use cases (e.g., real-time payments). State channels have emerged as a potential solution to enhance throughput by allowing transactions to process off-chain. While current proposals can increase scalability, they require high collateral and lack support for dynamic systems that require asynchronous state transitions. Additionally, the latency of channel initialisations can cause issues especially if fast interactions are required. In this paper, we propose an atomic, scalable and privacy-preserving protocol that enables secure and dynamic updates. We develop a smart contract-based Credit-Note System (CNS) that allows participants to lock funds before a state channel initialisation, which enhances flexibility and efficiency. We formalise our model using the Universal Composability (UC) framework and demonstrate that it achieves the stated design goals of privacy, scalability, and atomicity. Moreover, we implement a dispute process in the state channel to counter availability attacks. Finally, we analyse the protocol in the context of an asynchronous smart grid-based marketplace.",

Conventional authentication protocols would require some form of challenge-response exchange with each individual tag. The extra transaction time needed to authenticate each individual tag sequentially might not be practically feasible, especially when readers are required to process an ever increasing volume of tagged items within a limited time. Our proposal works towards an approach that allows for multiple tags in a group to be authenticated simultaneously, as all the tags transmit their responses to a single challenge at the same time. This results in a controlled bit-collision pattern that can be used to verify that all the individual tags in a group are present and genuine.",

However, recent developments of multi-application smart card technology lead to new potential ownership models. One of the possible models is the User Centric Smart Card Ownership Model. In this model, the ownership is with smart card users. To support user\u2019s ownership, we require a framework that can assist cardholders to manage applications on their smart cards. In this paper, we present such a framework for managing application securely on a smart card.",

One of the most common modules has been the smart card; however, there are often misconceptions about the definition of the smart card and related technologies, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), as well as the requirement and justification for using them in the first place. These misconceptions are fuelled by the ever evolving nature of applications, security technology, personal devices and the growing threats that they must deal with. There is also a question of whether smart cards/RFIDs should really be in a book about embedded security, but we will see that the \u201cembedded\u201d aspect is growing ever stronger especially with developments in the mobile phone area.

            "Abstract": "Contactless technology is widely used in security sensitive applications, including identification, payment and access-control systems. Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range contactless technology allowing mobile devices to act primarily as either a reader or a token. Relay attacks exploit the assumption that a contactless token within communication range is in close proximity, by placing a proxy-token in range of a contactless reader and relaying communication over a greater distance to a proxy-reader communicating with the authentic token. It has been theorised that NFC-enabled mobile phones could be used as a generic relay attack platform without any additional hardware, but this has not been successfully demonstrated in practice. We present a practical implementation of an NFC-enabled relay attack, requiring only suitable mobile software applications. This implementation reduces the complexity of relay attacks and therefore has potential security implications for current contactless systems. We also discuss countermeasures to mitigate the attack.",

            "Abstract": "Fair-exchange and anonymity are two important attributes in e-commerce. It is much more difficult to expect fairness in e-commerce transactions using Bit coin due to anonymity and transaction irreversibility. Genuine consumers and merchants who would like to make and receive payments using Bit coin may be reluctant to do so due to this uncertainty. The proposed protocol guarantees strong-fairness while preserving anonymity of the consumer and the merchant, using Bit coin as a payment method which addresses the aforementioned concern. The involvement of the trusted third party (TTP) is kept to a minimum, which makes the protocol optimistic and the exchanged product is not revealed to TTP. It achieves dispute resolution within the protocol run without any intervention of an external judge. Finally we show how the protocol can be easily adapted to use other digital cash systems designed using public \u2026",

The growing trend of services convergence fuelled by Near Field Communication and smart phones has made multi-application smart cards a tangible reality. In such an environment, cardholders might have a number of applications on their smart cards and if a card is lost, all of the applications would be lost with it. In addition, consumers might decide to upgrade their smart cards and require a seamless and secure framework to migrate their applications from the old smart card to the new one. Currently, the recovery of a smart card-based service might take from a day to a week at best as each of the lost cards can only be replaced by the respective card issuer, during which time the card issuer might lose business from the user because she is not able to access the provisioned services. Similarly, there is at \u2026",

In this paper, we propose the inclusion of a trusted computing platform for smart cards that we refer as the Trusted Environment & Execution Manager (TEM). This is followed by the rationale behind the changes to the traditional smart card architecture to accommodate the remote security assurance and validation mechanism. We propose an attestation protocol that provides an on-demand security validation of a smart card by its respective manufacturer. Finally, the attestation protocol is informally analysed, and its test implementation and performance measurements are presented.",

Every now and then, the leader commands all other agents to move toward or away from the leader with speeds proportional to their battery levels. The leader then simultaneously estimates the battery levels of all other agents from measurements of the relative distances between the leader and other agents. We propose a nonlinear system model that integrates a particle motion model and a dynamic battery model that has demonstrated high accuracy in battery capacity prediction. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to this nonlinear model to estimate the battery level of each agent. We improve the EKF so that, in addition to gain optimization embedded in the \u2026",

Although there exist a number of software integrity verification techniques, they often fail to work in embedded environment. One main reason is, the memory read protection, frequently implemented in today\u2019s microprocessors, that prevent the verifier from reading out the necessary software parts. In this paper we show that side channel leakage (power consumption) can be used to verify the integrity of the software component without prior knowledge of the software code.

            "Abstract": "Avionics networks rely on a set of stringent reliability and safety requirements. In existing deployments, these networks are based on a wired technology, which supports these requirements. Furthermore, this technology simplifies the security management of the network since certain assumptions can be safely made, including the inability of an attacker to access the network, and the fact that it is almost impossible for an attacker to introduce a node into the network. The proposal for Avionics Wireless Networks (AWNs), currently under development by multiple aerospace working groups, promises a reduction in the complexity of electrical wiring harness design and fabrication, a reduction in the total weight of wires, increased customization possibilities, and the capacity to monitor otherwise inaccessible moving or rotating aircraft parts such as landing gear and some sections of the aircraft engines.

However as technology has advanced it has become possible to make use of electronic tickets that have significant advantages both for travellers and for the transport system operators. There has been a lot of recent publicity regarding weaknesses in some electronic ticket solutions; which whilst based on some solid facts tend to suggest that transport ticket security and fraud control is primarily a smart card/RFID technology issue. However this cannot be the case as systems exist that do not use such technology; or use it along side legacy systems. This paper will consider technology problems, but will first establish the bigger picture of transport ticketing and will finally make suggestions for future evolution of such systems.",

Voting on VW issues is currently done outside the VW environment, as constant monitoring of avatar activities means the privacy of in-world voting cannot be guaranteed.

            "Abstract": "Digital content providers seek to restrict usage by implementing conditional access. One such scenario is the security aspects of digital video broadcast (DVB-S). There has been a history of attacks on this technology to circumvent any security measures and some techniques have been countered by the deployment of customised/provider specific receivers. However, this leads to less choice and the duplication of equipment at the customer level. Open satellite receivers have been introduced to allow a single user to access several different services from a single piece of receiver equipment. These boxes provide a highly configurable environment with software emulations of conditional access systems that is open to abuse. The internet has allowed communities with in-depth expertise to grow up around open receiver equipment; effectively communicating attack methods as they evolve. A new level of emerging attack is a card sharing by which one legitimate user colludes to provide protected content to a larger group of illegitimate users. In this paper we propose countermeasures to protect DVB-S content against this species of attack by enforcing behavioural contracts and correct usage guidelines within the smart card. 1",

            "Abstract": "The notion of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) refers to inter-connected pieces of avionics equipment supported by a wired technology, with stringent reliability and safety requirements. If the inter-connecting wires are physically secured so that a malicious user cannot access them directly, then this enforces (at least partially) the security of the network. However, substituting the wired network with a wireless network-which in this context is referred to as an Avionics Wireless Network (AWN)-brings a number of new challenges related to assurance, reliability, and security. The AWN thus has to ensure that it provides at least the required security and safety levels offered by the equivalent wired network. Providing a wired-equivalent security for a communication channel requires the setting up of a strong, secure (encrypted) channel between the entities that are connected to the AWN.

However, as the IoT market grows, so does the number of attacks made against it with some reports claiming an increase of 600% in 2017. This work seeks to prevent code replacement, injection, and exploitation attacks by ensuring correct and platform specific application execution. This combines two previously studied problems: secure application execution and binding hardware and software. We present descriptions of both problems and requirements for ensuring both simultaneously. We then propose a scheme extending previous work that meets these requirements, and describe our implementation of the soft-core Secure Execution Processor developed and tested on Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.

The system uses a Kinect\u2122 device to capture and extract features, as it provides 20 skeleton tracking points: we use just six of these in our system. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is used to find an optimal alignment between gestures which are time-bound sequences. We tested the system on a sample of 38 volunteers. Ten volunteers provided reference gestures of their own design and 28 volunteers attempted to attack these reference gestures by both guessing and copying.

A generic voting model is proposed, using a SIM/SCWS voting application with standardised Mobile Network Operator (MNO) management procedures to process the votes cast. E-voting systems Pr\u00eat \u00e0 Voter and Estonian I-voting are used to illustrate the generic model. As the SCWS voting application is used in a distributed processing architecture, e-voting security is enhanced: to compromise an election, an attacker \u2026",
