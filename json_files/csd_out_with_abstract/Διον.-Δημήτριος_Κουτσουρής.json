Towards the accomplishment of this requirement, the traditional solution of cabled sensors appears to have clear limitations and this is one of the ultimate causes of the proliferation of wireless medical sensor networks during last years. The modern trend towards this direction is the formulation of patient Personal Area Networks (pPANs), consisting of a wireless infrastructure of medical sensors, attached to patient's body, which lays the path for incessant telemonitoring of the person in mind, without discomforting them. The nature of data that these networks are set to handle, as well as the particular demands that patient telemonitoring services raise, necessitate for a thorough analysis of the design requirements of pPAN communication protocols \u2026",

Accurate estimation of a Parkinson's Disease patient's Hoehn & Yahr stage is of great importance since this single value is enough to represent condition, severity of symptoms and localization and disease progression. For the first time data mining techniques are used to enhance Hoehn & Yahr stage estimation performance in a DSS. In its core a classification algorithm is trained using motor evaluation UPDRS data and new instances can then be automatically classified to provide suggestions and facilitate the clinician's final decision.

Autofluorescence bronchoscopy is, however, characterized by low specificity and a high rate of false positive findings (FPFs). The majority of FPFs are due to inflammations, as they often fluoresce at the same wavelengths with cancer. According to several clinical trials, the percentage of the FPFs is about 30%. In this paper we present an intelligent computing system for the classification of suspicious areas of the bronchial mucosa, in order to decrease the rate of FPFs, to increase the specificity and sensitivity of AFB and enhance the overall diagnostic value of the AFB method.",

This platform will allow the distribution of knowledge and collaboration among the health personnel of these areas, making use of wireless and terrestrial broadband telecommunication lines. The platform will provide the following health care services: i) Tele-collaboration and teleconsultation services between health care personnel, ii) home care telemedical services for \u201cat risk\u201d citizens, eg elderly, patients with chronic diseases, and post-surgery patients, iii) tele-medicine services in emergency situations, and iv) eLearning services for the continuous training through seminars for both health care personnel (doctors, nurses etc.), and persons supporting \u201cat risk\u201d citizens. The above services will be provided through the combined use of already evaluated systems. These systems supports capabilities for ultrasound images, ECGs, vital signal measurements, video conference, and elearning, along with communication gateways for data transmission over ISDN/DSL, satellite, GPRS, and WLAN networks. Furthermore, the implementation of an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) infrastructure to support proposed system\u2019s interoperability will provide the fundamental basis for future collaboration and information technology projects in the area.Manuscript received August 10, 2006.

We used phantom data from a prototype small-animal positron emission tomography system and the methods presented here are applied to 2-D sinograms. Further, we assess the performance of the new algorithm by comparing it to the simultaneous version of algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), to expectation maximization maximum likelihood (EM-ML), ISRA, and WLS.

Teleconsultations usually take place between 2 parties who have already established a relationship and have a defined communications pathway. In this paper we describe an innovative telematics platform that is not based on the traditional clientserver architecture. The proposed platform utilises the Widows Communication Foundation and is based on the concept of nodes. It allows a person requiring telemedical consultation to find available specialist help anytime and not just from the centre they usually deal with. The design of the system allows data to be transferred to any available centre, for centres to share data in real time, eg to obtain a second opinion, and for centres to communicate with hospital information systems to obtain necessary information about a patient.

            "Abstract": "The paper addresses the fine retinal-vessel's detection issue that is faced in diagnostic applications and aims at assisting in better recognizing fine vessel anomalies in 2D. Our innovation relies in separating key visual features vessels exhibit in order to make the diagnosis of eventual retinopathologies easier to detect. This allows focusing on vessel segments which present fine changes detectable at different sampling scales. We advocate that these changes can be addressed as subsequent stages of the same vessel detection procedure. We first carry out an initial estimate of the basic vessel-wall's network, define the main wall-body, and then try to approach the ridges and branches of the vasculature's using fine detection. Fine vessel screening looks into local structural inconsistencies in vessels properties, into noise, or into not expected intensity variations observed inside pre-known vessel-body areas. The vessels are first modelled sufficiently but not precisely by their walls with a tubular model-structure that is the result of an initial segmentation. This provides a chart of likely Vessel Wall Pixels (VWPs) yielding a form of a likelihood vessel map mainly based on gradient filter's intensity and spatial arrangement parameters (e.g., linear consistency). Specific vessel parameters (centerline, width, location, fall-away rate, main orientation) are post-computed by convolving the image with a set of pre-tuned spatial filters called Matched Filters (MFs). These are easily computed as Gaussian-like 2D forms that use a limited range sub-optimal parameters adjusted to the dominant vessel characteristics obtained by Spatial Grey Level Difference statistics \u2026",

In order to perform the spectral analysis, we applied the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and the adaptive approximation technique using the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm. The evaluation of FspO2 was based on calculating the time duration in which the FSpO2 was less than 30%(TSpO2< 30%). We demonstrate that the oscillating activity of the FHR of about 0.01 Hz identified by the MP method and the TSpO2< 30% parameter, show an adequate sensitivity (90%) in predicting fetal acidemia, whereas the combination of these two variables shows a very good specificity (94%). The results of the analysis of our data demonstrate that the analysis of the fetal heart rate by the matching pursuit and the fetal pulse oximetry recordings may provide additional source of information about fetal status and to alert the clinician to decide under objective conditions when and how to perform the delivery",

Fulfilling these needs are just as important for elderly people as it is for everyone else, but can become more difficult. In spite of the need for social contact, elderly people, even those who use the internet, tend to miss out on the benefits of online social networking platforms. Many are no longer at work so they do not have a daily set of activities with the same group of people. This, combined with increasing frailty, can lead to a habit of staying at home, which adds to the feeling of loneliness and isolation. In the same \u2026",

The time-frequency content of the EEG signals is extracted using the Short Time Fourier Transform. The analysis focuses on the EEG energy distribution among the well-established delta, theta and alpha rhythms (2-13 Hz), as energy variations in these frequency bands are widely associated with seizure activity. Relying on seizure rhythmicity, the classification is performed by isolating the segments where each rhythm is more clearly and dominantly expressed over the others. For the first time, an unsupervised methodology is evaluated using more than 978 hours of EEG recordings from a public database. The results show that the proposed methodology achieves high seizure detection sensitivity with significantly reduced human intervention.",

Current practice shows that the most promising approach to achieve a regional healthcare information system is to use a health level 7 (HL7) message-based communication system implemented by an asynchronous common communication infrastructure between healthcare sites. The system is a complete and integrated information system at a regional level that comprises all types of healthcare levels, that includes interoperability issues, that covers most of the needed components, and that is able to work efficiently in a secure wide area network to ensure data privacy and confidentiality. Another important feature of the proposed solution is that it creates an interoperability framework that can be replicated from one healthcare institution to another. In that sense, common interoperability messages can be used to interconnect heterogeneous information systems. In response to this strategy, more than 10 different consortiums have submitted proposals to the Greek government and the proposed interoperability framework seems to be widely accepted as a solution to enhance information and communication technologies developments in the healthcare sector in Greece.",

In this paper we describe an innovative telematics platform that is not based on the traditional clientserver architecture. The proposed platform utilises the Widows Communication Foundation and is based on the concept of nodes. It allows a person requiring telemedical consultation to find available specialist help anytime and not just from the centre they usually deal with. The design of the system allows data to be transferred to any available centre, for centres to share data in real time, eg to obtain a second opinion, and for centres to communicate with hospital information systems to obtain necessary information about a patient. The proposed platform should broaden the applicability and flexibility of telemedical services.",

But if we question this proposition, can we find any three dimensional objects that can't be printed layer by layer? To banish any disbeliefs we walked together through the mathematics that prove 3d printing is feasible for any real life object. 3d printers create three dimensional objects by building them up layer by layer. The current generation of 3d printers typically requires input from a CAD program in the form of an STL file, which defines a shape by a list of triangle vertices. The vast majority of 3d printers use two techniques, FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) and PBP (Powder Binder Printing). One advanced form of 3d printing that has been an area of increasing scientific interest the recent years is bioprinting.

Epileptic seizure is a phenomenon of rhythmicity discharge for either a focal area or the entire brain and this individual behavior usually lasts from seconds to minutes. The unpredictable and rare occurrences of epileptic seizures make the automated detection of them highly recommended especially in long term EEG recordings. The present work proposes an automated method to detect the epileptic seizures by using an unsupervised method based on k-means clustering end Ensemble Empirical Decomposition (EEMD).

The architecture consists of a self-configurable communications network based on identical stations, standard IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) protocols, Open Source software and wireless operation over the unlicensed 5.8 GHz frequency spectrum. Data transmission between stations is achieved using WPA (WiFi Protected Access).Results: We demonstrated the feasibility of field-deploying an ad hoc communications infrastructure during emergency situations, where other communications grids eg GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) are absent or damaged. The interface of medical data collection devices, such as biosignal monitors and electronic stethoscopes, with a data network that operates autonomously, was successfully achieved without the need of any user configuration. Data routing for scalability was shown to be supported for several dozen nodes spaced several hundred metres apart from each other. Video and audio data (including sounds from a digital stethoscope) were successfully transmitted by the system with adequate quality. Security of data encryption \u2026",

A three-layered neurophysiologically based artificial neural network model is presented whose neurons obey to Dale's law. The first two layers of the network can memorize and recall sparsely coded patterns, oscillating at biologically plausible frequencies. Excitatory low-pass filtering synapses, from the second to the third layer, create evoked current dipoles, when the network retrieves memories related to stimuli. Based on psychophysiological indications, simulated intracranial dipoles are straightforwardly transformed into long latency EP components such as N/sub 100/ and P/sub 300/ that match laboratory-measured scalp EPs.",

This restricted view of the clinical trials\u2019 context is quite often the reason behind unsuccessful trials and/or successful ones which, however, underestimate drugs\u2019 unwanted effects and thus their results are of low external validity in the much more complicated environment of clinical healthcare. In this paper, we present a context-aware approach, which has been developed in the PONTE project, for effectively guiding medical researchers during clinical trial protocol design and allowing for more efficient and effective access to scientific literature. The suggested approach incorporates intelligent services and advanced text mining mechanisms for scientific literature querying and mining during protocol design, taking into account the study context (ie active substance, target and disease) and the domain context in literature.",

Ambulances, Rural Health Centers (RHC) or other remote health location such as Ships navigating in wide seas are common examples of possible emergency sites, while critical care telemetry and telemedicine home follow-ups are important issues of telemonitoring. In order to support the above different growing application fields we created a combined real-time and store and forward facility that consists of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit. This integrated system: can be used when handling emergency cases in ambulances, RHC or ships by using a mobile telemedicine unit at the emergency site and a base unit at the hospital-expert's site, enhances intensive health care provision by giving a mobile base unit to the ICU doctor while the telemedicine unit remains at the ICU patient site and enables home telemonitoring, by installing the telemedicine unit at the patient's home while the base unit remains at the physician's office or hospital. The system allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3\u201312 lead ECG, SPO2, NIBP, IBP, Temp) and still images of the patient. The transmission is performed through GSM mobile telecommunication network, through satellite links (where GSM is not available) or through Plain Old Telephony Systems (POTS) where available. Using this device a specialist doctor can telematically \"move\" to the patient's site and instruct unspecialized personnel when handling an emergency or telemonitoring case.

We have focused on anxiety disorders specifically, which have mainly fear as their common denominator, and using this we decided to look into the role of the clinician in live ET sessions so as to examine whether this role can be replicated in a VRET simulation with similar or better outcomes for the patient, ie a more effective treatment.

We use phantom data from a prototype small-animal PET system and the methods presented here are applied to 2D sinograms. Further, we assess the performance of the new algorithm by comparing it to the simultaneous version of MRP-EM-ML (Median Root Prior Expectation Maximization Maximum Likelihood). Both algorithms are compared in terms of reconstruction time and CNRs (Contrast-to-Noise Ratios). As it turns out, MRP-ISWLS presents higher CNRs than MRP-EM-ML for objects of different size. Also MRP-ISWLS has better noise manipulation.",

This paper suggests several security measures in order to enhance security of the sensitive medical data both in an intranet and an extranet environment, and to provide value-added services for efficient health information management. The authors propose an architecture that enables the integration of such security measures in a HIS, especially with the use of SSO, which can cover a wide range of applications.",

The main problem is that currently, clinicians have limited guidance, as well as evidence of how to approach care decisions for such patients. As a consequence, the understanding of how to best take care of patients with multimorbidity conditions, may lead to improvements in Quality of Life (QoL), utilization of healthcare, safety, morbidity and mortality. The root of this problem is not narrowly confined to guidelines development and application, but is inherent throughout the translational path from the generation of evidence to the synthesis of the evidence upon which guidelines depend.",

The algorithms that are being compared are the simultaneous versions of ART (SART) and MART (SMART), EM-ML, ISRA and WLS. The evaluation study was based on reconstructed image quality, as it is derived from visual inspection, normalized profiles, cross-correlation coefficient and CNRs (contrast-to-noise ratios) of specific ROIs (region-of-interest). In general EM-ML and ISRA present similar reconstruction time and minor differences in reconstructed image quality. Slightly superior performances show WLS and SART while SMART is not adequate for reconstruction of PET data.",

Considering the chaotic nature of the EEG signal, it is very unlikely that such continuous, repetitive patterns with strict periodic behavior would occur naturally under normal conditions. Searching for spectral activity in the range of 2.5-4.5 Hz and assessing the presence of synchronous, repeated patterns across multiple EEG channels in an unsupervised manner, the proposed methodology provides high absence seizure detection sensitivity of 93.94% with a low false detection rate of 0.168 FD/h using the open TUSZ dataset.",

Based on these results, a two-layer LSTM network is selected to evaluate seizure prediction performance using four different lengths of preictal windows, ranging from 15\u202fmin to 2\u202fh. The LSTM model exploits a wide range of features extracted prior to classification, including time and frequency domain features, between EEG channels cross-correlation and graph theoretic features.

The design of the methodology exploits the available medical knowledge to tackle the lack of training data using a simple rule-based seizure detection logic, avoiding complex decision making systems, training and empirical thresholds. The Short-Time Fourier Transform is initially applied to extract the EEG signal energy distribution over the delta (<4 Hz), theta (4\u20137 Hz) and alpha (8\u201313 Hz) frequency bands. A set of four novel seizure detection conditions is proposed to isolate EEG segments with increased potential of containing ictal activity, by identifying segments where the EEG signal energy is intensively accumulated among the three fundamental frequency rhythms. A set of candidate seizure segments is extracted based on the intensity of the accumulated EEG activity per seizure \u2026",

Current practice shows that the most promising approach to achieve a regional healthcare information system (RHIS) is to use a health level 7 (HL7) message-based communication system implemented by an asynchronous common communication infrastructure between healthcare sites. The RHIS is a complete and integrated information system at a regional level that comprises all types of healthcare levels, that includes interoperability issues, that covers most of the needed components, and that is able to work efficiently in a secure wide area network to ensure data privacy and confidentiality. Another important feature of the proposed solution is that it creates an interoperability framework that can be replicated from one healthcare \u2026",

By the age of 75, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 6 men will have a stroke, which is one of the largest causes of disability, as half of all stroke survivors have a disability, making those persons dependent on others (1 in 5 are cared for by family and/or friends). People living longer is a cause for celebration, but older people are more vulnerable to mental health, cognition and physical problems, especially if they have already experienced a stroke (minor or mild). Depression is a main condition after a stroke and may be experienced in the form of sadness, unexplained pains, loss of interest in socializing, weight loss etc. The abovementioned conditions reduce the person's ability to remain active and independent, affecting their well-being and quality of living.

This paper describes the development of a computer-based system for the characterization of digital images utilizing methods of artificial intelligence. Border and color based features were extracted from digital images of skin lesions acquired under reproducible conditions. These features were used to construct a classification system for the recognition of malignant melanoma versus dysplastic nevus. Different methods, drawn from the fields of artificial intelligence (specifically, neural networks) and statistical modeling (discriminant analysis), were used in order to find the best classification rules and to compare the results of different approaches to the problem. Although larger sample sizes are necessary to resolve these issues fully, results so far show that a high percentage of correct classification (from 96% to 100%) is achievable by either method, using only two or three of the 20 available features. Thus a highly successful classification system for malignant melanoma versus dysplastic nevus is clearly feasible.",

Currently, the most efficient method for breast cancer early detection is mammography. An early sign of 30\u201350% of breast cancer incidents is the appearance of clusters of fine, granular microcalcifications, whilst 60\u201380% of breast carcinomas reveal microcalcification clusters upon histological examination. An efficient method for automated classification of microcalcification clusters and thus for breast cancer control is the use of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. One of the most powerful computing methods these systems use is the multiresolution analysis of digitized mammographic images, based on wavelet transform. In this paper, we present a comparative study of such methods which are widely used in microcalcification detection and feature extraction. The detection of microcalcifications was achieved by decomposing the mammograms into different frequency sub-bands, and reconstructing the mammogram from the subbands containing only high frequencies, duo to the fact that microcalcifications correspond to high frequencies in the frequency domain of the image.",

We demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between healthy subjects and academic fetuses by way of wavelet transform analysis of the fetal heart rate recordings and fetal pulse oximetry (FSpO/sub 2/). We focus on the values of the standard deviation of the wavelet components (up to scale index 5) and we apply a Self-Organizing-Map in order to investigate the relationship between the fetal heart rate variability in different scales and FSpO/sub 2/ (taking as a threshold for the FSpO/sub 2/, the 30% level and considering the minimum value of FSpO/sub 2/ during a 10-minute segment) for normal and acidemic fetuses during the second stage of labor, which can be used to discriminate acidemic fetuses from normal ones.

            "Abstract": "In the majority of cases, cervical cancer (CxCa) develops as a result of underestimated abnormalities in the Pap test. Nowadays, there are ancillary molecular biology techniques providing important information related to CxCa and the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) natural history, including HPV DNA test, HPV mRNA tests and immunocytochemistry tests. However, these techniques have their own performance, advantages and limitations, thus a combinatorial approach via computational intelligence methods could exploit the benefits of each method and produce more accurate results. In this paper we present a risk assessment model based on a Bayesian Network which, by combining the results of Pap test and ancillary tests, may identify women at true risk of developing cervical cancer and support the management of patients with ASCUS or LSIL cytology.

The rapid advance in the development of telemedicine systems and monitoring devices during last years gave several solutions in continuous patient telemonitoring. However, in most of the cases, these systems work with only one or a few types of medical devices and, thus, the variety of diseases they can monitor is rather limited. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that medical device manufacturers usually develop their own proprietary communication protocols and data format for each device. Most of the existing telemonitoring systems support communication with limited medical device types and depend on the manufacturer of them.

Improved compliance can lead to significant savings by preserving or restoring a patient's health, improving quality of life, by reducing the number of medical services required when therapy fails or appears ineffective, and by helping limit the rise in national health care costs. Within the framework of the TEN-Telecom European Commission Programme, C-Monitor project developed an integrated health telematics platform to enhance chronic patient compliance to therapy and interactive communication with their attending physicians. The overall aim of the project was to study the potential benefits, both in clinical and financial aspects, of such innovative systems and services along cost-efficiency of care provision. The platform developed has been validated in controlled small-scale trials in a number of European countries. The Greek pilot involved installation of the system in a private hospital in Athens and the validation scenario dealt with morbid obesity patients that have undergone surgical operation. A number of 30 patients were recruited for the trial. Results of the trial indicated the technological robustness of the proposed system and the potential clinical and economic benefits of running such services. Further trials are required to better address cost-efficiency issues with respects to the service goals.",

Yet, contemporary information access and distribution technologies raise critical issues that urgently need to be addressed, especially those related to security. The paper suggests the use of watermarking in telemedical applications in order to enhance security of the transmitted sensitive medical data, familiarizes the users with a telemedical system and a watermarking module that have already been developed, and proposes an architecture that will enable the integration of the two systems, taking into account a variety of use cases and application scenarios",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, there are molecular biology techniques providing information related to cervical cancer and its cause: the human Papillomavirus (HPV), including DNA microarrays identifying HPV subtypes, mRNA techniques such as nucleic acid based amplification or flow cytometry identifying E6/E7 oncogenes, and immunocytochemistry techniques such as overexpression of p16. Each one of these techniques has its own performance, limitations and advantages, thus a combinatorial approach via computational intelligence methods could exploit the benefits of each method and produce more accurate results. In this article we propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS), composed by artificial neural networks, intelligently combining the results of classic and ancillary techniques for diagnostic accuracy improvement. We evaluated this method on 740 cases with complete series of cytological assessment, molecular tests, and colposcopy examination. The CDSS demonstrated high sensitivity (89.4%), high specificity (97.1%), high positive predictive value (89.4%), and high negative predictive value (97.1%), for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+). In comparison to the tests involved in this study and their combinations, the CDSS produced the most balanced results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. The proposed system may reduce the referral rate for colposcopy and guide personalised management and therapeutic interventions.",

In this paper, we propose a method for creating realistic artificial vessel geometry. The centerline is constructed using PseudoRandom Noise Generator (PRNG) and 3d spline interpolation and the artificial wall using a variation of the 2d Perlin Noise. The resulted geometry indicates that this method achieves realistic representations of vessel walls with user defined parameters.",

As a result, clinicians who use biosignal sensors tend to ask their patients to remain motionless during simulations in order to achieve accurate measurements from the sensors. It is clear that this practice limits the level and range of benefits yielded when using VR simulation.

Based on this notion and the fact that modern day healthcare provision requires a multidisciplinary approach and relies heavily on various interrelated technologies we need to build/establish/turn on a system that will be in constant use and will reshape standard clinical practice.We therefore propose a system that will follow a bottom-up citizen-centred approach that includes a monitoring environment (at home and at work and possibly on the move), wireless communication substrate, cloud-based services and data provision, smart-tools for on-the-fly decision making and simple, cheap but effective hardware.Such a system would immediately improve access the healthcare provision regardless of geographical settings and social boundaries.",

The reasons are (i) decreased ratio of working population/pensioners, as well as (ii) increase of life expectancy. Thus, high priority should be given to safeguarding the reliable administration of the financial resources devoted to this purpose. This paper describes the application of a \"clever\" system which can be used by social security bodies (SSBs) and healthcare providers for: (a) Electronic data entry of prescriptions written by doctors to patients, (b) Check of prescriptions against predefined rules entered in the system for errors or possible fraud, reporting all \u00bfsuspicious\u00bf cases.

In this study, three different classification approaches, including the Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs), are investigated for their ability to discriminate preictal from interictal EEG segments. Using public EEG data, a wide range of features is extracted from each segment and then applied to the classifiers. The analysis covers a patient-specific approach, so as to optimize the decision to each patient individually and a patient-independent approach in order to explore a global prediction approach that can discriminate randomly selected preictal and interictal segments from all patients.

In this work an unsupervised seizure detection methodology is used to isolate ictal EEG segments without requiring any apriori information or human intervention. Seizures are detected using four simple seizure detection conditions that are activated when rhythmical activity from different brain areas is simultaneously concentrated in the alpha (8-13 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz) or delta (1-3 Hz) frequency range. Then, only a small proportion of the EEG segments that are most likely to contain ictal activity is selected and presented to the physician for the final evaluation. In this way, large volumes of EEG signals can be annotated in a fraction of the time and effort that would be otherwise required. Using EEG data \u2026",

Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is a novel surgical technique that uses the natural orifices of the human body in order to approach the peritoneal cavity. There are two basic types of robotics for NOTES; the external robots that stay outside the patient but act inside the abdominal cavity, and the internal robots that stay and act in the abdomen. The internal robots could only be mini-robots. The development of modular assembling reconfigurable micro-robots is a revolutionary idea for the NOTES. Modular micro-robots consist of small subunits which could be assembled and construct a functional miniature robot. These surgical micro-robots may increase the possibility for true scarless tele-surgery.

Avoiding situations where inordinate noise levels are apparent, increases the protection of the hearing system from damage. The monitoring of sound and noise exposure allows to recognize the circumstances under which potentially harmful sound levels may occur. With the EVOTION platform (www. h2020evotion. eu) recognition of loud sound incidents will be monitored in patients with hearing loss during usage of the hearing aids. Depending on the outcomes of the evaluation of such episodes, appropriate preventive actions should be taken, eg informing users about environment conditions or activities that may be a source of harmful exposure to noise. Sharing the sound/noise exposure data with health care professionals allows to counsel the user about their hearing habits. Moreover, combining the sound exposure data from many users enables public authorities to investigate health policy actions for noise exposure. During the first stage of the EVOTION project, a demonstrator program was developed, which relied on sound exposure data measured at outside situations, combined with available static clinical data (ie audiograms). These data undergone pre-processing techniques so as to be encapsulated into data coming from a real-time recording performed by EVOTION hearing aids during a rock concert.

Such policies are important for several aspects of healthcare provision, including:(a) screening for prevention of disease;(b) early diagnosis and treatment;(c) long-term management of chronic diseases and disabilities; and (d) setting-up standards. Although it is widely recognised that the PHP life cycle (ie, the analysis, action plan design, execution, monitoring and evaluation of public health policies) should be evidenced based, current support for it is mainly in the form of guidelines, and is not supported by data analytics and decision making tools tailored to it. In this paper, we present a novel model driven approach to PHP life cycle management and an integrated platform for realising this life cycle. Our approach is based on PHP decision making models. Such models steer the PHP decision making process by defining the data that need to be collected and the ways in which these data should be analysed in order to produce the evidence required for PHP making.

This is true not only due to the definition and physical meaning of Information, but also due to the difficulty in quantifying Information. It has been an intense field of study, especially in the 20th century, due to the revolution of information technology, where the notion of bit dominated the information discipline. Further on, after the bit the next term introduced in information theory was the qubit, the quantum bit. The present work tries to answer the question on the thermodynamic cost of intelligence. It attempts to build a connection between information and thermodynamics in terms of energy consumption and work production and in particular from a macroscopic point of view. From an initial observation we have reached the outcome that when introducing the concept of information into the \u2026",

Endoscopy images from the endometrium from three subjects, at optimum illumination and focus, were frozen and digitized at 720/spl times/576 pixels using 24 bits color. Regions of interest (ROI) of normal (N=61) and abnormal (N=69) regions were manually selected by the physician. ROI images were converted into gray scale and statistical features (SF) and spatial gray level dependence matrix features (SGLDM) were computed. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test at a=0.05 was carried out for comparing the differences between normal and abnormal tissue. There was significant difference between normal and abnormal endometrium for the SF features variance, energy and entropy and for the SGLDM feature of angular second moment. There \u2026",

With medical technology having developed in isolation and major manufacturers developing their own proprietary communication protocols, which preclude connection to devices from different manufacturers, and with healthcare trends having evolved, pointing to primary care, telecare and home care monitoring, there is an increasing need for technical standardization in healthcare environments and the development of protocols that enable communication in a structured and open way. In this study, a novel codification scheme has been developed, based on two healthcare informatics standards, the VITAL and DICOM Sup. 30, in addressing the robust interchange of waveform and medical data \u2026",

This dysfunction leads to many short- and long-term complications. In this paper, a system for tele-monitoring and tele-management of type 1 diabetes patients is proposed, aiming at reducing the risk of diabetes complications and improving quality of life. The system integrates wireless personal area networks (WPAN), mobile infrastructure, and Internet technology along with commercially available and novel glucose measurement devices, advanced modeling techniques, and tools for the intelligent processing of the available diabetes patients information. The integration of the above technologies enables intensive monitoring of blood glucose levels, treatment optimisation, continuous medical care, and improvement of quality of life for type 1 diabetes patients, without \u2026",

It is, nevertheless, paradoxical that although the medical community has embraced with satisfaction most of the technological discoveries allowing the improvement in patient care, this has not happened when talking about health-care informatics. Taking the above issue of concern, our work proposes an information model for knowledge management (KM) based upon the use of key performance indicators (KPIs) in health-care systems. Based upon the use of the balanced scorecard (BSC) framework (Kaplan/Norton) and quality assurance techniques in health care (Donabedian), this paper is proposing a patient journey centered approach that drives information flow at all levels of the day-to-day process of delivering effective and managed care \u2026",

The proposed modification consists of eight steps: 1) definition of the seed points, 2) conversion of the image to gray scale, 3) application of watershed transformation, 4) computation of the centroid of each region, 5) construction of the graph, 6) application of the Random Walker algorithm, 7) smoothing and extraction of the perimeter of the regions of interest and 8) overlay of the results.

The telecare systems are able to provide flexible services for older people suffering from chronic diseases, but are largely user group oriented. However, it is common in elderly to show symptoms of a combination of (chronic) diseases. Moreover, elderly are totally dependent on a third person as they are unable to perform a number of basic functions at home. They also feel cutt off from the social fabric. Old people living in remote places typically use telephone that dials a social alarm control center or mobile social alarm systems and monitoring systems.",

Further, we assess the performance of the new algorithm by comparing it to the simultaneous version of known MRP algorithms. All algorithms are compared in terms of cross-correlation and CNRs (Contrast-to-Noise Ratios). As it turns out, MRP-ISWLS presents higher CNRs than the known algorithms for objects of different size. Also MRP-ISWLS has better noise manipulation.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this work is to estimate the volume of a random shape cavity using distance sensors which transmit on a surface of a sphere, where sensors are mounted in a normal distribution. It is based on a variant method of convex surface volume measurement using triangulation. The innovation in the present work is that the measurements of distances for triangulation are taken from a random point of the cavity, to the inner wall. This method could be applied in cardiac ventricles; ventricles volume is an important hemodynamic factor for heart failure patients. The necessity for a new method of volume measurement by catheterization is more compulsory in the right ventricle due to its shape singularity than in the case of the left ventricle, whose practicable shape helps in easier volume estimation.",

However, very few of them have focused on proposing or creating a holistic framework meant to maximize the merits of rehabilitation treatments. More importantly, an even smaller number has taken into consideration the immense impact of emotions and the crucial role they display concerning patients' performance during rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to examine and highlight the direct connection of patients' performance quality with an artificially induced positive or negative emotional state. For that reason, we conducted an experiment regarding the convergence of emotions with the motor exercise. Specifically, our study was conducted with 45 participants and the GAPED database was employed as an emotional classifier. The effect of the visual stimulus was combined with a simple bicep exercise \u2026",

It is common knowledge that in order to install any type of information system in healthcare, six main groups of issues have to be dealt with: organizational and cultural matters related to healthcare, technological gap between healthcare professionals and information science experts, legal requirements on the confidentiality of personal data, of patient related data and on data privacy, industrial and market position of healthcare informatics and interoperability complexity, lack of vision and leadership of the health care managers and health authorities and user acceptability and usability of the proposed information systems. In order to meet these issues stated above, a special focus group (Z3) performed an assessment of the situation of healthcare informatics in Greece and of the main key points that would lead to success. In that sense it is now common knowledge that Greece is lagging information and communication technology progress in healthcare because almost none of the above mentioned issues were dealt with. This assessment is the result of the interaction of more than 150 decision makers, medical informaticians, healthcare practitioners and other individual involved in healthcare. As a conclusion, this focus group resulted in 4 major propositions that will lead to healthcare informatics introduction with better success chances: focus on terminologies and standards, focus on interoperability and information systems sustainability, focus on clear goals and system \u2026",

Seizures are detected when a concentration of rhythmical activity is observed in the lower end of the EEG spectrum within the delta (\u22643 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency bands, along with an increase in EEG signal variation and a high frequency of spikes/sharp waves in the same segment. When a candidate seizure segment is detected, channel localization is also evaluated to assess its activation pattern providing feedback to the clinician regarding potential seizure onset area.

The main cause of this concern is the frequent complaints of residents, living in areas where wind turbines are installed and operate. Residents claim that the operation of the turbines and specifically the infrasound generated by them, has a negative effect on their health. These facts justify the development of a low-cost device, able of detecting and suitably amplifying infrasonic waves so that the processing and study of infrasound waves can be measurable.

In addition, each organism should be studied throughout numerous generations to determine the profound biological changes in evolution. Here, we review the significant abnormalities presented in the cardiovascular, immune, vestibular and musculoskeletal systems, due to altered gravity conditions. We also review the impact that gravity played in the anatomy of snakes and amphibians, during their evolution.

            "Abstract": "The study of the normal function and pathology of the inner ear has unique difficulties as it is inaccessible during life and, so, conventional techniques of pathologic studies such as biopsy and surgical excision are not feasible, without further impairing function. Mathematical modelling is therefore particularly attractive as a tool in researching the cochlea and its pathology. The first step towards efficient mathematical modelling is the reconstruction of an accurate three dimensional (3D) model of the cochlea that will be presented in this paper. The high quality of the histological images is being exploited in order to extract several sections of the cochlea that are not visible on the micro-CT (mCT) images (i.e., scala media, spiral ligament, and organ of Corti) as well as other important sections (i.e., basilar membrane, Reissner membrane, scala vestibule, and scala tympani). The reconstructed model is being projected in the centerline of the coiled cochlea, extracted from mCT images, and represented in the 3D space. The reconstruction activities are part of the SIFEM project, which will result in the delivery of an infrastructure, semantically interlinking various tools and libraries (i.e., segmentation, reconstruction, and visualization tools) with the clinical knowledge, which is represented by existing data, towards the delivery of a robust multiscale model of the inner ear.",

Further on, prognosis of this type of neoplasms still remain poor and the comprehension of the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease still remains scarce. Several reports have identified microRNAs as significant molecules in the development of central nervous system tumors and propose that they might compose key molecules underlying oncogenesis. In a previous study we have identified several miRNAs, common to different subtypes of pediatric embryonal CNS malignancies as well as, we have identified miRNAs that manifest significant dynamics with respect to their expression and the neoplasmatic subtype. Overall, 19 tumor cases from children diagnosed with embryonal brain tumors were investigated. As controls, children who suffered a sudden death underwent autopsy and were not present with \u2026",

In this study, we incorporated realistic reconstructed geometries from microCT imaging data. The geometric representation of the stapedial annular ligament provided additional damping and the Rayleigh parameter \u03b2 was adjusted to lower values in comparison to previous computational studies. The maximum displacement of the stapes footplate, equal to 0.168 \u03bcm, was observed at a frequency of 1050 Hz. The computational results were validated with experimental measurements. Good agreement is observed between our results and the experimental data and other finite element studies.",

In this work, a methodology for the extraction of the most informative features for predicting rapid progression of the disease is proposed, using public data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and machine learning techniques. The aim is to determine if a patient is at risk of expressing rapid progression of PD symptoms from the baseline evaluation and as close to diagnosis as possible. By examining the records of 409 patients from the PPMI dataset, the features with the best predictive value at baseline patient evaluation are found to be sleep problems, daytime sleepiness and fatigue, motor symptoms at legs, cognition impairment, early axial and facial symptoms and in the most rapidly advanced cases speech issues, loss of smell and affected leg muscle reflexes.",

We have focused on anxiety disorders specifically, which have mainly fear as their common denominator, and using this we decided to look into the role of the clinician in live ET sessions so as to examine whether this role can be replicated in a VRET simulation with similar or better outcomes for the patient, ie a more effective treatment. Our hypothesis was tested in an outpatient setting with patients being separated into two groups. We examined whether the presence of a virtual guided master using participant modeling in a virtual environment was as effective or more effective than the Standard ET method. Our VR system is based on the Full Body Immersive Virtual Reality System with Motion Recognition Camera created by Jacob Kritikos. The outcomes were gathered via the Session Rating Scale by Miller which led to the conclusion that participant modeling within a VRET approach can lead to a better treatment quality.",

The present work applies different computational methods on microarray data in order to examine the hypothesis whether these cells have an intrinsic or acquired mechanism of resistance. Early onset gene expression at 4 h was compared to 72 h gene expression. Early gene expression allowed identification of genes initiating pivotal, early onset regulatory mechanisms activated by prednisolone.

In general, wireless networks suffer from decreased security. However, digital watermarking can be used to secure medical information. In this study, we focused on combining wireless transmission and digital watermarking technologies to better secure the transmission of medical images within and outside the hospital. Methods: We utilized an integrated system comprising the wireless network and the digital watermarking module to conduct a series of tests. Results: The test results were evaluated by medical consultants. They concluded that the images suffered no visible quality degradation and maintained their diagnostic integrity. Discussion: The proposed integrated system presented reasonable stability, and its performance was comparable to that \u2026",

A total of 418 regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted (209 normal and 209 abnormal) from 40 subjects. Images were gamma corrected and were converted to gray scale. The following texture features were extracted: (i) statistical features, (ii) spatial gray level dependence matrices (SGLDM), and (iii) gray level difference statistics (GLDS). The PNN and SVM neural network classifiers were also investigated for classifying normal and abnormal ROIs. Results show that there is significant difference (using Wilcoxon rank sum test at a=0.05) between the texture features of normal and abnormal ROIs for both the gamma corrected and uncorrected images. Abnormal ROIs had lower gray scale median and homogeneity values, and higher entropy and contrast \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The development of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) revolutionized the examination of the small bowel for diseases. Upon swallowing a capsule (a microscopic camera that resembles an ordinary pill in both shape and size), images of the patient's gastrointestinal (GI) tract are wirelessly transmitted from it to an external recorder. The inspection of these images is, to this day, still manually performed by medical professionals - a lengthy, and especially prone to errors, process. One of the most common diagnoses is the presence of angioectasias, i.e. ectatic vessels on the GI tract that are predisposed to bleeding. In this paper, a novel method for automatic detection of these lesions is proposed, using a combination of low-level image processing, feature detection and machine learning, that can run in real-time without the need for specialized hardware or graphics cards, achieving 92.7% sensitivity and 99.5 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Information is probably one of the most difficult physical quantities to comprehend. This applies not only to the very definition of information, but also to the physical entity of information, meaning how can it be quantified and measured. In recent years, information theory and its function in systems has been an intense field of study, due to the large increase of available information technology, where the notion of bit dominated the information discipline. Information theory also expanded from the \u201csimple\u201d\u201cbit\u201d to the quantal \u201cqubit\u201d, which added more variables for consideration. One of the main applications of information theory could be considered the field of \u201cautonomy\u201d, which is the main characteristic of living organisms in nature since they all have self-sustainability, motion and self-protection. These traits, along with the ability to be aware of existence, make it difficult and complex to simulate in artificial constructs. There are many approaches to the concept of simulating autonomous behavior, yet there is no conclusive approach to a definite solution to this problem. Recent experimental results have shown that the interaction between machines and neural cells is possible and it consists of a significant tool for the study of complex systems. The present work tries to review the question on the interactions between information and life. It attempts to build a connection between information and thermodynamics in terms of energy consumption and work production, as well as present some possible applications of these physical quantities.

            "Abstract": "This paper presents and demonstrates a qualitative and quantitative methodological approach to the evaluation of public Research and Development (R&D) funding. This approach aims to support rather than replace traditional evaluation approaches, by focusing on the input, output and behavioural effects of public R&D funding. This study employs as an evaluation model an adapted impact analysis model of the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (TEKES), including additionality theory and other evaluation methods. In addition, an evaluation tool is proposed in which R&D indicators are arranged in portfolios. Furthermore, a data repository mechanism is designed, and a computational tool for computing and displaying evaluation results is employed - a customised web-based application centred by an ontological evaluation model. The methodological approach is articulated, explained, illustrated and discussed by employing R&D programmes granted by the Greek funding agency. The results display both a standardised approach that can be applied to R&D funding evaluation, as well as a flexible and modular approach that can be adapted according to the objectives and policies of funding agency. The main benefits of this methodology are the ease of decoding quantitative and qualitative evaluation attributes in an automated way with low cost; and the ability to evaluate results objectively, in addition to producing outcomes in a broad and comparative manner. The challenge in this methodological approach is focused on three key areas: the exploitation of new evaluation tools, the elevation of hidden information, and the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Although several genes are known to be deregulated in urinary bladder cancer (UBC), the list of candidate prognostic markers has expanded due to the advance of high-throughput methodologies, but they do not always accord from study to study. We aimed to detect global gene co-expressional profiles among a high number of UBC tumors. We mined gene expression data from 5 microarray datasets from GEO, containing 131 UBC and 15 normal samples. Data were analyzed using unsupervised classification algorithms. The application of clustering algorithms resulted in the isolation of 6 down-regulated genes (TMP2, ACTC1, TAGLN, MFAP4, SPARCL1, and GLP1R), which were mainly implicated in the proteasome, base excision repair, and DNA replication functions. We also detected 6 up-regulated genes (CDC20, KRT14, APOBEC3B, MCM5, STMN, and YWHAB) mainly involved in cancer pathways. We identified lists of drugs that could potentially associate with the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), including Vardenafil, Pyridone 6, and Manganese (co-upregulated genes) or 1D-myo-inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (co-down regulated genes). We propose 12 novel candidate markers for UBC, as well as potential drugs, shedding more light on the underlying cause of the development and progression of the disease. View Full-Text",

The XML technology was employed to achieve customised views on patient data, according to the access rights of different user profiles. Strict security and access control policy were implemented to ensure secure transmission of medical data through the Internet. The system was designed to collaborate with existing clinical patient record systems and to be adjustable to different medical applications. Current implementations include the fields of Oncology, Lupus Erythrematosis, Obstetrics and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease.

An important requirement for its quantification is the continuous recording of electrocardiography (ECG) signal, so as to extract the RR interval, in parallel with continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure recording. We aimed to accurately calculate the RR Interval from pressure wave recordings per se, namely, the Pulse Interval (PI) using various arterial pulse wave analysis algorithms and to evaluate the precision and accuracy of BRS values calculated with the PI compared to BRS values calculated with the RR Interval.We analyzed the open access data of the Eurobavar study, which contains a set of ECG and arterial blood pressure (BP) wave signals recorded at 11 European centers.

The telemedicine system is a combined real-time and store and forward facility that consists of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit. The telemedicine unit (patient site) allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3-12 lead ECG, SPO2, NIBP, IBP, Temp) and still images of the patient from the incident place to the base unit (consultation site). The transmission is performed through GSM, Satellite links or POTS. Using this device a specialist doctor can telematically \"move\" to the patient site and instruct medical personnel when handling a patient. The consultation site is equipped with a multimedia database able to store and manage the data collected by the system. The system was validated in four different countries using a standardized medical protocol.",

The support of primary healthcare, home care and the continuous education of physicians are the three major issues that the proposed platform is trying to facilitate. The proposed system is based on state-of-the-art telemedicine systems and is able to provide the following healthcare services: i) Telecollaboration and teleconsultation services between remotely located healthcare providers, ii) telemedicine services in emergencies, iii) home telecare services for \"at risk\" citizens such as the elderly and patients with chronic diseases, and iv) eLearning services for the continuous training through seminars of both healthcare personnel (physicians, nurses etc) and persons supporting \"at risk\" citizens. These systems support data transmission over simple phone lines, internet connections, integrated services digital network/digital subscriber lines, satellite links, mobile networks (GPRS/3G), and wireless local area networks. The data corresponds, among others, to voice, vital biosignals, still medical images, video, and data used by eLearning applications.

            "Abstract": "A highly sensitive, fully digital, sensor-actuator has been developed for photoplethysmography(PPG) measurements. It uses standard light emitting diodes (LEDs) as both light emitters and detectors and general purpose microcontrollers (MCs) or programmable logic devices (PLDs) for the sensing, signal processing and communication. The main advantages of the proposed approach are that in its better spectral sensitivity, increased and adjustable resolution, reductions in cost, dimension, power consumption and also in avoiding the need for external components like precise analogue to digital converters (ADCs), sensitive operational amplifiers (OAs) and different filter configurations. Two sensing configurations are presented; basic (2-LEDs) and SpO2 (4-LEDs). Basic one uses only two I/O pins and two LEDs and is capable of detecting the PPG signal from a finger or a toe. It is then very simple to extract vital information like heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) from such a signal. It should be easily expanded to SpO2 sensor-meter, by adding two more LEDs and occupying two more pins. The sensing approach and preliminary results are briefly elaborated.",

A random sample of 12 patients undergoing elective high-risk hepatectomies at our institution was prospectively selected to undergo computer-assisted surgery using our algorithms (June 2013\u2013July 2014). Quantitative and qualitative evaluation was performed. The average computer analysis time (segmentation, resection planning, volumetry, visualization) was 45 min/dataset. The runtime for the semiautomatic algorithm was <0.2 s/slice. Liver volumetric segmentation using the hybrid method was achieved in 12.9 s/dataset (SD \u00b1 6.14 \u2026",

Early gene expression response implies a dose-dependent dual mechanism of action of prednisolone too, something reflected on cell state upon 72 h of treatment. In this work, a generic, computational microarray data analysis framework is proposed, in order to examine the hypothesis, whether CCRF-CEM cells exhibit an intrinsic or acquired mechanism of resistance and investigate the molecular imprint of this, upon prednisolone treatment. The experimental design enables the examination of both the dose (0 nM, 10 nM, 22 uM, 700 uM) effect of glucocorticoid exposure and the dynamics (early and late, namely 4 h, 72 h) of the molecular response of the cells at the transcriptomic layer.

We have compared these methods using hierarchical clustering. The gene expression patterns revealed by hierarchical clustering were used to draw probable conclusions on the question whether resistance to glucocorticoids is inherent or acquired, in this type of cells. Although different algorithmic approaches have concluded different results, the set of genes examined manifested an opposing pattern in their expression profile between low and high prednisolone concentrations. This opposing behavior seems to be related to glucocorticoid receptor-related gene repression or activation, leading to the activation of resistance mechanisms within the cell \u2026",

However, no specific technological importance has been given so far on how to apply Virtual Reality with a way that properly stimulates the phobic stimulus and provide the necessary means for lifelike experience. Thanks to technological advancements, there is now a variety of hardware that can help enhance stronger emotions generated by Virtual Reality systems. This study aims to evaluate the feeling of presence during different hardware setups of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy, and, particularly how the user\u2019s interaction with those setups can affects their sense of presence during the virtual simulation. An acrophobic virtual scenario is used as a case study by 20 phobic individuals and the Witmer\u2013Singer presence questionnaire was used for presence evaluation by the users of the system. Statistical analysis on their answers revealed that the proposed full body Motion Recognition Cameras system generates a better feeling of presence compared to the Hand Controllers system. This is thanks to the Motion Recognition Cameras, which track and allow display of the user\u2019s entire body within the virtual environment. Thus, the users are enabled to interact and confront the anxiety-provoking stimulus as in real world. Further studies are recommended, in which the proposed system could be used in Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy trials with acrophobic patients and other anxiety disorders as well, since the proposed system can provide natural interaction in various simulated environments.

TM is responsible to collect the required data and process them by a threshold detection algorithm so as to evaluate the fall risk level. RG is the core of the proposed platform bearing the primary duty of providing individually tailored fun rehabilitation/training programs. These programs are games based on balance/coordination, gait, strength and flexibility exercises, enhanced by relaxing graphics, backgrounds, sound and music. Moreover each game\u2019s score relates to user performance according to their motion during the gaming sessions. Finally, the KINOPTIM platform provides an intelligent system (MBI), able to act both as repository and as a self-learning system, assisting physicians to design more efficient rehabilitation plans. Results & Conclusion: KINOPTIM is a tele-rehabilitation gaming platform for fall prevention in the elderly community. It embraces among others an entertaining physical training program implemented in a game format based on personalised information. Furthermore, it offers some further functionality for the cares in order to help them to plan the most appropriate rehabilitation \u2026",

Ambulances are usually the first to arrive on the scene and to administer first aid. However, as the time that it takes to transfer the patient to the hospital increases, so does the fatality rate.In this paper, a mobile teleconsultation system is presented, based on third generation mobile links. This system can be installed inside an ambulance and will permit high resolution videoconferencing between the moving vehicle and a doctor or a consultant within a base station (usually a hospital). In addition to video and voice, high quality still images and screenshots from medical equipment can also be sent.",

The recent advances in the study of the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (the necessary cause for CxCa development) have guided clinical practice to add HPV related tests alongside the Pap test. In this way, today, HPV DNA testing is well accepted as an ancillary test and it is used for the triage of women with abnormal findings in cytology. However, these tests are either highly sensitive or highly specific, and therefore none of them provides an optimal solution. In this Letter, a clinical decision support system based on a hybrid genetic algorithm \u2013 Bayesian classification framework is presented, which combines the results of the Pap test with those of the HPV DNA test in order to exploit the benefits of each method and produce more accurate outcomes.

The algorithms compared are the simultaneous versions of ART (SART), EM-ML, ISRA WLS and a new iterative algorithm we have introduced under the short name ISWLS. The evaluation study was based on reconstructed image quality, as it is derived from visual inspection, cross-correlation coefficient and CNRs (contrast-to-noise ratios) of specific ROIs (region-of-interest). In general EM-ML and ISRA present similar reconstruction time and minor differences in reconstructed image quality. Slightly superior performances show WLS and SART while ISWLS improves reconstruction resolution at the edges of the field of view.",

In late 90s, laparoscopic surgery had already been established from both practical and theoretical point of view. This, along with the evolution of technology, paved the way towards the broad application of minimally invasive surgery. During the very first interventions robots were tools with minor roles besides the operation table (e.g. Probot). The introduction of the daVinci system, made the breakthrough towards the wide application of robotic assisted surgery, and still today maintains the lead position in the field. Recently, NOTES (Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery), gave another dimension to minimally invasive surgery. The main innovation in NOTES is that the endoscope and other surgical tools are inserted to human body through natural holes such as mouth anus etc. Endoscopic surgery is a well-developed \u2026",

The robustness and sensitivity of these techniques have been evaluated both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Towards that purpose error parameters were calculated using phantom and real patient images. The usefulness of our techniques was evaluated by specialist radiologists.

Modular mini-robots can be used in novel minimally invasive surgery techniques like natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgery. The control of these miniature assistants is complicated. The aim of this study is the in silico investigation of a remote controlling interface for modular miniature robots which can be used in minimally invasive surgery. Methods. The conceptual controlling system was developed, programmed, and simulated using professional robotics simulation software. Three different modes of control were programmed. The remote controlling surgical interface was virtually designed as a high scale representation of the respective modular mini-robot, therefore a modular controlling system itself. Results. With the proposed modular controlling system the user could easily identify the conformation of the modular mini-robot and adequately modify it as needed. The arrangement of each module was always known. The in silico investigation gave useful information regarding the controlling mode, the adequate speed of rearrangements, and the number of modules needed for efficient working tasks. Conclusions. The proposed conceptual model may promote the research and development of more sophisticated modular controlling systems. Modular surgical interfaces may improve the handling and the dexterity of modular miniature robots during minimally invasive procedures.",

The innovation introduced is that an object's/face's 2-D caricature's views that are taken in 3-D are fused in terms of their contour features. In addition, these features are directly connected to all of the objects and faces stored in our database. A face/object is thus regarded as the output of a detailed probabilistic Bayesian analysis of the views' contours being inter-independent parameters. The features are the object's/face's border pixels that are extracted from low-level edge information. The faces were separated from background clutter using the C.M. for two clusters (background and foreground) for the fist view and then the nearest neighbour classifier. Both kinds of patterns are modelled as distributions, as they are vague due to the non-perfect lighting conditions \u2026",

The application aims to enable users to self-evaluate their activity and progress, to communicate with each other and, through strategically selected motivational features, to engage with the system with undiminished interest for a long period of time. Mock-up interfaces were evaluated in semi-structured focus groups and interviews that were performed across three European countries. Further evaluation in the form of four pilot studies with 160 participants will be performed and qualitative and quantitative measures will be used to process the feedback about the use of the application.",

            "Abstract": "Information technology advances have brought forth new challenges in healthcare information management, due to the vast amount of medical data that needs to be efficiently stored, retrieved, and distributed, and the increased security threats that explicitly have to be addressed. The paper discusses the perspectives of digital watermarking in a range of medical data management and distribution issues, and proposes a complementary and/or alternative tool that simultaneously addresses medical data protection, archiving, and retrieval, as well as source and data authentication. The scheme imperceptibly embeds in medical images multiple watermarks conveying patient's personal and examination data, keywords for information retrieval, the physician's digital signature for authentication, and a reference message for data integrity control. Experimental results indicate the efficiency and transparency of the scheme \u2026",

Early medical traditions include those of ancient Egypt and Babylon. The Greeks went even further, introducing the concepts of medical diagnosis, prognosis, and advanced medical ethics. Around 800 BCE Homer in The Iliad gives descriptions of wound treatment by the two sons of Asklepios, the admirable physicians Podaleirius and Machaon and one acting doctor, Patroclus. The Hippocratic Oath, still taken by doctors up to today, was written in Greece in the fifth century BCE. In the medieval age, surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in Rogerius\u2019s The Practice of Surgery. Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy. During the Renaissance, understanding of anatomy improved with \u2026",

Classification features are extracted with the use of image texture analysis techniques such as fractal dimension texture analysis, spatial gray-level dependence matrices, gray-level difference statistics, gray-level run-length statistics, and first-order gray-level parameters. These features are fed to a neural network classifier based on geometrical fuzzy sets. Starting from the construction of the Voronoi diagram of the training patterns, an aggregation of Voronoi regions is performed, leading to the identification of larger regions belonging exclusively to one of the pattern classes. The resulting scheme is a constructive algorithm that defines fuzzy clusters of patterns. Based on observations concerning the grade of membership of the training patterns to the created \u2026",

The present work reviews the existent knowledge on models of epidemiological dispersion, the creation of a new form of an epidemiological diffusion equation, and the subsequent application of this equation to the investigation of epidemiological phenomena. Towards that scope, the authors have used mathematical models which have been previously reported, as well as algorithmic approaches of stochastic nature for the solution of complex functions. In particular, they have used dynamic programming algorithms, Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz stochastic optimization algorithms, Markov chains and cellular automata. The modified diffusion equation could potentially provide a useful tool to the investigation of epidemiological phenomena. More \u2026",

Starting from the Warburg effect, which was one of the first theories concerning the mitochondrial dysfunction in tumor cells. Further on, the \"two-hit\" theory, where tumors were considered to be the outcome of genetic aberrations or mutations and more specifically of a certain number of \"hits\" each one resulting in a mutation. One of the main physical problems of biological systems is proliferation. Proliferation brings forwards two main questions: First, under a given population of cells, at time t what will be the precise population at time t+24h (or any other time point)? Second, what are the metabolic strategies followed by tumor cells in order to facilitate for their growth? In the present work we have used experimental data obtained from proliferation experiments of leukemic cells, where cell population and glucose consumption were evaluated. These data were \u2026",

An early sign of 30-50% of breast cancer is the appearance of clusters of fine, granular microcalcifications and 60-80% of breast carcinomas reveal microcalcification clusters upon histological examination. The high correlation between the appearance of the microcalcification clusters and diseases, proves that computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for automated classification of microcalcification clusters will be very useful and helpful for breast cancer control. The fuzzy nature of microcalcification, the low contrast and the low ability of distinguishing them from their surroundings make automated characterization of them extremely difficult.

            "Abstract": "Hemodynamic monitoring is the main component in intensive care unit (ICU). Patients in ICU are under hemodynamic instability and multi-organ failure for some hours or even some days. Volume\u2013pressure relation constitutes the most reliable method for the estimation of central hemodynamic state and ventricular function. Therefore, the evaluation of intracardiac volume and pressure is necessary. However no available method exists for clinical use that measures the volume of the right ventricular cavity continuously in real time. This paper discusses the methods could be used in measuring the right ventricular volume in the context of an efficient cardiac function evaluation of critical ill patients in ICU, using miniaturised ultrasound on the tip of a Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC), which is anyway used on that purpose but evaluates only pressure.",

However, its impact on health policy is seldom considered. As part of the EVOTION project, the related platform supports the acquisition of wider policy feedback through the launching of social media campaigns and the collection and analysis of related feedback to identify areas of improvement in the hearing healthcare field. In the present paper, we present the interaction of the Social Media Campaigning Tool and the Decision Support System of the platform and highlight its importance in decision making for such purposes.",

Yet, significant differences can arise due to variations in the image acquisition method. For endoscopic imaging of the endometrium, we propose a standardized image acquisition protocol to eliminate significant statistical differences due to variations in: (i) the distance from the tissue (panoramic vs close up), (ii) difference in viewing angles and (iii) color correction. We investigate texture feature variability for a variety of targets encountered in clinical endoscopy. All images were captured at clinically optimum illumination and focus using 720 \u00d7 576 pixels and 24 bits color for: (i) a variety of testing targets from a color palette with a known color distribution, (ii) different viewing angles, (iv) two different distances from a calf endometrial and from a chicken \u2026",
