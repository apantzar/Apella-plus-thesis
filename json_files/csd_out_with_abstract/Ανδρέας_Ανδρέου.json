            "Abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of software effort estimation through the use of a new machine learning technique for producing reliable confidence measures in predictions. More specifically, we propose the use of Conformal Predictors (CPs), a novel type of prediction algorithms, as a means for providing effort estimations for software projects in the form of predictive intervals according to a specified confidence level. Our approach is based on the well-known Ridge Regression technique, but instead of the simple effort estimates produced by the original method, it produces predictive intervals that satisfy a given confidence level. The results obtained using the proposed algorithm on the COCOMO, Desharnais and ISBSG datasets suggest a quite successful performance obtaining reliable predictive intervals which are narrow enough to be useful in practice.",

Firstly, Web quality is divided into five major components, namely usability, functionality, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. Secondly, the relationship of these quality components with certain Web patterns is demonstrated and a set of guidelines for designing quality Web applications using these patterns is proposed. A successful Web site is then used as a case-study to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed guidelines. The Web patterns utilized by the site under study are identified and matched with the proposed list of patterns. Finally, we investigated how these patterns contribute to the success of the specific Web application.",

In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized IoT application using blockchain technology, namely, ParkChain. The ParkChain application operates in a way that no one can delete, revert, hack or question the time a registered vehicle securely entered a parking area. In order to evaluate ParkChain, we have implemented the smart contract on top of Ethereum Blockchain along with a traditional Image Processing / Computer Vision approach for License Plate Recognition, and using a Raspberry Pi we control the access on a parking place. We report on several experiments that assess the performance of ParkChain application.",

The dynamic behaviour of a system focuses on a stable behaviour reaching equilibrium state at fixed points. Multicollinearity in FCMs, is examined as a phenomenon possibly present in any dynamic modelling. Cases in which the activation level of a concept is constantly driven towards +1 or -1 are investigated. In addition, concepts stabilizing at levels other than those reflecting the actual environment are also considered. These experiments are performed by selectively inserting bias nodes in the map so as to increase the reliability of the dynamic model. Following the theoretical background of FCMs and the mathematical formulation of bias nodes we demonstrate their use and contribution in terms of a case study that deals with the Cyprus issue in view of the Turkish full EU membership.",

To create our dataset, we used crowdsourcing combined with expert guidance, resulting in 513K annotated mesh primitives, grouped into 292K semantic part components across 2K building models. The dataset covers several building categories, such as houses, churches, skyscrapers, town halls, libraries, and castles. We include a benchmark for evaluating mesh and point cloud labeling. Buildings have more challenging structural complexity compared to objects in existing benchmarks (eg, ShapeNet, PartNet), thus, we hope that our dataset can nurture the development of algorithms that are able to cope with such large-scale geometric data for both vision and graphics tasks eg, 3D semantic segmentation, part-based generative models, correspondences, texturing, and analysis of point cloud data acquired from real-world buildings. Finally, we show that our mesh-based graph neural network significantly improves performance over several baselines for labeling 3D meshes.

The objective of the Genetically Evolved Certainty Neuron Fuzzy Cognitive Map (GECNFCM) as it is introduced here is to overcome the main weakness of CNFCMs, which lies with the recalculation of the weights corresponding to each concept every time a new strategy is adopted. The problem is overcome through the introduction of a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which produces a set of solutions and new weights following a strategy change. The GA concepts are very appealing since they offer the optimal solution without a problem-solving strategy, once the requirements are defined. It is interesting to point out that the hybrid approach is reflected in both the implementation of the GA and in the methodology applied for solving the problem. In fact, the reasoning behind this hybrid methodology is to use it for obtaining the optimal values of the weights corresponding to the variables of the model rather than the optimal values of the variables themselves.",

The ongoing searching behavior of the user is dynamically recorded and inserted in the recommendation engine, adjusting user preferences in real-time and enabling the system to maintain high levels of accuracy. The proposed approach is validated on a movie dataset containing information on stars, categories and production companies, with the user being able to search for an item based on one or more of these features. The results indicate successful performance for the two clustering algorithms, while a short comparison to variations of the KNN algorithm suggests superiority of the proposed approaches.",

Continuous evaluation of the web applications to check if they meet functional and non-functional requirements, as well as the organisational goals, necessitates the use of quality evaluation models in a fast-changing environment. This paper proposes an efficient web application quality evaluation model that is based on two axons: internal (within the organisation) and external (the users). The model places emphasis on quality issues as defined by ISO 9126 and other web quality factors and utilises importance-based criteria for evaluating requirements. Finally, the applicability and efficiency of the model are demonstrated through the evaluation of two different types of web applications.",

An evolutionary algorithm is designed based on the correction of the weight matrix, the origin of which is responsible for the creation of the limit cycle phenomenon. The system traces the presence of a limit cycle or chaotic behaviour and then searches the weight matrix using evolutionary techniques to identify which weight or group of weights are responsible for the cause of the limit cycle.

Ambulances, Rural Health Centers (RHC) or other remote health location, Ships navigating in wide seas and Airplanes in flight are common examples of possible emergency sites, while critical care telemetry and telemedicine home follow-ups are important issues of patient monitoring. The telemedicine system is a combined real-time and store and forward facility that consists of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit. The telemedicine unit (patient site) allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3-12 lead ECG, SPO2, NIBP, IBP, Temp) and still images of the patient from the incident place to the base unit (consultation site). The transmission is performed through GSM, Satellite links or POTS. Using this device a specialist doctor can telematically \"move\" to the patient site and instruct medical personnel when handling a patient. The consultation site is equipped with a multimedia database able to store and manage the data collected by the system. The system was validated in four different countries using a standardized medical protocol.",

Additionally, project management in conventional development processes aims to plan and predict the future, whereas in agile development environments, aims to adapt according to any future change. In this paper we investigate, through modeling with Influence Diagrams, the benefit of switching from traditional software development to agile in terms of productivity, expected value and cost. Additionally, we examine how software costs might differentiate if traditional or agile development methodologies are followed. We explore the factors that contribute in successful software development and draw our main conclusions through hypothetical and real case scenarios recorded in agile surveys on Information Technology practices. One of our main conclusions includes verification of the need for a skillful manager and small development team to lead to successful agile projects.",

            "Abstract": "In the area of software engineering a critical task is to accurately estimate the overall project costs for the completion of a new software project and efficiently allocate the resources throughout the project schedule. The numerous software cost estimation approaches proposed are closely related to cost modeling and recognize the increasing need for successful project management, planning and accurate cost prediction. Cost estimators are continually faced with problems stemming from the dynamic nature of the project development process itself. Software development is considered an intractable procedure and inevitably depends highly on several complex factors (eg, specification of the system, technology shifting, communication, etc.). Normally, software cost estimates increase proportionally to development complexity rising, whereas it is especially hard to predict and manage the actual related costs. Even for well-structured and planned approaches to software development, cost estimates are still difficult to make and will probably concern project managers long before the problem is adequately solved. During a system\u2019s life-cycle, one of the most important tasks is to effectively describe the necessary development activities and estimate the corresponding costs. This estimation, once successful, allows software engineers to optimize the development process, improve administration and control over the project resources, reduce the risks caused by contingencies and minimize project failures (Lederer & Prasad, 1992). Subsequently, a commonly investigated approach is to accurately estimate some of the fundamental characteristics related to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the traditional software development cycle, requirements gathering is considered the most critical phase. Getting the requirements right early has become a dogma in software engineering because the correction of erroneous or incomplete requirements in later software development phases becomes overly expensive. For product-service systems (PSS), this dogma and standard requirements engineering (RE) approaches are not appropriate because classical RE is considered concluded once a product service is delivered. This paper proposes a novel framework that enables the customer and the product engineer to co-design smart products by integrating three novel and advanced technologies to support: view-based modelling, visualization and monitoring, i.e., Product-Oriented Configuration Language (PoCL), gamification and Complex Event Processing (CEP), respectively. These create a \u201cdigital-twin\u201d model of the connected \u2018smart\u2019 factory of the future. The framework is formally founded on the novel concept of manufacturing blueprints, which are formalized knowledge-intensive structures that provide the basis for actionable PSS and production \u201cintelligence\u201d and a move toward more fact-based manufacturing decisions. Implementation and validation of the proposed framework through real-life case studies are ongoing to validate the applicability, utility and efficacy of the proposed solutions.",

Hence, it is crucial to move on with a research analysis in an attempt to identify whether documentation, the most reliable source for preserving a software system\u2019s quality over the years, is properly created, updated and used in Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) operating in small EU markets, focusing both on the development process and the maintenance activities. Henceforth, the main objective of this paper is to propose a minimum documentation set required to fulfil both the Software Engineering principles and the SME practical needs by comparing literature suggestions with empirical findings. In further support of our documentation set suggestion, we present and discuss the results of a small survey conducted in nine IT-oriented SME in Cyprus and Greece. 1",

It aims, in addition, at investigating the possibilities of improvement in Greek-Turkish relations which may lead, in turn, to reducing the arms race between the two countries. The paper uses a Genetically Evolved Certainty Neuron Fuzzy Cognitive Map algorithm to consider a number of scenarios examining the possible reactions of all sides involved in the Cyprus issue, namely Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, the Turkish-Cypriot community and the international environment. All simulation exercises suggest that the Greek and the Cypriot side should not necessarily rely on the decisions taken during the Copenhagen summit conference. The forecasts point out, in addition, that the optimism of the Greek government concerning the outlook of its relations with \u2026",

The framework houses a Program Analyser and a Test Case Generator, which intercommunicate to automatically generate test cases. The Program Analyser extracts statements and variables, isolates code paths and creates control flow graphs. The Test Case Generator utilises two optimisation algorithms, the Batch-Optimistic (BO) and the Close-Up (CU), and produces a near to optimum set of test cases with respect to the edge/condition coverage criterion. The efficacy of the proposed approach is assessed on a number of programs and the empirical results indicate that its performance is significantly better compared to existing dynamic test data generation methods.",

It is very important to point out, however, that solving the Cyprus issue is not exactly a prerequisite for settling all disputes between Greece and Turkey. The Greek-Turkish relations and the Cyprus problem must be regarded as being two very important, however entirely distinct issues. It goes without saying, however, that a mutually acceptable solution to the latter will contribute to the improvement of the former to a large extent. Going back to the construction of our platform, what we have decided to do is to resort to the help of mathematics, always bearing in mind that they can be a useful servant, however a very bad master. In other words we have applied a number of mathematical techniques that have contributed just to the point at which the key determinants in this conflict are underlined thus offering a clear description of the relations between the two sides with emphasis on the issue of Cyprus. The picture thus obtained is then used for suggesting answers on a number of key questions, much more effectively, we believe, compared to the results of any panel discussion. In any case, however, the responsibility of the final decision concerning policies employed on such complicated issues certainly burdens the politicians\u2019 shoulders. As far as we are concerned, we will be happy to know that the conclusions reached in this book are taken in consideration during the decision-making process in the interest of peace.

The target is to identify groups of projects sharing similar characteristics in terms of cost attributes or descriptors, and utilise this grouping information to provide estimations of the effort needed for a new project that is classified in a certain group. The effort estimates produced address the uncertainty and fuzziness of the clustering process by yielding interval predictions based on the mean and standard deviation of the samples having strong membership within a cluster. Empirical validation of the proposed methodology was conducted using a filtered version of the ISBSG dataset and yielded encouraging results both in terms of practical usage of the clustered groups and of approximating effectively project costs.",

Reuse of existing software components is considered one of these paths. However, this process experiences significant problems related to efficiently maintaining component repositories, and, moreover, providing the means to discover and retrieve the most suitable ones. This paper aims to provide a methodology to improve the component-based software development process. Specifically, its objective is to introduce an approach that reduces the time to locate suitable software components. The suggested methodology meets the requirements for the efficient searching of components in repositories and also addresses the need for adequate retrieval of the most suitable software components based on the needs of developers.

            "Abstract": "Software cost estimation is one of the prerequisite managerial activities carried out at the software development initiation stages and also repeated throughout the whole software life-cycle so that amendments to the total cost are made. In software cost estimation typically, a selection of project attributes is employed to produce effort estimations of the expected human resources to deliver a software product. However, choosing the appropriate project cost drivers in each case requires a lot of experience and knowledge on behalf of the project manager which can only be obtained through years of software engineering practice. A number of studies indicate that popular methods applied in the literature for software cost estimation, such as linear regression, are not robust enough and do not yield accurate predictions. Recently the dual variables Ridge Regression (RR) technique has been used for effort estimation yielding promising results. In this work we show that results may be further improved if an AI method is used to automatically select appropriate project cost drivers (inputs) for the technique. We propose a hybrid approach combining RR with a Genetic Algorithm, the latter evolving the subset of attributes for approximating effort more accurately. The proposed hybrid cost model has been applied on a widely known high-dimensional dataset of software project samples and the results obtained show that accuracy may be increased if redundant attributes are eliminated.",

Cloud vendors also seek ways to study beforehand the behavior of potential users with respect to their decision to adopt the cloud environment so as to take actions towards enhancing the positive side. Therefore, the study of the parameters forming the environment behind the cloud adoption decision is of paramount importance to both users and vendors. In this context the present paper proposes a multi-layer FCM approach which models a number of factors which play a decisive role to the cloud adoption issue and offers the means to study their influence. The factors are organized in different layers which focus on specific aspects of the cloud \u2026",

The focus on the case of both countries unlike the paper mentioned above that dealt with just the Greek side provides ample room for comparative purposes regarding the determinants of defense expenditure on both sides. The results derived in terms of input significance estimation support the findings of the earlier research as indicated above, pointing to the leading role of the demographic preponderance of Turkey over Greece.  The paper also points to the fact that 10 years later, Turkey continues to set the arms race rules against its rival by determining the defense expenditure of Greece, whereas the role of the latter in affecting the military spending of Turkey is non-existent.",

            "Abstract": "The software cost estimation process is one of the most critical managerial activities related to project planning, resource allocation and control. As software development is a highly dynamic procedure, the difficulty of providing accurate cost estimations tends to increase with development complexity. The inherent problems of the estimation process stem from its dependence on several complex variables, whose values are often imprecise, unknown, or incomplete, and their interrelationships are not easy to comprehend. Current software cost estimation models do not inspire enough confidence and accuracy with their predictions. This is mainly due to the models' sensitivity to project data values, and this problem is amplified because of the vast variances found in historical project attribute data. This paper aspires to provide a framework for evolving value ranges for cost attributes and attaining mean effort values using the AI-oriented problem-solving approach of genetic algorithms, with a twofold aim. Firstly, to provide effort estimations by analogy to the projects classified in the evolved ranges and secondly, to identify any present correlations between effort and cost attributes. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

In this context, a new requirements elicitation process is proposed, a part of which utilises a short-scale ethnography analysis. The process introduces specific steps for recording HSO factors based on certain software quality characteristics that are treated as principal components for conducting requirements identification. The output of the process is the HSO document, which can be used in conjunction with the classic requirements document to identify structural and functional aspects of the system.",

The first is involved with providing efficient decision support for migrating from monolithic to service-oriented software, while the latter addresses automatic service composition, which is a special form of service migration. Migration to service-oriented architecture (SOA) is influenced by a number of different and intertwined factors. These factors are identified through literature review and expert consultation. Different CI models, such as Fuzzy Influence Diagrams and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, are employed to organize the factors and study their behavior. Various simulations are conducted that enable decision makers to execute what-if scenarios and take informed decisions as to whether to migrate or not to SOA, as well as to study the decisive factors contributing in favor or against this migration.

            "Abstract": "Reliable and accurate software cost estimations have always been a challenge especially for people involved in project resource management. The challenge is amplified due to the high level of complexity and uniqueness of the software process. The majority of estimation methods proposed fail to produce successful cost forecasting and neither resolve to explicit, measurable and concise set of factors affecting productivity. Throughout the software cost estimation literature software size is usually proposed as one of the most important attributes affecting effort and is used to build cost models. This paper aspires to provide size and effort-based estimations for the required software effort of new projects based on data obtained from past completed projects. The modelling approach utilises Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with a random sliding window input and output method using holdout samples and moreover, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) undertakes to evolve the inputs and internal hidden architectures and to reduce the Mean Relative Error (MRE). The obtained optimal ANN topologies and input and output methods for each dataset are presented, discussed and compared with a classic MLR model.",

            "Abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of software cost estimation through fuzzy decision trees, aiming at acquiring accurate and reliable effort estimates for project resource allocation and control. Two algorithms, namely CHAID and CART, are applied on empirical software cost data recorded in the ISBSG repository. Approximately 1000 project data records are selected for analysis and experimentation, with fuzzy decision trees instances being generated and evaluated based on prediction accuracy. The set of association rules extracted is used for providing mean effort value ranges. The experimental results suggest that the proposed approach may provide accurate cost predictions in terms of effort. In addition, there is strong evidence that the fuzzy transformation of cost drivers contribute to enhancing the estimation process.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, Product-Service-Systems (PSS) are being modernized into smart connected products that target to transform the industrial scenery and unlock unique prospects. This concept enforces a new technological heap and lifecycle models to support smart connected products. The intelligence that smart, connected products embed paves the way for more sophisticated data gathering and analytics capabilities ushering in tandem a new era of smarter supply and production chains, smarter production processes, and even end-to-end connected manufacturing ecosystems. The main contribution of this paper is a smart shop-floor monitoring framework and underpinning technological solutions, which enables the proactive identification and resolution of shop-floor distributions. The proposed monitoring framework is based on the synergy between the novel concept of Manufacturing Blueprints and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technologies, while it encompasses a middleware layer that enables loose coupling and adaptation in practice. The framework provides the basis for actionable PSS and production \u201cintelligence\u201d and facilitates a shift toward more fact-based manufacturing decisions. Implementation and validation of the proposed framework is performed through a real-world case study which demonstrates its applicability, and assesses the usability and efficiency of the proposed solutions.",

            "Abstract": "This paper examines the use of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) as a technique for modeling political and crisis situations and supporting the decision-making process. FCMs use notions borrowed from artificial intelligence and neural networks to combine concepts and causal relationships, in the form of dynamic models that describe a given political setting. The present work proposes the use of the Genetically Evolved Certainty Neuron Fuzzy Cognitive Map (GECNFCM) as an extension of Certainty Neuron Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (CNFCMs) aiming at overcoming the main weaknesses of the latter, namely the recalculation of the weights corresponding to each concept every time a new strategy is adopted. This novel technique combines CNFCMs with Genetic Algorithms (GAs), the advantage of which lies with their ability to offer the optimal solution without a problem-solving strategy, once the requirements are defined. We demonstrate the value of such a hybrid technique in the context of a model reflecting the complexity of the Cyprus problem. The scenario analysis performed makes decision makers aware of political uncertainties, while multiple scenario analysis brings uncertainty into the decision process by combining it with different future states.",

Reuse of existing software components is considered one of these paths. However, this process experiences significant problems related to efficiently maintaining component repositories, and, moreover, providing the means to discover and retrieve the most suitable ones. This paper aims to provide a methodology to improve the component-based software development process. Specifically, its objective is to introduce an approach that reduces the time to locate suitable software components. The suggested methodology meets the requirements for the efficient searching of components in repositories and also addresses the need for adequate retrieval of the most suitable software components based on the needs of developers. To achieve this we employ a combination of partitional clustering algorithms borrowed from the field of computational intelligence and fuzzy logic thus creating a subset of the available components that are most suitable to the developers' preferences. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

Mutation testing refers to the application of mutation operators on correctly functioning programs so as to induce common programming errors and then assess the ability of a set of test cases to reveal them. In the above context the present paper introduces a novel methodology for identifying and correcting faults in Java source code using dynamic slicing coupled with mutation testing and enhanced by Genetic Algorithms. A series of experiments was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, using different types of errors and sample programs. The results were quite encouraging as regards the ability of the approach to localise the faults, as well as to suggest the appropriate correction (s) to eliminate them.",

            "Abstract": "Component-based software engineering is a stepwise software development process that relies on integrating small, independent software pieces into one larger fully-functioning system. However, a delay in any of the steps may negatively affect a project\u2019s schedule and, even worse, jeopardise its completion. Furthermore, given that the process is ultimately evaluation-oriented it is very difficult to find ways to accelerate certain stages in the process since developers are unwilling to compromise quality over time. Consequently, the only substantial means of reducing development time is to make components more easily and readily accessible to reusers in order to shorten the time taken for locating them. For this reason, component repositories have been introduced to store and organise software components. However, with an ever-increasing number of components, covering a wider variety of functionalities, there has been a parallel increase in the need for techniques to search and retrieve software components from repositories. Thus, the main motive of the research activity discussed in this chapter is to attempt to minimise the time necessary to discover any or all of the components to be reused in a component-based system by proposing an intelligent clustering methodology to aid the searching and retrieval of components stored in a repository.To date there has been a number of attempts for clustering and classifying software components for reuse which have lead to the formation of various techniques. Several of these rely on structuring a formal specification of software components using classification methods based on natural language \u2026",

A new methodology performing a certain form of requirements identification and collection prior to developing new software components is proposed and demonstrated, the essence of which lays on a three-entity model that describes the relationship between different types of component stakeholders: Developers, reusers and end-users. The model is supported by a set of critical factors analysed in the context of three main directions that orient the production of a new component, that is, the generality of the services offered, the management approach and the characteristics of the targeted market. The investigation of the three directions produces critical success factors that are closely connected and interdependent. Further analysis of the significance of each factor according to the priorities set by component developers can provide a detail picture of potential management implications during the development process and more importantly can support management decisions related to if and how development should proceed.",

To do so we have resorted to evaluating the optimal military expenditure for the two countries, allied in the context of the Integrated Defence Doctrine, which is compatible with the constraints imposed by the resources of their economies. All experiments and scenarios examined lead to the conclusion that the current defence burden of the two allies seems to be driving their economies beyond capacity limits. The fact remains, however, that under the circumstances, a one-sided disarmament policy like the one currently followed by Greece, is a risky choice given that the long-term armament programmes pursued by Turkey, whose role in this arms race has been proven as leading, leave very small room to the Greek and Cypriot sides to reduce their own defence expenditure.",

This paper addresses the issue of estimating the cost of software development by identifying the need for countable entities that affect software cost and using them with artificial neural networks to establish a reliable estimation method. Input Sensitivity Analysis (ISA) is performed on predictive models of the Desharnais and ISBSG datasets aiming at identifying any correlation present between important cost parameters at the input level and development effort (output). The degree to which the input parameters define the evolution of effort is then investigated and the selected attributes are employed to establish accurate prediction of software cost in the early phases of the software development life-cycle.",

            "Abstract": "Accurate software cost estimation has always been a major concern especially for people involved in project management, resource control and schedule planning. A high-quality and reliable development effort estimate could provide more efficient planning and control over the whole software process and guide a project to success. As literature shows many researchers proposed a plethora of methods and techniques to model the relationship between software size and the actual development costs (J\u00f8rgensen & Shepperd, 2007). However, the track record of IT projects shows that often a large number fails. Most IT experts agree that such failures occur more regularly than they should (Charette, 2005). According to the 10th edition of the annual CHAOS report from the Standish Group that studied over 40,000 projects in 10 years, it seems that success rates increased to 34% and failures declined to 15% of the projects. Even though success rates increased, still, 51% of the projects overrun time/budget, lack critical features and requirements and/or important quality requirements are compromised. Furthermore, average software costs are apparently overrun by 43%(Software Magazine, 2004). One of the main reasons for these figures is failure to estimate the actual effort required to develop a software project. A reliable software cost estimation model has always been a major challenge and demand for project managers at the initiation phase of the project and also an important asset for the whole process of software development. In addition, there is a large discussion on the discovery of the relationship between cost drivers and effort, especially \u2026",

The proposed framework utilizes a special form of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to define and assess critical business and organizational factors within small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) whishing to go ecommerce. This set of factors is enriched with other critical issues belonging to the quality requirements of the system and to the application type of services it aspires to offer. The set of critical factors identified is used to estimate the average complexity level of the system using numerical values to describe the contribution of each factor to the overall complexity.

Our proposed approach consists in treating the network recurrent units as stochastic latent variables with a prior distribution imposed over them. On this basis, we proceed to infer corresponding posteriors; these can be used for prediction and recommendation generation, in a way that accounts for the uncertainty in the available sparse training data.

Prior work: Listed companies from different countries have divergent disclosure policies and regulations which create challenges. On the one hand, professional accountants find difficulties in the auditing and reporting process, while on the other hand investors are struggling to comprehend and compare annual reports. Approach: This study is mainly based on a mixed method approach, and involves gathering data from a group of specialists in the accounting field and a group of investors in the Cypriot stock market. Results: Investors and professional accountants agree that the reporting framework can be considered as adequate both in terms of quality and quantity. Implications: Despite the fact that the current accounting principles are perceived to be adequate in the eyes of investors and professional accountants, there is still space for improvement and a requisite for disclosures of non-financial information. Value: The information provided by accountants and investors alike is helpful towards reforming and developing an enriched disclosure era in financial reports so as to meet decision maker needs under the current financial crisis.",

This work proposes a complete software testing framework that utilizes a series of specially designed genetic algorithms to generate automatically test data with reference to the edge/condition testing coverage criterion. The framework utilizes a program analyzer, which examines the program's source code and builds dynamically program models for automatic testing, and a test data generation system that utilizes genetic algorithms to search the input space and determine a near to optimum set of test cases with respect to the testing coverage criterion. The performance of the framework is evaluated on a pool of programs consisting of both standard and random-generated programs. Finally, the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The fact that Cloud Computing is steadily becoming one of the most significant fields of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has led many organizations to consider the benefits of migrating their business operations to the Cloud. Decision makers are facing strong challenges when assessing the feasibility of the adoption of Cloud Computing for their organizations. Cloud adoption is a multi-level decision which is influenced by a number of intertwined factors and concerns thus characterizing it as a complex and difficult to model real-world problem. In this paper we propose two decision support modeling approaches based on Influence Diagrams (ID) aiming to model the answer to the question \u201cAdopt Cloud Services or Not?\u201d Two models are developed and tested, the first is a generic ID with nodes interacting in a probabilistic manner, while the second is a more flexible version that utilizes Fuzzy Logic \u2026",

This paper presents a formal semantics for the basic use case model elements, including specific semantic types of use cases, specific types of basic and alternative flow actions, and specific functional roles actors can play. To maintain a high-degree of readability and understandability and to minimize ambiguity, the proposed approach provides a semi-formal, NL-based specification syntax, tailored to each semantic use case type, with a specific sequence of basic and alternative flow actions. The formalization is facilitated by utilizing elements of a novel methodology named Natural Language Syntax and Semantics Requirements Engineering.",

            "Abstract": "Reliable and accurate software cost estimations have always been a challenge especially for people involved in project resource management. The challenge is amplified due to the high level of complexity and uniqueness of the software process. The majority of estimation methods proposed fail to produce successful cost forecasting and neither resolve to explicit, measurable and concise set of factors affecting productivity. Throughout the software cost estimation literature software size is usually proposed as one of the most important attributes affecting effort and is used to build cost models. This paper aspires to provide size and effort-based estimations for the required software effort of new projects based on data obtained from past completed projects. The modelling approach utilises Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with a random sliding window input and output method using holdout samples and moreover, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) undertakes to evolve the inputs and internal hidden architectures and to reduce the Mean Relative Error (MRE). The obtained optimal ANN topologies and input and output methods for each dataset are presented, discussed and compared with a classic MLR model.",

The idea behind selecting the most informative subset of features from a pool of available cost drivers stems from the hypothesis that reducing the dimensionality of datasets will significantly minimise the complexity and time required to reach to an estimation using a particular modelling technique. This work investigates the appropriateness of attributes, obtained from empirical project databases and aims to reduce the cost drivers used while preserving performance. Finding suitable subset selections that may cater improved predictions may be considered as a pre-processing step of a particular technique employed for cost estimation (filter or wrapper) or an internal (embedded) step to minimise the fitting error. This paper compares nine relatively popular feature selection methods and uses the empirical values of selected attributes recorded in the ISBSG and Desharnais datasets to estimate software development effort.",

More specifically, most used methods have not been explicitly designed to tackle the problem of metrics-driven software defect counts prediction, thus postulating irrelevant assumptions, such as (log-)linearity of the modeled data.

When a user wishes to trace a component he/she identifies the desired characteristics (component profile) which are then compared with the characteristics of the available classifiers. The closest classifier matching the required characteristics over a user-defined threshold will result in the \"winning\" set of components belonging to its cluster, which are presented to the user in descending matching fitness.

As software development is a highly dynamic procedure, the difficulty of providing accurate cost estimations tends to increase with development complexity. The inherent problems of the estimation process stem from its dependence on several complex variables, whose values are often imprecise, unknown, or incomplete, and their interrelationships are not easy to comprehend. Current software cost estimation models do not inspire enough confidence and accuracy with their predictions.

This set of factors is enriched with other critical issues belonging to the quality requirements of the system and to the application type of services it aspires to offer. The set of critical factors identified is used to estimate the average complexity level of the system using numerical values to describe the contribution of each factor to the overall complexity.

Various experiments and scenarios have been tested leading to the general conclusion that the defence expenditure in both allied countries seems to be driving their economies beyond capacity limits. This, however, by no means justifies the one sided disarmament policy currently followed by Greece, since the long-term armament programmes pursued by Turkey, the role of which in this arms race has been proven as leading, leave very small room to the Greek and Cypriot sides to reduce their defence expenditures.",

The decentralized application proposed exposes the various design challenges that programmers are likely to face when realizing the implementation of the application. The proposed methodolog y utilises the implementation of a dedicated smart contract that was developed based on a special-purpose structure for satisfying the requirements of the usecase. The evaluation was based on the execution of each of the functions measuring the gas costs and execution time. The prototype design was deployed and evaluated on a real-world Blockchain framework and can be considered as a first solution to how the Blockchain technolog y can be utilized within Logistics to overcome any barriers that may exist between professionals. In this paper we present a real implementation of a smart contract for the Logistics industry. The proposed dApp provides a live example of how Blockchain can be utilized within Logistics as it enables users to send and track products.",

Project managers must decide who will do what and when in a software project, with the aim of minimizing both its duration and cost. However, project managers often struggle to efficiently allocate developers and schedule tasks in a way that balances these conflicting goals. Furthermore, the different criteria used to select developers could lead to inaccurate estimation of the duration and cost of tasks, resulting in budget overruns, delays, or reduced software quality. This paper proposes an approach that makes use of multi-objective optimization to handle the simultaneous minimization of project cost and duration, taking into account several productivity-related attributes for better estimation of task duration and cost.

The model proposed involves an assessment tool based on basic negotiation elements\u2013namely relationship, interests, cost and time\u2013quantifying the influences among each other, and makes use of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) for developing the associations around basic risk elements on one hand and attaining an innovative risk quantification model for improved software negotiations on the other.

The present work aspires to eliminate the weaknesses of the existing ML-FCM algorithm, which reside in the way activation levels are calculated for those concepts decomposed into a set of parameters at lower layers in the map. The current algorithm calculates these levels by completing a full iteration cycle at the lower level thus losing the information produced between the iterative steps. We attempt to solve this problem by introducing the Enhanced ML-FCM algorithm, (EML-FCM) which allows calculations in-between iterations and takes into consideration the change of activation levels in a more detailed form. The strong features of the proposed EML-FCM algorithm are presented and discussed, in addition to the provision of a comparison between the two algorithms. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

Conceiving a RS primarily as a selfcontained or part of a Web-application, the present paper utilizes the SpiderWeb methodology and takes into account important requirements that result from human, cultural, social and organizational factors (HSCO) so as to drive the RS development activities.",

Our approach is based on the well-known Ridge Regression technique, but instead of the simple effort estimates produced by the original method, it produces predictive intervals that satisfy a given confidence level. The results obtained using the proposed algorithm on the COCOMO, Desharnais and ISBSG datasets suggest a quite successful performance obtaining reliable predictive intervals which are narrow enough to be useful in practice.",

Although many software systems are being designed and developed from scratch, a significant number of existing monolithic solutions tend to be transformed to this new architectural style. What is less common, though, is how to migrate component-based software systems to systems composed of microservices and enjoy the benefits of ease of changes, rapid deployment and versatile architecture. This paper proposes a novel and integrated process for the decomposition of existing software components with the aim being to fully or partially replace their functional parts with by a number of suitable and available microservices. The proposed process is built on semi-formal profiling and utilizes ontologies to match between properties of the decomposed functions of the component and those offered by microservices residing in a repository. Matching concludes with recommended solutions yielded by multi-objective optimization which considers also possible dependencies between the functional parts.",

Mutation testing refers to the application of mutation operators on correctly functioning programs so as to induce common programming errors and then assess the ability of a set of test cases to reveal them. In the above context the present paper introduces a novel methodology for identifying and correcting faults in Java source code using dynamic slicing coupled with mutation testing and enhanced by Genetic Algorithms. A series of experiments was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, using different types of errors and sample programs. The results were quite encouraging as regards the ability of the approach to localise the faults, as well as to suggest the appropriate correction(s) to eliminate them.",

The dynamic behaviour of a system focuses on a stable behaviour reaching equilibrium state at fixed points. Multicollinearity in FCMs, is examined as a phenomenon possibly present in any dynamic modelling. Cases in which the activation level of a concept is constantly driven towards +1 or -1 are investigated. In addition, concepts stabilizing at levels other than those reflecting the actual environment are also considered. These experiments are performed by selectively inserting bias nodes in the map so as to increase the reliability of the dynamic model. Following the theoretical background of FCMs and the mathematical formulation of bias nodes we demonstrate their use and contribution in terms of a case study that deals with the Cyprus Issue in view of the Turkish full EU membership.",

M-Commerce services and applications can be adopted through different wireless and mobile networks, with the aid of several mobile devices. However, constraints of both mobile networks and devices influence their operational performance; therefore, there is a strong need for taking into consideration those constraints in the design and development phases of m-Commerce services and applications. Another important factor in designing m-Commerce services and applications is the identification of mobile users requirements. Furthermore, m-Commerce services and applications need to be classified based on the functionality they provide to the mobile users. This kind of classification results in two major classes: the directory and the transaction-oriented services and applications.

The high forecasting performance permitted the application of alternative scenarios for predicting the impact of the Greek\u2010Turkish arms race on the relative security of the Greek\u2010Cypriot alliance.",

Especially when trying to produce accurate and reliable software cost estimates, these difficulties are amplified due to the high level of complexity and uniqueness of the software process. This paper addresses the issue of estimating the cost of software development by identifying the need for countable entities that affect software cost and using them with artificial neural networks to establish a reliable estimation method. Input Sensitivity Analysis (ISA) is performed on predictive models of the Desharnais and ISBSG datasets aiming at identifying any correlation present between important cost parameters at the input level and development effort (output). The degree to which the input parameters define the evolution of effort is then investigated and the selected attributes are employed to establish accurate prediction of software cost in the early phases of the software development life-cycle.",

The fuzzification process is primarily based on producing fuzzy information provided by a group of experts. Each concept is analyzed into trapezoidal membership functions of either fixed or variable widths, with these intervals labeled and stored for the defuzzification process later on, during which the levels are matched according to the membership functions of each concept. The defuzzification process is more complicated than the fuzzification one and consists of four basic iterative stages: The Iteration, the Max-Min Average Computation, the Categorization and, finally, the Realization Inference Stage.",

The easy distribution of applications on online markets like App Store and Google Play makes their development very tempting for developers who move from traditional software to mobile applications. As with desktop systems, mobile application developers face a number of difficult decisions that need to take prior to and during the development process. This paper proposes a decision support model based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps that assists developers to assess whether they should go ahead and develop a mobile application or not based on a number of factors and specifications. In fact the map models the outcome of the complex interaction between competing factors and estimates which ones will finally prevail. A validation process with realistic and real-world cases proved that the model performs quite successfully.",

The formalization is achieved by utilizing elements of natural language syntax and semantics, with the focus being on keeping ambiguities low and expressiveness high.

In order to support the above different growing application fields we created a combined real-time and store and forward facility that consists of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit. This integrated system: can be used when handling emergency cases in ambulances, RHC or ships by using a mobile telemedicine unit at the emergency site and a base unit at the hospital-expert's site, enhances intensive health care provision by giving a mobile base unit to the ICU doctor while the telemedicine unit remains at the ICU patient site and enables home telemonitoring, by installing the telemedicine unit at the patient's home while the base unit remains at the physician's office or hospital. The system allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3\u201312 lead ECG, SPO2, NIBP, IBP, Temp) and still images of the patient. The transmission is performed through GSM mobile telecommunication network, through satellite links (where GSM is not available) or through Plain Old Telephony Systems (POTS) where available.

            "Abstract": "In the traditional software development cycle, requirements gathering is considered the most critical phase. Getting the requirements right early has become a dogma in software engineering because the correction of erroneous or incomplete requirements in later software development phases becomes overly expensive. For product-service systems (PSS), this dogma and standard requirements engineering (RE) approaches are not appropriate because classical RE is considered concluded once a product service is delivered. This paper proposes a novel framework that enables the customer and the product engineer to co-design smart products by integrating three novel and advanced technologies to support: view-based modelling, visualization and monitoring, i.e., Product-Oriented Configuration Language (PoCL), gamification and Complex Event Processing (CEP), respectively. These create a \u201cdigital-twin\u201d model of the connected \u2018smart\u2019 factory of the future. The framework is formally founded on the novel concept of manufacturing blueprints, which are formalized knowledge-intensive structures that provide the basis for actionable PSS and production \u201cintelligence\u201d and a move toward more fact-based manufacturing decisions. Implementation and validation of the proposed framework through real-life case studies are ongoing to validate the applicability, utility and efficacy of the proposed solutions.",

In particular, with the use of our approach, formalization of the stage for identifying the use case elements is achieved with the use of predefined types of use cases and actors, specific guidelines to define associations, relationships and business rules, and formalized sentential patterns. Formalization and clarity of the use case specification is achieved with the use of specific types of actions and guidelines, on one hand, and natural language-based authoring rules, on the other.

Despite the uniqueness and unpredictability of the software processes, people involved in project resource management have always been striving for acquiring reliable and accurate software cost estimations. The difficulty of finding a concise set of factors affecting productivity is amplified due to the dependence on the nature of products, the people working on the project and the cultural environment in which software is built and thus effort estimations are still considered a challenge. This paper aims to provide size-and effort-based cost estimations required for the development of new software projects utilising data obtained from previously completed projects. The modelling approach employs different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) topologies and input/output schemes selected heuristically, which target at capturing the dynamics of cost behavior as this is expressed by the available data attributes. The ANNs are enhanced by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) whose role is to evolve the network architectures (both input and internal hidden layers) by reducing the Mean Relative Error (MRE) produced by the output results of each network.",

            "Abstract": "Supermarket customers find it difficult to choose from a large variety of products or be informed for the latest offers that exist in a store based on the items that they need or wish to purchase. This paper presents a framework for a Recommender System deployed in a supermarket setting with the aim of suggesting real-Time personalized offers to customers. As customers navigate in a store, iBeacons push personalized notifications to their smart-devices informing them about offers that are likely to be of interest. The suggested approach combines an Entropy-based algorithm, a Hard k-modes clustering and a Bayesian Inference approach to notify customers about the best offers based on their shopping preferences. The proposed methodology improves the customer's overall shopping experience by suggesting personalized items with accuracy and efficiency. Simultaneously, the properties of the underlying techniques used by the proposed framework tackle the data sparsity, the cold-start problem and other scalability issues that are often met in Recommender Systems. A preliminary setup in a local supermarket confirms the validity of the proposed methodology, in terms of accuracy, outperforming the traditional Collaborative Filtering approaches of user-based and item-based.",

Deciding which method to use for achieving accurate cost estimations among the many methods proposed in the relevant literature is a significant issue for project managers. This paper investigates whether it is possible to improve the accuracy of estimations produced by popular non-parametric techniques by coupling them with a linear component, thus producing a new set of techniques called semi-parametric models (SPMs). The non-parametric models examined in this work include estimation by analogy (EbA), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and locally weighted regression (LOESS).

The time period between the two papers contributes to the reliability of the results derived, not just by increasing the number of observations, but mainly by incorporating the progress made in the realm of Artificial Intelligence. The focus on the case of both counties unlike the paper mentioned above which dealt with just the Greek side provides ample room for comparative purposes regarding the determinants of defence spending on both sides.  The results derived in terms of input significance estimation support the findings of earlier research as indicated above, pointing to the leading role of the demographic preponderance of Turkey over Greece. The paper also points to the fact that ten years later, Turkey continues to set the arms race rules against its rival by determining the defence expenditure of Greece while the role of the latter in affecting the military spending of Turkey is non-existent.",

To this end, we improve upon systems that utilize deep learning techniques with recurrently connected units; we do so by adopting concepts from the field of Bayesian statistics, namely variational inference. Our proposed approach consists in treating the network recurrent units as stochastic latent variables with a prior distribution imposed over them. On this basis, we proceed to infer corresponding posteriors; these can be used for prediction generation, in a way that accounts for the uncertainty in the available sparse training data.

In fact any further decreases will have a direct impact on the security of the country given the dramatic reduction of the defence budget and the arms race against Turkey. By contrast, any increases will only burden the balance of payments without adding to the GDP, once the bulk of the defence equipment is imported due to the inefficiency of the domestic defence industrial base.

In this work, risk quantification is proposed to translate its impact to measurable values that may be taken into consideration during negotiations. The model proposed involves an assessment tool based on basic negotiation elements - namely relationship, interests, cost and time - quantifying the influences among each other, and makes use of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) for developing the associations around basic risk elements on one hand and attaining an innovative risk quantification model for improved software negotiations on the other.
