This massive-scale data generation has posed new challenges in the data management community in terms of storing, querying, analyzing, and extracting knowledge out of such data. Knowledge discovery out of mobility data is essentially the goal of every mobility data analytics task. Especially in the maritime and aviation domains, this relates to challenging use-case scenarios, such as discovering valuable behavioral patterns of moving objects, identifying different types of activities in a region of interest, environmental fingerprint, etc. In order to be able to support such scenarios, an analyst should be able to apply, at massive scale, several knowledge discovery techniques, such as trajectory clustering, hotspot analysis, and frequent route \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Spatial-keyword queries are important for a wide range of applications that retrieve data based on a combination of keyword search and spatial constraints. However, efficient processing of spatial-keyword queries is not a trivial task because the combination of textual and spatial data results in a high-dimensional representation that is challenging to index effectively. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel indexing scheme for efficient support of spatial-keyword range queries. At the heart of our approach lies a carefully-designed mapping of spatio-textual data to a two-dimensional (2D) space that produces compact partitions of spatio-textual data. In turn, the mapped 2D data can be indexed effectively by traditional spatial data structures, such as an R-tree. We propose bounds, theoretically proven for correctness, that lead to the design of a filter-and-refine algorithm that prunes the search space \u2026",

Thus, despite recent progresses in trajectory handling, there is still a gap between movement data and formal semantics. This gap hinders movement analyses benefiting from available knowledge, with well-defined and widely agreed semantics. This article describes the Baquara2 framework to help narrow this gap by exploiting knowledge bases to semantically enrich and analyze movement data. It provides an ontological model for structuring and abstracting movement data in a multilevel hierarchy of progressively detailed movement segments that generalize concepts such as trajectories, stops, and moves. Baquara2 also includes a general customizable process to annotate movement data with concepts and objects described in ontologies and Linked Open Data (LOD) collections.

An interesting and challenging query type over existentially uncertain data is the search of the Nearest Neighbor (NN), since the probability of a potential dataset object to be the NN of the query object depends on the locations and probabilities of other points in the same dataset. In this paper, following a statistical approach, we estimate the average number of the NNs required to answer probabilistic thresholding NN (PTNN) queries as function of the threshold t, allowing us to utilize existing approaches and propose a cost model for such queries. Based on the same statistical approach, we propose an efficient algorithm for PTNN queries over arbitrarily structured existentially uncertain spatial data. Our experimental study demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed techniques.",

We also develop one-pass heuristics to eliminate inherent noise and provide reliable trajectory representations.

Extracting knowledge from TD using certain types of mining techniques, such as clustering and classification, impose that there is a mean to quantify the distance between two trajectories. Having as a main objective the support of effective similarity query processing, existing approaches utilize generic distance metrics that ignore the peculiarities of the trajectories as complex spatio-temporal data types.

In this paper, we assume that the majority of the information that exists in the mobility dataset must remain private and the data has to stay in-house to the hosting organization. To facilitate privacy-aware sharing of the mobility data we develop a trajectory query engine that allows subscribed users to gain restricted access to the database to accomplish various analysis tasks. The proposed engine (i) audits queries for trajectory data to block potential attacks to user privacy,(ii) supports range, distance, and k-nearest neighbors spatial and spatiotemporal queries, and (iii) preserves user anonymity in answers to queries by (a) augmenting the real trajectories \u2026",

In this paper, we address the problem of Distributed Subtrajectory Clustering in an efficient and highly scalable way. The problem is challenging because the subtrajectories to be clustered are not known in advance, but they need to be discovered dynamically based on adjacent subtrajectories in space and time.

            "Abstract": "The current Air Traffic Management (ATM) system worldwide is managing a high (and growing) amount of demand that sometimes leads to demand-capacity balancing (DCB) issues. These further impose limitations to the ATM system that are resolved via airspace management or flow management solutions, including regulations that generate delays (and costs) for the entire system. These demand-capacity imbalances are difficult to predict in the pre-tactical phase (prior to operation), as the existing ATM information is not accurate enough during this phase. With the aim of overcoming these drawbacks, the ATM system is moving towards a new, trajectory-based operations (TBO) paradigm, where the trajectory becomes the cornerstone upon which the ATM capabilities rely on. This transformation, however, requires reliable information available in pre-tactical phase or, at least, high-fidelity aircraft trajectory prediction capabilities to reach sufficient levels of confidence in the available planning information.In this scenario, the DART (Data-driven Aircraft Trajectory Prediction Research) project from SESAR 2020 Exploratory Research aims at reaching this goal, by means of machine learning and agent-based modeling methods in two different operational use cases: trajectory prediction and demand-capacity balancing. This paper presents the machine learning approach followed, as well as the promising results already achieved by the project.",

More specifically, as prescribed also in D1. 1, in addition to the approach of data anonymization by concurrent adherence to the privacy-bydesign principles, we employ a more conservative approach by assuming that the majority of the information that is captured in the mobility dataset must remain private and that the data has to stay in-house to the hosting organization. Following this approach, in order to ensure privacy-aware sharing of in-house mobility data, a mechanism is necessary to control the information that is made available to external parties when they query the database, so that only non-sensitive information leaves the premises of the hosting organization. This section presents an overview of the privacy-aware \u2018skin\u2019of Hermessem, called Hermessem++, for handling data privacy aspects.Most of the proposed approaches for movement analysis are mainly focused on the raw spatiotemporal features of trajectories stemming from GPS devices. However, the increasing progress of mobile technology along with the interest of understanding human mobile behavior has led to the creation of more complex representations of trajectory data. Raw trajectory data are enriched with conceptual knowledge conducting more meaningful and comprehensible abstractions of mobility data. This alternative representation of trajectories may pose even greater privacy violation threats.

Spatio-temporal Database Management Systems (STDBMS) are able to process, manage and analyze spatio-temporal data. Spatial TAU 1 (STAU), developed in [Pel02], provides spatio-temporal functionality to Oracle10g Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS). Although STAU is designed in a way that it can also be used as a pure temporal or a pure spatial system, its main functionality is to support modeling and querying of moving objects. Such a collection of data types and their corresponding operations are defined, developed and provided as a data cartridge using the extensibility interface of Oracle10g. This paper presents HERMES Moving Data Cartridge (HERMES-MDC), the core component of STAU system architecture. HERMES-MDC integrates two other data cartridges, namely the TAU temporal data cartridge and Oracle\u2019s spatial data cartridge. It introduces time-varying geometries that change their position and/or extent in space and time dimension, either discretely or continuously. HERMES-MDC extends PL/SQL, the data definition and manipulation language of Oracle10g, with spatio-temporal semantics. The resulted query language is applied to a case study related with truck motion analysis formulating a benchmarking framework for the evaluation of next generation fleet management systems.",

The clustering of the feature space is realized by an expectation-maximization algorithm that uses an iterative approach to automatically determine the number of clusters. Then, the 2-component property of PANDA is exploited: the similarity between two clusters is estimated as a function of the similarity of both their structures and the measure components.

Current approaches group trajectories together by accounting only the degree of their similarity, ignoring at the same time the degree in which they are unrelated and more importantly the hesitancy introduced by the uncertainty. In this paper we study the effect of uncertainty on clustering TD, as well as the representation of the clusters and introduce a three-step approach to deal with this challenge. Firstly, we propose an intuitionistic point vector representation of trajectories that encompasses the underlying uncertainty and we introduce an effective distance metric to cope with uncertainty. At the second step, we devise CenTra, a novel algorithm which tackles the problem of discovering the Centroid Trajectory of a group of movements taking into advantage the local similarity between portions of trajectories. At the final step, we devise CenTR-I-FCM a variant of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm, appropriately modified in the context of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) theory, which embodies CenTra as its update procedure when producing the cluster centroids at each iteration. The experimental evaluation with real world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.",

Thus, it can offer timely notification in emergency situations, such as intrusion into marine preservation areas, loitering, and unsafe sailing. Thanks to a mobility tracking module, evolving trajectories generated by massive positional updates can be compressed online into concise, but reliable synopses per ship, retaining only salient motion features within a sliding window. These features are exploited by a complex event recognition module that detects suspicious situations of interest to maritime authorities. We conducted a comprehensive empirical validation against a real dataset of traces collected from thousands of vessels. Our results confirm the scalability and approximation accuracy of the proposed system, and thus demonstrate its potential for effective, real-time maritime monitoring.",

            "Abstract": "Conventional Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems make use of similarity measures estimated directly from low-level image features, involving multidimensional and exhaustive, nearest neighbor searching. In this paper we present an image retrieval methodology suited for efficient search in cultural heritage images that utilizes similarity measures defined over higher-level patterns associated with clusters of low-level image features. The similarity between two patterns is estimated as a function of the similarity between both the structure and the measure components of the patterns. We evaluate our system using cultural heritage images derived from the repository of the Foundation of Hellenic World (FHW). For the experiments we use Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and contrast distributions as image features and the results show that the proposed pattern-based approach efficiently retrieves images compared to commonly employed methods.",

MOD management systems support storage and query processing of non-static spatial objects and provide essential operations for higher level analysis of movement data. The goal of this paper is to present HERMES MOD engine that supports the afore-mentioned functionality through appropriate data types and methods in Object-Relational DBMS (ORDBMS) environments. In particular, HERMES exploits on the extensibility interface of ORDBMS that already have extensions for static spatial data types and methods that follow the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard, and extends the ORDBMS by supporting time-varying geometries that change their position and/or extent in space and time dimensions, either discretely or continuously. It further extends the data definition and manipulation language of the ORDBMS with spatio-temporal semantics and functionality based on advanced spatio-temporal indexing and query processing techniques. Its implementation over two ORDBMSs and its utilization in various domains proves the expressive power and applicability of HERMES in different application domains where knowledge regarding movement data of an organization is essential. As a proof-of-concept, in this paper HERMES is applied to a case study related with vehicle traffic analysis.",

So far, the proposed compression techniques are not designed for network constrained moving objects, while map matching algorithms do not consider compression issues.

Due to the need of extracting useful knowledge patterns that improve services based on users\u2019 and customers\u2019 behavior, querying and mining such databases has gained significant attention in recent years. Existing approaches for privacy-aware mobility data sharing aim at publishing an anonymized version of the mobility dataset, operating under the assumption that most of the information in the original dataset can be disclosed without causing any privacy violations. In this paper, we assume that the majority of the information that exists in the mobility dataset must remain private and the data has to stay inhouse to the hosting organization. To facilitate privacy-aware sharing of the mobility data we develop a trajectory query engine that allows subscribed users to gain restricted access to the database to accomplish various analytic tasks. The proposed engine (i) audits queries for trajectory data to block potential attacks to user privacy,(ii) supports range, distance, and k-nearest neighbor spatial and spatiotemporal queries, and (iii) preserves user anonymity in answers to queries by (a) returning a set of carefully crafted, realistic fakes trajectories, and (b) ensuring that no user-specific sensitive locations are reported as part of the returned trajectories. Along this direction, we also present Private-HERMES, a platform that provides a two-dimension benchmark framework that includes:(i) the aforementioned privacy-aware trajectory query engine and (ii) a progressive analysis framework, which, apart from anonymization methods for data publishing, includes various well \u2026",

For example, in both mature (transportation, climatology, zoology, etc.) and emerging domains, such as mobile social networks, scientists work with mobility (mostly GPS) data, resulting in Moving Object Databases (MOD) consisting of trajectories of moving objects. Although during the last decade, there have been significant achievements in the field [13], researchers continuously call for new methods aiming at deeper comprehension and analysis of mobility data.In the literature of mobility data mining one can identify several types of mining models used to describe various collective behavioral patterns. As such, there are works that propose classification schemes for trajectory data [28], identify various types of clusters of moving objects [12][31][27][38], moving clusters [30][22], sequential trajectory patterns [14], flocks [5], convoys [21], swarms [29], outliers [26] and others.",

Despite an increase in traffic and national monitoring, ships formulate routes according to their best judgment risking an accident. In this study we take a dataset spanning in 3 years from the AIS (Automatic Identification System) network, which is transmitting in public a ship's identity and location with an interval of seconds, and we load it in a trajectory database supported by the Hermes Moving Objects Database (MOD) system. Presented analysis begins by extracting statistics for the dataset, both general (number of ships and position reports) as well as safety related ones. Simple queries on the dataset illustrate the capabilities of Hermes and allow to gain insight on how the ships move in the Greek Seas. Analysis of movement based on an Origin-Destination matrix between interesting areas in the Greek territory is presented. One of the newest challenges that emerged during this process is that the amount of the positioning data is becoming more and more massive. As a conclusion, a preliminary review of possible solutions to this challenge along with others such as dealing with the noise in AIS data is mentioned and we also briefly discuss the need for interdisciplinary cooperation.",

METHOD Analysis was made of the annual detailed financial, operational and patient data as recorded by the ESY. net web application, for 129 Greek National Health System (NHS) hospitals. Four KPIs were calculated based on the hospital financial and patient data. The indicators were then adjusted to the case mix (ie, clinical workload) of the units, using a hospital clinical weight (HCW) indicator based on the DRG data. RESULTSSignificant changes in the KPIs resulted from adjustment according to DRG, in both percentages and the relative ranking of hospitals as efficient and inefficient. After adjustment, improvement in indicators and relative ranking was observed for hospitals with more severe than average incidents, such as cancer hospitals, cardiac surgery centers, etc., but also for some general hospitals and health centers, while other small health centers and regional hospitals ranked lower after adjustment.

            "Abstract": "Trillions of bytes of information are being collected by companies about their customers, suppliers, and operations. Devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, smart energy meters, automobiles, industrial machines, carry millions of networked sensors which create huge portions of data that are channeled in the Internet of Things (IoT). In addition, the massive participation of individuals on social networking sites will continue to fuel exponential data growth. Hence, the enormous amount of data being produced in our world during the last decades has posed new challenges in the world of data management. Various methods and technologies have been developed and adapted in order to store, manage, analyze, and visualize the complex vast quantities of data in an efficient way. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the concept of Big Data management and, then, we highlight interesting works made so far \u2026",

A cornerstone facilitator for performing mobility analytics at scale is the availability of big data processing frameworks and techniques tailored for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Motivated by this pressing need, in this paper, we provide a survey of big data processing frameworks for mobility analytics. Particular focus is put on the underlying techniques; indexing, partitioning, query processing are essential for enabling efficient and scalable data management. In this way, this report serves as a useful guide of state-of-the-art methods and modern techniques for scalable mobility data management and analytics.",

Subsequently, a separate predictive model is trained for each cluster, using a nonuniform graph-based grid that is formed by the waypoints of each flight plan.

For decades, spatial information has been studied thoroughly; from Cartography and Geodesy to Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Spatial Database Management Systems (SDBMS); this is justified due to its importance and ubiquity in our everyday lives. Database community has followed the paradigm of extended DBMS and provided inherent spatial functionality in geographical data collections by developing spatial data types, operators and methods for querying, as well as indexing techniques. At the exploration level, multi-dimensional online analytical processing (OLAP) and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) have attracted excellent results at the spatial domain.

Therefore, compression techniques are inevitable also in the field of moving object databases. Related work is relatively limited and mainly driven by line simplification and data sequence compression techniques. Moreover, due to the (unavoidable) erroneous measurements from GPS devices, the problem of matching the location recordings with the underlying traffic network has recently gained the attention of the research community. So far, the proposed compression techniques have not been designed for network constrained moving objects, while on the other hand, existing map matching algorithms do not take compression aspects into consideration.

To achieve that we propose a clustering approach based on the fuzzy c-means algorithm utilizing a novel similarity metric defined over intuitionistic fuzzy sets.

First, this is the thorough attention paid to the multiple aspects of movement.

Despite an increase in traffic and national monitoring, ships formulate routes according to their best judgment risking an accident. In this study we take a dataset spanning in 3 years from the AIS (Automatic Identification System) network, which is transmitting in public a ship's identity and location with an interval of seconds, and we load it in a trajectory database supported by the Hermes Moving Objects Database (MOD) system. Presented analysis begins by extracting statistics for the dataset, both general (number of ships and position reports) as well as safety related ones. Simple queries on the dataset illustrate the capabilities of Hermes and allow to gain insight on how the ships move in the Greek Seas. Analysis of movement based on an Origin-Destination matrix between interesting areas in the Greek territory is presented. One of the newest challenges that emerged during this process is that the amount of the positioning data is becoming more and more massive. As a conclusion, a preliminary review of possible solutions to this challenge along with others such as dealing with the noise in AIS data is mentioned and we also briefly discuss the need for interdisciplinary cooperation.",

An interesting trend that poses new challenges in the field and has emerged especially due to the advance of location-based social networks, is that involved data cannot be considered purely spatiotemporal; trajectories of moving objects also contain additional semantic information that deserves to be further explored. On the other hand, the recently available real trajectory datasets are neither adequate nor appropriate for a wide empirical evaluation of related research proposals. As in other domains, a practical approach to overcome this limitation is developing efficient and functional synthetic trajectory generators. In this line of research, we present Hermoupolis, a pattern- and semantic-aware synthetic trajectory generator, which \u2026",

The novelty of the approach is not only to provide qualitatively different means to query for similar trajectories, but also to support trajectory clustering and classification mining tasks, which definitely imply a way to quantify the distance between two trajectories.

They are usually equipped with sensors that read the state of the environment and effectors that apply actions on other entities. Believable agent behavior requires nonomniscience: each agent should contain its own representation of the environment based on its sensing abilities and its interaction history. However, the storage and maintenance of a multitude of different knowledge bases in a dynamic environment with a large number of agents raises memory and performance issues, as data is duplicated and a lot of calculations are repeated. This paper presents an architecture for multiagent virtual environments that is based on a spatiotemporal database, which maintains an abstract representation of the environment and the moving entities, and delivers all the sensory information required by the agents. The use of the spatiotemporal database enhances the agents\u2019 reasoning about the position and motion of other entities by providing a number of queries for spatiotemporal reasoning.",

During the last decade, there has been a lot of research ranging from data models and query languages to implementation aspects, such as efficient indexing, query processing and optimization techniques.This chapter covers aspects related to data collection and handling so as to feed trajectory databases with appropriate data. We will also focus on the step trajectory reconstruction of the Geographic Privacy-aware KDD process (illustrated in Figure 2.1) emerged from the GeoPKDD project which proposed some solid theoretical foundations at an appropriate level of abstraction to deal with traces and trajectories of moving objects aiming at serving real world applications. This process consists of a set of techniques and methodologies that are applicable on mobility data and are organized in some well-defined and individual steps that have a clear target: to extract user-consumable forms of knowledge from large amounts of raw geographic data referenced in space and in time. However, when mobility data is about individuals, data collection is subject to privacy regulations and restrictions. To enable privacy-aware collection of position data, a complementary class of techniques are used, known as location PETs (privacy-enhancing technologies). This KDD process can be applied to heterogeneous sources of mobility data. The cellphone icon that is illustrated in Figure 2.1 could represent various data sets coming from various devices.

Since trajectory data is more than just a collection of individual points, we formulate the problem of trajectory hot spot analysis, using the Getis-Ord statistic.

However, an alternative strategy considers that data stays in-house to the hosting organization and privacy-preserving mobility data management systems are in charge of privacy-aware sharing of the mobility data. Furthermore, human trajectories are nowadays enriched with semantic information by using background geographic information and/or by user-provided data via location-based social media. This new type of representation of personal movements as sequences of places visited by a person during his/her movement poses even greater privacy violation threats. To facilitate privacy-aware sharing of mobility data, we design a semantic-aware MOD engine were all potential privacy breaches that may occur when answering a query, are prevented through an auditing mechanism. Moreover, in order to improve user friendliness and system functionality of the aforementioned engine, we propose Zoom-Out algorithm as a distinct component, whose objective is to modify the initial query that cannot be answered at first due to privacy violation, to the \u2018nearest\u2019query that can be possibly answered with \u2018safety\u2019.",

In this paper, we propose a method for trajectory segmentation and sampling based on the representativeness of the (sub)trajectories in the MOD. In order to find the most representative subtrajectories, the following methodology is proposed. First, a novel global voting algorithm is performed, based on local density and trajectory similarity information. This method is applied for each segment of the trajectory, forming a local trajectory descriptor that represents line segment representativeness. The sequence of this descriptor over a trajectory gives the voting signal of the trajectory, where high values correspond to the most representative parts. Then, a novel segmentation algorithm is applied on this signal that automatically estimates the number of \u2026",

Similarity search over trajectories is imperative for supporting such tasks. Related works in the field, mainly inspired from the time-series domain, employ generic similarity metrics that ignore the peculiarity and complexity of the trajectory data type. Aiming at providing a powerful toolkit for analysts, in this paper we propose a framework that provides several trajectory similarity measures, based on primitive (space and time) as well as on derived parameters of trajectories (speed, acceleration, and direction), which quantify the distance between two trajectories and can be exploited for trajectory data mining, including clustering and classification.

In this paper, we propose an innovative algorithm for protecting users from location tracking by the localization service, without hindering the provisioning of fine-grained location updates on a continuous basis. Our proposed Temporal Vector Map (TVM) algorithm, allows a user to accurately localize by exploiting a k-Anonymity Bloom (kAB) filter and a bestNeighbors generator of camouflaged localization requests, both of which are shown to be resilient to a variety of privacy attacks.

Each trajectory is modelled by sequential 3-D line segments. The global voting method is applied for each segment of the trajectory, forming a local trajectory descriptor.

The literature on NN query processing algorithms so far deals with either stationary or moving query points over static datasets or future (predicted) locations over a set of continuously moving points. With the increasing number of Mobile Location Services (MLS), the need for effective k-NN query processing over historical trajectory data has become the vehicle for data analysis, thus improving existing or even proposing new services. In this paper, we investigate mechanisms to perform NN search on R-tree-like structures storing historical information about moving object trajectories. The proposed (depth-first and best-first) algorithms vary with respect to the type of the query object (stationary or moving point) as well as the type of the query result (historical continuous or not), thus \u2026",

A challenging query type over existentially uncertain data is the search of the Nearest Neighbour (NN), as the likelihood of an object to be the NN of the query object does not only depend on its distances from other objects, but also from their existence.

Effectively, it can keep only those positions conveying salient mobility events (annotated as stop, change in speed, heading, or altitude, etc.), identified when the mobility pattern of a given vessel or aircraft changes significantly.

Our approach for (a) relies on a two-phase process: a voting-and-segmentation phase followed by a sampling-and-clustering phase. Regarding (b), we organize data into partitions that correspond to groups of sub-trajectories, which are incrementally maintained in a hierarchical structure. Both approaches have been implemented in Hermes@PostgreSQL, a real Moving Object Database engine built on top of PostgreSQL, enabling users to perform progressive cluster analysis via simple SQL.

In this paper, we define and formalize the strict path query. This is a novel query type tailored to support path-based analysis, where trajectories must follow all edges in the path. To efficiently support strict path queries, we present a novel NET work-constrained TRAjectory index (NETTRA). This index enables very efficient retrieval of trajectories that follow a specific path, ie, strict path queries.
