Our experimental results indicate that the core power signature would be indistinguishable in a SoC with hundreds of IP cores due to the power consumption of the rest cores that operate and/or are tested in parallel. To this end, we propose embedding ring oscillators, which are enabled at discrete time points during the testing of the core to over pronounce its power signature. Our experimental results indicate that in this way cores can be identified more efficiently.",

            "Abstract": "Two architectures for modulo 2 n +1 adders are introduced in this paper. The first one is built around a sparse carry computation unit that computes only some of the carries of the modulo 2 n +1 addition. This sparse approach is enabled by the introduction of the inverted circular idempotency property of the parallel-prefix carry operator and its regularity and area efficiency are further enhanced by the introduction of a new prefix operator. The resulting diminished-1 adders can be implemented in smaller area and consume less power compared to all earlier proposals, while maintaining a high operation speed. The second architecture unifies the design of modulo 2 n  \u00b1 1 adders. It is shown that modulo 2 n +1 adders can be easily derived by straightforward modifications of modulo 2 n -1 adders with minor hardware overhead.",

            "Abstract": "Recent trends in IC technology have given rise to a new requirement, that of low power dissipation during testing, that Built-In Self-Test (BIST) structures must target along with the traditional requirements. To this end, by exploiting the inherent properties of Carry Save, Carry Propagate and modified Booth multipliers, in this paper we propose new power-efficient BIST structures for them. The proposed BIST schemes are derived by: (a) properly assigning the Test Pattern Generator (TPG) outputs to the multiplier inputs, (b) modifying the TPG circuits and (c) reducing the test set length. Our results indicate that the total power dissipated during testing can be reduced from 29.3% to 54.9%, while the average power per test vector applied can be reduced from 5.8% to 36.5% and the peak power dissipation can be reduced from 15.5% to 50.2% depending on the implementation of the basic cells and the size of the multiplier. The test application time is also significantly reduced, while the introduced BIST schemes implementation area is small.",

We firstly show that an augmented diminished-1 adder can be used for the modulo 2 n  +1 addition of two n-bit operands in the weighted representation, if it is driven by operands whose sum has been decreased by 1. This scheme outperforms solutions that are based on the use of binary adders and/or weighted modulo 2 n  + 1 adders in both area and delay terms. We then apply this scheme in the design of residue generators (RGs) and multi-operand modulo adders (MOMAs). The resulting arithmetic components remove at least a whole parallel adder out of the critical path of the currently most efficient proposals.
