            "Abstract": "The \u201cAVR Butterfly\u201d (BF) is not just a microcontroller, but rather an autonomous embedded system kit including several sensors. Our main objective was first to provide Internet connectivity to the BF and then to evaluate its further capabilities as a sensor network node. To this end, we equipped the BF with a TCP/IP stack and a Zigbee transceiver. As a case study, we constructed a node and a gateway based on the BF and formed a simple wireless sensor network (WSN). In order to enable remote users to access, on demand, sensor node readings through their web browsers, an HTML Server application was developed for the BF-gateway. We demonstrate that despite the scarcity of the available resources, if we enhance the BF with a popular Ethernet chip and the optimal TCP/IP stack for 8-bit microcontrollers, we can obtain a powerful, yet simple and inexpensive, monitoring device with Internet connectivity \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Environmental hazards (wildfires, floods, oil spills) are often modeled as \u201ccontinuous objects\u201d which evolve in space and time taking irregular shapes. Tracking their boundaries and accurately predicting their spatiotemporal spreading patterns is of paramount importance to combat their often catastrophic consequences. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been very instrumental for this purpose. However, current WSN-based methods require a prohibitively large density of deployed sensors to achieve a reasonable boundary reconstruction accuracy because they are based on the explicit identification of nodes close to the boundary. We present a novel approach that can track and predict the global boundary using only a relatively small number of distributed local front estimates. Our approach first filters and fuses the available sparse set of local front estimates (e.g. vectors of local orientation, direction and speed \u2026",

As clusters of workstations become increasingly popular the need for component frameworks that facilitate the high level modeling and rapid prototyping of parallel and distributed applications on such systems is becoming pressing. Many scientists and engineers have image and signal processing applications that could benefit from cluster computing. However, these applications often exist as legacy code, such as serial Matlab functions, which are not easily parallelizable. The goal of the JavaPorts project is to provide a framework and a set of tools that make it easy to develop component-based parallel and distributed applications for networks of heterogeneous computing nodes. The latest version of the package supports the integration of Java and Matlab components into the same application and provides a mechanism for incorporating legacy Matlab functions into parallel processing \u2026",

The first one tries to predict the fish indices of biotic integrity (IBI) at the state or regional scale based on the most similar observations to a specific target site of interest using the simple to implement k-nearest neighbors (or kNN) method. Two different distance functions were considered to find the k-nearest neighbors: the Euclidean and the Mahalanobis. The second method was applied on the same datasets and consisted of a step-wise multiple regression. The two modeling approaches yielded similar results but kNN proved to be more time-efficient and very fast computationally for the given dataset sizes, which allowed applying a leave-one-out cross validation.In an attempt to reveal the importance of scale in the prediction of IBI, regression models were constructed at the state (or regional) scale and at the more refined \u2026",

The two methods can be combined with regression techniques to correct the baseline in all regions of the chromatogram and are shown to work well even in areas of low SNR.

In this paper, we study the muscular co-activation patterns during a variety of reach-to-grasp motions, and we introduce a learning scheme that can discriminate between different strategies. This scheme can then classify reach-to-grasp strategies based on the muscular co-activations.

We have developed a software framework that exploits many-core and multicore CPUs to implement efficient parallel MCPSC in modern processors based on three popular PSC methods, namely, TMalign, CE, and USM. We evaluate and compare the performance and efficiency of the two parallel MCPSC implementations using Intel\u2019s experimental many-core Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC) as well as Intel\u2019s Core i7 multicore processor. We show that the 48-core SCC is more efficient than the latest generation Core i7, achieving a speedup factor of 42 (efficiency of 0.9), making many-core processors an exciting emerging technology for large-scale structural proteomics. We compare and contrast the performance of the two processors on several datasets and also show that MCPSC outperforms its component methods in grouping related domains, achieving a high -measure of 0.91 on the benchmark CK34 dataset. The software implementation for protein structure comparison using the three methods and combined MCPSC, along with the developed underlying rckskel algorithmic skeletons library, is available via GitHub.",

With new PSC methods continuously emerging and no clear method of choice, Multi-Criteria Protein Structure Comparison (MCPSC) is commonly employed to combine methods and generate consensus structural similarity scores. We present pyMCPSC, a Python based utility we developed to allow users to perform MCPSC efficiently, by exploiting the parallelism afforded by the multi-core CPUs of today\u2019s desktop computers. We show how pyMCPSC facilitates the analysis of similarities in protein domain datasets and how it can be extended to incorporate new PSC methods as they are becoming available. We exemplify the power of pyMCPSC using a case study based on the Proteus_300 dataset. Results generated using pyMCPSC show that MCPSC scores form a reliable basis for identifying the true classification of a domain, as evidenced both by the ROC analysis as well as the Nearest-Neighbor analysis. Structure similarity based \u201cPhylogenetic Trees\u201d representation generated by pyMCPSC provide insight into functional grouping within the dataset of domains. Furthermore, scatter plots generated by pyMCPSC show the existence of strong correlation between protein domains belonging to SCOP Class C and loose correlation between those of SCOP Class D.

            "Abstract": "We present the development of a simulator that approximates the behaviour of a wireless network of temperature sensors deployed in the area affected by a wildfire. It is based on a novel signal processing approach in which the temperature experienced at a sensor due to a spreading fire front is modelled as the mixture of two-dimensional Gaussian distributions. We present the justification, development and validation of the proposed model. Our work enables the in-silico generation of synthetic, yet realistic, sensor temperature data sets. Due to the lack of real data, such data sets can be useful in deriving optimal sensor network deployment strategies for fire detection and progress monitoring in a specific area, under different scenarios for the expected wind conditions, and for calibrating fire spread prediction models.",

We show first how a good estimate of the peak diffusion (spread) can be calculated from the raw trace and without having to known the underlying base sequence. Using the estimated inter-peak distance and peak spread parameters a non-negative least squares problem can be formulated in order to find the weight factors of the multiple shapes immersed in broad peaks, typically found towards the end of the chromatogram. The two algorithms combined provide peak hypotheses that are tested by the subsequent base decisions and scoring stage of the base-caller using probabilistic methods",

Task specificity for motion decoding is introduced in two different levels: Subspace to move toward and object to be grasped. The discrimination between the different reach to grasp strategies is accomplished with machine learning techniques for classification. The classification decision is then used in order to trigger an EMG-based task-specific motion decoding model. Task specific models manage to outperform \u201cgeneral\u201d models providing better estimation accuracy.

As the hazard approaches, these parameters are re-estimated using ad-hoc clusters (triplets) of collaborating sensor nodes. Parameters updating is based on algebraic closed-form expressions resulting from the analytical solution of a Bayesian estimation problem.

The best fitted distribution (LogLogistic) was further used to predict the inactivation of Salmonella populations of various initial levels using Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results showed that the variability in inactivation kinetics is negligible for concentrations down to 100\u202fcells and the population behavior can be described with a deterministic model.

It allows capturing detailed information about the morphology, gene expression, and spatial characteristics of individual cells at every time instance of the imaging experiment. The image analysis of bacterial \"single-cell movies\" (videos) generates big data in the form of multidimensional time series of measured bacterial attributes. If properly analyzed, these datasets can help us decipher the bacterial communities' growth dynamics and identify the sources and potential functional role of intra- and inter-subpopulation heterogeneity. Recent research has highlighted the importance of investigating the role of biological \"noise\" in gene regulation, cell growth, cell division, etc. Single-cell analytics of complex single-cell movie datasets, capturing the interaction of multiple micro-colonies with thousands of cells, can shed light on essential phenomena for human health, such as the competition of pathogens and benign microbiome cells, the emergence of dormant cells (\u201cpersisters\u201d), the formation of biofilms under different stress conditions, etc. However, highly accurate and automated bacterial bioimage analysis and single-cell analytics methods remain elusive, even though they are required before we can routinely exploit the plethora of data that single-cell movies generate.

However, prediction of biological integrity using information from multi-parameter environmental observations is a challenging problem due to the hierarchical organization of the natural environment, the existence of nonlinear inter-dependencies among variables as well as natural stochasticity and measurement noise. We present a method for predicting the Fish Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) using multiple environmental observations at the state-scale in Ohio. Instream (chemical and physical quality) and offstream parameters (regional and local upstream land uses, stream fragmentation, and point source density and intensity) are used for this purpose.

We implemented a QoS service to enable application-driven adaptation for performance and fault tolerance at runtime. The service is associated with lightweight middleware that monitors the state and load of all application entities (e.g., machines, tasks, and logical network links). Moreover, it makes its services available to an application task via an anonymous and simple to use QoS API. We present a Manager-Worker application that uses our fault tolerance QoS API to adapt for Worker faults in order to avoid application deadlock at runtime. Moreover, we show how a dynamic application-level scheduler can easily utilize the QoS API to find efficient schedules. Furthermore, we quantified the overhead of the QoS middleware in various scenarios to demonstrate that it has minor impact on the performance of the application it is servicing.",

Although clinical evidence and in vitro studies indicate disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier in Parkinson9s disease, the mechanisms mediating the endothelial dysfunction remain elusive. Lack of relevant models able to recapitulate the order of events driving the development of the disease in humans has been a significant bottleneck in the identification of specific successful druggable targets. Here we leveraged the Organs-on-Chips technology to engineer a human Brain-Chip representative of the substantia nigra area of the brain containing dopaminergic neurons, astrocytes, microglia, pericytes, and microvascular brain endothelial cells, cultured under fluid flow. Our \u03b1Syn fibril-induced model was capable of reproducing several key aspects of Parkinson9s disease, including accumulation of phosphorylated \u03b1Syn (pSer129-\u03b1Syn), mitochondrial impairment, neuroinflammation, and compromised barrier function.

            "Abstract": "The post-genomic era is characterized by the rapid data accumulation leading to unwieldy and large volumes of biological data. The proteomics results (large sets of identified proteins or peptides) that originate from several workflow steps, play an important role in the analysis of a proteomics experiment. As a result, the area of high-through-put proteomics created new visualization challenges in interpreting large-scale datasets. We present VIP, an interactive visualization tool for proteomics data, which integrates protein or peptide features emanating at every step of the proteomics analysis and combines them visually in synthetic maps. Our novel tool offers the flexibility to choose any desired features according to the analysis objectives, examine simultaneously more than one maps and interact with the visualization by querying and filtering the results. The synthetic maps visualization aims not only at summarizing \u2026",

We propose a method for emulating the operation of collaborative algorithms in large-scale WSNs by re-using a small number of available real sensor nodes.

The modified Gaussian model parameters are adjusted based on the solution of a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization problem. The whole scheme can be realized by a wireless sensor network by forming dynamically triplets of cooperating sensor nodes along the path of the hazard.

The system is self contained and relies on its own middleware layer to do the resource monitoring and servicing behind the scenes, at the application-level. It groups the available machines into clusters to scale down the number of required QoS measurements and to facilitate the mapping process. A scheduler considers user requirements and constraints and uses an efficient mapping heuristic to find an acceptable assignment. The performance estimator predicts the overall running time of a given mapping based on application and network models as well as resource state information. The estimated time is used to decide whether the mapping satisfies the QoS targets set by the user.

Despite the existence of sophisticated software tools, 2\u2010DE gel image analysis still remains a serious bottleneck. The low accuracies of commercial software packages and the extensive manual calibration that they often require for acceptable results show that we are far from achieving the goal of a fully automated and reliable, high\u2010throughput gel processing system. We present a novel spot detection and quantification methodology which draws heavily from unsupervised machine\u2010learning methods. Using the proposed hierarchical machine learning\u2010based segmentation methodology reduces both the number of faint spots missed (improves sensitivity) and the number of extraneous spots introduced (improves precision). The detection and quantification performance has been thoroughly \u2026",

We are presenting a new end-to-end image analysis pipeline of operations that can be fully automated. The pipeline includes image denoising and enhancement based on contourlets, image segmentation into Regions of Interest (ROIs) based on active contours, followed by the analysis of the extracted ROIs for spot detection and quantification using mixture modeling, model selection and unsupervised machine learning methods. The proposed system is shown to match the sensitivity and exceed the precision of commercial spot detection software when analyzing real 2D gel images. It is suitable for high throughput proteomics analysis of image stacks since, unlike commercial software, it does not require any manual re-calibration of parameters every time a new image is to be processed.",

            "Abstract": "The intestinal epithelial barrier supports the symbiotic relationship between the microbiota colonizing the intestinal epithelium and the host immune system to maintain homeostasis. Leaky barrier is increasingly recognized as part of the pathogenesis of a number of chronic conditions in addition to inflammatory and infectious diseases. As our understanding on the regulation of the barrier remains limited, effective therapeutic targeting for the compromised barrier is still an unmet need. Here we combined advancements on the organoids and Organ-on-Chip technologies to establish a micro-engineered Colon Intestine-Chip for studying development and regulation of the human intestinal barrier. Our data demonstrate the significance of the endothelium in co-culture with the epithelial cells within a tissue-relevant microenvironment for the establishment of a tight epithelial barrier of polarized cells. Pathway analysis of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), revealed significant upregulation of mechanisms relevant to the maturation of the intestinal epithelium in organoid-derived epithelial cells in co-culture with endothelium as compared to organoids maintained in suspension. We provide evidence that the Colon Intestine-Chip platform responds to interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), a prototype cytokine utilized to model inflammation-induced barrier disruption, by induction of apoptosis and reorganization of the apical junctional complexes as shown with other systems. We also describe the mechanism of action of interleukin 22 (IL-22) on mature, organoid-derived intestinal epithelial cells that is consistent with barrier disruption. Overall we propose the Colon Intestine \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (ASYN) is central in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) pathogenesis. Converging pieces of evidence suggest that the levels of ASYN expression play a critical role in both familial and sporadic Parkinson\u2019s disease. ASYN fibrils are the main component of inclusions called Lewy Bodies (LBs) which are found mainly in the surviving neurons of the substantia nigra. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the involvement of ASYN in molecular mechanisms underlying the development of PD, there is much information missing which prevents understanding the causes of the disease and how to stop its progression. Using a Systems Biology approach, we develop a biomolecular reactions model that describes the intracellular ASYN dynamics in relation to overexpression, post-translational modification, oligomerization and degradation of the protein. Especially for the proteolysis of ASYN, the model takes into account the biological knowledge regarding the contribution of Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA), macro-autophagic and proteasome pathways in the protein\u2019s degradation. Importantly, inhibitory phenomena, caused by ASYN, concerning CMA (more specifically the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a, abbreviated as Lamp2a receptor, which is the rate limiting step of CMA) and the proteasome are carefully modeled. The model is validated by simulation studies of known experimental overexpression data from SH-SY5Y cells and the unknown model parameters are estimated either computationally or by experimental fitting. The calibrated model is then tested under three hypothetical intervention scenarios and in all \u2026",

A new regression-based method for normalizing electrophoretic DNA traces is presented. It is based on a channel-coupled exponential decay model that can track accurately the trend of dropping peak heights (the so-called signal \u201cskyline\u201d) even in the low SNR region of the trace. We provide the justification and formulation of the regression model as well as the analytical estimation of its parameters. The proposed skyline-based normalization scheme is not affected by the presence of artifacts, compressions, false peaks, etc. and does not depend on the dye chemistry used. We demonstrate that it can improve the interpretation of chromatograms and therefore increase base-calling accuracy when employed in the pre-processing stage of either a pattern classification type base-caller (such as the BEM presented in \u2026",

Use of prior knowledge provides constraints which help disambiguate the different possible interpretations that the data may have at regions of low SNR, and is shown to lead to a substantial increase of the number of DNA bases that can be accurately called in such regions. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithms, without being optimized, can achieve base-calling performance that matches, and often exceeds, that of commercially available software.
