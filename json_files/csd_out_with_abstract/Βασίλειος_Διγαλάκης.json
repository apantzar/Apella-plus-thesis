Multimodality comes as the next step in order to offer even more natural, friendlier and personalized interfaces. In this work, we present the architecture of a distributed system that utilizes the data channel (GPRS or 3G), in order to accommodate multimodal applications on a mobile device. Within the context of our work we also introduce a generic framework for creating applications of this kind. Finally, we integrate the proposed system in order to demonstrate a sample application",

Despite what is generally believed, we show that discrete-distribution HMMs can outperform continuous-density HMMs at significantly faster decoding speeds. Performance of the discrete HMMs is improved by using product-code vector quantization (VQ) and mixtures of discrete distributions. The decoding speed of the discrete HMMs is also improved by quantizing subvectors of coefficients, since this reduces the number of table lookups needed to compute the output probabilities. We present efficient training and decoding algorithms for the discrete-mixture HMMs (DMHMMs). Our experimental results in the air-travel information domain show that the high level of recognition accuracy of continuous-mixture-density HMMs (CDHMMs) can be \u2026",

Regardless of the estimation algorithm, if there are no restrictions on the form of the matrices we want to estimate, the matrices can be determined up to within a linear transformation and thus the result may be different than the true solution and the convergence of iterative algorithms may be affected. In this paper, we apply a new identification procedure based on the Expectation Maximization framework to a family of identifiable state-space models. To our knowledge, this is the first complete solution of Maximum-Likelihood estimation for general linear state-space models.",

It is known, however, that additional gains can be made if we do not constrain the components of each class to use the same transform. In this paper two speaker adaptation algorithms are described. First, instead of estimating one linear transform for each class (as maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) does, for example) we estimate multiple linear transforms per class of models and a transform weights vector which is specific to each component (Gaussians in our \u2026",

We then address pronunciation evaluation as a prediction problem, trying to predict the grade a human expert would assign to a particular skill. Using the speech and the expert-ratings databases, we build statistical models and introduce different machine scores that can be used as predictor variables. We validate these machine scores on the Voice Interactive Language Training System (VILTS) corpus, evaluating the pronunciation of American speakers speaking French and we show that certain machine scores, like the log-posterior and \u2026",

We describe a novel method to produce a language-independent system by combining acoustic models from a number of source languages.

Therefore, using LDMs to evaluate the clustering of longer phoneme segments improves the linguistic-to-acoustic mapping and leads to trajectories of synthetic speech parameters without discontinuities and closer to the natural ones. It also decreases the footprint of the system since the total number of decision tree leaves is smaller than the total number of leaves usually produced in a typical HMM-based \u2026",

Alternatively, linear dynamic models (LDM) can be used to model speech segments. Several implementations of LDM have been proposed in the literature. However, all had a restricted structure to satisfy identifiability constraints. In this paper, we relax all these constraints and use a general, canonical form for a linear state-space system that guarantees identifiability for arbitrary state and observation vector dimensions.

Since the conditional independence between the variables corresponds to zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix, one can learn the structure of the graph by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix from sample data. This is usually done by solving a convex maximum likelihood problem with a l 1 -regularization term applied on the inverse covariance matrix. In this study, we develop an estimator for such models appropriate for data coming from several datasets that share the same set of variables and a common network substructure. We assume that there exist a few different edges among the networks while the others (edges) are common. To this end, we form an optimization problem that exploits the problem's special structure and we propose an alternating direction method for its solution. We confirm the performance improvement \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This work is part of an effort aimed at developing computer-based systems for language instruction; we address the task of grading the pronunciation quality of the speech of a student of a foreign language. The automatic grading system uses SRI's DecipherTM continuous speech recognition system to generate phonetic segmentations. Based on these segmentations and probabilistic models we produce different pronunciation scores for individual or groups of sentences that can be used as predictors of the pronunciation quality. Different types of these machine scores can be combined to obtain a better prediction of the overall pronunciation quality. In this paper we review some of the best-performing machine scores and discuss the application of several methods based on linear and nonlinear mapping and combination of individual machine scores to predict the pronunciation quality grade that a human expert \u2026",

Such techniques are particularly useful for target languages where minimal amounts of training data are available. We describe a novel method to produce a language-independent system by combining acoustic models from a number of source languages. This intermediate language-independent acoustic model is used to bootstrap a target-language system by applying language adaptation. For our experiments we use acoustic models of seven source languages to develop a target Greek acoustic model. We show that our technique significantly outperforms a system trained from scratch when less than 8 hours of read speech is available.",

Previous attempts have shown that it is feasible to evaluate the pronunciation of a non-native speaker by having implicit or explicit knowledge of the uttered text, provided that enough utterances are available. Our approach is to use characteristics of the mother tongue (SOURCE language) of the speaker in the evaluation of his/her pronunciation. We recorded 20 Greek students speaking English (TARGET language) and evaluated their pronunciation using algorithms that include characteristics of the SOURCE language (Greek). We show that the pronunciation scores that are based on both TARGET- and SOURCE-language characteristics have better correlation with the human scores than those based only on characteristics of the TARGET language.

Instead of trying to improve the synthesis quality of PSOLA based diphone concatenation speech synthesizers, we have chosen to use words as the synthesis units. This approach has the advantage of low complexity and quick implementation, while at the same time it achieves better speech quality due to the fact that the synthesis units inherently possess the necessary prosodic feature diversity. The selection of the optimal sequence of words that form the synthesized speech, however, presents the greatest challenge in the synthesis process. Several features are taken into consideration during the selection, but we have identified Coarticulation at the edges of consecutive words to have the greatest effect on the quality of the synthesized utterance. We present a novel method for evaluating a measure on coarticulation \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Linear Dynamical Models (LDMs) have been used in speech synthesis recently as an alternative to hidden Markov models (HMMs). Among the advantages of LDMs are the ability to capture the dynamics of speech and the achievement of synthesized speech quality similar to HMM-based speech systems on a smaller footprint. However, such as in the HMM case, LDMs produce over-smoothed trajectories of speech parameters, resulting in muffled quality of synthetic speech. Inspired by a similar problem found in HMM-based speech synthesis, where the naturalness of the synthesized speech is greatly improved when the global variance (GV) is compensated, this paper proposes a novel speech parameter generation algorithm that considers GV in LDM-based speech synthesis. Experimental results show that the application of GV during parameter generation significantly improves speech quality.",

            "Abstract": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are becoming the dominant approach for text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). HMMs provide an attractive acoustic modeling scheme which has been exhaustively investigated and developed for many years. Modern HMM-based speech synthesizers have approached the quality of the best state-of-the-art unit selection systems. However, we believe that statistical parametric speech synthesis has not reached its potential, since HMMs are limited by several assumptions which do not apply to the properties of speech. We, therefore, propose in this paper to use Linear Dynamical Models (LDMs) instead of HMMs. LDMs can better model the dynamics of speech and can produce a naturally smoother trajectory of the synthesized speech. We perform a series of experiments using different system configurations to check on the performance of LDMs for speech synthesis. We show that LDM \u2026",

To reduce the number of adaptation parameters, the multiple linear transforms are generated from training speakers and the adaptation parameters consist of a single weight vector per class. This can be seen as incorporating a-priori knowledge to our estimation process.
