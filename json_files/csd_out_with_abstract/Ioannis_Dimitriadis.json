The authors have proposed CLFPs (Collaborative Learning Flow Patterns) as a way of collecting these best practices. To facilitate the process of CLFPs by software systems, the paper proposes to specify these patterns using IMS Learning Design (IMS-LD). Thus, teachers without technical knowledge can particularize and integrate CSCL tools. Nevertheless, the support of IMS-LD for describing collaborative learning activities has some deficiencies: the collaborative tools that can be defined in these activities are limited. Thus, this paper proposes and discusses an extension to IMS-LD that enables to specify several characteristics of the use of tools that mediate collaboration.

The case, which took place in the context of a computer-mediated learning environment, includes the design, instantiation, enactment and evaluation of the script. Focusing on the relevance of the assessment activities which are integrated in the script, the case study illustrates the complexity of formalizing computer-interpretable CSCL scripts with embedded assessment. The usage of design patterns is proposed as a means of providing support and hiding the complexity of creating and enacting such scripts.

How can they evaluate how the activities actually went compared with the plan? Teachers' effectiveness in orchestrating the classroom has a direct impact on students learning. Interactive tabletops offer the potential to support teachers by enhancing their awareness and classroom control. This paper describes our mechanisms to help a teacher orchestrate a classroom activity using multiple interactive tabletops. We analyse automatically captured interaction data to assess whether the activity design, as intended by the teacher, was actually followed during its enactment.

Several solutions proposed in the literature, have tackled the important dimensions of data flow automation or the consistency of design, but they have not adequately covered the perspective of reusing scripts. Current data and tools binding specifications do not establish the dependencies between this setting and the structural design of the collaborative data flow situations. This preclude a complete design particularization and raise the issue of reusing data flow designs, which is especially important in the case of complex and adaptive real-world collaborative learning scenarios.

            "Abstract": "Despite ongoing research on learning repositories, share and reuse of Teacher Education (TE) resources remains scarce. One of the reasons is that TE communities use their own in-house resources and repositories in a rather isolated way, thus limiting resource exchange in different contexts. Further, current learning metadata specifications such as Dublin Core (DC) and LOM do not address the description of pedagogical characteristics of resources demanded by TE practitioners. To overcome these limitations, the Share.TEC project aims to provide a federated TE metadata repository based on the Common Metadata Model (CMM) as the shared reference metadata model. Key for the success of the Share.TEC project is the migration of existing TE metadata records to the federated repository, performing the necessary format conversions to CMM. Besides, practitioners should be able to make TE-based annotations of resources. These two functionalities are covered by the Metadata Migration and Annotation Tool of Teacher Education Resources (MATTER) that is the subject of this paper. Although MATTER is purposed for the Share.TEC project, it can be potentially used to support the federation of other learning repositories.",

We are working in the definition, developing and validation of a conceptual framework for characterizing roles in collaborative learning contexts that aims at supporting IA tools in achieving these goals.

Additionally, the complexity of CSCW situations demands the use of distinct sources of data as the input of the analysis. We introduce our proposal of a mixed method for the formative evaluation of participatory aspects of collaboration, which defines how to integrate SNA with other analysis perspectives. This method is supported by a set of tools. We will briefly introduce one of them, called SAMSA, that has been developed in order to adapt the SNA-related procedures to the demands of evaluators, who are not expected to be SNA experts. We also discuss about future work plans related to the application of SNA modules for introducing on-line collaboration support functions in CSCW or CSCL systems.",

The impact of a grouping strategy based on requiring homogeneity among the students\u2019 engagement of the group is examined in a real MOOC context. In a preliminary stage the results have been analyzed in terms of peer interactions, active students per team and students\u2019 satisfaction. These results have been also compared with those in prior interventions in real MOOCs, thus validating previous findings about the suitability of this approach. The role of the timing of grouping was also examined by carrying out two collaborative activities at different weeks (the fourth and the sixth). A consistent improvement of all indicators was observed in the second intervention and its possible causes are discussed.",

Doctoral education still suffers from two severe overlapping problems: high dropout rates and low emotional wellbeing experienced by many doctoral candidates (eg, depression or anxiety symptoms). Yet, there are few interventional approaches specifically designed to address them in the doctoral student population. Background. Among structural, psychosocial and demographic factors influencing these problems, the self-perception of progress has emerged recently as a crucial motivational factor in doctoral persistence. This paper explores an intervention approach (in the form of workshops) focusing on doctoral progress. Methodology. This paper reports on an iterative design-based research study of workshop interventions to foster such perception of progress in doctoral students\u2019 everyday practice. We gathered mixed data over four iterations, with a total of N= 82 doctoral students from multiple disciplines in Spain and Estonia. Contribution. An approach to preventive interventions that combines research-backed education about mental health and productivity, peer sharing and discussion of experiences and indicators of progress, as well as self-tracking, analysis and reflection upon everyday evidence of their own progress. The paper provides initial evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed interventions, across two institutions in two different countries. Further, our data confirms emergent research on the relationships among progress, emotional wellbeing and dropout ideation in two new contexts.

Facilitating specific CSCL processes by providing learners with computer-supported collaboration scripts is regarded as a promising approach. Implemented in CSCL environments, computer-supported collaboration scripts specify, sequence and distribute roles and activities. Scripts are intended to scaffold activities that students could not yet engage in on their own. One of the main challenges of this approach for realising effective CSCL is the continuous adaptation of scripts to learners\u2019 needs and knowledge. Efforts to specify and formalise script components and mechanisms have led to an integrative framework for computer scientists, educational scientists and psychologists of what constitutes computer-supported collaboration scripts as well \u2026",

However, the design and implementation of such strategies in MOOCs is still a challenge, which is being studied by several researchers, who tend to focus specially on the enactment of MOOCs. Therefore, there is a need for research studies exploring the design processes of MOOCs including active strategies. In this paper, we describe a co-redesign process in which an economic translation course conceived as a MOOC but finally implemented in Moodle for blended learning, was redesigned to include collaboration and gamification to implement it in Canvas Network (a MOOC platform). During the redesign process we found severe difficulties related to the scale, which were mainly caused by the initial implementation in a typical LMS.",

Besides this, it is known that the correct interpretation of human action needs to take context into account. We propose in this paper an XML-based representation of source data, which includes a description of the context of collaboration, and offers a common representation for data of different origin and nature. It is extensible, and independent of the subsequent data analysis methods to which it might be applied. We show examples of its use for the representation of different collaborative scenarios to which it has been applied.

Yet the impact of TEL research on daily teaching-learning practices is still far from fulfilling this potential. Arguably, this is a gap in the capacity for learning design: educators need the tools and competencies which would allow them to identify educational challenges, describe the context in which they arise, identify the opportunities afforded by technology, project the insights derived from research, and devise new learning experiences. To address this gap, educators need tools and practices. Tools that would support them through the cycle of learning design \u2013 from conception to deployment and evaluation of techno-educational innovations. Professional practices that use such tools to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of their innovations and make learning design a daily habit and part of their professional identity. The METIS project (http://metis-project.org/) aims to contribute to this aim, by providing educators with an Integrated Learning Design Environment (ILDE) (Hern\u00e1ndez-Leo, Asensio-P\u00e9rez, Derntl, Prieto, & Chac\u00f3n, 2014; Hern\u00e1ndez-Leo et al., 2015) and a workshop package for training educators in using the ILDE to support effective learning design.

Furthermore, this solution facilitates the reuse of good practices formulated as patterns, permitting a design process that promotes potentially effective results. This issue is especially important in collaborative learning designs, in which elicitations of desired social interactions are planned beforehand.

This article presents a script-aware monitoring process which uses the knowledge about the learning design to guide the analysis of the educational data generated throughout the learning processes. The proposal is illustrated by an example based on a real CSCL scenario in an university course. This example shows how the script-aware monitoring provides useful feedback for the teacher and reduces the effort devoted to management tasks.",

We examine if such distance can provide evidence of transferable linguistic features, suggesting transferability of forum classification models. For this purpose, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation in order to extract the main discussion topics for each MOOC and proceeded to a pairwise semantic comparison between them. We focused on three categories of forum topics, i.e., Content-Related, Logistics-Related and Social Building. In the Content-Related discussions, the study confirmed semantic distance between the humanities course and the other four, while the distances among the mathematics and computing courses were shorter than expected.

The term SLE has emerged to encompass a set of recent trends in the field of educational technology, heavily influenced by the growing impact of technologies such as cloud services, mobile devices, and interconnected objects. However, the term SLE has been used inconsistently by the technology-enhanced learning (TEL) community, since different research works employ the adjective smart to refer to different aspects of novel learning environ- ments. Previous surveys on SLEs are narrowly focused on specific technologies, or remain at a theoretical level that does not discuss practical implications found in empirical studies.

Such an analysis may allow the proposal of alternative ways of handling the modeling process without incurring in excessive work and cognitive load. Our findings through an analysis of a set of significant CSCL scenarios, suggest that artifact assignment, access mode and size of collaborative scenarios are important influencing factors.",

This approach is supported by theorems that guarantee the possibility of representing arbitrary functions by fuzzy systems. However, due to the fact that real data are often noisy, generation of accurate identifiers is presented as an important problem. Within the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), PROBART architecture has been proposed as a solution to this problem. After a detailed comparison of these architectures based on their design principles, the FasArt and FasBack models are proposed.

Focusing on this issue, this chapter deals with the application of learning and assessment patterns along with the creation of such scripts. More specifically, this chapter is focused on the potential benefits of using detailed information concerning the relationships between assessment and learning patterns.

            "Abstract": "The use of Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) is gaining momentum in education. However, most widely spread VLEs such as Moodle, Sakai or. LRN miss two important features for the support of collaborative learning [1] thus precluding their adoption for putting into practice this pedagogical approach that is considered to be more effective than individual and competitive learning under many circumstances. First, they are not tailorable [2]. In this way, educators cannot incorporate existing tools in the VLEs in order to enable their use for the support of new collaborative learning scenarios. And second, they do not support scripting [3]. This precludes the possibility of enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative learning by structuring the interactions between learners in the VLEs. Gridcole [4] is a VLE proposed by the authors that overcomes these limitations by combining the IMS-LD1 specification and service-oriented technologies. More specifically, Gridcole allows educators to easily integrate service-based tools provided by third parties for the support of scripted collaborative learning scenarios described with IMS-LD. Nevertheless, two issues have been identified that may discourage the adoption of Gridcole. One of them is that Gridcole relies on the availability of a sufficient set of tools developed by third parties and compliant with the technological requirements posed for their integration. Gridcole requires thirdparty tools to follow WSRF2 standards that, unfortunately, are not yet commonly adopted for the development of tools with potential learning uses. The other issue refers to the fact that Gridcole was conceived to replace other VLEs \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, technologies play a key role in educational research processes, especially in the context of complex designs or integrative perspectives (qualitative and quantitative). Affordances provided by new tools and technological devices are constantly impacting the way educational research is carried out. Consequently, this growing importance (and dependence on) technology for educational research calls for a deeper reflection, not only about its clear benefits, but also about its potential drawbacks and limitations. This paper explores this tension in a specific mixed-methods research design aimed at understanding the barriers preventing the adoption of Learning Design (LD) tools/methods, a significant problem in the research field of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL). Different actors (teachers and researchers) were involved in the research design, which included a systematic literature review, a Delphi study and a case study. Such an articulated design required the adoption of technologies to support the process in all its phases. The paper describes the main methodological implications of the employed technologies in the different methods applied and in the overall research. The conclusions of the paper highlight that while technologies definitely support a higher level of complexity and articulation of the research design, they might also lead to superficial or biased results.",

Experimental results on the UNIPEN international database show that the proposed system is able to extract a low number of prototypes that are easily recognizable.

            "Abstract": "Different approaches have explored how to provide seamless learning across multiple ICT-enabled physical and virtual spaces, including three-dimensional virtual worlds (3DVW). However, these approaches present limitations that may reduce their acceptance in authentic educational practice: The difficulties of authoring and sharing teacher-created designs across different 3DVW platforms, or the lack of integration of 3DVWs with existing technologies in the classroom ecosystem (eg, widespread web-based learning platforms such as Moodle, or mobile augmented reality applications). Focusing on a specific kind of 3DVW (virtual globes, such as Google Earth, used like 3DVWs), we propose a system that enables teachers to deploy across-spaces learning situations, which can be authored with a plethora of existing learning design tools, that involve different common web-based learning platforms, mobile AR \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Several approaches have addressed the consistency and automatic enactment dimensions of CSCL scripts with data flow, but they have not appropriately tackled the problem of reusing such learning designs. For instance, workflow-based solutions such as LeadFlow4LD only capture particular case behaviors, instead of describing generic data flow situations. This limitation hinders the reusability of these designs because the workflow needs to be adapted for specific technical, teaching and social contexts. This adaptation is complex and time consuming, especially with a large number of students. In order to show the relevance of this problem, this paper analyzes the LeadFlow4LD approach through a real-world complex CSCL script. The study characterizes the reuse effort of CSCL scripts with and without data flow definition, in different social context settings. The findings illustrate how the data flow \u2026",

To address this issue, supervised classification models have been studied and developed in order to assist course facilitators in detecting forum discussions that seek for their intervention. A key issue studied by the literature refers to the transferability of these models to domains other than the domain in which they were initially trained. Typically these models employ domain-dependent features, and therefore they fail to transfer to other subject matters. In this study, we propose and evaluate an alternative way of building supervised models in this context, by using the semantic similarities of the forum transcripts with the dynamically created corpora from the MOOC environment as training features. Specifically, in this study, we analyze the case of two MOOCs, in which the models \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In spite of high expectations and the support given by prestigious funding and educational institutions, Open Educational Resources (OER) have not been adopted widely by teachers and learners in practice. From a cultural historical activity theory perspective, we argue that Mediating Artefacts (MA) such as OER learning design visual representations and rich narrative pedagogical patterns may enable a more effective OER cycle of creation, design, use and evaluation. More specifically, two main arguments are analysed in this paper: first, that making the inherent design of OER more explicit will make them more understandable and hence reusable; second, that offering a small set of simple patterns will encourage new ways to interpret OER and inspire re-purposing in new challenging contexts. A series of successful workshops was carried out and qualitative data gathered which provide initial evidence that a set of CSCL pedagogical patterns were found very suitable in order to repurpose resources intended for individual use and adjust the focus to make them suit new collaborative learning contexts. Interpretation of the data will form the basis for further workshops that aim to extend the idea of using targeted mediating artefacts to guide the design and repurposing of OER.",

The method automatically chooses traffic windows used as a reference, which the traffic window under test is compared with, with no expert intervention needed to that end. We focus on detecting two anomaly types, namely floods and flash-crowds, which have been frequently studied in the literature. Performance of our detection method has been measured through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and results indicate that our method outperforms the closely-related state-of-the-art contribution described in.

For reflective academic writing tasks, which are common for university assessments, this is especially the case since students are often required to plan the task independently to be successful. The purpose of the current study was to examine different reflection behaviours of postgraduate students that were required to reflect on individual tasks over a fifteen-week-long higher education course. Forty students participated in a standardised questionnaire at the beginning of the course to assess their SRL competence and then participated in weekly individual reflection tasks on Google Docs. We examined students\u2019 reflective writing behaviours based on time-series and correlation analysis of fine-grained data retrieved from Google Docs. More specifically, reflection behaviours between students with high SRL and low SRL competence were investigated. The results show that students with high SRL competence tend to reflect more frequently and more systematically than students with low SRL competence. Even though no statistically significant difference in academic performance between the two groups was found, there were statistical correlations between academic performance and individual reflective writing behaviours. We conclude the paper with a discussion on the insights into the temporal reflection patterns of different SRL competence student clusters, the impact of these behaviours on students\u2019 academic performance, and potential suggestions for appropriate support for students with different levels of SRL.",

Furthermore, it provides high level system architecture to highlight key aspects of the technology infrastructure and the functionality of the software system. The rationale of the approach follows the tenets of several converging theoretical perspectives emphasizing the value of learners' dialogue and constructive argumentation as knowledge building processes during collaborative activities. The MOOC teacher (domain expert) is expected to play a key role by entering in the system conceptual links that guide the agent to make relevant questioning interventions. Thus, the agent tool is mediating group-teacher interactions in a MOOC environment aiming to increase the transactive quality of peer dialogue. The paper \u2026",

Group Scribbles provides a dynamic and flexible medium that is easy to learn and enables transformative participatory learning experiences. A familiar Post-It note metaphor allows most teachers and students to learn Group Scribbles quickly and to use it to enable simple brainstorming activities without much preparation. This workshop brings together users and researchers from around the world to demonstrate Group Scribbles and other collaborative learning tools, discuss challenges of assessment and improvisational instruction, and develop design principles for producing activities that enable agile learning and collaboration in real classrooms. Through engaging brainstorming and design sessions, the workshop itself will operate as an agile classroom as participants use Group Scribbles to receive, generate, edit and transmit their own script to determine the flow and aims of the workshop.",

Firstly, it is based on the principles of the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) (Koschman, 1996), field, using technologies to support the collaborative learning process. On the other hand, it follows an Inquiry based Learning methodology. This special mixture offers a \"tasty dish\" we have called \"Inquiry (cowiki-) based learning\". The whole process was designed, implemented and evaluated by a transdisciplinary community of practice formed by many researchers coming from the ICT and education fields.

It reports a study located in a novel multi-surface environment, configured to support small teams who are designing for other people\u2019s learning. Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers\u2019 work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.",

Major issues that remain unsolved deal with the merging of qualita-tive and quantitative methods and data, especially in educational settings that involve both physical and computer-supported collaboration. In this paper we present a methodology that combines traditional sources of data with computer logs, and integrates social network analysis in an overall qualitative evaluation approach. Several computer tools have been developed to assist in this process, integrated with generic software for qualitative analysis. We present the method in the context of an educational and research project that has been going on for three years, to which we have incrementally applied and validated the evalu-ation design and tools. Our proposal and the presented case study aim at giving an answer to the need of innovative techniques for the study of new forms of interaction emerging in CSCL; at increasing the efficiency of the traditionally demanding qualitative methods, so that they can be used by teachers in curriculum-based experiences; and at the definition of a set of guidelines for bridging different data sources and methodological perspectives.

The COVID-19 global crisis has amplified this complexity, making it evident that ICTs will play a major role of the future of education at all levels. Indeed, all students will need at least some access to digital contents and tools from their homes and in the classroom. Thus, to address local and national restrictions and recommendations, hybrid learning spaces (Cohen et al., 2020) are and will be present due to the need for mixing teaching and learning modalities and spaces. The affordances of ICTs are often powerful and presumably make teaching and learning more efficient and effective (Linn and Eylon, 2011), easing the life of the involved stakeholders. However, such complex TEL ecosystems will demand an extraordinary effort from the teachers as they will need to design appropriate learning scenarios, manage them under real-world conditions, and make decisions for the most effective pedagogical interventions. In other terms, teachers will face the challenge of carrying out the design and orchestration of the learning and teaching process in increasingly uncertain and complex TEL ecosystems (de Quincey et al., 2013; Goodyear, 2015).",

The authors have proposed CLFPs (Collaborative Learning Flow Patterns) as a way of collecting these best practices. To facilitate the process of CLFPs by software systems, the paper proposes to specify these patterns using IMS Learning Design (IMS-LD). Thus, teachers without technical knowledge can particularize and integrate CSCL tools. Nevertheless, the support of IMS-LD for describing collaborative learning activities has some deficiencies: the collaborative tools that can be defined in these activities are limited. Thus, this paper proposes and discusses an extension to IMS-LD that enables to specify several characteristics of the use of tools that mediate collaboration. In order to obtain a Unit of Learning based on a CLFP, a three stage process is also proposed. A CLFP-based Unit of Learning example is used to illustrate the process and the need of the proposed extension.",

This paper presents a study wherein 37 teachers\u2019 collaborative learning designs were deployed in Moodle with the support of a particular set of ICT tools throughout the different phases of CSCL scripts life-cycle. According to the data from the study, teachers considered that the resulting deployment of learning designs in Moodle was still valid to be used in real practice (even though some information is actually lost).

Adopting a service oriented architecture such as OGSA can further benefit CSCL systems, enabling increased flexibility to adapt and reuse learning software. However, proliferation of services enormously challenges the search of appropriate ones. Common service discovery mechanisms, such as the Index Service or UDDI, perform poor searches since they rely on keyword matching and do not properly describe service functionality. To address these difficulties, ontologies can be used to formally describe services allowing for semantic searches.

The findings of this study provide us with useful insights on current human interventions in MOOC forums, driving our effort in designing future modules to support the large number of students of these courses, with the ultimate objective to improve the learning experience for each individual student of future \u2026",

In this report, we examine two issues related to project-based software engineering courses: 1) what processes should we include in the course, and 2) in order to achieve formative assessments, how can we build process metrics. In the first part, we combine a field study on professional Agile (eXtreme Programming, XP) teams and an established team process taxonomy to \u201cproactively\u201d select team processes to include in a project-based software engineering course. We choose processes that are 1) considered essential by professionals, and 2) complete with respect to coverage of the taxonomy\u2019s main categories. A case study shows that the augmented course design improves learning outcomes. In the second part, we establish the importance of measuring processes in project-based software engineering courses and present metrics mined from software development tools for monitoring and observing processes to facilitate teaching. A case study confirms that teams with better conformance to software development processes achieve better outcomes. Methods presented in this report can be used to improve software engineering courses. Some future studies are discussed in this report, envisioning a systematic method for improving and automating software engineering courses.",

Synergy is grounded in a theoretical framework of dialogic feedback, which suggests an ongoing dialogue among the peers (providing feedback) and the target student (receiving feedback). Synergy allows instructors to create multiple review sessions with specific tasks depending on the role as feedback receiver or provider. Peer review activities are organized around three phases, in accordance with theoretical framework. Using Synergy, peers in the first phase assess student work, discuss together to align their perspectives toward the quality of the work. Then, the peers create feedback tasks (to identify who gives which feedback). In the second phase, Synergy enables peers to provide the intended feedback (based on the feedback tasks) and to build dialogue with the \u2026",

The CSCL community is currently exploring systematically the issue of collaboration scripting. However, there are also voices calling for attention on the issue of sacrificing the \u201cfun and creativity of free collaboration\u201d to attain effectiveness. Computer-supported scripting has been criticized for its loss of flexibility and also the danger of \u201cover-scripting\u201d the collaborative activity. The need has also been emphasized to differentiate between flexibility loss that is due to pedagogical design and undesired constraints of computerbased scripting techniques. At the same time, suggestions for more adaptive and intelligent forms of CSCL scripting are already on the table.

While learning standards, such as IMS-LD, can be used for scripting, we have encountered some problems to describe activity types, their collaboration properties and learning tools with this standard. The usability of collaboration scripts is limited, since some important features cannot be described. Furthermore, poor description of tools hinders the search of tools, offered as services, in service oriented CSCL systems. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an ontology that can be used to enrich the description of activities and tools in a script. Besides, the authoring process of a learning design is eased due to enforced restrictions in the ontology as well as the use of off-the-self ontology editors. Furthermore, formal and explicit semantics in a script can be exploited to automate the search of tools. This way, service providers can describe their tools in terms of the ontology, while educators can search for them using domain concepts.",

Despite this, there are not so many successful CSCL scenarios happening on a regular basis. Several CSCL frameworks try to overcome these limitations by providing guidelines either to educators, or software developers or institutions. However, there is a lack of a global understanding of the whole CSCL lifecycle shared among all stakeholders. Here we propose a framework that tries to point out issues and recommendations for all stakeholders along the whole CSCL lifecycle. It considers the influences between the social and organisational context, the learning process designed by the educator, the technology used to support it, and the evaluation of both the process and the technology. We illustrate the usage of this framework with its application to an engineering course on Computer Architecture conceived for a virtual university.",

To evaluate this proposal, a group of educators was engaged in a formal comparison study of Ontoolsearch with a keyword search facility based on Lucene. Six search tasks were proposed, each responding to the learning tool needs of a real CSCL setting. Participants had to find tools for these search \u2026",

Sadly, those few VLEs that do so, are not available to most teachers, due to institutional decisions and other contextual constraints. This panorama is even grimmer if a teacher wants to use not only the tools offered by the institutional VLE, but also other web 2.0 tools (in a broader, so-called \u201dDistributed Learning Environment\u201d). By using the GLUE!-PS architecture and data model, teachers are now able to design learning activities using a variety of learning design tools, and to deploy them automatically in several different distributed learning environments. The demonstrator will show two authentic learning designs with different pedagogical approaches, and how GLUE!-PS helps set up the ICT infrastructure for both of them into two different distributed \u2026",

Our mixed methods evaluation reveals that GLUE!-PS supports multiple aspects of orchestration, especially the efficient implementation of teacher learning designs, the ability for useful and intuitive adaptations in run-time, and its adequacy to pragmatic restrictions that teachers face in authentic settings.

Therefore, there is a need for research studies exploring the design processes of MOOCs including active strategies. In this paper, we describe a co-redesign process in which an economic translation course conceived as a MOOC but finally implemented in Moodle for blended learning, was redesigned to include collaboration and gamification to implement it in Canvas Network (a MOOC platform).

The authors investigated these open questions through an LD tool called the Pedagogical Planner. This tool has been evaluated in authentic contexts with the goal of providing input for the ongoing debate.

In this study we follow an incremental approach in order to examine how soon after the beginning of a new course, we have collected enough data for training a supervised classification model. We show that by employing features that derive from a seeded topic modeling method, we achieve classifiers with reliable performance early enough in the course life, thus reducing significantly the human effort. The content of the MOOC platform is used to bias the topic extraction towards discussions related to (a) course content,(b) logistics, or (c) social interactions.

This paper presents a CPD approach based on a novel LD platform (ILDE, Integrated Learning Design Environment). The ILDE guides teachers along a full-lifecycle LD process and incorporates social features that facilitate team co-design, as well as easy interactions among trainees and facilitators in CPD actions. The paper summarizes some first reflections after the evaluation of a set of ILDE-supported CPD actions with teachers from Adult Education and Higher Education. Such reflections provide clues on how to design LD training workshops, and on the need for close monitoring of initial attempts to enact learning designs with students.",

            "Abstract": "Collaborative learning patterns (CLPs) are detailed descriptions of best practices in collaborative learning. These patterns provide a way for a representation of key aspects of CSCL (computer-supported collaborative learning) that is easy to understand by software developers. To formalize these CLPs we have focused our attention on IMS learning design (IMS-LD). IMS-LD provides a means of expressing many different pedagogical approaches (including collaborative learning), however we have found some limitations in reflecting learning experiences that are group-based. Although this specification supports multiple roles in a learning activity, it is not possible to specify how they are going to interact. This paper points out this deficiency and proposes an extension of IMS-LD. The process that can be followed in order to obtain a unit of learning based on a CLP is illustrated with an example.",

Towards this end, collaborative learning best practices are proposed to teachers through the WebCollage authoring tool. The resulting collaborative scripts are modelled using workflow technology and orchestrated automatically by a workflow engine. The ThirdSpace platform then allows the publication and monitoring of the learning activities in learners' PLEs. Thus, ThirdSpace enables the students to participate in the activities through their own self-configured PLEs, using the tools of their choice to engage both in individual and collaborative activities.",

            "Abstract": "The deployment of non-trivial collaborative learning situations in VLEs is a burdensome and errorprone process for teachers, especially as the number of participants, groups, tools and activities grows. Besides, this deployment frequently suffers from the limited set of VLE built-in tools teachers can select to support learning activities. GLUE! and GLUE!-PS are two alternative routes for the deployment of collaborative learning situations that respectively tackle the integration of multiple external tools in multiple VLEs, and the deployment of abstract learning designs generated within multiple authoring tools in multiple VLEs. This paper discusses how the GLUE!-GLUE!-PS partnership represents a deployment route that overcomes both the two aforementioned limitations, when deploying in VLEs non-trivial collaborative learning situations that require the integration of external tools. An authentic, though somewhat complex collaborative situation deployed in Moodle illustrates the benefits of the GLUE!-GLUE!-PS approach. Higher education teachers that deployed this situation in Moodle as part of a professional development workshop highlighted that this approach allows an efficient deployment, and emphasized the benefit of reusing learning designs in other courses and VLEs.",

However, IA tools and processes are still not adopted in mainstream CSCL practices, mostly due to the fact that the current proposals are research prototypes, which do not provide generic and usable solutions for practitioners. To face this weakness, researchers in the IA field should strive to provide adaptive and interoperable tools. This paper presents Role-AdaptIA, a tool based on the concept of role, which supports the adaptivity of IA tools, by enabling the definition of the needs and characteristics of different types of users (roles) in terms of IA indicators. This tool uses a generic data format to represent interactions, proposed by our group as part of our attempts to increase the interoperability of IA tools. This format is discussed in the context of other initiatives in which the authors have participated with other members of the IA research community in order to define a common format to represent interaction data.",

Gridcole can then search for these tools in a service-oriented grid in order to integrate them so that they are available for users during the realization of the situation. Significantly, Gridcole has two features that are not supported by other tailorable systems. First, it allows the integration of tools that use supercomputing capabilities or specific hardware resources, thus enabling the possibility of supporting many situations in which this type of tools is required.

For this purpose, it offers an example that illustrates the type of scenarios that happen in SLE, considering aspects such as the integration of diverse technology, the personalization of the learning process and the connection between formal and informal learning environments. Once analyzed these aspectsobtained from the literature and exemplified in the scenarioalready-existing data models are extended to satisfy the specific needs of the SLEs. This extension allows to define a network of actors and artifacts connected by their topics of interests, as well as to relate the learning activities with formal or informal environments.

            "Abstract": "In spite of the substantial progress in CSCL, there is still some distance between the promise of educational technology for classroom learning and what is readily achieved. Emerging tabletop devices can offer new means to enhance teachers' classroom control and awareness. These technologies can help them orchestrate activities, and capture, analyse and visualise students' collaborative interactions. This paper presents MTClassroom and MTDashboard, that were designed, deployed and tested to support the teacher in orchestrating collaborative learning activities at an authentic classroom. MTClassroom is an enriched multi- tabletop environment that captures aspects of students' activity as they work in small groups. MTDashboard is an orchestration tool displayed at a handheld device, giving the teacher control over classroom activities and providing `real-time' indicators of participation and task progress of each group. We analysed teacher's attention by triangulating quantitative evidence captured by our environment with qualitative observations and teacher's perceptions. We investigated the affordances of our environment and the impact of the information provided to the teacher through the MTDashboard. The contribution of this paper is the novel approach for providing teachers with key indicators of small-group collaboration in the classroom and analysing their impact on teachers' attention to help them manage their time more effectively.",

Group formation, which is a crucial activity in order to achieve effective collaboration, is scarcely covered in MOOC platforms, which do not allow the formation of teams using criteria defined by the instructors. This paper presents an exploratory study conducted in a seven-week MOOC, comparing our group formation proposal, based on students\u2019 activity criteria, to a baseline grouping function provided by the platform.

            "Abstract": "A new architecture called /spl mu/ARTMAP is proposed to impact a category proliferation problem present in Fuzzy ARTMAP. Under a probabilistic setting, it seeks a partition of the input space that optimizes the mutual information with the output space, but allowing some training error, thus avoiding overfitting. It implements an inter-ART reset mechanism that permits handling exceptions correctly, thus using few categories, especially in high dimensionality problems. It compares favorably to Fuzzy ARTMAP and Boosted ARTMAP in several synthetic benchmarks, being more robust to noise than Fuzzy ARTMAP and degrading less as dimensionality increases. Evaluated on a real-world task, the recognition of handwritten characters, it performs comparably to Fuzzy ARTMAP, while generating a much more compact rule set.",

The contextualization of learning tasks opens the possibility of bridging formal learning that happens in a classroom, and informal learning that happens in other physical spaces, such as squares or historical buildings. The tasks created cover different cognitive levels and are contextualized by their location and the topics covered. We applied this approach to the domain of History of Art in the Spanish region of Castile and Leon. We gathered data from DBpedia, Wikidata and the Open Data published by the regional government and we applied 32 templates to obtain 16K learning tasks.

            "Abstract": "Interaction analysis has become a basic function in the field of collaborative learning as a means for supporting evaluation processes. These processes can benefit from the use of automatic or semi-automatic interaction analysis tools. If these tools considered the different roles implied in the analysis processes, this could permit to exploit the results of the analysis in function of who is the user and what is the purpose. The experience of awareness systems in CSCW suggests that this is an appropriate approach. These systems use roles to decide the type and amount of information that they show in a specific moment. However, a review of the concept and classification of roles in the CSCL literature has shown a great diversity, which demands a common vocabulary to describe roles and a new dimension for classify roles that takes into account the dynamic nature of interactions in real collaborative systems. We have identified two dimensions that classify roles in static or dynamic, and in pre-established or emergent. Also we have begun the design of a framework proposing four dimensions (actors, functions, needs and indicators) that compose a structured description of roles in CSCL environments. Both proposals help to identify the roles established before the beginning of the collaborative activities, and to detect the changes of roles produced during the activity. Thus, we will be able to adapt the functionalities of interaction analysis tools to the changing needs of roles at a given moment.",

However, CSCL designs (pattern-based or not) also have to be enacted by teachers, and very often ambiguities, difficulties and deviations arise in this enactment. This paper reports recent experiences in an authentic primary school setting, aimed to study teachers who are not technology experts, designing, enacting and even improvising with a CSCL tool. This study uncovered a set of recurrent routines in the design of activity scripts (which we could see as implicit design patterns), as well as a limited set of routines in the enactment of these activities. The comparison of the designs and their enacted counterparts revealed that the designed routines were completed with additional sets of unexpected routines, bridging the gap between high-level designs and the concrete classroom performance. This paper discusses the idea of eliciting an extensible set of enactment patterns/routines and the level of formalization needed, especially regarding its potential usefulness as a tool (mediating artifact) to support practitioners in enacting CSCL activities in a more flexible and effective way.",

This allows educators to integrate external tools, offered as services by software providers, in order to support the realization of collaborative learning situations. Discovering appropriate services is a challenging task that requires the description of their capabilities. This can be accomplished with Ontoolcole, an ontology of collaborative learning tools designed with the aim of supporting educators in the search of CSCL tools. Ontoolcole is depicted here and some new, relevant features are discussed. Namely, Ontoolcole incorporates an artifact module, a task-level coordination module and the description of static information resources, further improving the capabilities to describe complex CSCL tools. As a proof of concept, we also present a preliminary prototype of the intended target application of Ontoolcole, an \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Collaborative learning flow patterns (CLFPs) encode solutions to recurrent pedagogical problems, which have been successfully applied to the design of learning experiences. However, the pedagogical knowledge encoded in these patterns has seldom been exploited in learning analytics (LA). This paper analyzes four of the most common CLFPs to extract the intrinsic constraints that lead to a successful collaborative learning activity, and use them to enhance existing LA solutions. To understand the added value of applying such codified knowledge in LA, we present evidence from five authentic case studies in which such constraints aided university teachers in monitoring complex collaborative scripts. The results not only illustrate quantitatively such added value but also unearth qualitative benefits, such as raising practitioners' awareness about how the current state of activities may affect future phases of the script.",

There is a lack of research on teachers' perception and use of different technological learning design tools, as existing evaluations are often restricted to a single tool. In order to explore whether there are common factors hampering teacher adoption, and which tool features might appeal to different teachers, more studies involving multiple authoring tools are needed. This paper provides a first step in this direction, describing a mixed methods study performed around a professional development workshop with 18 university teachers from multiple disciplines. This workshop exposed teachers to two different authoring tools (WebCollage and EDIT2), as they learned to create computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL \u2026",

The present study proposes an approach to predict student participation in peer reviews in a MOOC context, which can be utilized to achieve an effective peer-review activity. We attempt to predict the number of different peer works that students will review for each of four assignments based on their past activities in the course. Results show that students\u2019 preceding activities were predictive of their participation in peer reviews starting from the first assignment, and that the prediction accuracy improved considerably with the inclusion of past peer-review activities.",

Teachers create learning buckets at design time, configuring them with constraints to regulate the degree of freedom offered to the students.

This tool is implemented both as a mobile and desktop application, which offers the possibility to end users to easily create, edit and/or mix content for these games. TaggingCreaditor has been designed to support a number of location-based games for learning in cultural heritage sites, based on the idea of connections between digital content and the physical world. Thus, the aim of the reported research was to create a tool that can support the users to customize these games by creating content in the form of textual and multimedia information that can be linked with specific locations or objects indoors and outdoors. In this paper we outline the design rationale and discuss the findings of an initial evaluation study.",

In order to help teachers in this endeavor, we propose to combine these two approaches by means of a process where design takes into account the especial requirements posed by monitoring, and monitoring is informed by the characteristics of the scripts that must be met to achieve the learning goals. These desired features are obtained from the constraints defined by the collaborative-learning flow patterns on which the scripts are based. The result is an automated and higher-level view about the evolution of the learning process, integrating the data gathered from the different tools.

These interaction patterns depend on the roles assumed by participants in the learning process. In real practice, teachers need support to be able to detect these emergent roles and undesired interaction patterns, especially if collaboration is mediated by computers, and thus is not directly observable by humans. Interaction analysis (IA) methods and tools are adequate to support the regulation of the collaborative activities, using the analysis results to provide adequate feedback to the different participants in their specific roles.

CSCL is an interdisciplinary domain, which demands participatory design techniques that allow teachers to get directly involved in design activities. Developing CSCL designs using LD is a difficult task for teachers since LD is a complex technical specification and modelling collaborative characteristics can be tricky.

The empirical study, reported in this paper and grounded on mixed methods, provides evidence of the effort overload when teachers are involved in designing CSCL situations in a controlled environment.

Previous research has identified the knowledge gaps and communication among different stakeholders (especially, at the practitioner level) as critical factors for successful adoption of LA innovations. This paper aims to address these issues through the recognition that limited adoption at the practitioner level is not particular to LA technology. Under the label \u201corchestration\u201d, educational technology researchers have tried to refocus their work to emphasize the classroom-level constraints faced in everyday educational activities, in order to favor adoption. In this paper, we review both the learning analytics and orchestration literature to elicit the main aspects to consider in inter-stakeholder communication about the adoption of LA at the practitioner level. As a result of this review, we propose conceptual frameworks organizing these issues, and tools to support inter-stakeholder communication about LA adoption. We also provide examples that illustrate how researchers and practitioners are using these frameworks and tools to focus communication and decision-making during the adoption of LA innovations in Australia, Spain and Estonia.",

This is mainly because of its implementation as a one-way transmission of diagnostic information where students play a passive role as the information receivers. Dialogue around feedback can enhance students\u2019 sense making from feedback and capacities to act on it. Yet, dialogic feedback has been mostly implemented as an instructor-led activity, which is hardly affordable in large classrooms. Dialogic peer feedback can offer a scalable solution; however, current practices lack a systematic design, resulting in low learning gains. Attending to this gap, this paper presents a theoretical framework that structures dialogic feedback as a three-phase collaborative activity, involving different levels of regulation: first, planning and coordination of feedback activities \u2026",

We reviewed and synthesised existing literature on four focus areas related to LA, their adoption, implications for practice, and more general factors that have emerged as crucial when studying everyday classroom adoption of technologies (ie, classroom orchestration). This synthesis resulted in two conversational frameworks and an inter-stakeholder communication tool.

However, most of current across-spaces proposals are either highly teacher-centered, inflexible in the students' self-management of learning artifacts during the enactment, or allow the teacher little/no control of such students' management of artifacts. Moreover, these proposals tend to be disconnected from the practices and tools that are usual in the classroom. How can we achieve a middle ground between keeping the teacher in control of across-spaces situations and, at the same time, providing students with a degree of flexibility to manage learning artifacts? Aiming to address such a challenge we propose the notion of learning bucket, and the Bucket-Server, a system implementing such a notion. A learning bucket is a container of learning artifacts which are generated and/or accessed across-spaces by the students \u2026",

However, current classrooms are not limited anymore to books, blackboards and other physical artifacts: laptops, tablets, digital whiteboards, wikis, shared applications and simulations have also become part of this learning landscape. These last ones add new layers of complexity to the everyday educational practices and the dynamics of the classroom. CSCL researchers have traditionally proposed standalone systems or innovations, focusing their evaluation on the effects and management of a single system/intervention. However, everyday classroom activities involve multiple subject matters, different pedagogical approaches as well as a variety of technologies. The assumption that our innovation is alone no longer holds. The multiplicity and heterogeneity of resources (digital and legacy) pose a unique set of opportunities and challenges for the CSCL research community, which are bound to become stronger as time goes by. This collaborative workshop brought together technology designers, researchers and practitioners, in an attempt to match CSCL technologies to the pedagogical needs and contextual constraints of practitioners, identify a set of guidelines to design and connect existing CSCL systems with each other and with legacy classroom resources, and help teachers and students to make sense of these heterogeneous learning ecologies.",

Yet, to achieve rich, interactive, and creative collaborative learning settings CSCL tools need new flexible, dynamic and lightweight metaphors. This design tension between social and technology-mediated coordination is difficult to resolve and worthy of close analysis. In this paper, we study such a tension through the use of the Group Scribbles (GS) CSCL tool, developed at SRI International, a GUI-based approach that enables the creation and enactment of lightweight CSCL scenarios. The potential of GS, as well as its limita- tions and possible extensions are studied in relation to design scripts based on Collaborative Learning Flow Patterns. Preliminary experiences in an authentic environment illustrate several facets of the design tension, such as the participants' workload and awareness, or the adaptation to emergent situations. On the other hand, this study points out the need for a new flexible architec- ture that complements Group Scribbles.",

            "Abstract": "Distributed, highly coordinated activities for learning are becoming more and more important as we move further into the world of pervasive mobile computing. These activities can be explored and developed using GroupScribbles, a system to allow the easy creation and exchange of shared information. However, to have confidence in the efficacy of shared activities for learning at scale, we need to be able to model the relationship between the rules and tasks as communicated to the group, and individual behaviour and experience. Trace Theory is a formal modelling language that allows us to do this. We show how Trace Theory and GroupScribbles can be used to model and test different ways a jigsaw pattern of engagement can be implemented, with implications both for the design of emergent pervasive technologies and for acute thought about coordination and collaborative learning.",

To address this need, we propose to provide teachers with monitoring feedback guided by their pedagogical intentions. In particular, those pedagogical intentions captured in the scripts where teachers reflect their learning designs. In order to configure monitoring in alignment with such pedagogical intentions, a model that gathers all the necessary data elements is required.

            "Abstract": "Conceptual barriers are often cited as an important obstacle for the integration of innovative, ICT-enabled practice (such as CSCL) in authentic educational settings. Although professional development (PD) can be used to overcome these barriers, there is a dearth of descriptions of PD programs that foster change towards CSCL practice. This paper presents an approach to PD centered on the notion of orchestrating CSCL activities, and exemplifies it through teacher workshops. The evidence from a mixed methods evaluation of two such workshops highlights the potential of this approach in driving conceptual change, and increasing the perceived feasibility of using CSCL, even in limited-time PD interventions. The results also show the limitations of the approach when used in isolation, hinting at multi-level coordinated actions (e.g. institutional, policy-level ones) to further foster CSCL practice.",

Although the automation of the learning flow has been achieved in IMSLD, the automation of the data flow between tools is still an open issue. Nevertheless, no real case studies have been reported in the literature, that illustrate the existence and relevance of the problem. In this paper an authentic case study is analyzed and several findings indicate that in collaborative learning the data flow management is error-prone for the students; the data flow specification is error-prone for the course designer; as well as a reusability issue in data flow specification has been identified. All of them are relevant issues since the two former may potentially affect the students\u2019 learning objectives while the latter affects the reusability of the whole unit of learning (UoL). In order to address these issues while keeping interoperability with IMS-LD, we introduce a solution that separate the data flow specification from the learningflow one.",

These scenarios show that the analysis techniques and data collection and processing tools are flexible enough to be applied in different conditions.

Two approaches were used for training the models: in situ learning (in which an engagement indicator available at the time of the predictions is used as a proxy label to train a model within the same course) and transfer across courses (in which a model is trained using labels obtained from past course data).

However, this variety can make it difficult for researchers and teachers to assess the tool that is best suited to their objectives and contexts as learning designers. Several of the tools are presented elsewhere in this issue. In this article, the aforementioned tools are used as lenses to view the same learning design narrative - an inquiry-based learning lesson on healthy eating aimed at secondary-school students - from different perspectives, in a manner inspired by the plot structure of Kurosawa's film \"Rashomon\". In modelling the lesson on five tools, we uncovered similarities and differences in relation to the challenges posed by modelling a particular learning scenario, the ease of implementation of the computer-interpretable products' output by the tools and their different target audiences and pedagogical specialities. This comparative analysis thus illustrates some of the current underlying issues and challenges in the field of Learning Design.",

To tackle this situation, this paper proposes the development of an intelligent virtual domain expert, based on summarization, matching and neuro-fuzzy systems, able to detect incoherences about concepts, values, or references, in technical documentation. In this scope, an incoherence is seen as the lack of consistency between related documents. Each document is summarized in the form of 4-tuples terms, describing relevant ideas or concepts that must be free of incoherences. These representations are then matched using several well-known algorithms. The final decision about the real existence of an incoherence, and its relevancy, is obtained by training a neuro-fuzzy system with expert knowledge, based on the previous knowledge of the activity area and domain experts. The final system offers a semi-automatic solution for incoherence detection and decision support.",

The analysis of data from multiple events (including surveys, case studies, workshops with teachers, and platform usage analyses) led to a catalogue of IBL orchestration needs that can be tackled by aligning learning design and analytics, as well as a list of guidelines for technology development aiming to support IBL orchestration. These two contributions can support the creation of future learning analytics\u2013enhanced IBL environments that are both pedagogically grounded and usable by teachers in authentic settings.",

One of them regards the possibility to create groups according to a set of criteria, which is not currentlly supported by MOOC platforms. This paper presents our work in progress on this problem.

The preliminary results provide initial evidence about the feasibility and eventual advantages of using criteria-based group formation in MOOCs.",

To do so, educators can provide a script specifying the sequence of learning activities to be performed by students as well as the documents and tools required to support them. Gridcole can then search for these tools in a service-based grid in order to make them available to users whenever it is required. Significantly, these tools are not limited in terms of access to supercomputational capabilities or specific hardware resources. Furthermore, Gridcole can guide students during the realization of the collaborative learning scenario according to the sequence of activities defined in the script.",

Nevertheless by specifying this data flow between tools, several degrees of activity automation may augment the system intervention opportunities for data flow management. Service automation, data flow automation and data flow validation may enhance the continuity of the learning design realization, reduce the student's cognitive load and obtain system-support for error prone situations. In this paper a novel approach based on the composition of LD and a standard workflow technology is proposed. Unlike other current approaches, our approach maintains interoperability with both LD and workflow standards. Then an architectural solution based on the composition approach is presented.",

These problems can appear in several ways, and the produced effects are different, but a common situation exists in those areas of activity where many linked documents must be generated, managed and updated by different authors. This paper describes some examples of this problem in the case of a technical document corpus used amongst partners, and the solution framework developed for this case. Several types of incoherence have been detected and formulated, connected with problems described in other research areas such as information extraction and retrieval, text mining, document interpretation and others, but all of them have been bounded and introduced from the point of view of document incoherences and their effects, specially in a company context. Finally the computational architecture and methodology uses are described and some initial results of incoherence detection are discussed.",

However, although ICT is slowly permeating all aspects of our lives, technology has certainly not \u2018weaved itself into the fabric of everyday\u2019learning.Today, classrooms are complex technological ecosystems (Luckin, 2008), where practitioners are asked to design and enact non-trivial pedagogical learning activities, integrating a wide variety of tools (from pen and paper to digital whiteboards, laptops, webbased tools, etc.). Designing learning activities in this complex landscape, and managing them in real time within the multiple constraints of authentic educational contexts (lack of time, curriculum restrictions, student scaffolding, discipline, etc.) has been termed,\u2018orchestration\u2019by TEL researchers (Prieto, Holenko Dlab, Guti\u00e9rrez, Abdulwahed & Balid, 2011a). Fischer and Dillenbourg (2006) define orchestration as \u2018the process of productively coordinating supportive interventions across multiple learning activities occurring at multiple social levels\u2019. Integrating all these technological and pedagogical aspects in everyday teacher practice (and, hence, integrating orchestration in learning design thinking) is a challenge for researchers and practitioners in TEL.

Teachers are incorporating them increasingly into their practice, however it is not common to find both of them aligned. We are working on the definition of a learning design process that takes monitoring issues into account and leads to better and more efficient monitoring when the scripts are put into practice. Moreover, if the learning design is based on patterns, the information given by these patterns can help to shape this enhanced design process. This paper presents a pilot study where a participatory design approach was followed. The first author and a teacher co-designed a CSCL situation in higher education based on the Jigsaw pattern.

The first one, FasArt, is used to support a simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that inherits fine properties of ART architectures, such as fast and incremental learning, stability and modularity. On the other hand, RFasArt is a new recurrent version of FasArt which efficiently exploits contextual information in the task of logical labeling. The proposed system is extensively tested in two real-world applications, i.e. E-mail of printed business letter and digital library of scientific papers. Experimental results show logical labeling and OCR rates over 90%. The proposed system is better compared to a previous system proposed by the group, where instead of using contextual information in an integrated way, a postprocessing Viterbi-based model was employed.",

            "Abstract": "Research in the computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) field is currently tackling three important problems which are closely related: difficult integration of CSCL tools, scarce software reuse and technification. This work presents a Grid Collaborative Learning Environment (GRIDCOLE) that combines IMS learning design (IMS-LD) and Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) technologies in order to address these issues. More specifically, GRIDCOLE allows users with no technical skills easy integration and use of applications that effectively support collaborative learning processes. IMS-LD is employed to formally describe the design of these collaborative learning processes while applications are built using tools provided by third-party suppliers as OGSA-compliant Grid services. With this aim, the GRIDCOLE architecture and its main functionalities are introduced. A simple prototype is also presented in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A major issue that concerns course instructors of massive open online courses (MOOCs) is the low retention ratio of learners. One of the key factors of this problem is the lack of support and interactivity in MOOC discussion forums. The support provided to learners in MOOC forums is critical to retain their motivation. Teaching assistants (TAs) play a crucial role in providing support to learners within the discussion forums, so an interesting research subject is to study the approaches they follow. In this study, we investigate the TAs\u2019 instructional approaches through a mixed-methods approach. This has been performed on two MOOCs delivered through the OpenEdX platform. The goal was to assess the main characteristics of their interventions by using an evaluation framework derived from social constructivism theory and to capture the main issues of their approaches. The results of this study reveal that TAs did not promote problem-centered learning and collaboration, and they acted more as \u2018omniscient interlocutors\u2019 rather than as facilitators. Thus, these issues should be addressed, through either a guided learning design process by the instructors, and support to the TAs, regarding their intervention strategy in forums.",

Each presenter will analyze and discuss the same corpus of data. These streams of data analysis are then brought together in the fourth presentation, with a discussion of visualizing and synthesizing the findings, piecing together an elaborated understanding of scaffolding.

However, low student participation is a barrier that can result in inefficiencies in the implementation of peer reviews, disrupting student learning. In this regard, knowing earlier the estimate number of peer works that students will review may bring numerous pedagogical utilities in MOOCs. Previously, we have attempted to predict student participation in peer review in a MOOC context. Building on our previous work, in this study we propose an ensemble learning approach with a refined set of features. Results show that the prediction performance improves when a preceding classification model is trained to identify students with no peer-review participation and that the refined features were effective with more transferability to other contexts.",

            "Abstract": "As digital technologies permeate every aspect of our lives, the complexity of the educational settings, and of the technological support we use within them, unceasingly rises. This increased complexity, along with the need for educational practitioners to apply such technologies within multi-constraint authentic settings, has given rise to the notion of technology-enhanced learning practice as \u201corchestration of learning\u201d. However, at the same time, the complexity involved in evaluating the benefits of such educational technologies has also increased, prompting questions about the way evaluators can cope with the different places, technologies, informants and issues involved in their evaluation activity. By proposing the notion of \u201corchestrating evaluation\u201d, this paper tries to reconcile the often disparate \u201cfront office accounts\u201d of research publications and the \u201cshop floor practice\u201d of evaluation of educational technology, through the case study of evaluating a system to help teachers in coordinating computer-supported collaborative learning scenarios (GLUE!-PS). We reuse an internationally-evaluated conceptual framework of \u201corchestration aspects\u201d (design, management, adaptation, pragmatism, etc.) to structure the case\u2019s narrative, showing how the original evaluation questions and methods were modulated in the face of the multiple (authentic) evaluation setting constraints.",

These models require a high interaction level among students and are mainly oriented towards in-class scenarios. But when collaborative models are deployed in a distant scenario, user expressiveness is significantly reduced thus creating a gap that hinders the effectiveness of this collaboration. A computer-supported model provides a set of tools to compensate for the distant scenario and reduce this gap. This paper presents the issues and solutions derived from the design and deployment of a complex collaborative model in a distant scenario. The course structure was captured using the Learning Design specification, and an architecture based on virtual network computing was used to provide the required collaborative tools. The course was included as part of a regular undergraduate program in three higher educational institutions.",

Such strategies, when implemented properly, can boost the quality of MOOC pedagogy. Nonetheless, the use of collaborative groups in MOOCs is scarce due to several yet critical contextual factors (eg, massiveness, and variable levels of engagement) that hamper the group formation process. Therefore, there is a need for supporting MOOC teachers in the design and implementation of group formation policies when implementing collaborative strategies. This paper presents a study where two instruments were used to explore solutions to this need: a guide to support teachers during the planning of the group formation, and a technological tool to help them implement the collaborative groups designed and to monitor them.

For reflective academic writing tasks, which are common for university assessments, this is especially the case since students are often required to plan the task independently to be successful. The purpose of the current study was to examine different reflection behaviours of postgraduate students that were required to reflect on individual tasks over a fifteen-week-long higher education course. Forty students participated in a standardised questionnaire at the beginning of the course to assess their SRL competence and then participated in weekly individual reflection tasks on Google Docs. We examined students\u2019 reflective writing behaviours based on time-series and correlation analysis of fine-grained data retrieved from Google Docs. More specifically, reflection behaviours between students with high SRL and low SRL \u2026",

The concept of routines is posed as a useful analytical tool for researchers and a powerful mediating tool for teachers, as well as in professional development programs. Also, the importance of aligning design, technology and teacher actions (embodied by routines) for effective orchestration is briefly highlighted.Introduction: a vision of orchestrated CSCL",

            "Abstract": "Assessment is one of the key elements of learning scenarios, both in individual and collaborative learning. Thus, embedding assessment in Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) scripts can potentially enhance the enactment of collaborative learning sessions, by explicitly indicating how assessment is to be carried out. However, assessment design has also been recognized as a demanding task for non-expert instructional designers or practitioners. To tackle this problem, the use of learning and assessment patterns has already been reported as a way of supporting script design for non-experts. In this context, the combination of patterns of different nature (learning-oriented and assessment-oriented) can be regarded as an essential task of CSCL script design. This paper discusses how to support this task, focusing on the joint application of patterns, and describes an evaluation of the proposed approach.",

This kind of improvisatory adaptation of teaching, however, is seldom seen in everyday classroom practice of CSCL. This paper describes two independent research projects that aim to influence authentic classroom practices to promote this kind of teaching using the same collaborative learning tool, Group Scribbles. Evidence from both projects shows that merely providing technologies that support this adaptation is not enough to provoke the change and that exposing teachers to good uses of the tool (in the form of pedagogical patterns) also has limited success. Both projects highlight the difficulty for practitioners to bridge the gap between de-contextualized advice and contextualized classroom situations. We propose the use of more atomic, actionable moves to help teachers orchestrate technology to support deeper collaborative knowledge building.",

            "Abstract": "The use of patterns in e-learning is being recently proposed with different purposes and scopes. This paper provides a unifying view of several representative proposals in order to situate and introduce the types of patterns that can be used for generating collaboration scripts that are suitable of being computationally represented and interpreted by learning management systems (LMSs). The paper also presents a hierarchical structure that relates these patterns according to their focus and granularity. The structure shows how the different types of patterns are complementary and should be considered in the process of creating a script. In addition to authoring tools and LMSs, there are other types of tools in which the application of patterns may be useful. This paper points out these tools locating them along the \"life cycle\" of the scripts",

            "Abstract": "Many modern web-based systems provide a \u2018responsive\u2019 design that allows material and services to be accessed on mobile and desktop devices, with the aim of providing ubiquitous access. Besides offering access to learning materials such as podcasts and videos across multiple locations, mobile, wearable and ubiquitous technologies have some additional affordances that may enable new forms of learning on MOOCs. We can divide these into two categories: firstly, context-sensitive features including delivery of content for a specific location, enabling a seamless continuity of learning across settings, and linking people in a location with others in a virtual representation of that place; secondly social learning opportunities to connect people as they move within and across locations, to enable crowd-sourced learning. In this paper we explore these aspects of mobile and accessible learning for MOOCs, drawing on examples from MOOC courses, mobile toolkits, and crowd-sourced learning sites.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe the experience of designing a collaborative learning activity for a traditional historical/cultural museum. The activity, based on a\" Mystery in the Museum\" story, involves collaboration of small groups of students through mobile handheld devices. An application has been built that permits authoring of such activities, while a usability evaluation study was performed that revealed some of the limitations of the design. The reported findings can be of use to those interested in following similar approaches in cultural and educational settings, and draw conclusions of general interest relating to interaction and collaboration through mobile technology.",

            "Abstract": "CSCL systems can benefit from using grids since they offer a common infrastructure enabling access to an extended pool of resources that can provide supercomputing capabilities as well as specific hardware resources. Adopting a service oriented architecture such as OGSA can further benefit CSCL systems, enabling increased flexibility to adapt and reuse learning software offered by third party providers. However, service discovery is a challenge for educators, since they cannot use their own domain abstractions to search for learning services that may support their educational settings. Common service discovery mechanisms, such as the Index Service or UDDI, provide limited discovery capabilities since they rely on keyword matching and cannot deal with the description of service properties. In order to address these drawbacks, formal semantics of ontologies can be employed to represent semantic \u2026",

The first stage performs prototype extraction of the training data using a Fuzzy ARTMAP based method. These prototypes are able to improve the performance of the second stage consisting of LVQ codebooks by means of providing the aforementioned explicit knowledge on shapes and execution plans. The proposed recognizer has been tested on the UNIPEN international database achieving an average recognition rate of 90.15%, comparable to that reached by humans and other recognizers found in literature.",

            "Abstract": "Interaction analysis has become a basic function in the field of collaborative learning, as a means for supporting both regulation and evaluation of collaborative learning processes. In spite of the fact that these processes rely on the same basic functionalities, there is a lack of proposals or systems that integrate them. The most outstanding difference between the tools that support either of the approaches is that they are oriented to different types of users. Then, an interaction analysis tool able to adapt to different roles would be able to perform both functionalities. This paper presents an experience performed in an authentic learning scenario using interaction analysis for supporting regulation for students and evaluation for teachers adapting its functionality depending on analysis needs of teacher and learners that participate in the activity. A first evaluation carried out shows that the participants assess positively this \u2026",
