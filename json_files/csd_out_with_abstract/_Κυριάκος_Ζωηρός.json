Implementation of this technology critically relies on the capability of processing RF signals in the optical layer. A Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) which incorporates semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) is an attractive scheme for executing all-optically the important task of RF signal frequency transposition via mixing function. In this paper we present the progress and main outcomes obtained so far on the work carried-out to achieve this goal under collaborative project `Choraal'.

Also, the integrated management of the overall ecosystem demands the provision of end-to-end interconnection, quality assurance, the definition of strict security policies, collaborative integration and correlation of events. In this respect, every design detail can be critical to the success or failure of a costly and ambitious project, such as that of smart energy networks.

The filters are implemented using as the building architecture the optical delay interferometer (ODI) and the microring resonator (MRR). We formulate and follow a rational procedure, which involves identifying and applying the appropriate conditions for the filters\u2019 spectral response slope related to the SOA pattern effect suppression mechanism. We thus extract the values of the free spectral range and detuning of each filter, which allow one to equivocally realize the pursued comparison. We define suitable performance metrics and obtain simulation results for each filter. The quantitative comparison reveals that most employed metrics are better with the MRR than with the ODI. Although the difference in performance is small, it is sufficient to justify considering also using the MRR for the intended purpose. Finally, we concisely discuss practical implementation issues of these notch filters and further make a qualitative comparison between them in terms of their inherent advantages and disadvantages. This discussion reveals that each scheme has distinct features that render it appropriate for supporting SOA direct signal amplification applications with a suppressed pattern effect.

We specify the necessary conditions that must hold in order for the MRR to act as notch filter and compensate for the uneven spectral broadening of the amplified data pulses. This procedure allows us to find the permissible range of values of the MRR radius and suitably select this parameter so that the defined design criteria are satisfied and the employed figure-of-merits are acceptable. If designed and constructed as suggested, which is feasible with state-of-the-art technology, the MRR-based notch filter enables to significantly improve the pattern-dependent SOA performance and the quality characteristics of the amplified signal.",

Starting from the continuous growth of bandwidth demand that is fuelled by the massive use of Internet and multimedia applications, the attractive features of optical fibers that have rendered them the primary transmission medium are underlined and the modern optical multiplexing techniques that enhance their performance are presented. Particular attention is given on Wavelength Division Multiplexing and Optical Time Division Multiplexing concerning their advantages, problems, technical maturity and combination to effectively increase capacity. The evolution of telecommunications networks that rely on electronic switching is reported with emphasis on the bandwidth-handling mismatch between the optical layer and the higher Synchronous Digital Hierarchy and Internet Protocol layers. The perspectives of electronic switching are described focusing on the technical restrictions that are imposed by its use due to the inevitable opto-electrical conversions at the users\" nodes. The mandatory need for moving towards all-optical packet switching networks through the development and implementation of all-optical digital fiber logic modules is demonstrated and the fact that the adoption of this technological option is inevitable in order to provide versatile, high quality and reliable services is justified.

In this paper we present work performed with a three terminal SOA-assisted Sagnac interferometer.

By using explicit expressions for the phase response and its temporal derivative and applying a numerical model, a set of curves is obtained that allows us to investigate and assess the dependence of the function of interest on the critical operational parameters. From their interpretation, the basic design rules that must govern them in order for its profile to acquire a form suitable for practical exploitation are extracted. These suggest that the combination of the energy of the driving control pulses and the small signal gain of the SOA must be such that the latter is biased to operate up to the medium saturation regime. Moreover, the width of these pulses must not exceed 10% of their allocated time slot, while the role of the loop asymmetry and \u2026",

The BFL is employed for suppressing the pattern effect on directly amplified data in a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). The analysis is conducted by describing the non-optimum BFL transmission response using Jones matrix method. This allows to formulate a comprehensive model, which is validated by comparing it to the experiment. Then we investigate and specify how sensitive the BFL is to imperfections of its building components by assessing its performance against the output amplitude modulation, power penalty, and crosstalk. For each critical operating parameter, we derive the tolerance range within which these performance metrics are acceptable. The obtained results suggest that the BFL can efficiently mitigate the SOA pattern effect \u2026",

            "Publication url": "https://www.mdpi.com/786194",
            "Abstract": "The feasibility of employing a birefringent fiber loop to enhance the performance of a directly modulated reflective semiconductor optical amplifier is experimentally demonstrated for the first time. The birefringent fiber loop acts as an optical filter of opposite slope than that of the reflective semiconductor optical amplifier electro-optical response and counteracts the finite reflective semiconductor optical amplifier modulation bandwidth of only 0.89 GHz. By proper adjustment of its detuning, the birefringent fiber loop tailors the spectral components that physically manifest due to the reflective semiconductor optical amplifier dynamic perturbation subject to direct modulation in the saturated gain regime, and suppresses the pattern-dependent distortions in the time domain. In this manner, the birefringent fiber loop manages to significantly improve the quality characteristics of the encoded signal at higher data rates than those enabled by the reflective semiconductor optical amplifier limited modulation capability. Owing to the birefringent fiber loop, the reflective semiconductor optical amplifier modulation range is extended to 4 Gb/s at the raw bit error rate of 1.0\u00d7 10\u2212 9, and to 11 Gb/s at the forward error correction limit of 3.8\u00d7 10\u2212 3. These results, which are unique against the evaluation criterion adopted in the first case, and the modulation speed achieved with post-filtering schemes in the second, highlight the beneficial role that the birefringent fiber loop can play in supporting reflective semiconductor optical amplifier operation for intensity amplification and modulation purposes.

The unobstructed employment of this technology critically depends on its robustness against atmospheric impairments, such as scintillation. A semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) in conjunction with optical filtering can act as amplitude equalizer to restore the quality of the impaired FSO signal. In this paper we propose to exploit as hard limiter a SOA whose current is directly modulated by non-return-to-zero (NRZ) electrical data pulses that correspond to the distorted FSO signal components. Moreover, we employ after the SOA two microring resonators (MRRs), which are configured as notch filters and are detuned toward opposite sidebands to mutually compensate for the SOA bandwidth-limited modulation response.

Owing to the remarkable advancements that have been achieved in the field, SOAs are commercially available devices that exhibit several important properties, such as strong nonlinearities, low power consumption, wavelength flexibility, large dynamic range, fast response, broadband and versatile operation, small footprint, and capability for scalable integration in single chips at affordable cost [17]. These attractive characteristics have rendered SOAs core elements for the accomplishment of critical and indispensable tasks at fundamental [18] and system-oriented [19] level. Thus, SOAs have widely been adopted both by the research community and the industrial sector as a principal technological platform for the realization of a diverse range of applications with high performance.",

The reconfiguration of the scheme that allows conversion from one gate to the other is achieved by simply turning on or off a clock signal, while the complement of one of the data signals is used too as input for both gates. By conducting a numerical simulation, the conditions under which the QD-SOA-based MZI must be adjusted to operate so as to simultaneously ensure an acceptable extinction ratio for the NOR and amplitude modulation for the NAND are specified. This procedure is more demanding than when each gate is considered separately.

            "Abstract": "A theoretical and experimental performance analysis of a semiconductor optical amplifier-Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (SOA-MZI) photonic sampling mixer used as a frequency up-converter is presented employing Switching and Modulation architectures. An active mode-locked laser, generating 2 ps-width pulses at a repetition rate equal to 10 GHz, is used as a sampling source. An optical carrier intensity modulated by a sinusoidal signal at 1 GHz is up-converted to 9 GHz and 39 GHz. High conversion gains (CGs) of about 15 dB are demonstrated for the frequency conversion to 9 GHz using both architectures, whereas up to 4 dB and 9 dB for the conversion to 39 GHz employing switching and modulation architectures, respectively. Small-signal equations for the up-converted signal in both architectures are formulated and developed, which permit to quantify the CG from closed-form expressions. The numerically \u2026",

From the theoretical analysis it has been found that such extension cannot be done without employing this passive element for any selection of the critical parameters but the SOA carrier lifetime, for which the requirements are yet very demanding. If, however, the time delay introduced by the ODI is adjusted to almost 1/3rd of the bit period, then the result of Boolean XOR operation can be improved for a specified range of parameter values, which can be further selected to be more relaxed than is possible when the ODI is not being used.

The main interest in these structures arises from our previous study which revealed their support of backward surface and possibly backward leaky waves. Moreover these structures exhibit non-reciprocal phenomena. These phenomena are studied thoroughly by using our two - dimensional curvilinear frequency domain finite difference (2D-FDFD) method, modified appropriately for the eigenanalysis of periodic structures. The present effort is particularly focused on the study of the non-reciprocal phenomena involved in periodic structures loaded with magnetized ferrites.",

The technique exploits the dynamic characteristics of a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) together with the interferometric properties of a cascaded optical delay interferometer (ODI). By conducting numerical simulation we have investigated the impact of the SOA and ODI critical operating parameters on the performance of the FSO communication system. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of the scheme and its capability of efficiently mitigating the amplitude and phase variations, as quantified by the achievement of acceptable metrics. Thus the technique can enhance the robustness of FSO links against atmospheric impairments, including scintillation, and allow for better quality and more reliable interconnections.",

The experimental results reveal the improvements in the quality characteristics of the encoded signal compared to those achieved with a single-stage BFL. The observed trends are complemented by numerical simulations, which allow to investigate the impact of the double-stage BFL detuning and specify how this critical parameter must be selected for enhanced performance. Provided that it is properly tailored, the proposed optical notch filtering scheme efficiently compensates for the pattern-dependent SOA response and enables this element to be employed as intensity modulator with improved performance at enhanced data speeds.",

The phase response of the ODI, which through its variation per time increment determines the chirp, is calculated at its crossed output port using an explicit expression. The theoretical analysis reveals that cascading the ODI after the SOA can reduce both the magnitude of the chirp and the variations of its peaks as well as those of the amplified pulses while ensuring error-free performance even for a tight combination of the critical parameters. In order for this goal to be successfully accomplished while not distorting the pulses acted on by the ODI the offset introduced by this passive element is computationally found \u2026",
