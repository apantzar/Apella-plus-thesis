            "Abstract": "Fractal interpolation functions are very useful in capturing data that exhibit an irregular (non-smooth) structure. Two new methods to identify the vertical scaling factors of such functions are presented. In particular, they minimize the area of the symmetric difference between the bounding volumes of the data points and their transformed images. Comparative results with existing methods are given that establish the proposed ones as attractive alternatives. In general, they outperform existing methods for both low and high compression ratios. Moreover, lower and upper bounds for the vertical scaling factors that are computed by the first method are presented.",

In this paper, we present a descriptor which can be used for content based retrieval of 3D pottery. The descriptor carries morphological features which are extracted from a set of sequential plane-based contours which are vertical to the vessel\u2019s axis of symmetry. The feature extraction is performed after the completion of a pre-processing phase, which involves scale and pose normalisation of the vessel. The latter is a recursive algorithm that takes advantage of the rotational symmetry property found in vessels. We developed a software tool that implements the above and we performed initial testing on vessel\u2019s main body shape matching using a 3D vessel database composed by both manually modelled and digitised 3D artefacts.",

This descriptor uses intersection counts to determine the presence of boundaries in the support volume. These boundaries can be used to recognise local shape similarity.

This descriptor is the concatenation of three sub-descriptors which capture topological as well as geometric information of the 3D face scans. The motivation behind the proposed hybrid facial expression descriptor is the fact that some facial expressions, like happiness and surprise, are characterized by obvious changes in the mouth topology while others, like anger, fear and sadness, produce geometric but no significant topological changes.

For representative eukaryotes (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cereviciae, Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana) we have demonstrated the existence of long-range correlations for the distances separating oligonucleotides of sizes 4, 5 and 6, which carry a promoter signature. This observation is independent of the consensus sequence used by the organism, as in the case of O. sativa (which mainly uses the CG promoter box) and A. thaliana (which mainly uses the TATA promoter box). If we use two parameters to characterise the size distribution separating oligonucleotides, we observe that oligonucleotides containing promoter signatures cluster together, away from the others.",

Our method is unique in many respects. First, SOMAnet is based on the Inception architecture, departing from the usual siamese framework. This spares expensive data preparation (pairing images across cameras) and allows the understanding of what the network learned. Second, and most notably, the training data consists of a synthetic 100K instance dataset, SOMAset, created by photorealistic human body generation software.

We couple progressive hulls with a selective refinement framework and use them in applications involving intersection queries on the mesh. We demonstrate that selectively refinable progressive hulls considerably speed up intersection queries by efficiently locating intersection points on the mesh. Concerning the progressive hull construction, we propose a new formula for assigning edge collapse priorities that significantly accelerates the simplification process, and enhance the existing algorithm with several conditions aimed at producing higher quality hulls. Using progressive hulls has the added advantage that they can be used instead of the enclosed object when a lower resolution \u2026",

The algorithm is based on the use of depth buffers and is suitable for polygonal meshes and parametric surfaces. The presented method unifies and extends our previous approaches under a single general algorithm; three practical variants are then given that implement it on different generations of graphics hardware in order to achieve high performance. The implementations for older hardware impose certain limitations on the depth complexity of the object.",

In contrast, a large body of work exists in the field of biometrics which has a different goal: the recognition of human subjects. Due to this disparity of interest, existing methods for retrieval based on demographic attributes tend to lag behind the more well-studied algorithms designed purely for face matching. The question this raises is whether a face recognition system could be leveraged to solve these other problems and, if so, how effective it could be. In the current work, we explore the limits of such a system for gender and ethnicity identification given (1) a ground truth of demographically-labeled, textureless 3-D models of human faces and (2) a state-of-the-art face-recognition algorithm.

Thirty-one cases of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma have been scanned before and after two and after four cycles of treatment. For each patient, we calculated the fractal and multifractal dimensions using the box-counting method on the digitalised PET/CT images of all three studies to assess the therapeutic outcome. We modelled the spreading of malignant cells in the body via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to address the dynamical evolution of the metastatic process and to predict the spatial distribution of malignant lesions. Our analysis shows that the fractal dimensions which describe the tracer dispersion in the body decrease consistently with the deterioration of the patient\u2019s therapeutic outcome condition. In 20 out of 24 cases, the fractal analysis results match those of the treatment outcome as defined by the oncologists, while 7 cases are considered as special cases because the patients had non-tumour-related findings or side effects which affect the results. The decrease in the fractal dimensions with the deterioration of the patient conditions (in terms of disease progression) is attributed to the hierarchical localisation of the tracer which accumulates in the affected lesions and does not spread homogeneously throughout the body. Fractality emerges as a result of the migration patterns which the malignant cells follow for propagating within the body (circulatory system \u2026",

The order of collapses is determined by a compound metric which takes into account the field and domain error incurred as well as the quality of the resulting mesh. Special attention is given to the preservation of the mesh boundary and of critical points on the vector field.

As opposed to the SI and 3DSC, which both count point samples, the RICI uses intersection counts with the mesh surface, and is therefore noise-free. For efficient RICI construction, novel algorithms of general interest were developed. These include an efficient circle-triangle intersection algorithm and an algorithm for projecting a point into SI-like (\u03b1, \u03b2) coordinates. The \u2019clutterbox experiment\u2019 is also introduced as a better way of evaluating descriptors\u2019 response to clutter. The SI \u2026",

The first achieves high accuracy but is suitable for sequences consisting of clean meshes, such as artificial sequences or highly post-processed real sequences, while the second one is robust and suitable for noisy meshes, such as those that often result from unprocessed scanning or 3D surface reconstruction errors. The first method uses a spatio-temporal descriptor based on the trajectories of 6 salient points of the human body (i.e. the centroid, the top of the head and the ends of the two upper and two lower limbs) from which a set of kinematic features are extracted. The resulting features are transformed using the wavelet transformation in different scales and a set of statistics are used to obtain the descriptor.

Our methodology is the following: for each person or object, we perform 2 independent recordings, one used for learning and the other one for test purposes. For each recorded frame, a 3D-mesh is computed by simple triangulation from the filtered depth image. The feature we use for recognition is the normalized histogram of directions of normal vectors to the 3D-mesh facets. We consider each training frame as a separate example, and the training is done with a multilayer perceptron with 1 hidden layer. For our 3D person facial identification experiments, 3 different persons were used, and we obtain a global correct rank-1 recognition rate of up to 80%, measured on test frames from an independent 3D video. For our 3D object recognition experiment, we have considered 3 different objects, and obtain a correct single-frame recognition rate of 95%, and checked that the method is quite robust to variation of distance from depth camera to object. These first experiments show that 3D object recognition or 3D face identification, with a time-of-flight 3D camera, seems feasible, despite the high level of noise in the obtained real depth images.",

Cross-time registration is a special case where the objects to be registered are instances of the same object after undergoing processes such as erosion or restoration. Traditional registration techniques are inadequate to address this problem with the required high accuracy for detecting minute changes; some are extremely slow. A deep learning registration framework for cross-time registration is proposed which uses the DeepGMR network in combination with a novel down-sampling scheme for cross-time registration.

During enrollment, subject-specific 3D models are constructed using 3D+2D data. For recognition, 2D images are represented in a normalized image space using the gallery 3D models and landmark-based 3D-2D projection estimation.

The first two minimize the area of the symmetric difference between the bounding volumes of the data points and their transformed images, while the latter aims at achieving the same box-counting dimension between the original and the reconstructed data.

The proposed architecture initially compresses the images sequentially using the quad tree decomposition algorithm. In the sequel, at the receiver side, the image is reconstructed as a lossy image, based on the available successfully received data packets, while afterwards the proposed scheme applies the image inpainting algorithm, in order to restore any missing partitions of the image.

Instantaneous frequency is an important complex trace attribute, and it is generally used for identifying specific seismic events, such as abnormal attenuation and thin bed tuning. Although the definition itself is clear, in practice, the calculation varies considerably and deviates from the definition. As a result, there is little consistency in the calculation of the instantaneous frequency. We thus adopt a robust and reliable scientific process to objectively compare various implementations of the instantaneous frequency. To this end, we start by reviewing four classic algorithms for instantaneous frequency computation and efficient approximations and point out several issues and weaknesses of these algorithms.

An action is represented by a mesh sequence wherein each frame is represented by a static shape descriptor. Six state-of-the-art static descriptors are used to extract meaningful information of the mesh objects in the sequence. These descriptors are first examined in terms of similarity performance using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Then, they are utilized in the action retrieval problem, where the query is a 3D mesh sequence. Each descriptor for an action, is considered as a multidimensional curve which traverses the corresponding points. The temporal similarity estimation is achieved by two variations of the descriptor's normalization in the context of Multidimensional Dynamic Time Warping.

The architecture exploits parallel processing and minimizes memory operations by implementing an efficient metric and an extended-access memory scheme. The employed data reutilization technique reduces overall throughput allowing the use of a single FPGA. Results reveal that the hardware system accelerates the software method by an order of magnitude and its processing rate surpasses the typical rate of a dynamic Integral Imaging acquisition system, making it suitable for robust 3D image and video reconstruction applications.",

A novel retrieval scheme for such data is introduced in this paper. It is the first spatio-temporal retrieval scheme ever used for retrieval in dynamic sequences of 3D face scans. The proposed scheme automatically detects specific facial landmarks and uses them to create a spatio-temporal descriptor. At first, geometric as well as topological information of the 3D face scans is captured by using the detected landmarks. In the sequel, the aforementioned spatial information is filtered by using wavelet transformation, resulting to our final spatio-temporal descriptor. Our descriptor is invariant to the number of the 3D face scans of a facial expression sequence. The proposed retrieval scheme exploits the Square of \u2026",

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is often used to detect, characterize and quantify MS lesions in the brain, due to the detailed structural information that it can provide. Manual detection and measurement of MS lesions in MRI data is time-consuming, subjective and prone to errors. Therefore, multiple automated methodologies for MRI-based MS lesion segmentation have been proposed. Here, a review of the state-of-the-art of automatic methods available in the literature is presented.The current survey provides a categorization of the methodologies in existence in terms of their input data handling, their main strategy of segmentation and their type of supervision.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel method for human face modeling and its application to face relighting and recognition. An annotated face model is fitted onto the raw 3D data using a subdivision-based deformable model framework. The fitted face model is subsequently converted to a geometry image representation. This results in regularly sampled, registered and annotated geometry data. The albedo of the skin is retrieved by using an analytical skin reflectance model that removes the lighting (shadows, diffuse and specular) from the texture. Additional provisions are made such that if the input contains over-saturated specular highlights, an inpainting method with texture synthesis is used as a post-processing step in order to estimate the texture. The method is fully automatic and uses as input only the 3D geometry and texture data of the face, as acquired by commercial 3D scanners. No measurement or calibration of the lighting environment is required. The method's fully automatic nature and its minimum input requirements make it applicable to both computer vision applications (e.g., face recognition) and computer graphics applications (i.e., relighting, face synthesis and facial expressions transfer). Moreover, it allows the utilization of existing 3D facial databases. We present very encouraging results on a challenging dataset .",

Local shape similarity is quantified by averaging the minimum weighted distances associated with pairs of dFPFH values calculated on the partial query and the target object.

However, certain pose variations often result in missing facial data. This is common in realistic scenarios, such as uncontrolled environments and uncooperative subjects. Most previous 3D face recognition methods do not handle extensive missing data as they rely on frontal scans. Currently, there is no method to perform recognition across scans of different poses. A unified method that addresses the partial matching problem is proposed. Both frontal and side (left or right) facial scans are handled in a way that allows interpose retrieval operations. The main contributions of this paper include a novel 3D landmark detector and a deformable model framework that supports symmetric fitting. The landmark detector is utilized to detect the pose of the facial scan. This information is \u2026",

To our knowledge, no algorithm can perform P3DMR on a database having significant size (eg, 100K 3D models) that includes polygon soup and other not-so-well-defined shape representations. In this paper, we propose a scalable P3DMR algorithm called Part-based 3D model retrieval by Randomized Sub-Volume Partitioning, or P3D-RSVP. To match a partial query with a set of (whole) 3D models in the database, P3D-RSVP iteratively partitions a 3D model into a set of sub-volumes by using 3D grids having randomized intervals and orientations.

An action is composed of a mesh sequence, wherein each frame is represented by a static shape descriptor. Six state-of-the-art static descriptors are used to extract meaningful information for each sequence. Firstly, these descriptors are examined in terms of frame-to-frame similarity by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Then, they are utilized in the action retrieval problem, where the query is an entire 3D mesh sequence. Each action is a multidimensional curve which traverses the points defined by the vectors of each descriptor. The estimation of similarity between actions is achieved by calculating the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between the corresponding curves. The retrieval performance is further examined when the Sakoe band is used to constrain the search \u2026",

A useful aid in such a process is the simulation of the stone degradation process. The first step in such a process is to create realistic digital representations of stones. In this work we present early efforts to create 3D voxelized representations of stones from given 2D example-textures of the desired stone-material. The process aims at the creation of 3D stone materials, consistent with 2D samples. The presented work is one part of the PRESIOUS EU project.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper a novel object signature is proposed for 3D object retrieval and partial matching. A part-based representation is obtained by partitioning the objects into subparts and by characterizing each segment with different geometric descriptors. Therefore, a Bag of Words framework is introduced by clustering properly such descriptors in order to define the so called 3D visual vocabulary. In this fashion, the object signature is defined as a histogram of 3D visual word occurrences. Several examples on the Aim@ Shape watertight dataset demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method in matching either 3D objects with articulated shape changes or partially occluded or compound objects. In particular, a comparison with the methods that participated to the Shape Retrieval contest 2007 (SHREC) reports satisfactory results for both object retrieval and partial matching.",

The unconstrained acquisition of data from uncooperative subjects may result in facial scans with significant pose variations along the yaw axis. Such pose variations can cause extensive occlusions, resulting in missing data. In this paper, a novel 3D face recognition method is proposed that uses facial symmetry to handle pose variations. It employs an automatic landmark detector that estimates pose and detects occluded areas for each facial scan. Subsequently, an Annotated Face Model is registered and fitted to the scan. During fitting, facial symmetry is used to overcome the challenges of missing data. The result is a pose invariant geometry image.

Unlike 2D facial images, 3D facial data are less affected by lighting conditions and pose. Recent advances in the computer vision field have enabled the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the production of 3D facial reconstructions from 2D facial images. This paper proposes a novel CNN-based method which targets 3D facial reconstruction from two facial images, one in front and one from the side, as are often available to law enforcement agencies (LEAs). The proposed CNN was trained on both synthetic and real facial data. We show that the proposed network was able to predict 3D faces in the MICC Florence dataset with greater accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, a scheme for using the proposed network in cases where only one facial image is available is also presented. This is achieved by introducing an additional network whose task is to generate a rotated version of the original image, which in conjunction with the original facial image, make up the image pair used for reconstruction via the previous method.",

It is also faster to compute and compare. The clutter resistance of the RICI is mainly due to the design of a novel distance function, capable of disregarding clutter to a great extent. As opposed to the SI and 3DSC, which both count point samples, the RICI uses intersection counts with the mesh surface, and is therefore noise-free. For efficient RICI construction, novel algorithms of general interest were developed. These include an efficient circle-triangle intersection algorithm and an algorithm for projecting a point into SI-like (, ) coordinates. The'clutterbox experiment'is also introduced as a better way of evaluating descriptors' response to clutter. The SI \u2026",

These applications often require the retrieval of specific facial areas (such as the nasal region). The most crucial step in facial region retrieval is the detection of key 3D facial landmarks (eg, the nose tip). A key advantage of 3D facial data over 2D facial data is their pose invariance. Any landmark detection method must therefore also be pose invariant. In this paper, we present the first 3D facial landmark detection method that works in datasets with pose rotations of up to 80\u25e6 around the y-axis. It is tested on the largest publicly available 3D facial datasets, for which we have created a ground truth by manually annotating the 3D landmarks. Landmarks automatically detected by our method are then used to robustly retrieve facial regions from 3D facial datasets.",

One such popular method for extracting an isosurface from volume data is the Marching Cubes (MC) algorithm, which creates a polygon mesh by sampling the data at the vertices of the cubes of a 3D grid. We present a method for isosurface approximation that uses the vertex extraction phase of the MC algorithm, but subsequently represents the data by fractal interpolation surfaces instead of a polygon mesh. The proposed method is appropriate for isosurfaces that are not locally flat, such as natural structures. Another advantage is that a coarser grid resolution can typically be used, since fractal interpolation surfaces are particularly good at representing detailed, irregular or self-similar structures. Thus for many cases the resulting isosurface is more accurate and more compact. The multiresolution extension of the method is also straightforward. Experimental data verify the practical usefulness of the proposed method.",

During authentication, the probe 2D images are projected onto a normalized image space using the subject-specific 3D model in the gallery. Then, a bidirectional relighting algorithm and two similarity metrics (a view-dependent complex wavelet structural similarity and a global similarity) are employed to compare the gallery and probe. We tested our algorithms on the UHDB11 and UHDB12 databases that contain 3D data with probe images under large lighting and pose variations. The experimental results show the robustness of our approach in recognizing faces in difficult situations.",

To estimate the modified axis-aligned bounding box, a set of predefined planes of symmetry are used and a combined spatial and angular distance, between the 3D object and its symmetric object, is calculated. By minimizing the combined distance, the 3D object fits inside its modified axis-aligned bounding box and alignment with the coordinate system is achieved.

Not only is face recognition one of the most widely accepted modalities, but also advances in processing power have allowed the development of more complex algorithms while still providing a relatively rapid response to queries. Ear recognition, on the other hand, is a relatively new field. However, it holds a lot of promise as the complexity of the human ear is even higher than that of the face, and ears are subject to fewer deformations. In addition, the problem of recognizing an ear is not too different from that of recognizing a face. Therefore, part of the large body of research available in 3D face recognition can be inherited to 3D ear recognition. Both face and ear recognition require no contact with the subject, thus being more easily accepted by the public, compared to other biometrics such as fingerprints.Face \u2026",

The MEG data are rst transformed to generic Talairach coordinates and then displayed within the model brain as arrows (giving the directional, positional and magnitude characteristics of MEG dipoles). Due to this transformation MEG data from di erent subjects can be displayed within the same model brain for comparison. The model brain and the functional brain data can be simultaneously manipulated in 3D in real time. The MEG dipoles can be animated according to their latency after stimulus onset. Our visualizations are providing new insights to the specialists that will facilitate (among others) the design of algorithms for the comparison of MEG data sets.",

            "Abstract": "Automatic computation of breast volume data is required in post-mastectomy breast reconstructive surgery, where it is very useful to have an estimate of the volume of the tissue to be extracted in advance of the operation. Such an automated process is essential when conducting studies on large patient databases where manual volume estimation is both tedious and subjective. In this paper, we present a noninvasive automatic breast volume estimation method. It employs 3D scanned data of the torso. First, a surface underneath the breast that resembles a 'breast-less' torso is automatically constructed, and then the volume of the breast is estimated as a function of the difference between the new surface and the actual breast. We have performed a number of experiments on both synthetic and real data with very encouraging results.",

Fractal interpolation literature focuses mainly on functions, i.e. on data points linearly ordered with respect to their abscissa. In practice, however, it is often useful to model curves as well as functions using fractal intepolation techniques. After reviewing existing methods for curve fitting using fractal interpolation, we introduce a new method that provides a more economical representation of curves than the existing ones. Comparative results show that the proposed method provides smaller errors or better compression ratios.",

            "Abstract": "It has recently been shown in Re-Identification (Re-ID) work that full-body images of people reveal their somatotype, even after change in apparel. A significant advantage of this biometric trait is that it can easily be captured, even at a distance, as a full-body image of a person, taken by a standard 2D camera. In this work, full-body image-based somatotype is investigated as a novel soft biometric feature for person recognition at a distance and on-the-move. The two common scenarios of (i) identification and (ii) verification are both studied and evaluated. To this end, two different deep networks have been recruited, one for the identification and one for the verification scenario. Experiments have been conducted on popular, publicly available datasets and the results indicate that somatotype can indeed be a valuable biometric trait for identity recognition at a distance and on-the-move (and hence also suitable for non-collaborative individuals) due to the ease of obtaining the required images. This soft biometric trait can be especially useful under a wider biometric fusion scheme. View Full-Text",

The 2D features are Fourier coefficients extracted from three pairs of depth buffers which are computed for each Cartesian plane capturing the model's thickness along each axis. The 3D features are spherical harmonic coefficients extracted from a spherical function based representation that captures the model's surface as well as volume information.",

Finally, we apply a second linear dimensionality reduction step to the wavelet coefficients using Linear Discriminant Analysis and compute a compact biometric signature. Although this biometric signature consists of just 57 coefficients, it is highly discriminant. Our approach, UR3D-C, is experimentally validated using four publicly available databases (FRGC vl, FRGC v2, Bosphorus and BU-3DFE).

A possible step toward improving region merging is to enhance the continuity (refers to the extent of the fault regions, not to the seismic reflection itself) beforehand.

The main issue is learning these features. We propose a datadriven approach where the best view selection problem is formulated as a classification and feature selection problem; First a 3D model is described with a set of view-based descriptors, each one computed from a different viewpoint. Then a classifier is trained, in a supervised manner, on a collection of 3D models belonging to several shape categories. The classifier learns the set of 2D views that maximize the similarity between shapes of the same class and also the views that discriminate shapes of different classes. Our experiments using the LightField (LFD) descriptors and the Princeton Shape Benchmark demonstrate the performance of the approach and its suitability for classification and online visual browsing of 3D data collections.",

            "Abstract": "A method for the reconstruction of 3D shape and texture from integral photography (IP) images is presented. Sharing the same principles with stereoscopic-based object reconstruction, it offers increased robustness to noise and occlusions due to the unique characteristics of IP images. A coarse-to-fine approach is used, employing what we believe to be a novel grid refinement step in order to increase the quality of the reconstructed objects. The proposed method's properties include configurable depth accuracy and direct and seamless triangulation. We evaluate our method using synthetic data from a computer-simulated IP setup as well as real data from a simple yet effective digital IP setup. Experiments show reconstructed objects of high-quality indicating that IP can be a competitive modality for 3D object reconstruction.",

            "Abstract": "A method for the determination of pixel correspondence in stereo image pairs is presented. The optic flow vectors that result from the displacement of the point of projection are obtained and the correspondence between pixels of the various objects in the scene is derived from the optic flow vectors. The proposed algorithm is implemented and the correspondence vectors are obtained. Various specialized improvements of the method are implemented and thoroughly tested on sequences of image pairs giving rise to interesting conclusions. The algorithm is highly-parallelizable and therefore suitable for real-time applications.",

            "Abstract": "Facial landmark detection is a crucial first step in facial analysis for biometrics and numerous other applications. However, it has proved to be a very challenging task due to the numerous sources of variation in 2D and 3D facial data. Although landmark detection based on descriptors of the 2D and 3D appearance of the face has been extensively studied, the fusion of such feature descriptors is a relatively under-studied issue. In this report, a novel generalized framework for combining facial feature descriptors is presented, and several feature fusion schemes are proposed and evaluated. The proposed framework maps each feature into a similarity score, combines the individual similarity scores into a resultant score, used to select the optimal solution for a queried landmark. The evaluation of the proposed fusion schemes for facial landmark detection clearly indicates that a quadratic distance to similarity mapping in conjunction with a root mean square rule for similarity fusion achieves the best performance in accuracy, efficiency, robustness and monotonicity.",

            "Abstract": "The increasing adoption of 3D capturing equipment, now also found in mobile devices, means that 3D content is increasingly prevalent. Common operations on such data, including 3D object recognition and retrieval, are based on the measurement of similarity between 3D objects. A common way to measure object similarity is through local shape descriptors, which aim to do part-to-part matching by describing portions of an object's shape. The Spin Image is one of the local descriptors most suitable for use in scenes with high degrees of clutter and occlusion but its practical use has been hampered by high computational demands. The rise in processing power of the GPU represents an opportunity to significantly improve the generation and comparison performance of descriptors, such as the Spin Image, thereby increasing the practical applicability of methods making use of it. In this paper we introduce a GPU-based Quasi Spin Image (QSI) algorithm, a variation of the original Spin Image, and show that a speedup of an order of magnitude relative to a reference CPU implementation can be achieved in terms of the image generation rate. In addition, the QSI is noise free, can be computed consistently, and a preliminary evaluation shows it correlates well relative to the original Spin Image.",

            "Abstract": "Transient biometrics, a new concept for biometric recognition, is introduced in this paper. A traditional perspective of biometric recognition systems concentrates on biometric characteristics that are as constant as possible (such as the eye retina), giving accuracy over time but at the same time resulting in resistance to their use for non-critical applications due to the possibility of misuse. In contrast, transient biometrics is based on biometric characteristics that do change over time aiming at increased acceptance in non-critical applications. We show that the fingernail is a transient biometric with a lifetime of approximately two months. Our evaluation datasets are available to the research community.",

Retrieval methods are based on the extraction of a compact shape descriptor; the challenge is to design a shape descriptor that describes the original object in sufficient detail to make accurate 3D object retrieval possible. Building on previous work, this paper proposes a novel depth buffer-based shape descriptor (called PTK) that encompasses symmetry, eigenvalue-related weighting and an object thickness related measure to provide an accuracy surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. An evaluation of the novel method\u2019s parameters and a direct comparison to other approaches are carried out using publicly available and widely used databases. ",

The algorithm is implemented on an FPGA using Handel-C, a language that enables the compilation of high-level algorithms directly into gate level synchronous hardware, thus reducing the development time. The designed algorithm makes no assumptions about DNA transformations, and is therefore a very powerful tool.

This work introduces encoding methods for pedestrian recognition, based on statistical shape analysis of 3D LIDAR data.

They have been successfully applied to face recognition and more recently to ear recognition. However, real-life biometric applications require algorithms that are both robust and efficient so that they scale well with the size of the databases. A novel ear recognition method is presented that uses a generic annotated ear model to register and fit each ear dataset. Then a compact biometric signature is extracted that retains 3D information. The proposed method is evaluated using the largest publicly available 3D ear database appended with our own database, resulting in a database containing data from multiple 3D sensor types. Using this database it is shown that the proposed method is not only robust, accurate and sensor invariant but also extremely efficient, thus \u2026",
