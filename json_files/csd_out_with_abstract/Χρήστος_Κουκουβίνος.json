The EWMA chart is a good alternative to the Shewhart chart to quickly detect small and moderate shifts in the process mean. The DEWMA charting procedure is an enhanced approach for the EWMA chart and performs much better, especially for small and moderate shifts. In this article, we propose the triple EWMA (TEWMA) chart in an effort to improve much more the detection ability of the classical EWMA chart. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the run-length characteristics of the proposed chart. A comparison study versus the DEWMA, EWMA and GWMA charts indicates that the TEWMA chart with time-varying control limits is more effective in detecting small shifts while it is comparable with the other charts in moderate and large shifts. Moreover, the proposed chart has better inertia properties than the competing charts and is also shown \u2026",

It is used in many experiments, for screening purpose, i.e., for studying a large number of factors and identifying the active ones. In this paper, we propose a method for screening out the important factors from a large set of potentially active variables through the symmetrical uncertainty measure combined with the information gain measure. We develop an information theoretical analysis method by using Shannon and some other entropy measures such as R\u00e9nyi entropy, Havrda\u2013Charv\u00e1t entropy, and Tsallis entropy, on data and assuming generalized linear models for a Bernoulli response. This method is quite advantageous as it enables us to use supersaturated designs for analyzing data on generalized linear models. Empirical study demonstrates that this method performs well \u2026",

In this paper, we perform an evaluation of several non-orthogonal saturated designs with two levels that are well known in the literature by studying their behavior under certain optimality criteria.

However, SVMs can be limited in their performance on highly imbalanced datasets. A classifier which has been trained on an imbalanced dataset can produce a biased model towards the majority class and result in high misclassification rate for minority class. For many applications, especially for medical diagnosis, it is of high importance to accurately distinguish false negative from false positive results. The purpose of this study is to successfully evaluate the performance of a classifier, keeping the correct balance between sensitivity and specificity, in order to enable the success of trauma outcome prediction.

To overcome this drawback, several scientists proposed the use of combined arrays, where the control and noise factors are combined in a single array. In this paper, we use non-isomorphic orthogonal arrays as combined arrays, in order to identify a model that contains all the main effects (control and noise), their control-by-noise interactions and their control-by-control interactions with high efficiency. Some cases where the control-by-control-noise are of interest are also considered.",

They are commonly used in screening experiments, with the aim of identifying the dominant active factors with low cost. However, an important research field, which is poorly developed, is the analysis of such designs with non-normal response. In this article, we develop a variable selection strategy, through the modification of the PageRank algorithm, which is commonly used in the Google search engine for ranking Webpages. The proposed method incorporates an appropriate information theoretical measure into this algorithm and as a result, it can be efficiently used for factor screening. A noteworthy advantage of this procedure is that it allows the use of supersaturated designs for analyzing discrete data and therefore a generalized linear model is assumed.

Recently a new method of constructing self-dual codes was established using orthogonal designs. This method has led to the construction of many new self-dual codes over small finite fields and rings. In this paper, we generalize this method by using generalized orthogonal designs, and we give another new method that creates and solves Diophantine equations over GF(p) in order to find suitable generator matrices for self-dual codes. We show that under the necessary conditions these methods can be applied as well to small and large fields. We apply these two methods to study self-dual codes over GF(31) and GF(37). Using these methods we obtain some new maximum distance separable self-dual codes of small orders.",

We also introduced more new primitive pairs than could be inferred previously, concluding with some conjectures reflecting the patterns that were beginning to arise in light of the new approach.In this paper we take what appears to be the natural next step, by investigating these patterns among those lengths and weights that are within easy computational distance from the last length considered therein, length 14.

            "Abstract": "Monitoring of time between events (TBE) instead of the number of events is used in high\u2010quality processes where the events occur rarely. This article presents a double generally weighted moving average control chart with a lower time\u2010varying control limit to monitor the TBE (regarded as DGWMA\u2010TBE chart). The design parameters of the proposed chart are provided, and through a simulation study, it is shown that the DGWMA\u2010TBE chart is more effective than the DEWMA and GWMA charts in detecting moderate to large shifts. Furthermore, the DGWMA\u2010TBE chart is very robust for the same range of shifts when the TBE observations follow a Weibull or a lognormal distribution. Finally, examples are also presented to enhance the performance of the proposed chart.",

The issue is even more critical in case of a complicated correlation structure. Variable selection plays a vital role in statistical analysis of large data bases and many methods have been proposed so far to deal with the aforementioned problem. One of such methods is the Sure Independence Screening which has been introduced to reduce dimensionality to a relatively smaller scale. This method, though simple, produces remarkable results even under both ultra high dimensionality and big scale in terms of sample size problems. In this paper we dealt with the analysis of a big real medical data set assuming a Poisson regression model. We support the analysis by conducting simulated experiments taking into consideration the correlation structure of the design matrix.",

The statistical performance of the two charts has been evaluated on the basis of the average and standard deviation of run-length performing Monte Carlo simulations. A comparison study versus the EWMA and DEWMA charts indicate that the modified schemes have better detection ability for the range of shifts where a classical chart is not optimal designed.

In this article, we propose an alternative method for the derivation of the tuning parameter selector in penalized least squares framework, which can lead to an ameliorated estimate.

            "Abstract": "In the field of survival analysis, when heterogeneity is suspected across study subjects, a model that can account for that variability is preferred. Moreover, an important and challenging task in that field is to efficiently select a subset of significant variables upon which the hazard function depends. To this end, frailty models along with the penalized likelihood methodology can be applied. In this paper, we extend the Gamma frailty model methodology of Fan and Li (2002) to the Uniform frailty model, based on the results of our previous work (Androulakis et al., 2012). Theoretical findings are illustrated via a thorough simulation study.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of variable selection is the identification of the most important predictors that define the response of a linear system. Many techniques for variable selection use a constrained least squares (LS) formulation in which the constraint is imposed in the 1-norm (the lasso), or the 2-norm (Tikhonov regularisation), or a linear combination of these norms (the elastic net). It is always assumed that a constraint must necessarily be imposed, but the consequences of its imposition have not been addressed. This assumption is considered in this paper and it is shown that the correct application of Tikhonov regularisation to the overdetermined LS problem min\u2016 A x\u2212 b\u2016 2 requires that A and b satisfy a condition C. If this condition is satisfied, then the solution of the LS problem with this constraint is numerically stable and the regularisation error e between the solution of this problem and the solution of the LS problem is small \u2026",

Traditionally orthogonal arrays such as Hadamard matrices and Plackett Burman designs have been studied for this purpose. It is therefore of practical interest for a given k to know all the classes of inequivalent projections of the design into the k dimensions that have certain statistical properties. In this paper we present 15 inequivalent Hadamard matrices of order n=32 constructed from circulant cores. We study their projection properties using several well-known statistical criteria and we provide minimum generalized aberration 2 level designs with 32 runs and up to seven factors that are embedded into these Hadamard matrices. A concept of generalized projectivity and design selection of such designs is also discussed.",

In this work, new estimates of the norm of the error are firstly proposed through the use of Kantorovich inequalities and, subsequently, applied to the frailty models framework. These estimates are used in order to derive a tuning parameter selection procedure for penalized frailty models and clustered data.

To overcome the drawbacks of the product array several scientists proposed the use of combined arrays, where the control and noise factors are combined in a single array. In this paper, we use certain orthogonal arrays that are embedded into Hadamard matrices as combined arrays, in order to identify a model that contains all the main effects (control and noise) and their control-by-noise interactions with high efficiency.

Recently, a homogeneously weighted moving average (HWMA) control chart was proposed as an improvement of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart for efficiently monitoring of small shifts in the process mean. In the present article, we extend the HWMA chart by imitating exactly the double EWMA (DEWMA) technique. The proposed scheme is regarded as double HWMA (DHWMA) control chart. The run\u2010length characteristics of the proposed chart are evaluated by performing Monte Carlo simulations. A comparison study versus the EWMA, DEWMA, HWMA, mixed EWMA cumulative sum (CUSUM), CUSUM, and GWMA charts indicates that the DHWMA chart is more effective in detecting small to moderate shifts, while it performs similarly with its competitors for large shifts.

            "Abstract": "In two-level factorial experiments and in other linear models the coefficients of the unknown parameters can take one out of two values. When the number of observations is a multiple of four, the D-optimal design is a Hadamard matrix. Skew Hadamard matrices are of special interest due to their use, among others, in constructing D-optimal weighing designs for n\u2261 3 (mod 4). A method is given for constructing skew Hadamard matrices which is based on the construction of good matrices. The construction is achieved through an algorithm which is also presented and relies on the discrete Fourier transform. It is known that good matrices of order n, exist for all odd n\u2a7d 35 and n= 127. In this paper, we give for the first time all non-equivalent circulant good matrices of odd order 33\u2a7d n\u2a7d 39. We note that no good matrices were previously known for orders 37 and 39.

Most of the existing studies have focused on balanced designs. This paper provides a new lower bound for the -optimality measure of SSDs with general run sizes. This bound is a generalization of existing bounds since it is applicable to both balanced and unbalanced designs. Optimal multi and mixed-level, balanced and nearly balanced SSDs are constructed by applying a k-circulant type methodology. Necessary and sufficient conditions are introduced for the generator vectors, in order to pre-ensure the optimality of the constructed k-circulant SSDs. The provided lower bounds were used to measure the efficiency of the generated designs. The presented methodology leads to a number of new families of improved SSDs, providing tools for \u2026",

Supersaturated designs are a large class of factorial designs which can be used for screening out the important factors from a large set of potentially active variables. The huge advantage of these designs is that they reduce the experimental cost drastically, but their critical disadvantage is the high degree of confounding among factorial effects. Based on the idea of the group screening methods, the f factors are sub-divided into g \u201cgroup-factors\u201d. The \u201cgroup-factors\u201d are then studied using the penalized likelihood statistical analysis methods at a factorial design with orthogonal or near-orthogonal columns.

The penalty term was imposed on a generalized form of the likelihood function designed for clusters, which allows the direct use of many different distributions for the frailty parameter. In this paper, we discuss the asymptotic properties of the penalized likelihood estimators in shared frailty models. It is known that the rates of convergence depend on the tuning parameter which is involved in the penalty function. It is shown that with a proper choice of the tuning parameter and the penalty function, the penalized likelihood estimators possess an oracle property, namely, that they work as well as if the correct submodel was known in advance.",

            "Abstract": "The problem of variable selection is fundamental to statistical modelling in diverse fields of sciences. In this paper, we study in particular the problem of selecting important variables in regression problems in the case where observations and labels of a real-world dataset are available. At first, we examine the performance of several existing statistical methods for analyzing a real large trauma dataset which consists of 7000 observations and 70 factors, that include demographic, transport and intrahospital data. The statistical methods employed in this work are the nonconcave penalized likelihood methods (SCAD, LASSO, and Hard), the generalized linear logistic regression, and the best subset variable selection (with AIC and BIC), used to detect possible risk factors of death. Supersaturated designs (SSDs) are a large class of factorial designs which can be used for screening out the important factors from a large set of potentially active variables. This paper presents a new variable selection approach inspired by supersaturated designs given a dataset of observations. The merits and the effectiveness of this approach for identifying important variables in observational studies are evaluated by considering several two-levels supersaturated designs, and a variety of different statistical models with respect to the combinations of factors and the number of observations. The derived results are encouraging since the alternative approach using supersaturated designs provided specific information that are logical and consistent with the medical experience, which may also assist as guidelines for trauma management.",

In addition, we survey some of the most prolific construction methods for Hadamard matrices thus providing the necessary structures to describe a two-part secret-sharing scheme based on Hadamard designs. Furthermore, we exhibit how some algebraic aspects of secret-sharing cryptography are interpreted in terms of combinatorial design theory, such as the access structure and the security of the secret-sharing schemes.",

Several special cases of the general factorial design are important, because they are widely used in research work and also because they form the basis of other designs of considerable practical value, The most important is that of k factors, each at two or three levels.Consider a situation in which a response y depends on k factors x 1,\u2026, x k, with the first-order relationship of the form y= X\u03b2+ e, where y is an n\u00d7 1 vector of observations; the design matrix X is n\u00d7(k+ 1) and its jth row is of the form (1, x j1, x j2,\u2026, x jk), j= 1, 2,\u2026, n; \u03b2 is the (k+ 1)\u00d7 1 vector of coefficients to be estimated; and e is assumed to be an n\u00d7 1 random vector of errors, distributed with mean 0 and covariance matrix \u03c3 2 I.",

Under the assumption of effect sparsity it is often anticipated that only a few experimental factors play an important role in the experiment. Usually, it is not known which columns of the experimental design will be of further interest. After the initial stage of factor screening, experimenters are usually interested in identifying and estimating interactions of factors that have been found active. It is therefore practical to select a design suitable to provide essential information for this purpose, for whatever choice of active factors.In this paper, we generalize the concept of projectivity of a screening design and we identify saturated screening designs of generalized projectivity Pa that guarantee the identification of P active main effects and their a-factor interactions.",

The complicated structure of the design matrix renders the analysis of such designs a complicated issue.

This article presents a heuristic approach for analyzing SSDs using the cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) under a sure independence screening approach. Simulations are used to investigate the performance of the method comparing the proposed method with other well-known methods from the literature.

This article proposes a new control chart based on the double progressive mean statistic for monitoring the time between k () failures of a maintained gamma distributed system (referred as DPM\u2010TBE chart). The performance of the proposed scheme is measured in terms of the average run\u2010length (ARL) for the case when the scale parameter is known as well as when it is unknown and is estimated from an in\u2010control (IC) reference sample. A comparison study with other TBE charts shows that the DPM\u2010TBE chart is more effective.

Generally, we assume that the data are independent observations; however, there are many situations where this assumption may not be sustainable. In this paper, we want to compare three-level OAs with 18, 27, and 36 runs under the presence of three specific forms of correlation in observations.

            "Abstract": "The penalized likelihood approach (Fan and Li, 2001), has been consistently demonstrated to be an attractive shrinkage and selection method. This procedure is di erent from traditional methods of variable selection in that it selects the signi cant variables and estimates regression coe cients simultaneously. As a result, the produced estimators are as e cient as the oracle estimator.This new methodology was extended further to the case where we have survival data with censored observations and clusters, where the Cox proportional hazards model and the Gamma frailty model (Fan and Li, 2002) are the two commonly used semi-parametric models. This prompted us to extend the penalized Gamma frailty model approach and to propose a generalized form of the full likelihood function designed for clusters, which allows the direct use of many di erent distributions for the frailty parameter. However, the performance of the penalized likelihood estimators depends on the proper choice of the regularization parameter. To this end, we rstly propose new estimates of the norm of the error in the generalized linear models framework, through the use of Kantorovich inequalities. Then these estimates are used in order to derive a tuning parameter selector in penalized generalized linear models.",

In this study we implement data mining techniques, metaheuristics and use experimental designs in databases in order to determine the most relevant variables for classification in regression problems in cases where observations and labels of a large database are available. We propose a database-driven scheme for the encryption of specific fields of a database in order to select an optimal supersaturated design consisting of the variables of a large database which have been found to influence significantly the response outcome. The proposed design selection approach is quite promising, since we are able to retrieve an optimal supersaturated plan using a very small percentage of the available runs, a fact that makes the statistical analysis of a large database computationally feasible and affordable.",

A robust design of a system is one in which two different types of factors are varied; control factors and noise factors. Control factors are variables with levels that are adjustable, whereas noise factors are variables with levels that are hard or impossible to control during normal conditions, such as environmental conditions and raw-material properties. Robust parameter design aims at the reduction of process variation by properly selecting the levels of control factors so that the process becomes insensitive to changes in noise factors. Taguchi [ ] proposed the use of crossed arrays (inner\u2013outer arrays) for robust parameter design. A crossed array is the cross-product of an orthogonal array (OA) involving control factors (inner array) and an OA involving noise \u2026",

For monitoring such data, a new two\u2010sided TBE control chart called progressive mean control chart (regarded as PM\u2010TBE chart) is proposed in the present study. Through a simulation study and using the average run\u2010length (ARL) measure, it is shown that the proposed chart outperforms the tr, ARL\u2010unbiased gamma, GWMA\u2010TBE, and DEWMA\u2010TBE charts in detecting very small to moderate downward shifts, as well as in some cases small upward shifts. Moreover, the PM\u2010TBE chart is very robust for moderate to large shifts when the true distribution of the TBE observations is a Weibull or a lognormal. Finally, examples are given to display the application of the proposed chart.",

            "Abstract": "One of the major issues in medical field constitutes the correct diagnosis, including the limitation of human expertise in diagnosing the disease in a manual way. Nowadays, the use of machine learning classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVM), in medical diagnosis is increasing gradually. However, traditional classification algorithms can be limited in their performance when they are applied on highly imbalanced data sets, in which negative examples (i.e. negative to a disease) outnumber the positive examples (i.e. positive to a disease). SVM constitutes a significant improvement and its mathematical formulation allows the incorporation of different weights so as to deal with the problem of imbalanced data. In the present work an extensive study of four medical data sets is conducted using a variant of SVM, called proximal support vector machine (PSVM) proposed by Fung and Mangasarian .

Golay sequences, which are pairs of binary sequences (i.e., all entries are \u00b11) with zero autocorrelation, have been studied extensively, yet are known only in lengths 2a10b26c. Ternary complementary pairs are pairs of (0, \u00b11)-sequences with zero autocorrelation (thus, Golay pairs are ternary complementary pairs with no 0's). Other kinds of pairs of sequences with zero autocorrelation, such as those admitting complex units for nonzero entries, are studied in similar contexts. Work on ternary complementary pairs is scattered throughout the combinatorics and engineering literature where the majority approach has been to classify pairs first by length and then by deficiency (the number of 0's in a pair); however, we \u2026",

In particular, new inequivalent [48, 24] and [56, 28] self-dual codes over GF (5) whose minimum weights are 14 and 16, are constructed using skew-Hadamard matrices of order 24 and 28, thus improving the only known quadratic double circulant self-dual codes of length 48 and 56. Moreover,[80, 40] and [88, 44] self-dual codes whose minimum weights are 17 and 19 over GF (5), are constructed for the first time. These codes are derived from skew-Hadamard matrices of order 40 and 44, respectively. Finally, a new [56, 28, 17] self-dual code is constructed over GF (7) having the highest minimum weight among [56, 28] self-dual codes. This new optimal code is constructed from a skew-Hadamard-matrix of order 28, for the first time.",

            "Abstract": "Control charts are very popular quality tools used to detect and control industrial process deviations in statistical process control. The current paper presents a new triple exponentially weighted moving average (TEWMA) control chart for monitoring the process dispersion (named as \u2010TEWMA chart), based on a three\u2010parameter logarithmic transformation of the sample variance. A performance evaluation of the proposed chart is conducted, through Monte\u2010Carlo simulations, in terms of the average run length and the standard deviation of the run length. A comparison study with the \u2010EWMA, CUSUM\u2010, CS\u2010EWMA and \u2010HEWMA charts indicates that the \u2010TEWMA chart is more efficient, than the competing ones, in detecting small shifts in the process variability. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to explain the application of the \u2010TEWMA control chart.",

            "Abstract": "A supersaturated design is a type of factorial design where the number of columns m is at least as large as the number of rows n, so n\u2264m. The use of these designs is helpful in conducting experiments where, from a large number of factors the experimenters need to screen out a few significant ones, while the run size is limited. Analyzing data in supersaturated designs is a difficult task, since the number of experimental runs is less than the number of factors to be examined. In this article we propose a method for analyzing data using a specific type of supersaturated designs. This method use heavily the special block-orthogonal structure of the supersaturated designs given by Tang and Wu (1995). As an example we use the block-stepwise method to show the improvement archived, in comparison to the stepwise regression, when he structure of the design is considered.",

            "Abstract": "As an important class of space-filling designs, uniform designs (UDs) choose a set of points over a certain domain such that these points are uniformly scattered, under a specific discrepancy measure. They have been applied successfully in many industrial and scientific experiments since they appeared in 1980. A noteworthy and practical advantage is their ability to investigate a large number of high-level factors simultaneously with a fairly economical set of experimental runs. As a result, UDs can be properly used as experimental plans that are intended to derive the significant factors from a list of many potential ones. To this end, a new screening procedure is introduced via penalized least squares. A simulation study is conducted to support the proposed method, which reveals that it can be considered quite promising and expedient, as judged in terms of Type I and Type II error rates.",

When the cardinality of the original set is big, it is advantageous to proceed in an incremental manner and therefore we supply a distributed version of the buckets algorithm. The distributed buckets algorithm comprises a multi-stage merging phase, during which the intermediate results obtained in the previous phases are combined to yield the final result. The buckets algorithm for Hadamard inequivalence is independent of the particular method utilized to check Hadamard inequivalence. When the Hadamard matrices in the given set exhibit a certain structure, any corresponding methods for checking Hadamard inequivalence, tailored for this structure, may be used. Such structured Hadamard matrices arise for instance as the solution sets of Hadamard ideals for \u2026",

Practical limitations and issues related to cost reveals frequently the practical usefulness of split-plot designs. When an experiment is planned, factors that are difficult or time consuming to manipulate appear and make complete randomization impractical. A split-plot structure is used when it is impractical to change the levels of some of the experimental factors. Our dataset, selected with the aid of a split-plot design, consists of 2256 observations 17 factors and 8 repetitions. A statistical analysis on the resulting data is performed and useful biological justification of our results is provided.",

The goal here is to identify the dominant factors that constitute a small proportion of the overall set of factors, according to the assumption of effect sparsity. The analysis of such designs constitutes a challenging task and, even though many methods have been proposed in the literature assuming a normal response, only few works attempted to address the case of non\u2010normal responses. In this paper, we propose a method for screening out the most important features in supersaturated designs assuming a Bernoulli distributed response. This new approach is based on an effective chart in Statistical Process Control, the cumulative sum control chart, combined with an information theoretic measure, and it is referred as the MIC algorithm.

In the present article, a new attribute control chart based on the double progressive mean statistic is proposed for monitoring Poisson data (regarded as PDPM chart). Through a simulation study and using the average run-length (ARL) measure, the performance of the proposed control chart is compared with the c-chart, ARL-unbiased c-chart, PCUSUM, PEWMA, PDEWMA, PGWMA and PPM charts. The performance comparison study indicates that the proposed control chart outperforms the other charts at almost all levels of shifts. Finally, the practical application of the PDPM chat is given through an illustrative example.",

            "Abstract": "Control charts are widely used for monitoring quality characteristics of high-yield processes. In such processes where a large number of zero observations exists in count data, the zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) models are more appropriate than the ordinary binomial models. In ZIB models, random shocks occur with probability \u03b8, and upon the occurrence of random shocks, the number of non-conforming items in a sample of size n follows the binomial distribution with proportion p. In the present article, we study in more detail the exponentially weighted moving average control chart based on ZIB distribution (ZIB-EWMA) and we also propose a new control chart based on the double exponentially weighted moving average statistic for monitoring ZIB data (ZIB-DEWMA). The two control charts are studied in detecting upward shifts in \u03b8 or p individually, as well as in both parameters simultaneously. Through a simulation \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Suppose a large number of factors (q) is examined in an experimental situation. It is often anticipated that only a few (k) of these will be important. Usually, it is not known which of the q factors will be the important ones, that is, it is not known which k columns of the experimental design will be of further interest. Screening designs are useful for such situations. It is of practical interest for a given k to know all the classes of inequivalent projections of the design into the k dimensions that have certain statistical properties, since it helps experimenters in selecting a screening design with favorable properties. In this paper we study all the classes of inequivalent projections of certain two-level orthogonal arrays that arise from Hadamard matrices, using well known statistical criteria, such as generalized resolution and generalized minimum aberration. We also pay attention to each projection's distinct runs. Results are given \u2026",

The corresponding orthogonal arrays can estimate a model with all main effects and their two factor interactions with the highest efficiency and also provide estimates of all main effects that are independent of linear and quadratic time (or position) trends. Some alternative efficient run orders are also presented when the estimation of two factor interactions is of experimental interest.",

Unbalanced designs are also used in cases where some treatment combinations may be of particular interest, so the experimenter chooses to sample more heavily from them. A new lower bound for the -optimality measure that can be applied to both balanced and nearly-balanced experimental designs is provided. This bound is proved to be tight and achievable. New methods for constructing infinite families of saturated and supersaturated nearly-balanced -optimal designs are also provided.",

In this paper, we propose a method for screening out the important factors from a large set of potentially active variables, based on an information theoretical approach. Three entropy measures: R\u00e9nyi entropy, Tsallis entropy and Havrda\u2013Charv\u00e1t entropy, have been associated with the measure of information gain, in order to identify the significant factors using data and assuming generalized linear models. The investigation of the proposed method performance and the comparison of each entropic measure application have been accomplished through simulation experiments. A noteworthy advantage of this paper is the use of generalized linear models for analyzing data from supersaturated designs, a fact that, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been studied.",

Unfortunately, the variance of DMA statistic that has been used in these studies is not correct. In this article, we provide the correct variance of the DMA chart and through a simulation study, we evaluate its performance. It is shown that the DMA chart is more effective than the moving average (MA) chart in detecting small shifts in the process mean and vice versa for moderate to large shifts. Moreover, the DMA chart, even with a small value of span w, has similar, and in some cases better, detection ability than the EWMA and CUSUM charts, especially for moderate and large shifts.",

In the current paper, we propose a new single memory-type control chart, called the maximum double generally weighted moving average chart (referred as Max-DGWMA), that simultaneously detects shifts in the process mean and/or process dispersion. The run length performance of the proposed Max-DGWMA chart is compared with that of the Max-EWMA, Max-DEWMA, Max-GWMA and SS-DGWMA charts, using time-varying control limits, through Monte\u2013Carlo simulations. The comparisons reveal that the proposed chart is more efficient than the Max-EWMA, Max-DEWMA and Max-GWMA charts, while it is comparable with the SS-DGWMA chart. An automotive industry application is presented in order to implement the Max-DGWMA chart. The goal is to establish statistical control of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In some process control applications, the quality of a process or a product can be characterized by a relationship between a response variable and one or more independent variables which is typically referred to as a profile. For an in-control process, process capability indices are widely used for the characterization of the capability of a process. Although there are several studies in monitoring profiles, there are a few studies to evaluate the process capability of the profiles. In the majority of cases, the response variable in the profile follows a normal distribution, but, sometimes, this assumption is violated. In many industrial applications, the response variable is binary or binomial, as in the case of whether a product can be classified as defective or nondefective. In this article, we calculate the  and  indices to measure the process capability when the quality of a process is characterized by a logistic regression \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Combinatorial designs have been widely used, in the construction of self-dual codes. Recently, new methods of constructing self-dual codes are established using orthogonal designs (ODs), generalized orthogonal designs (GODs), a set of four sequences and Diophantine equations over GF(p). These methods had led to the construction of many new self-dual codes over small finite fields and rings. In this paper, we used some methods to construct self-orthogonal and self dual codes over GF(p), for some primes p. The construction is achieved by using some special kinds of combinatorial designs like orthogonal designs and GODs. Moreover, we combine eight circulant matrices, a system of Diophantine equations over GF(p), and a recently discovered array to obtain a new construction method. Using this method new self-dual and self-orthogonal codes are obtained. Specifically, we obtain new self-dual \u2026",

In the current article, we propose a triple exponentially weighted moving average control chart to monitor TBE (regarded as triple exponentially weighted moving average TEWMA\u2010TBE chart) modeled by a gamma distribution. One\u2010 and two\u2010sided schemes of the proposed chart are designed and compared with the double EWMA DEWMA\u2010TBE and EWMA\u2010TBE charts. It is shown that the lower\u2010 and two\u2010sided TEWMA\u2010TBE charts outperform its competitors, especially for small to moderate downward shifts, while the upper\u2010sided TEWMA\u2010TBE chart has very good detection ability for small shifts. We also study the robustness of the proposed chart when the true distribution is a Weibull or a lognormal and it is found that the TEWMA\u2010TBE chart has better robustness properties than its competitors, especially for \u2026",

A SBIBD is defined as a square matrix of order v with entries 0 or 1. Suitable matrices are matrices with elements+ 1 and-1 which can be used to replace the variables of orthogonal design (OD) to form Hadamard matrices.

By analogy, we extend the construction to larger arrays using matrix representations of the algebras of octonions and sedenions.

In the case of sedenions we obtain the full orthogonal design OD(16;1,1,7,7) of order 16 with 4 variables and the full orthogonal design OD(16;1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2) of order 16 with 9 variables. We use OD(16;1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2) to search for inequivalent Hadamard matrices of orders 112, 144, 176 and we establish constructively three new lower bounds for the numbers of inequivalent Hadamard matrices of these three orders. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The huge advantage of these designs is that they reduce the experimental cost drastically, but their critical disadvantage is the confounding involved in the statistical analysis. In this article, we propose a method for analyzing data using several types of supersaturated designs. Modifications of widely used information criteria are given and applied to the variable selection procedure for the identification of the active factors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is depicted via simulated experiments and comparisons.",

For the monitoring of such data, many different control charts have been developed. In this article, we compare the performance of several widely used Poisson control charts in terms of the average run-length. Based on the comparison study, some recommendations are made in order to choose the best-performing control chart under different situations. Moreover, we apply these charts in real data relating to the airplane accidents.",

The present paper proposes a new regression model for its solution. We show that the proposed model satisfies continuity, sparsity, and unbiasedness properties. A generalized Krylov subspace method for the practical solution of the minimization problem involved is described. This method can be used for the solution of both small-scale and large-scale problems. Several computed examples illustrate the good performance of the proposed model. We place special focus on screening studies using saturated and supersaturated experimental designs.",

In this paper, a moving average control chart based on a robust scale estimator of standard deviation, namely, the sample median absolute deviation (MAD) statistic, for monitoring process dispersion, is proposed. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed moving average median absolute deviation (MA\u2010MAD) chart, in terms of average run length for various distributions. The results show that the moving average MAD chart performs well in detecting small and moderate shifts in process dispersion, especially when the normality assumption is violated. In addition, this chart is very efficient, especially when the quality characteristic follows a skewed distribution. Numerical and simulated examples are given at the end of the paper.",

It is shown that the proposed chart is more effective than the MA and DMA charts in detecting small to moderate shifts for a small value of span w. However, this range of shifts decreases as the value of w increases. The application of the proposed chart is demonstrated through two examples.",

In this paper, if X and Y are orthogonal designs, group generated or circulant on the group G, these will be denoted 2\u2014SAS (n; ul, u2; G). Recently Kharaghani, in\" Arrays for orthogonal designs\", J. Combin.

In this paper we concentrate on constructing short amicable sets, which satisfy the same equation but contain four, called short, or two, called 2-short, matrices. We give a method of multiplying the order of 2-short circulant amicable sets and thus we obtain many infinite classes of 2-short circulant amicable sets. We give some constructions for infinite families of circulant amicable sets. We then contrast by comparing with short block amicable sets which are block circulant matrices and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, extensive amounts of data are stored which require the development of specialized methods for data analysis in an understandable way. In medical data analysis many potential factors are usually introduced to determine an outcome response variable. The main objective of variable selection is enhancing the prediction performance of the predictor variables and identifying correctly and parsimoniously the faster and more cost-effective predictors that have an important influence on the response. Various variable selection techniques are used to improve predictability and obtain the \u201cbest\u201d model derived from a screening procedure. In our study, we propose a variable subset selection method which extends to the classification case the idea of selecting variables and combines a nonparametric criterion with a likelihood based criterion. In this work, the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) criterion is used from another viewpoint in order to determine more directly the important factors. The proposed method revealed a modification (\u03f5BIC) of the modified Bayesian Information Criterion (mBIC). The comparison of the introduced \u03f5BIC to existing variable selection methods is performed by some simulating experiments and the Type I and Type II error rates are calculated. Additionally, the proposed method is applied successfully to a high-dimensional Trauma data analysis, and its good predictive properties are confirmed.",

            "Abstract": "Face recognition and identification are very important applications in machine learning. Due to the increasing amount of available data, traditional approaches based on matricization and matrix PCA methods can be difficult to implement. Moreover, the tensorial approaches are a natural choice, due to the mere structure of the databases, for example in the case of color images. Nevertheless, even though various authors proposed factorization strategies for tensors, the size of the considered tensors can pose some serious issues. Indeed, the most demanding part of the computational effort in recognition or identification problems resides in the training process. When only a few features are needed to construct the projection space, there is no need to compute a SVD on the whole data. Two versions of the tensor Golub\u2013Kahan algorithm are considered in this manuscript, as an alternative to the classical use of the tensor SVD which is based on truncated strategies. In this paper, we consider the Tensor Tubal Golub\u2013Kahan Principal Component Analysis method which purpose it to extract the main features of images using the tensor singular value decomposition (SVD) based on the tensor cosine product that uses the discrete cosine transform. This approach is applied for classification and face recognition and numerical tests show its effectiveness.",

Recent studies discuss the possible advantages of relaxing the balance requirement in construction or data analysis of SSDs, and that unbalanced designs compare favorably to balanced designs for several optimality criteria and for the way in which the data are analyzed. Moreover, the effect analysis framework of unbalanced SSDs until now is restricted to the central assumption that experimental data come from a linear model.

            "Abstract": "A supersaturated design is a factorial design in which the number of effects to be estimated is greater than the available number of experimental runs. It is used in many experiments for screening purposes, i.e., for studying a large number of factors and then identifying the active ones. The goal with such a design is to identify just a few of the factors under consideration, that have dominant effects and to do this at minimum cost. While most of the literature on supersaturated designs has focused on the construction of designs and their optimality, the data analysis of such designs remains still at an early stage. In this paper, we incorporate the parameter model complexity into the supersaturated design analysis process, by assuming generalized linear models for a Bernoulli response, for analyzing main effects designs and discovering simultaneously the effects that are significant.",

The point is that we regard the design as a set of polynomial solutions. Then, the Gr\u00f6bner base theory allows one to identify the whole set of estimable effects (main or interactions) of the factors of the design. In this paper we applied Gr\u00f6bner base theory in certain two level factorial designs.",

            "Abstract": "Robust parameter design, originally proposed by Taguchi, is an off\u2010line technique for maintaining variance reduction and improving quality. According to Taguchi, product variation from the desirable target is affected by two types of factors: control factors and noise factors. The basic idea in robust parameter design is to identify the levels of the control factors so that the product's quality characteristic becomes insensitive to changes in the levels of the noise factors. As a consequence, the effect of uncontrollable variations on the response will be reduced.Taguchi suggested the use of inner\u2010outer arrays with the control factors being assigned to an inner array and the noise factors assigned to an outer array. After the collection of the data, a performance measure called signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio is calculated and analyzed in order to identify the optimal levels of the control factors.

A popular tool for specifying the tuning parameter is the generalized cross-validation (GCV). In this work, we utilize estimates for the GCV function whose minimizers can lead to the determination of the tuning parameter. The selection of an efficient estimate depends on an appropriately defined index of proximity. Bounds and specific values are derived for this index, and a thorough study proves that the proposed one-term estimate suits perfectly to statistical models with high correlated variables. This is confirmed through simulation tests for several datasets.",

In our study, different data mining techniques are implemented and decision trees, classification rules and clusters are produced. The results of C&RT, CHAID, C5.0 and QUEST are evaluated not only before but also after the implementation of feature selection methods in the examined data set.

This hard combinatorial problem can be formulated in terms of objective functions of several binary variables, so that heuristic methodologies can be used. Our algorithms are based on local and tabu search and they use information on the geometry of the objective function landscapes. In addition, we use the supplementary difference sets formalism to detect when solutions of a special structure exist. Using these algorithms we have computed at least one Hadamard matrix with two circulant cores of the sixteen orders 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116. In particular, the Hadamard matrix with two circulant cores of order 116 is constructed here for the first time, indeed it was accidentally reported as known in an earlier paper.",

In this work, we propose the selection of this parameter via the minimization of an extrapolation estimate of the generalized cross-validation function. The efficiency of the estimate is characterized by an appropriately defined index of proximity; in case that its value approaches one, the estimation becomes optimal. We consider regression models with highly correlated covariates and prove that the probability of the index of proximity being close to one is high. This result is confirmed through several simulation tests.",

The motivation to deal with the messy genetic algorithm (mGA) is given from the pioneering results of Goldberg, regarding the ability of the mGA to put tight genes together in a solution which points directly to structural patterns in weighing matrices. In order to take into advantage a recent formalism on the support of two sequences with zero autocorrelation we use an adaptation of the ordering messy GA (OmeGA) where we combine the fast mGA with random keys to represent permutations of the two sequences under investigation.

            "Abstract": "Supersaturated designs (SSDs) are defined as fractional factorial designs whose experimental run size is smaller than the number of main effects to be estimated. While most of the literature on SSDs has focused only on main effects designs, the construction and analysis of such designs involving interactions has not been developed to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a backward elimination design-driven optimization (BEDDO) method, with one main goal in mind, to eliminate the factors which are identified to be fully aliased or highly partially aliased with each other in the design. Under the proposed BEDDO method, we implement and combine correlation-based statistical measures taken from classical test theory and design of experiments field, and we also present an optimality criterion which is a modified form of Cronbach's alpha coefficient. In this way, we provide a new class of computer-aided \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we formalize three constructions for skew-Hadamard matrices from a Computational Algebra point of view. These constructions are the classical 4 Williamson array construction, an 8 Williamson array construction and a construction based on OD (16; 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), a 9-variable full orthogonal design of order 16. Using our Computational Algebra formalism in conjunction with supercomputing, we perform exhaustive and partial searches for all three constructions. The computational results of these searches indicate a fundamental difference among these constructions, namely that the 8 Williamson array construction and the full orthogonal design construction exhibit exponential growths in the number of solutions. Subsequently, we analyze the computational results of these searches to locate inequivalent skew-Hadamard matrices, using the profile criterion. We show how to use the doubling construction to construct inequivalent skew-Hadamard matrices of order 2n from skew-Hadamard matrices of order n. Combining our computational results and the doubling construction we establish constructively 30 new lower bounds for the numbers of inequivalent skew-Hadamard matrices of orders 60, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 136, 144, 152, 160, 168, 176, 184, 200, 208, 216, 224, 232, 240, 288, 352, 416.

If n\u2261 1 (mod 4), we have to decide if we should add a run in a n\u00d7 p submatrix of a Hadamard matrix of order n, say H n or, alternatively, if we should delete three runs from a (n+ 4)\u00d7 p submatrix of a Hadamard matrix of order n+ 4, say H n+ 4, in an optimal manner, respectively. Similarly, when n\u2261 3 (mod 4), we have to decide between optimally adding three more runs to a n\u00d7 p submatrix of H n or optimally deleting a single run from a (n+ 4)\u00d7 p submatrix of H n+ 4. The question to be studied is whether both strategies give designs that are equally efficient in terms of a well defined optimality criterion. We show that, in both cases, for p= 3 both strategies give equally efficient designs under the D-or the A-optimality criterion.

The objective functionthat we use in our implementation of Simple Genetic Algorithm, comes from a Computational Algebra formalism of the full orthogonal design equations. In particular, we constructed Hadamard matrices of orders 144, 176, 208, 240, 272, 304 and 336, from the aforementioned orthogonal design. By varying three genetic operator parameters, we computer 62 inequivalent Hadamard matices of order 304 and 4 inequivalent Hadamard matrices of order 336. Therefore we established two new constructive lower bounds for the numbers of Hadamard matrices of order 304 and 336.",

The main idea is to transform the constrained - minimization problem obtained by applying the IRLS method to a - one that allow regularization matrices in the usual 2-norm regularization term. The regularization parameter that controls the equilibrium between the minimization of the two terms of the - minimization problem can be then chosen inexpensively by solving some reduced minimization problems related to generalized cross-validation (GCV) methods. These reduced problems can be obtained after a few iterations of Krylov subspace based methods. The goal of our simulation study is directed toward the variable selection and the prediction accuracy performance of the proposed method in solving a  regularized logistic regression problem in large dimensional \u2026",

Not all orthogonal designs produce inequivalent Hadamard matrices, because the corresponding systems of equations do not possess solutions. The systems of equations arising when we search for inequivalent Hadamard matrices from full orthogonal designs using circulant and symmetric block matrices, can be concisely described using the periodic autocorrelation function of the generators of the block matrices. We use Maple, Magma, C and Unix tools to find many new inequivalent Hadamard matrices.",

Fan and Li proposed a family of new variable selection methods based on a nonconcave penalized likelihood approach and advocated penalties with the following properties: unbiasedness, sparsity and continuity. The chapter focuses on the penalized frailty models framework. A description of the work of Androulakis et al. is provided.

It is of practical interest for a given k to know all the inequivalent projections of the design into the k dimensions. In this paper we give all the (combinatorially) inequivalent projections of inequivalent Hadamard matrices of order 24 into k=3,4 and 5 dimensions, as well as their frequencies. Then, we sort these projections according to their generalized resolution, generalized aberration and centered L 2-discrepancy measure of uniformity. Then, we study the hidden projection properties of these designs as they are introduced by Wang and Wu (1995). The hidden projection property suggests that complex aliasing allows some interactions to be estimated without making additional runs.",

We show the necessary conditions for the existence of an OD (28; s1, s2, s3) plus the condition that (s1, s2, s3)\u2260(1, 5, 20) are sufficient conditions for the existence of an OD (28; s1, s2, s3).

            "Abstract": "The penalized Gamma frailty model methodology of Fan and Li [12] was extended in Androulakis et al.[4][5] to other frailty distributions. The penalty term was imposed on a generalized form of the likelihood function designed for clusters, which allows the direct use of many different distributions for the frailty parameter. In this paper, we examine the asymptotic properties of the penalized likelihood estimators in shared frailty models. It is known that the rates of convergence depend on the tuning parameter which is involved in the penalty function. It is shown that with a proper choice of the tuning parameter and the penalty function, the penalized likelihood estimators possess an oracle property, namely, that they work as well as if the correct submodel was known in advance.",

This family is generated as the quotient of two independent random variables, one with noncentral standard elliptical distribution and the other the power of a U (0, 1) random variable. For this family of distributions, we derive general properties, including the moments and discuss some special cases based on the family of scale mixtures of normal distributions, where the main advantage is easy simulation and nice hierarchical representation facilitating the implementation of an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. This new family of distributions provides a robust alternative for parameter estimation in asymmetric distributions. The results and methods are applied to three real datasets, showing that this new distribution fits better than other models reported in the recent statistical literature.",

In this paper, we present a general algorithmic method for constructing 2q1 4q2 mixed-level designs in order to explore and optimize response surfaces with respect to D-efficiency, where the predictor variables are at two and four equally spaced levels, by utilizing a hybrid genetic algorithm. Emphasis is given on various properties that arise from the implementation of the genetic algorithm, such as using genetic operators as local optimizers and the representation of the four levels of the design with a 2-bit Gray Code. We applied the genetic algorithm in several cases and the optimized mixed-level designs achieve good properties, thus demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed hybrid heuristic.",

In the present article, we propose the quadruple MA (QMA) chart for normally distributed data to improve much more the performance of the MA chart for small shifts. Comparing with the existing MA, DMA, TMA, EWMA and DEWMA charts, it is shown that the proposed chart is more effective for small shifts. Furthermore, it is found that the QMA chart is more in-control (IC) robust to non normality than its competitors. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed chart.",

Since these designs are only main effects plans and since the number of runs are greater than the number of active factors (main effects), there are plenty of degrees of freedom unused for identifying and estimating interactions of factors. Computational Algebraic Geometry can be used to solve identifiability problems in design of experiments in Statistics. The theory of Gr\u00f6bner bases allows one to identify the whole set of estimable effects (main or interactions) of the factors of the design.

This method heavily uses the special block orthogonal structure of the supersaturated designs given by Tang and Wu . Also, we compare our method with several known statistical analysis methods by using some of the existing supersaturated designs. The comparison is performed by some simulating experiments and the Type I and Type II error rates are calculated. The results are presented in tables and the discussion to follow.",

Using these results we can obtain many infinite classes of Kharaghani type orthogonal designs. Actually, if there exists an Kharaghani type orthogonal design of order n and of type (al, a2,\u2026, av), which is constructed from sequences, then there exists an infinite family of Kharaghani type orthogonal designs of the same type which is constructed from appropriate sequences.",

            "Abstract": "Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modelling in diverse fields of sciences. Specially in health studies, many potential factors are introduced to determine an outcome variable. In our study, different statistical methods are applied to analyze trauma annual data, collected by 30 General Hospitals in Greece. The dataset consists of 6334 observations and at most 131 factors that include demographic, transport and intrahospital data. The statistical methods employed in this work were the nonconcave penalized likelihood methods, SCAD, LASSO, and Hard, the generalized linear logistic regression, and the best subset variable selection, used to detect possible risk factors of death. A variety of different statistical models are considered, with respect to the combinations of factors and the number of observations. A comparative survey reveals differences between results and execution times of each method. The performed analysis reveals several distinct advantages of the nonconcave penalized likelihood methods over the traditional model selection techniques.",

            "Abstract": "A supersaturated design is a factorial design in which the number of factors to be estimated is larger than the available number of experimental runs. The cost and time required for many industrial experimentations can be reduced by using the class of supersaturated designs, since the main goal for such a design is to identify only a few of the factors under consideration that have dominant effects and to do this identification at a minimal cost. While most of the literature on supersaturated designs has focused on the construction of designs and their optimality properties, the data analysis of such designs has not been developed to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a supersaturated design analysis method, by assuming generalized linear models for discrete responses, for analyzing main effects designs and identifying simultaneously the effects that are significant. Empirical study demonstrates that this \u2026",

By using the proposed method three level supersaturated designs are constructed and explored. Moreover, many new, optimal and near optimal, multi-level supersaturated designs are provided as well.",

Infinite families of orthogonal designs, based on some weighing matrices of order 2n, weight 2n\u2212 k and spread \u03c3, are constructed from two circulants matrices by using complementary sequences of zero non-periodic autocorrelation function, ie ternary complementary pairs. Moreover, a new measure is introduced, called \u03b6-efficiency, for ternary complementary pairs and some of its basic properties are explored. Using the notion of \u03b6-efficiency, some infinite classes of weighing matrices from ternary complementary pairs are constructed. Finally, a multiplication theorem for sequences with zero periodic autocorrelation function is given and its consequences are studied. As an application, we give some more weighing matrices from the derived pairs of zero periodic autocorrelation function.",

Split-plot designs can be effectively applied to decrease the cost in RPD experimentation when there are hard-to-change or hard-to-control factors. In the presence of many factors, either the traditional replicated split-plot designs or the Cartesian-product designs proposed by Taguchi are not of practical use since they require a large number of experimental units; thus, fractional factorial designs, such as supersaturated designs (SSDs) are needed. In this article, we propose a construction for supersaturated split-plot designs suitable for RPD experiments. We implemented the methodology of compound orthogonal arrays using orthogonal arrays of strength greater than 1, for the split-plot units and any relevant balanced SSD for the whole-plot units \u2026",

Rather, they are motivated by a desire to obtain a coherent and powerful theory of existence and properties of designs. Nevertheless, it comes as no surprise that applications in coding theory and communications continue to arise, and also that designs have found applications in new areas. Cryptography in particular has provided a new source of applications of designs, and simultaneously a field of new and challenging problems in design theory. In this paper, we present a number of applications of combinatorial designs in which the connection with modern symmetric (private-key) cryptography appears to be substantial and meaningful.

However, in many applications, this assumption is violated. In this case, t control charts are preferred as they are robust to changes in the process standard deviation. In this article, a generally weighted moving average chart based on the t statistic (referred as GWMA t chart) is proposed for monitoring shifts in the process mean. Its performance is studied using Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown that the proposed chart is more effective than the Shewhart t and EWMA t charts.

            "Abstract": "Variability among experimental plots may be a relevant problem in field genotype experiments, especially when a large number of entries are involved. Four field trials on 24 durum wheat genotypes were conducted in 2013/14 in order to evaluate the efficiency of Incomplete Block, Alpha and Augmented designs in comparison with the traditional Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). The results showed that the RCBD can be replaced by an Alpha design, which provides better control of variability among the experimental units when the number of treatments to be tested in an experiment exceeds twenty. The ranking of the genotypes across the four designs was not constant.",

            "Abstract": "Supersaturated designs (SSDs) are designs whose factors exceeds run size; thus, there are not enough runs for estimating all the main effects. They are commonly used in screening experiments, where the primary goal is to identify the few, but dominant, active factors, keeping the cost as low as possible. The development of new statistical methods inspired by machine learning algorithms is increasing rapidly, especially nowadays. One of such methods is the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), which manages to extract the informative genes in classification problems, while it achieves extremely high performance. In this article, we study a variable selection method for regression problems, called SVR-RFE, to screen active effects in both two-level and mixed-level designs. Simulation studies demonstrate that this procedure is effective enough, especially in terms of statistical power.",

            "Abstract": "Hadamard matrices have traditionally been used for screening main effects only, because of their complex aliasing structures. The hidden projection property, as introduced by Wang and Wu (Statistica Sinica 5 (1995) 235\u2013250), suggests that complex aliasing allows some interactions to be entertained and estimated without making additional runs in order to form full or fractional factorial designs as the geometric approach inclines. However, in most cases, because the original data are sufficiently noisy to mask the significance of any two-factor interaction we need to add (fewer) runs that give the maximum amount of information for this purpose. In this paper, we list what runs give the maximum amount of information needed in order to entertain and estimate some two-factor interactions for all the inequivalent projections of Hadamard matrices of order n=16,20 and 24 when they are projected into four and five \u2026",

In particular, we demonstrate that the search for weighing matrices constructed from two circulants using the power spectral density criterion and exploiting structural patterns for the locations of the zeros in candidate solutions, can be viewed as a string sorting problem together with a linear time algorithm to locate common strings in two sorted arrays. This allows us to bring into bear efficient algorithms from the string sorting literature. We also state and prove some new enhancements to the power spectral density criterion, that allow us to treat successfully the rounding error effect and speed up the algorithm. Finally, we use these ideas to find new weighing matrices of order 2n and \u2026",

The analysis includes a comparison of data mining techniques using classification, clustering and association algorithms. Data were collected by Hellenic Trauma and Emergency Surgery Society from 30 Greek hospitals. Dataset contains records of 8544 patients suffering from severe injuries collected from the year 2005 to 2006. Factors include patients' demographic elements and several other variables registered from the time and place of accident until the hospital treatment and final outcome. Using this analysis the obtained results are compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value and the ROC curve depicts these methods performance.",

Once the best model is specified, the goodness of fit of the model needs to be examined first. A highly complex model may provide a good fit, but giving no consideration to model complexity could result in incorrect estimates of parameter values and predictions. In order to improve the model selection process, model complexity needs to be defined clearly. This article studies different aspects of model complexity and discusses the extent to which they can be measured. The most common attribute that is usually ignored from many complexity measures is the parameter prior, which is an inherent part of the model and could impact the complexity significantly. The concept of parameter prior and its connection to model complexity are therefore discussed here, and some relationships to the entropy \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Supersaturated designs (SSDs) constitute a large class of fractional factorial designs which can be used for screening out the important factors from a large set of potentially active ones. A major advantage of these designs is that they reduce the experimental cost dramatically, but their crucial disadvantage is the confounding involved in the statistical analysis. Identification of active effects in SSDs has been the subject of much recent study. In this article we present a two-stage procedure for analyzing two-level SSDs assuming a main-effect only model, without including any interaction terms. This method combines sure independence screening (SIS) with different penalty functions; such as Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD), Lasso and MC penalty achieving both the down-selection and the estimation of the significant effects, simultaneously. Insights on using the proposed methodology are provided \u2026",

A one-sided Double Exponentially Moving Average control chart to monitor the TBE (regarded as DEWMA-TBE chart) is proposed in the present work. The design parameters of the proposed chart are provided and through a simulation study, it is seen that the DEWMA-TBE chart is more effective than the EWMA and Shewhart charts at detecting downward shifts.",

It does not only automatically and consistently select the important variables but also produces estimators that are as efficient as the oracle estimator. In this paper, we apply this approach to a general likelihood function for data organized in clusters, which corresponds to a class of frailty models, which includes the Cox model and the Gamma frailty model as special cases. Our aim was to provide practitioners in the medical or reliability field with options other than the Gamma frailty model, which has been extensively studied because of its mathematical convenience.

Such profiles can be expressed by a linear or a non-linear model. On the other hand, for an in-control process, capability indices are used for process quality improvement. In this article, we propose a method to measure the process capability when the quality of the process is characterized by a Poisson regression profile. The performance of the proposed index is evaluated through simulations studies. Two real data examples illustrate this method.",

Moreover, we present an incremental algorithm to explore the possibility of predicting the strength of an earthquake with incremental techniques.",

The motivation to deal with the messy genetic algorithm (mGA) is given from the pioneering results of Goldberg, regarding the ability of the mGA to put tight genes together in a solution which points directly to structural patterns in weighing matrices. In order to take into advantage certain properties of two ternary sequences with zero autocorrelation we use an adaptation of the fast messy GA (fmGA) where we combine mGA with advanced techniques, such as thresholding and tie-breaking. This transformation of the weighing matrices problem to an instance of a combinatorial optimization problem seems to be promising, since we resolved two open cases for weighing matrices as \u2026",

Both have good spaced filling properties in one-dimension. U-type designs may not have low correlations among the main effects, quadratic effects and two-factor interactions. On the other hand, OLHDs are hard to be found due to their large number of levels for each factor. Recently, alternative classes of U-type designs with zero or low correlations among the effects of interest appear in the literature. In this paper, we present new classes of U-type or quantitative -orthogonal designs for computer experiments. The proposed designs are constructed by combining known combinatorial structures and they have their main effects pairwise orthogonal, orthogonal to the mean effect, and orthogonal to both quadratic effects and two-factor interactions.",

This paper deals with the statistical analysis of two large dimensional data sets; we firstly conduct a seismic hazard sensitivity analysis using seismic data from Greece acquired during the years 1962\u2212 2003, and then analyze Trauma data collected in an annual registry conducted during the year 2005 by the Hellenic Trauma and Emergency Surgery Society involving 30 General Hospitals in Greece. The main purpose of both analyses is to extract high-level knowledge for the domain user or decision-maker. Eight non parametric classifiers derived from data mining methods (Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural (RBFN) Networks, Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Classification and Regression Tree (C&RT), Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), C5. 0 algorithm and Quick, Unbiased, Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST)) are employed in this work, and are compared to Logistic Regression and \u21131-norm SVM in terms of overall classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Area under the ROC curve (AUROC).

            "Abstract": "This paper provides a new methodology to construct quantitative screening designs. Some examples of 3-level designs are presented to illustrate the method. The theoretical properties of the derived designs are also explored. An advantage of the presented designs is that they exist in cases where the classical screening designs cannot exist. The above method leads to the construction of many new large orthogonal designs with nice properties. Turyn-type sequences of lengths n, n, n, n\u22121 and orthogonal designs are used to achieve the desirable structure. This approach also leads to the construction of new quadruples of directed sequences of lengths 2n\u22121, 2n\u22121, n, n and type  with zero non-periodic autocorrelation function (zero NPAF).",

            "Abstract": "Response surface methodology is widely used for developing, improving, and optimizing processes in various fields. In this article, we present a method for constructing three-level designs in order to explore and optimize response surfaces combining orthogonal arrays and covering arrays in a particular manner. The produced designs achieve the properties of rotatability, predictive performance and efficiency for the estimation of a second-order model.",

            "Abstract": "\u2022 The analysis of unreplicated factorial designs constitutes a challenging but difficult issue since there are no degrees of freedom so as to estimate the error variance. In the present paper we propose a method for screening active effects in such designs, assuming Bernoulli distributed data rather than linear; something that hasn\u2019t received much attention yet. Specifically, we develop an innovating algorithm based on an information theoretical measure, the well-known symmetrical uncertainty, so that it can measure the relation between the response variable and each factor separately. The powerfulness of the proposed method is revealed via both, a thorough simulation study and a real data set analysis.",

            "Abstract": "Variable selection is fundamental to statistical modelling in diverse fields of sciences. This paper deals with the problem of high-dimensional statistical modelling through the analysis of seismological data in Greece acquired during the years 1962\u20132003. The dataset consists of 10,333 observations and 11 factors, used to detect possible risk factors of large earthquakes. In our study, different statistical variable selection techniques are applied, while data mining techniques enable us to discover associations, meaningful patterns and rules. The statistical methods employed in this work were the non-concave penalised likelihood methods, SCAD, LASSO and Hard, the generalised linear logistic regression and the best subset variable selection. The applied data mining methods were three decision trees algorithms, the classification and regression tree (C&RT), the chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID \u2026",
