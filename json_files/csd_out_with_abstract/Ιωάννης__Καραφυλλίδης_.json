            "Abstract": "During the last decades, traffic congestion in urban networks is getting worse affecting many aspects of the residents lives to an increasing extent. Traffic lights play a decisive role in the aforementioned traffic networks of modern metropolises, and the existing conditions of the corresponding vehicular traffic flows. In order to develop an efficient system dedicated to the real-time traffic signals control for which the hardware implementation will be straightforward, Cellular Automata (CAs) were chosen as the simulation and implementation method. Despite its ease of implementation and simplicity, CAs is a powerful tool that can generate realistic traffic models. In this paper, a Cellular Automaton (CA) model was implemented on a FPGA to take full advantage of the inherent parallelism of CAs and provide real-time traffic signals control in accordance with vehicular traffic flow. The proposed hardware was optimized and the resulting single FPGA processor can be finally considered as basic component of an advanced electronic system able to provide real time information concerning the traffic conditions in the under study intersections and thus to efficiently handle-control the traffic signals in real conditions.",

            "Abstract": "Many physical problems cannot be easily formulated as quantum circuits, which are a successful universal model for quantum computation. Because of this, new models that are closer to the structure of physical systems must be developed. Discrete and continuous quantum walks have been proven to be a universal quantum computation model, but building quantum computing systems based on their structure is not straightforward. Although classical cellular automata are models of universal classical computation, this is not the case for their quantum counterpart, which is limited by the no-coning theorem and the no-go lemma. Here we combine quantum walks, which reproduce unitary evolution in space with quantum cellular automata, which reproduce unitary evolution in time, to form a new model of quantum computation. Our results show that such a model is possible.",

            "Abstract": "Recent experiments elucidated the structure and function of the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator, which is driven by sunlight intensity variation and therefore by Earth's rotation. It is known that cyanobacteria appeared about 3.5 billion years ago and that Earth's rotational speed is continuously decreasing because of tidal friction. What is the effect of the continuous slowdown of Earth's rotation on the operation of the cyanobacterial oscillator? To answer this question we derived the oscillator's equation of motion directly from experimental data, coupled it with Earth's rotation and computed its natural periods and its resonance curve. The results show that there are two resonance peaks of the \u201ccyanobacterial oscillator-rotating Earth\u201d system, indicating that cyanobacteria used more efficiently the solar energy during the geological period in which the day length varied from about 11 to 15 h and make more efficient use of \u2026",

CAs have also been successfully used as a VLSI architecture that proved to be very efficient at least in terms of silicon-area utilization and clock-speed maximization. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) as one of the promising emerging technologies for nanoscale and quantum computing circuit implementation, provides very high scale integration, very high switching frequency and extremely low power characteristics. In this paper we present a new automated design architecture and a tool, namely DATICAQ (Design Automation Tool of 1-D CAs using QCAs), that builds a bridge between 1-D CAs as models of physical systems and processes and 1-D QCAs as nanoelectronic architecture.

Furthermore, due to their simple, regular, modular and cascadable structure with local interconnections CAs algorithms are ideally suited for hardware implementation. On the other hand, power dissipation is recognized as a critical parameter in modern VLSI design field. In this paper a power estimation model based on CAs is proposed. With the help of this model the power consumption of 1-d CAs rules logic circuits is investigated in details. More specifically, CMOS power consumption estimation measurements for the entireness of 1-d CAs rules as well as entropy variation measurements were conducted based on the proposed model.

            "Abstract": "Ecological systems are generally considered among the most complex ones, because they are characterized by a large number of diverse components, nonlinear interactions, scale multiplicity, and spatial heterogeneity. In this paper a methodology for modeling ecological systems using cellular automata (CAs) is presented. The proposed methodology establishes the ability to capture the essential features-characteristics of the ecological system under consideration, and translate them into a suitable form, in order to obtain an effective CA model. The CA models obtained are of crucial importance in ecological engineering, and they could be used as decision support systems in environmental emergency response. Further, a complete description of the details of this methodology is specified, in order to help other researchers reproduce published simulation experiments. Forest fire spreading and oil slick movement and spreading are considered as possible applications of the proposed methodology. The models obtained can serve as a basis for the development of algorithms to simulate environmental and biological systems based on real data. Moreover, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that would execute and speed up the corresponding algorithms could be designed with the help of VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL).",

DNA is modeled as the sender and proteins are modeled as the receiver of this information. On the DNA side, a 64-dimensional Hilbert space is used to describe the information stored in DNA triplets (codons). A Hamiltonian matrix is constructed for this space, using the 64 possible codons as base states. The eigenvalues of this matrix are not degenerate. The genetic code is degenerate and proteins comprise only 20 different amino acids. Since information is conserved, the information on the protein side is also described by a 64-dimensional Hilbert space, but the eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix are degenerate. Each amino acid is described by a Hilbert subspace. This change in Hilbert space structure reflects the nature of the processes involved in information transfer \u2026",

The simulator also produces contour plots that divide the strategy spaces of the game in regions in which players can get larger payoffs if they choose to use a quantum strategy against any classical one. We also apply the simulator to two well-known quantum games, the Battle of Sexes and the Chicken game.

            "Abstract": "Resistive memories are promising candidates for replacing current nonvolatile memories and realize storage class memories. Moreover, they have memristive properties, with many discrete resistance levels and implement artificial synapses. The last years researchers have demonstrated RRAM chips used as accelerators in computing, following the new in-memory and neuromorphic computational approaches. Many different metal oxides have been used as resistance switching materials in MIM structures. Understanding of the switching mechanism is very critical for the modeling and the use of memristors in different applications. Here, we demonstrate the bipolar resistance switching of silicon nitride thin films using heavily doped Si and Cu as bottom and top-electrodes respectively. Next, we dope nitride with oxygen in order to introduce and modify the intrinsic nitride defects. Analysis of the current-voltage \u2026",

Each message is delivered to its destination, provided that the destination processor is not surrounded by faults. In this case the message is returned to its source processor. Only local knowledge of faults is demanded. The hardware implementation of this algorithm leads to a message passing coprocessor which is allocated at each processor of the array. No need for high silicon overhead is required for the implementation of the message passing coprocessor. This coprocessor executes only the fault tolerant message passing algorithm presented here. The usage of the proposed coprocessor improves the general processing efficiency, as well as, the performance reliability under faulty conditions.",

In these devices, the nanoribbon conductance is modulated and controlled by applying potentials through top and back gates. Graphene nanoribbons with magnetic contacts have been studied and used as spin valves, mostly at liquid-helium temperatures. The operation of graphene nanoribbons with magnetic contacts at room temperature, where nanoelectronic devices and circuits are expected to operate, has received little attention. Here we study and simulate the operation of graphene nanoribbons with magnetic contacts using tight-binding Hamiltonians and the non-equilibrium Green's functions(NEGF) method, which we extend to incorporate the effect of magnetic contacts. Our results are in very good agreement with experimental measurements of the conductance of graphene \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Dye-sensitized solar cells are electrochemical devices with very interesting properties that provide an alternative to the conventional semiconductor solar cell technology. However, the details of the charge transport mechanisms, which include both electronic and ionic transport, are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we present a novel approach to dye-sensitized solar cell modeling and simulation which is based on population dynamics models that have recently been extensively used to model reactions between biological molecules. It is shown that the proposed model can be used to simulate the operation of dye-sensitized solar cells and produces I-V characteristics that are in qualitative agreement with the experimental ones. Furthermore, the model presented here can be used to optimize the characteristics and the design of dye-sensitized solar cells.",

Till now, several computational geophysical models have been proposed in order to tackle complex problems associated with proper interpretation of the available seismicity information and the understanding of triggering mechanisms. In this study, an automatic, hybrid, 3-d cellular automaton model evolved both in space and time is proposed for the modelling of earthquake activity. The proposed model is further calibrated with the usage of reverse engineering in its attempt to close the loop from data collection to initial hypothesis model formation and revision. More specifically, the CA rules and the rest of the CA parameters are derived by the dissociation of real seismic data of the region under consideration as it was spatiotemporally evolved.

The presented RNN can offer both daily and hourly prediction concerning solar irradiation forecasting. As a result, the proposed model can be used to predict the Photovoltaic Systems output of the HYRES and provide valuable feedback for PMSs of the understudy autonomous system. To do so a flexible network based design of the HYRES is used and, moreover, applied to a specific system located on Olvio, near Xanthi, Greece, as part of SYSTEMS SUNLIGHT S.A. facilities. As a result, the RNN after training with meteorological data of the aforementioned area is applied to the specific HYRES and successfully manages to enhance and optimize its PMS based on the provided solar radiation prediction.",

            "Abstract": "We have developed a model for tissue displacement caused by early tumor growth (ie before the onset of angiogenesis) using cellular automata and solving diffusion equations on the cellular automaton lattice in order to compute the distribution of oxygen and glucose into the tumor. Tumor growth causes mechanical forces that displace the already existing vessels away from it, thus affecting the distribution of oxygen and glucose which in turn influence tumor growth. We simulated this growth process and we found that tissue displacement may affect tumor progression rate. We also found that the relative distance of the tumor initiation area from neighboring vessels influences its growth. The model and the simulation software we developed can be used to understand the dynamics of early tumor growth and to explore various hypotheses of tumor growth relevant to drug delivery in chemotherapy. Importantly, our approach highlights that vessel displacement should not be neglected in tumor growth models.",

The existence of these two sublattices gives rise to the electron pseudospin and, along with the overlapping p z  orbitals, to the absence of back-scattering, which give to graphene high-quality transport properties. Graphene is a gapless material and currents in graphene nanoribbons cannot be effectively switched off. This is the most important obstacle for the use of graphene in the fabrication of integrated logic circuits. Recently, theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the conductance on graphene nanoribbons can be controlled in back and top gated graphene devices.

            "Abstract": "Memristors as emergent nano-electronic devices have been successfully fabricated and used in non-conventional and neuromorphic computing systems in the last years. Several behavioral or physical based models have been developed to explain their operation and to optimize their fabrication parameters. All existing memristor models are trade-offs between accuracy, universality and realism, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is purely characterized as quantum mechanical, despite the fact that quantum mechanical processes are a major part of the memristor operation. In this paper, we employ quantum mechanical methods to develop a complete and accurate filamentary model for the resistance variation during memristor's operating cycle. More specifically, we apply quantum walks to model and compute the motion of atoms forming the filament, tight-binding Hamiltonians to capture the filament structure and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method to compute the conductance of the device. Furthermore, we proceeded with the parallelization of the overall model through Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate our computations and enhance the model's performance adequately. Our simulation results successfully reproduce the resistive switching characteristics of memristors devices, match with existing fabricated devices experimental data, prove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed model in terms of multi-parameterization, and provide a new and useful insight into its operation.",

Understanding and controlling QS is an important step towards a possible solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. QS is a cooperative effort of a bacterial population in which some of the bacteria do not participate. This phenomenon is usually studied using game theory and the non-participating bacteria are modeled as cheaters that exploit the production of common goods (exofactors) by other bacteria. Here, we take a different approach to study the QS dynamics of a growing bacterial population. We model the bacterial population as a growing graph and use spectral graph theory to compute the evolution of its synchronizability. We also treat each bacterium as a source of signaling molecules and use the diffusion equation to compute the \u2026",

The cev1 mutant has constitutive expression of stress response genes and has enhanced resistance to fungal pathogens. Here, we show that cev1 plants have increased production of jasmonate and ethylene and that its phenotype is suppressed by mutations that interrupt jasmonate and ethylene signaling. Genetic mapping, complementation analysis, and sequence analysis revealed that CEV1 is the cellulose synthase CeSA3. CEV1 was expressed predominantly in root tissues, and cev1 roots contained less cellulose than wild-type roots. Significantly, the cev1 mutant phenotype could be reproduced by treating wild-type plants with cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors, and the cellulose synthase mutant rsw1 also had constitutive expression of VSP. We propose that the cell wall can signal stress responses in plants.",

Some critical circuits of computing systems, like memories, use large multiplexers in order to present the value of a specific memory cell to their output. Several quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) circuits have been designed and the need for a QCA memory access system becomes prominent. A modular 2n to 1 QCA multiplexer covering small area could reduce the size of such circuits and conclusively could increase circuit integration. In this paper we present a novel design of a small size, modular quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) 2n to 1 multiplexer that can be used for memory addressing. The design objective is to develop a modular design methodology which can be used to implement 2n to 1 multiplexers using building blocks.

            "Abstract": "In recent years cellular automata (CAs) have been used widely to model and simulate physical systems and also to solve scientific problems. CAs have also been successfully used as a VLSI architecture and have proved to be very efficient at least in terms of silicon-area utilisation and clock-speed maximisation. Quantum cellullar automata (QCA) is one of the promising emerging technologies for nanoscale circuit implementation. QCA technology provides very high scale integration, very high switching frequency and very low power circuit characteristics. In the work reported here, a universal cellular automaton cell has been designed using QCA circuitry. The implementation of CAs using QCA nanoelectronic circuits not only drives the already developed systems based on CAs to the nanoelectronics era but improves their performance significantly.",

The calculation    results are compared with the most frequently used coin, the Hadamard    transform. Furthermore, quantum walks on the line which involve two or more    quantum walkers with hybrid coins are studied. Quantum walks with entangled    walkers and hybrid coins are also studied. The results of these calculations    show that the proposed types of quantum walks can be used for quantum search,    because the walker can be directed towards preferred directions and can also    be confined in certain segments of the line.",

Four quantum-dots placed at the corners of a square form a unit cell, which can hold a bit of information and serve as a basis for quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nanoelectronic circuits. Although several basic QCA circuits have been designed, fabricated, and tested, proving that quantum-dots can form functional, fast and low-power nanoelectronic circuits, QCA nanoelectronics still remain at its infancy. One of the reasons for this is the lack of design automation tools, which will facilitate the systematic design of large QCA circuits that contemporary applications demand. Here we present novel, programmable QCA circuits, which are based on crossbar architecture. These circuits can be programmed to implement any Boolean function in analogy to CMOS field \u2026",

These architectures are based on the evolution of quantum cellular automata, which can possibly simulate both quantum and classical physical systems and processes. It is however known that except for the trivial case, unitary evolution of one-dimensional homogeneous quantum cellular automata with one quantum bit (qubit) per cell is not possible because of the no-go lemma. In this paper, we define quantum cellular automata that comprise two qubits per cell and study their evolution using a quantum computer simulator. The evolution is unitary and its linearity manifests itself as a periodic structure in the probability distribution patterns.",

In single electron circuits bits of information are represented by the presence or absence of single electrons at conducting or semiconducting islands. SECS utilizes the Monte Carlo method and the change in free-energy of the whole circuit determines the tunnel rates of possible tunnel events, providing thus a real time simulation of any arbitrary single-electron circuit. Furthermore, SECS is using the SPICE interface for schematic capture. SPICE models of single-electron circuit structures have been developed and, therefore, SECS can also be used for the design and simulation of hybrid microelectronic\u2014single-electron circuits.",

So far, it has not been possible to decipher the rules that govern DNA sequence evolution due to the extreme complexity of the entire process. In our attempt to approach this issue we focus solely on the mechanisms of mutagenesis and deliberately disregard the role of natural selection. Hence, in this analysis, evolution refers to the accumulation of genetic alterations that originate from mutations and are transmitted through generations without being subjected to natural selection. We have developed a software tool that allows modelling of a DNA sequence as a one-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) with four states per cell which correspond to the four DNA bases, i.e. A, C, T and G. The four states are represented by numbers of the quaternary \u2026",

In classical cryptography, key expansion schemes are used to strengthen security. In this paper we present a quantum key expansion scheme, in which the key is expanded using a quantum cellular automaton. We also present the simulation of quantum key expansion using a quantum computer simulator. Using this scheme a 6-qubit key transmitted from the sender to the receiver, using one of the quantum key distribution protocols, can be expanded to a 24-qubit key without any further communication between them.",

The main obstacle for using graphene as a material for bioelectronic circuits is the lack of a bandgap, which results in noneffective current switching. Here, we use rectangular L-shaped graphene nanoribbons as a building block for graphene logic gates. Electrons are initially transported along the zigzag-edged nanoribbon and then the transport direction changes by 90\u00b0, resulting in transport along the armchair edge. Our computations showed that electron scattering because of this change in the direction causes the appearance of a pseudobandgap, which is large enough for logic operations. This pseudobandgap appears as a zero-conductance region for electron energies near the Fermi level. We propose an and, an or, and a not logic gate and \u2026",

However, this evolution is still restrained by the poor efficiency of memory chips. As a possible solution to the problem, this paper examines a model of re-distributing the memory resources assigned to the processor, especially the on-chip memory, in order to achieve higher performance. The proposed model uses the basic concepts of game theory applied to cellular automata lattices and the iterated spatial prisoner's dilemma game. A simulation was established in order to evaluate the performance of this model under different circumstances. Moreover, a corresponding FPGA logic circuit was designed as a part of an embedded, real-time co-circuit, aiming at memory resources fair distribution.

Here, we show that cev1 plants have increased production of jasmonate and ethylene and that its phenotype is suppressed by mutations that interrupt jasmonate and ethylene signaling. Genetic mapping, complementation analysis, and sequence analysis revealed that CEV1 is the cellulose synthase CeSA3. CEV1 was expressed predominantly in root tissues, and cev1 roots contained less cellulose than wild-type roots. Significantly, the cev1 mutant phenotype could be reproduced by treating wild-type plants with cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors, and the cellulose synthase mutant rsw1 also had \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Resistance switching devices are of special importance because of their application in resistive memories (RRAM) which are promising candidates for replacing current nonvolatile memories and realize storage class memories. These devices exhibit usually memristive properties with many discrete resistance levels and implement artificial synapses. The last years, researchers have demonstrated memristive chips as accelerators in computing, following new in-memory and neuromorphic computational approaches. Many different metal oxides have been used as resistance switching materials in MIM or MIS structures. Understanding of the mechanism and the dynamics of resistance switching is very critical for the modeling and use of memristors in different applications. Here, we demonstrate the bipolar resistance switching of silicon nitride thin films using heavily doped Si and Cu as bottom and top-electrodes, respectively. Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics reveal that under space-charge limited conditions and appropriate current compliance setting, multi-level resistance operation can be achieved. Furthermore, a flexible tuning protocol for multi-level resistance switching was developed applying appropriate SET/RESET pulse sequences. Retention and random telegraph noise measurements performed at different resistance levels. The present results reveal the attractive properties of the examined devices.",

As parts of the population move randomly in the cellular automaton lattice, the disease spreads. We study the effect of two population movement parameters on the epidemic propagation: the distance of movement and the percentage of the population that moves. Furthermore, the model is extended to include the effect of the vaccination of some parts of the population on epidemic propagation. The model establishes the acceleration of the epidemic propagation because of the increment, of the percentage of the moving population, or of the maximum distance of population movement.

Most bacteria species use QS signalling circuits to optimise the secretion of virulence factors that damage their host. Recently, QS has been recognised as a target for antimicrobial drugs that can control bacterial infections. Here the QS process is modelled as a state transition graph with transitions depending on the diffusion and local concentration of the QS molecules (autoinducers). Based on this model a simulation tool has been developed to simulate the QS process in both open and confined spaces. Using this simulation tool a number of numerical experiments has been carried out with various strategies of QS circuit regulation. The results of these experiments showed that regulation of the QS signalling circuit can lead to significantly \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon allotrope with excellent biocompatibility allowing for safe integration in living tissue and is stable in harsh biological environments. Graphene has also very high electron mobilities and long carrier mean-free paths and is a very promising material for new nanoelectronic circuits. Here we present the design and simulation of a graphene Majority logic gate without back-gating, which can be fabricated on one side of the graphene sheet leaving the other free so that the gate can be brought into contact with biological tissue. Graphene majority gates can also operate as AND or OR gates giving rise to new carbon-based nanoelectronic devices for biomedical circuits.",

            "Abstract": "Microtubules are polymers of tubulin subunits (dimers) arranged on a hexagonal lattice. Each tubulin dimer comprises two monomers, the \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin, and can be found in two states. In the first state a mobile negative charge is located into the \u03b1-tubulin monomer and in the second into the \u03b2-tubulin monomer. Each tubulin dimer is modeled as an electrical dipole coupled to its neighbors by electrostatic forces. The location of the mobile charge in each dimer depends on the location of the charges in the dimer's neighborhood. Mechanical forces that act on the microtubule affect the distances between the dimers and alter the electrostatic potential. Changes in this potential affect the mobile negative charge location in each dimer and the charge distribution in the microtubule. The net effect is that mechanical forces affect the charge distribution in microtubules. We propose to exploit this effect and use \u2026",

Cellular automata (CAs) have been applied numerous times as an evolvable technique to the solution of some of the aforementioned complicated problems with great success due to their inherent parallelism, structural locality, regularity and modularity. One of the most difficult problems that CAs dealt with in several cases (i.e. integrated circuit fabrication, pattern recognition and classification, computer aided design, machine vision, etc.) is the identification and the reproduction of circular fronts and shapes. In this paper a CA is used to propagate circular fronts. This CA has an extended Moore neighborhood and a relatively simple local rule based on Boolean operators.

CAs perform as mathematical computation models, but also they are a powerful medium to model nature and natural systems. As a computational platform, CAs come with unified memory and computation in the same physical area, attributed as a strong candidate against the limitations of data transfer, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. On the other hand, Memristors with their inherent Computing-In-Memory compatibility, can be easily considered as appropriate nanoelectronic devices to be coupled with CAs towards an energy and time efficient computational paradigm. In particular, CA present a vast area of applications, comprising various NP-complete hard to be solved \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Graphene has high-quality transport properties, but currents in graphene ribbons cannot be switched OFF, because of the absence of a bandgap. This is the most important obstacle for the use of graphene in the fabrication of integrated logic circuits. Here, we study current switching in zigzag graphene quantum point contacts using tight-binding Hamiltonians and the nonequilibrium Green function method. The current in these quantum point contacts is controlled by a back-gate and a top-gate potential. Our results show that the current can be effectively switched OFF for a potential range of 0.6 V. We explain this effect by computing the energy-band structure corresponding to the various regions of the quantum point contact. We show that these regions do not have a common conducting channel in a sufficiently large energy range and this results in zero conductance for energies in this range.",

In this paper, we apply the Non-Equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method combined with tight-binding Hamiltonians to investigate the effect of lattice defects on the conductance of GNRs. We specifically study, butterfly shaped GNRs, which operate effectively as switches, and have been used in CMOS-like architectures. The cases of the most usual defects, namely the single and double vacancy have been analytically examined. The effect of these vacancies was computed by placing them in different regions and with various numbers on GNR nano-devices, namely edges, main body, contacts \u2026",

These architectures can simulate the evolution of quantum cellular automata, which can possibly simulate both quantum and classical physical systems and processes. It is however known that except for the trivial case, unitary evolution of one-dimensional homogeneous quantum cellular automata with one qubit per cell is not possible. Quantum cellular automata that comprise two qubits per cell are defined and their evolution is studied using a quantum computer simulator. The evolution is unitary and its linearity manifests itself as a periodic structure in the probability distribution patterns.",

This communication is controlled by biological circuits called quorum sensing circuits. Recently quorum sensing circuits have been recognized as an alternative target for controlling bacterial virulence and infections without the use of antibiotics. Here we model the quorum sensing process as a state transition graph. Based on this model we develop a simulation tool for the quorum sensing process in open and confined spaces. We perform a number of numerical experiments with various strategies of quorum sensing circuit regulation and we study the effectiveness of quorum sensing inhibitors. We also use network graph theory to model the complete quorum sensing system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and construct its state space, which \u2026",

On this scale, new phenomena of a quantum nature are starting to appear in ICs. The necessity of the development of new tools for studding the behavior of such circuits that take into account these phenomena is evident. For this reason, a new system for the design and simulation of single electron circuits called SECS has been developed. The operation of single electron circuits is based on the tunneling effect. The stochastic nature due to tunneling is incorporated in the simulation of single electron circuits using the Monte Carlo method. The novelty of the SECS system is that it provides the behavior of single electron circuits in an actual time scale, making thus easier and more complete the study of the phenomena that take place at an arbitrary single electron circuit.",

Quantum simulators are quantum systems that can perform specific quantum computations, or software packages that can reproduce most of the aspects of a general universal quantum computer on a general purpose classical computer. Development of quantum simulators using digital circuits, such as FPGAs is very difficult, mainly because the unit of quantum information, the qubit, has an infinite number of states, whereas the classical bit has only two. On the other hand, analog circuits comprising R, L and C elements have no internal state variables that can be used to reproduce and store qubit states. Here we take the first step towards the development of a new quantum simulator using memristors. The qubit state is mapped to a 3D space spanned by the memristances of three identical memristors.

The design and operation of two basic single-electron gates and the basic memory cell are presented.

While the conductance modulation of graphene pn junctions formed in devices with one bottom and one top gate have received much attention, there is comparatively little work done on devices with two top gates. Here, we employ tight-bind Hamiltonians and non-equilibrium Green function method to compute in a systematic way the dependence of the conductance of graphene pn junctions, formed in a device with two top gates, on the device parameters. We present our results in a compact and systematic way, so that the effect of each parameter is clearly shown. Our results show that the device conductance can be effectively modulated, and that graphene devices with two top gates may be used as basic elements in future carbon-based nanoelectronic circuits.",

For example, SA-dependent defenses are required for resistance to the biotrophic fungal pathogen Erysiphe cichoracearum UCSC1 and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola, and also are expressed during response to the green peach aphid Myzus persicae. However, recent evidence indicates that the expression of JA-dependent defenses also may confer resistance to E. cichoracearum. To confirm and to extend this observation, we have compared the disease and pest resistance of wild-type Arabidopsis plants with that of the mutants coi1, which is insensitive to JA, and \u2026",

Experiments were performed for periodic and isolated lines with pitches 300, 400, 500, and 1000 nm, for exposure energy doses of 11, 13, 17, and 23 mJ/cm/sup 2/, and with developer temperatures of 0, 20, and 80/spl deg/C.

            "Abstract": "Signal synchronization of large scale Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) circuits is one of the most complex QCA design challenges. More specifically, the QCA circuits synchronization problem, especially in the large circuits, is characterized as rather complex due to technology constraints. In this paper, by extensively analyzing the most important properties of the signal synchronization problem in QCA circuits, we propose an efficient design methodology to tackle the problem, based on the well-known from computer science, Firing Squad Synchronization Problem (FSSP). Comparing FSSP with the QCA circuits synchronization problem many similarities can be found. Among the numerous FSSP's algorithmic solutions in literature, the Mazoyer algorithm has proven to be the most efficient one. In this paper, a novel design and implementation in QCA technology of this algorithm is presented. Moreover, by the \u2026",

By taking advantage of the Coulomb blockade effect, the conversion of the analog input to a digital signal is obtained directly without the use of reference voltages, counters or other auxiliary circuitry. The operation of the A to D converter is simulated and the electron transport in the circuit is analyzed. The stability of the single-electron A to D converter circuit is studied and its stable operation is shown. The main result of this research work is that single-electron A to D converters are simple, stable and can be fabricated.",

CAs can be simulated exactly by computers and algorithms based on CAs are ideally suited for hardware implementation, due to their discreteness and their simple, regular and modular structure with local interconnections. On the other hand, power dissipation is recognized as a critical parameter in modern VLSI design field. As a result, the study of the undergoing relationship between CA algorithms and the corresponding power consumption could be considered as a matter of importance for their VLSI design analysis with many promising aspects. In this paper, different point of views on power consumption and CAs will be presented. First of all, a power estimation model for combinational logic circuits using CA and focused on glitching estimation is presented in order to elucidate the application of CA model to VLSI \u2026",

This communication is controlled by biological circuits called quorum sensing (QS) circuits. Recently QS circuits and have been recognized as an alternative target for controlling bacterial virulence and infections without the use of antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that infects insects, plants, animals and humans and can cause acute infections. This bacterium has three interconnected QS circuits that form a very complex and versatile QS system, the operation of which is still under investigation.

The simulated integrated circuit fabrication processes considered are lithography, oxidation, and deposition processes. The proposed methodology establishes the ability to capture the essential features of these integrated circuit fabrication processes and to translate them into a suitable form, in order to obtain an effective cellular automaton model, for each process. Several numerical experiments were carried out, in this work, using the cellular automaton algorithms obtained, and their results were found to be in very good agreement with published experimental results.

Existing quantum algorithms can natively solve complex problems, such as the prime number factorization and searching of unstructured databases, in a fast and efficient way. The main obstacle towards building large and efficient quantum computers is decoherence, which produces errors that have to be continuously corrected using quantum error correcting codes. Beyond the realisation of quantum computing systems with actual quantum hardware, quantum algorithms have been developed based on quantum logic gates that can be described and utilised by classical computers and proper interfaces based on linear algebra operations. Furthermore, memristive grids have been proposed as novel nanoscale and low-power hardware accelerators for the time-consuming matrix-vector multiplication and tensor products \u2026",

In this paper, we present a computational tool, based on genetic algorithms (GAs), which is able to predict with observed data the regulatory pathways that are represented as influence matrix.

CAs have been applied successfully to the simulation of several physical systems and processes, and have been extensively used as a very large-scale integrated (VLSI) architecture.We present a CAD system that builds a bridge between CAs as models of physical systems and processes, and CAs as a VLSI architecture. The inputs to our CAD system are the CA dimensionality, lattice size, local rule, and the initial and boundary conditions imposed by the particular problem.

Here we study graphene p\u2013n junctions with two trapezoid top gates and a common back gate with special focus to the effect of the angle and the distance between the two top gates. Furthermore, trapezoid top gates with angles of 45\u00b0 make use of the Veselago lens effect, allowing an effective control by tuning density of states and carrier density.

Cellular automata (CAs) are a well-known and successful model for complex systems. This paper presents a system for modeling and simulation of computer networks based on CAs. More specifically, a 2D NaSch CA computer network model has been developed, and several networks were simulated. Algorithms for connectivity evaluation, system reliability evaluation, and shortest path computation in a computer network have also been implemented. Our system, called Net_CA system, was designed and developed as an interactive tool that offers automated modeling with the assistance of a dynamic and user-friendly graphical environment. The proposed system also produces automatically synthesizable very high speed integrated circuits hardware description language code leading to the parallel \u2026",

Here we explain the near-unit photosynthetic efficiency without invoking non-trivial quantum effects. Instead, we use non-equilibrium Green\u2019s functions, a mesoscopic method used to study transport in nano-conductors to compute the transmission function of the Fenna\u2013Matthews\u2013Olson (FMO) complex using an experimentally derived exciton Hamiltonian.

However, it is generally assumed that its bandgap absence impedes Graphene Nanoribbons (GNRs) utilization as foundational elements for nanoelectronic circuits. In this paper we provide evidence against this belief and demonstrate that Graphene is indeed a strong post-Si nanoelectronics forerunner. In particular, we (i) reveal GNR\u2019s conductance dependence on shape and external biasing and (ii) discuss the realization of multiple-contact GNRs, GNR-based switches, and Graphene pn junctions. Our results clearly indicate that GNR devices can potentially outperform state of the art Boolean circuits performance.",

Stability analysis using free-energy diagrams and stability plots verified the correct and stable gate operation. The operation temperature of the single-electron Fredkin is expected to rise as dimensions of the circuit's conducting islands are reduced.",

Quorum sensing is such a process in which signaling molecules, called autoinducers, are produced, secreted and detected. In several cases bacteria use more than one autoinducers and integrate the information conveyed by them. It has not yet been explained adequately why bacteria evolved such signal integration circuits and what can learn about their environments using more than one autoinducers since all signaling pathways merge in one. Here quantum information theory, which includes classical information theory as a special case, is used to construct a quantum gate circuit that reproduces recent experimental results.

L-shaped and T-shaped graphene nanoribbons received a little or no attention until now. In this letter, we present computations of the conductance of L-shaped graphene nanoribbons with two contacts and of T-shaped graphene nanoribbons with tree contacts. We used tight-binding Hamiltonians and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute their conductance. In L and T-shaped nanoribbons electrons are initially transported along a zigzag-edged nanoribbon, and then the direction of their motion changes by 90O and are transported along an armchair-edged nanoribbon. Our results show that this change in direction of motion results in a zero-conductance region that extents about 0.25 eV below and above the Fermi level. This zero conductance region is large enough to cause \u2026",
