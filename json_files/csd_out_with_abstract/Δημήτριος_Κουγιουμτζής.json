            "Abstract": "In the prediction of oscillating time series, the interest is in the turning points of successive oscillations rather than the samples themselves. For this purpose a scheme has been proposed; the state space reconstruction is limited to the turning points and the local (nearest neighbor) model is modified in order to predict the turning point magnitudes and times. This approach is extended here using a local dynamic regression model on both turning point magnitudes and times. Simulations on oscillating nonlinear systems show that the proposed approach gives better predictions of turning points than the standard local model applied to all the samples of the oscillating time series.",

            "Abstract": "In network analysis it is important to contrast the given or formed network to a random network, typically by means of significance testing of some network measures. This requires the generation of random networks that preserve certain properties of the original network, ie the total number of nodes and connections or even the number of connections of each node. In this paper we show that these schemes are not appropriate for correlation or causality networks formed from multivariate time series, which have nodes the observed variables and connections given by some measure of correlation (undirected connections) or Granger causality (directed connections). Further, we propose a scheme that performs the randomization on the time series rather than the network connections. Particularly for the networks formed by cross correlation, we generate surrogates for each time series preserving the marginal distribution and linear autocorrelation, and form the network from the surrogate multivariate time series. Simulations on multivariate time series with no inter-dependencies shows that the classical network randomization erroneously tends to reject the null hypothesis of random network, whereas the proposed scheme does not.",

The surrogate data generating algorithms AAFT, IAAFT and STAP, as well as a residual-based bootstrap algorithm, all used for the randomization or bootstrap test for nonlinearity, are reviewed and their performance is compared using different nonlinear statistics for the test. The simulations on linear and nonlinear stochastic systems, as well as chaotic systems, reveals a variation in the test outcome with the algorithm and statistic. Overall, the bootstrap algorithm led to smallest test power whereas the STAP algorithm gave consistently good results in terms of size and power of the test.

CMI of order m is the mutual information of two variables in the Markov chain being m time steps apart, conditioning on the intermediate variables of the chain. The null distribution of CMI is approximated with a normal and gamma distribution deriving analytic expressions of their parameters, and a gamma distribution deriving its parameters from the mean and variance of the normal distribution.

Rather than removing or filling the gaps, the rows of the joint data matrix containing empty entries are removed and the calculations are done on the remainder matrix. The method, called measure adapted gap removal (MAGR), can be applied to any connectivity measure that uses a joint data matrix, such as cross correlation, cross mutual information and transfer entropy. MAGR is favorably compared using these three measures to a number of known gap-filling techniques, as well as the gap closure.

The approaches were applied to 300-beats series of T, S, R measured in the supine (su) and upright (up) positions during HUT. Both MB and MF approaches detected a unidirectional information transfer from R to T and from R to S, and a significant decrease of the TE from R to T, as well as a significant increase of the TE from S to T, moving from su to up. For the MF approach, these trends were supported by the statistical test for TE significance. These results suggest that TE estimated from T, S and R variability can \u2026",

Granger causality and similar concepts are employed for the estimation of the brain network from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Also source localization techniques, such as the standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), are widely used for more reliable data and results. In this work, connectivity structures are estimated in the sensor and in the source space making use of the sLORETA transformation for simulated and for EEG data with episodes of spontaneous epileptiform discharges (ED). The comparative simulation study on high-dimensional coupled stochastic and deterministic systems concludes that the structure of the estimated causality networks differs in the sensor space and in the source space. Moreover, different network types, such as random, small-world and scale-free, can be better discriminated in the sensor space than in the source space. The simulation results are in agreement with the findings for the EEG epochs containing EDs, concluding that the structural change (before and during ED) can be better detected in the sensor space.",

            "Abstract": "Many methods of Granger causality, or broadly termed connectivity, have been developed to assess the causal relationships between the system variables based only on the information extracted from the time series. The power of these methods to capture the true underlying connectivity structure has been assessed using simulated dynamical systems where the ground truth is known. Here, we consider the presence of an unobserved variable that acts as a hidden source for the observed high-dimensional dynamical system and study the effect of the hidden source on the estimation of the connectivity structure. In particular, the focus is on estimating the direct causality effects in high-dimensional time series (not including the hidden source) of relatively short length. We examine the performance of a linear and a nonlinear connectivity measure using dimension reduction and compare them to a linear measure designed for latent variables. For the simulations, four systems are considered, the coupled H\u00e9non maps system, the coupled Mackey\u2013Glass system, the neural mass model and the vector autoregressive (VAR) process, each comprising 25 subsystems (variables for VAR) at close chain coupling structure and another subsystem (variable for VAR) driving all others acting as the hidden source. The results show that the direct causality measures estimate, in general terms, correctly the existing connectivity in the absence of the source when its driving is zero or weak, yet fail to detect the actual relationships when the driving is strong, with the nonlinear measure of dimension reduction performing best.

In this work, a large number of Granger causality measures used to form causality networks from multivariate time series are assessed. These measures are in the time domain, such as model-based and information measures, the frequency domain, and the phase domain. The study aims also to compare bivariate and multivariate measures, linear and nonlinear measures, as well as the use of dimension reduction in linear model-based measures and information measures. The latter is particular relevant in the study of high-dimensional time series. For the performance of the multivariate causality measures, low and high dimensional coupled dynamical systems are considered in discrete and continuous time, as well as deterministic and stochastic. The measures are evaluated and ranked according to their ability to provide causality networks that match the original coupling structure. The simulation study concludes that the Granger causality measures using dimension reduction are superior and should be preferred particularly in studies involving many observed variables, such as multi-channel electroencephalograms and financial markets.

We examine the consistency of the estimators (convergence to a stable value with the increase of time series length) and the degree of deviation among the estimators. The optimization of parameters is assessed by quantifying the deviation of the estimated mutual information from its true or asymptotic value as a function of the free parameter.

The comparative study is based on Monte Carlo simulations on time series from several linear and nonlinear systems of different lengths and noise levels.

Two resampling methods, (1) the time shifted surrogates and (2) the stationary bootstrap, are combined with the following three independence settings (giving in total six resampling schemes), all consistent with the null hypothesis of non-causality: (a) only the driving variable is resampled, (b) both the driving and response variable are resampled, and (c) both the driving and response variable are resampled while also the dependence of the future of the response variable and the vector of its past values is destroyed. The empirical null distribution of the PTE as the surrogate and bootstrapped time series become more independent is examined along with the size and power of the respective tests.",

Here, we propose the correction of PTE, termed Corrected PTE (CPTE), in a similar way to CTE: time shifted surrogates are used in order to quantify and correct the bias, and the estimation of the involved entropies of high-dimensional variables is made with the method of k-nearest neighbors.

The measures are organized in two categories: correlation measures, such as autocorrelation and mutual information at specific lags and new measures derived from oscillations of the EEG time series, such as mean oscillation peak and mean oscillation period. All measures are computed on successive segments of multichannel EEG windows selected from early, intermediate and late preictal states from four epochs. Hypothesis tests applied for each channel and epoch showed good discrimination of the preictal states and allowed for the selection of optimal measures. These optimal measures, together with other standard measures (skewness, kurtosis, largest Lyapunov exponent) formed the feature set for feature-based clustering and the feature-subset \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the non-linear analysis of scalar time series the common practice is to reconstruct the state space using time-delay embedding. When there are more than one observed quantities, one can reconstruct the state space using a time-delay embedding scheme specifying embedding parameters for each quantity. In this study we investigate the state space reconstruction from multiple time series derived from continuous systems and propose a method for building the embedding vector progressively using information measure criteria. The proposed method is compared to other methods with simulations on known chaotic systems, such as individual and coupled Lorenz and R\u00f6ssler systems. Our analysis showed that multivariate attractor reconstruction preserves better the dynamics of a system and our proposed method gives a parsimonious alternative to the simple extension of the univariate case.",

In particular, the direct causal effects are commonly estimated by the conditional Granger causality index (CGCI). In the presence of many observed variables and relatively short time series, CGCI may fail because it is based on vector autoregressive models (VAR) involving a large number of coefficients to be estimated. In this paper, the VAR is restricted by a scheme that modifies the recently developed method of backward-in-time selection (BTS) of the lagged variables and the CGCI is combined with BTS. Further, the proposed approach is compared favorably to other restricted VAR representations, such as the top-down strategy, the bottom-up strategy, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), in terms of sensitivity and specificity of CGCI.

Focusing on causality measures that make use of delay vectors from time series, the idea is to account for non-stationarity by considering the ranks of the components of the delay vectors rather than the components themselves. As an exemplary measure, we introduce the partial symbolic transfer entropy (PSTE), which is an extension of the bivariate symbolic transfer entropy quantifying only the direct causal effects among the variables of a multivariate system. Through Monte Carlo simulations it is shown that the PSTE is directly applicable to non-stationary in mean and variance time series and it is not affected by the existence of outliers and VAR filtering. For stationary time series, the PSTE is also compared to the linear conditional Granger causality index (CGCI). Finally, the causal effects among \u2026",

Methods for TMS artifact correction have been developed to remove the artifact and recover the underlying, immediate response of the cerebral cortex to the magnetic stimulus. In this study, four such algorithms are evaluated. Since there is no ground truth for the masked brain activity, pilot data formed from the superposition of the isolated TMS artifact on EEG brain activity are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.

An understanding of the biomechanical behavior of the oral mucosa is essential in order to improve the denture-bearing foundations for complete and partially edentulous patients. The purpose of this paper was to examine the biomechanical behavior of the soft tissues supporting a removable denture and develop a model for that reason. Keratinized oral mucosa blocks with their underlying bone were harvested from the maxillary palatal area adjacent to the edentulous ridges of a cadaver. The compressive response of the oral mucosa was tested by using atomic force microscopy. The specimens were first scanned in order their topography to be obtained. The mechanical properties of the specimens were tested using a single crystal silicon pyramidal tip, which traversed towards the keratinized oral mucosa specimens. Loading-unloading cycles were registered and four mathematical models were tested using MATLAB to note which one approximates the force-displacement curve as close as possible: a. spherical, b. conical, c. third order polynomial, d. Murphy (fourth order polynomial, non-linear Hertzian based). The third order polynomial model showed the best accuracy in representing the force-displacement data of the tested specimens. A model was developed in order to analyze the biomechanical behavior of the human oral keratinized mucosa and obtain information about its mechanical properties.",

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been recently acknowledged as a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can be used in focal epilepsy for therapeutic purposes. In this case study, it is investigated whether simple time-domain connectivity measures, namely cross-correlation and partial cross-correlation, can detect alterations in the connectivity structure estimated from selected EEG channels before and during ED, as well as how this changes with the application of TMS. The correlation for each channel pair is computed on non-overlapping windows of 1 s duration forming weighted networks. Further, binary networks are derived by thresholding or statistical significance tests (parametric and randomization tests). The information for the binary networks is summarized by statistical network measures, such as the average degree and the average path length. Alterations of brain connectivity before, during and after ED with or without TMS are identified by statistical analysis of the network measures at each state. View Full-Text",

The optimal usage of this technique requires the elucidation of important methodological aspects and the application of the method in healthy subjects prior to the investigation of patient cohorts. Subjects and Methods: Ten neurologically normal subjects (aged 19-47 years of age) entered the study after giving informed consent for the procedures which were approved by an institutional review board. hd-EEG was performed in electrically shielded conditions using a 64-channel hd-EEG device (TMS-compatible eXimia, Nexstim Oy, Finland). During acquisition, the reference channel was attached to the right mastoid and the ground electrode was placed on the right zygomatic bone at a distance of approximately 4 cm from each other. The EEG signals were band-pass filtered from 0.1 to 500 Hz and sampled with a 1450 Hz sampling frequency and 16-bit precision. For data analysis, we selected artifact-free channels and preprocessed the data by applying a band-pass filter (low pass frequency 0.01 Hz and high pass frequency 70 Hz, filter order 60) and downsampling to 200 Hz. The EEG data were then re-referenced to infinity as well as to common average. Brain networks were constructed in artifact free epochs during resting state using linear and non-linear measures of brain connectivity. Conclusion: High-density EEG can be used to construct and describe brain networks quantitatively. The importance of certain methodological aspects in this procedure is highlighted.",

We find approximate analytic significance limits based on the estimation bias of CMI and develop a randomization significance test of I c (m), where the randomized symbol sequences are formed by random permutation of the components of the original symbol sequence. The significance test is applied for increasing m and the Markov chain order is estimated by the last order for which the null hypothesis is rejected.

            "Abstract": "Different resampling methods for the null hypothesis of no Granger causality are assessed in the setting of multivariate time series, taking into account that the driving-response coupling is conditioned on the other observed variables. As appropriate test statistic for this setting, the partial transfer entropy (PTE), an information and model-free measure, is used. Two resampling techniques, time-shifted surrogates and the stationary bootstrap, are combined with three independence settings (giving a total of six resampling methods), all approximating the null hypothesis of no Granger causality. In these three settings, the level of dependence is changed, while the conditioning variables remain intact. The empirical null distribution of the PTE, as the surrogate and bootstrapped time series become more independent, is examined along with the size and power of the respective tests. Additionally, we consider a seventh resampling method by contemporaneously resampling the driving and the response time series using the stationary bootstrap. Although this case does not comply with the no causality hypothesis, one can obtain an accurate sampling distribution for the mean of the test statistic since its value is zero under H0. Results indicate that as the resampling setting gets more independent, the test becomes more conservative. Finally, we conclude with a real application. More specifically, we investigate the causal links among the growth rates for the US CPI, money supply and crude oil. Based on the PTE and the seven resampling methods, we consistently find that changes in crude oil cause inflation conditioning on money supply in the post-1986 \u2026",

Symbolic transfer entropy (STE) is defined similarly to TE but on the ranks of the components of the reconstructed vectors rather than the reconstructed vectors themselves. First, we correct STE by forming the ranks for the future samples of the response system with regard to the current reconstructed vector. We give the grounds for this modified version of STE, which we call Transfer Entropy on Rank Vectors (TERV). Then we propose to use more than one step ahead in the formation of the future of the response in order to capture the information flow from the driving system over a longer time horizon. To assess the performance of STE, TE and TERV in detecting correctly the information flow we use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves formed by the measure values in the two coupling directions computed on a number of realizations of known weakly coupled systems. We also consider different settings of state space reconstruction, time series length and observational noise. The results show that TERV indeed improves STE and in some cases performs better than TE, particularly in the presence of noise, but overall TE gives more consistent results. The use of multiple steps ahead improves the accuracy of TE and TERV.",

            "Abstract": "For the quantification of strength and identification of direction of coupling between two sub-systems of a complex dynamical system, observed from bivariate time series, a number of measures have been proposed that can be grouped in measures of phase synchronization, state space and information. We review all these measures and, in particular, for the information measures we examine different estimates of the probability distributions. We propose also a modification of the transfer entropy measure to span larger time windows and thus be more appropriate for flows. Simulations on systems of different types and for varying coupling strengths showed that information measures, and the modified transfer entropy measure in particular, detect best the coupling strength and direction. This is also found when applying the measures to pairs of EEG channels in order to detect the propagation of pre-epileptic brain \u2026",

A multivariate framework for estimating Granger causality is essential in order to account for all the available information from multivariate time series.

To deal with this issue, direct causality measures using variable selection and dimension reduction techniques have been introduced. In this comparative work, the performance of an ensemble of bivariate and multivariate causality measures in the time domain is assessed, focusing on dimension reduction causality measures. In particular, different types of high-dimensional coupled discrete systems are used (involving up to 100 variables) and the robustness of the causality measures to time \u2026",

The clustering efficiency was measured by the corrected Rand index and the results showed the prevalence of oscillating-related features. The same setting was applied to real-world oscillating time series, ie epileptic electroencephalograms and optokinetic signals, giving good discrimination of pathological states.",

The focus of the study is on assessing the different network measures as to their ability in discriminating different dynamic regimes of the system underlying the multivariate time series. For this, we first compute the network measures on many realizations of the coupled Mackey-Glass system under different coupling structures, and then to electroencephalogram recordings containing episodes of epileptiform discharges.

The method of false nearest neighbors is often used to estimate the embedding dimension. For prediction purposes, the optimal embedding dimension can also be estimated by some prediction error minimization criterion. We investigate the proper state space reconstruction for multivariate time series and modify the two abovementioned criteria to search for optimal embedding in the set of the variables and their delays. We pinpoint the problems that can arise in each case and compare the state space reconstructions (suggested by each of the two methods) on the predictive ability of the local model that uses each of them. Results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations on known chaotic maps revealed the non-uniqueness of optimum reconstruction in the multivariate case and showed that prediction criteria perform better when the task is prediction.",

The general concept of brain connectivity encompasses different aspects: structural connectivity is related to the description of anatomical pathways and synaptic connections; functional connectivity investigates statistical dependencies between spatially separated brain regions; effective connectivity refers to models aimed at elucidating driver-response relationships. The study of these different modes of brain connectivity is fundamental both for the investigation of the neurophysiological processes engaged in cognitive and perceptive processing and for the assessment of a variety of neurological disorders.Over the last past few decades, the continuous advancement of multichannel data acquisition technologies has made it possible to collect neuroscience data at multiple levels of description, ranging from neural spikes to local field potentials and electroencephalography (EEG)-magnetoencephalography (MEG). This increasing data availability and the contemporaneous improvement of signal processing capabilities have contributed in placing increasing demands on methods for the quantitative assessment of neural interactions.

The nodes of the seismic network represent seismic zones and the connections between them are given by the time succession of two earthquakes of any seismic zones. Five different approaches for determining the weighted connections are studied based on different normalizations of the frequencies of successions for each pair of nodes (areas). In particular, two approaches transform the transition matrix to transition probability matrix of a Markov chain or Gibbs sequence. The network structure is quantified by five selected network measures, and we assess how changes in seismicity (number of earthquakes or seismic moment release) in sliding time windows (eg decades) agree with changes in the network structure. It turns out that the best matching of seismicity and network measures is succeeded with the two approaches normalizing the maximum frequency of a succession pair, over the current time window or over all time windows, and with the approach that is based on probability distribution for the pairs of nodes. For the approaches transforming the transition matrix to transition probability matrix, a test is developed for the null hypothesis according to which the observed transition in a time window is equal to the predicted one on the basis on the information given from the previous time window. The developed parametric test is based on Chi-square null distribution and shows that the null hypothesis could not be rejected in some time windows, providing a tool for future seismic hazard \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A number of measures have been proposed for the direction of the coupling between two time series, and transfer entropy (TE) has been found in recent studies to perform consistently well in different settings. Symbolic transfer entropy (STE) has been very recently proposed as a variation of the transfer entropy operating on the ranks of the components of the reconstructed vectors rather than the reconstructed vectors themselves. Here, an improvement of STE is proposed. Specifically, the ranks of the samples of the response system for given time steps ahead are computed with regard to the current reconstructed vector. The grounds of this modification are given and the new measure, called Transfer Entropy on Rank Vectors (TERV), is compared to STE and TE on different settings of state space reconstruction, time series length and observational noise. The results on two simulated systems have shown that the detection of the direction and strength of coupling is improved with TERV over both STE and TE.",

The null hypothesis of least deterministic structure is that the time series of extreme values is a bounded random walk of alternating direction (BRWAD); that is, besides the constraint of succession of minima to maxima bounded at a predefined range there are no other correlations in the data. To implement the test we use surrogate data generated by a model consistent with a BRWAD type process, which also uses the statistics of the original data to best mimic them. The proposed \u2026",

In patients with epilepsy, TMS can induce epileptiform discharges (EDs) with a stochastic occurrence despite constant stimulation parameters. This observation raises the possibility that the pre-stimulation period contains multiple covert states of brain excitability some of which are associated with the generation of EDs. Objective: To investigate whether the interictal period contains \"high excitability\" states that upon brain stimulation produce EDs and can be differentiated from \"low excitability\" states producing normal appearing TMS-EEG responses.

Sensorimotor rhythm-based BCIs have demonstrated remarkable results in controlling virtual or physical external devices but they still face a number of challenges and limitations. Main challenges include multiple degrees-of-freedom control, accuracy, and robustness. In this work, we develop a multiclass BCI decoding algorithm that uses electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging, a technique that maps scalp potentials to cortical activations, to compensate for low spatial resolution of EEG. Spatial features were extracted using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filters in the cortical source space from a number of selected Regions of Interest (ROIs). Classification was performed through an ensemble model, based on individual ROI classification models. The evaluation was performed on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a, which features 4 motor imagery classes from 9 participants. Our results revealed a mean accuracy increase of 5.6% with respect to the conventional application method of CSP on sensors. Neuroanatomical constraints and prior neurophysiological knowledge play an important role in developing source space-based BCI algorithms. Feature selection and classifier characteristics of our implementation will be explored to raise performance to current state-of-the-art.",

The correct test size is obtained for larger data sizes as autocorrelation increases and only when a randomization test that accounts for autocorrelation is used.

At the mean-field level the dynamics shows quasiperiodicity and chaos depending on the parameter values. The realization of the model on a square lattice shows that spatial restrictions and intrinsic stochasticity change the whole picture. The mean-field dynamics qualitatively remains only under global reactions, while local reactions drive the lattice to poisoning, where only some of the species survive. Nontrivial oscillatory steady states are developed if long-distance exchange is introduced due to gradual mixing with a certain probability. The mixing probability is shown to control the transition to synchronization which emerges abruptly following a phase slip scenario. Near the transition a typical intermittency crisis takes place, with phase slips becoming more \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Local linear prediction is one of several methods that have been applied to prediction of real time series including financial time series. The difference from global linear prediction is that, for every single point prediction, a different linear autoregressive (AR) model is estimated based only on a number of selected past scalar data segments. Geometrically, these data segments correspond to points close to the target point when the time series is viewed in a pseudo-state space with dimension equal to the order of the local AR model.The parameters of the local linear model are typically estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). Apart from potential linearisation errors, a drawback of this approach is the high variance of the predictions under certain conditions. It has been shown that a different set of so-called regularisation techniques, originally derived to solve ill-posed regression problems, gives more stable solutions (and thus better predictions) than OLS on noisy chaotic time series. Three regularisation techniques are considered, ie principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS) and ridge regression (RR). These methods reduce the variance compared to OLS, but introduce more bias. A main tool of this analysis is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and a key to successful regularisation is to dampen the higher order SVD components. For the sake of completeness, truncated total least squares is discussed as well, which is designed to solve \u201cerror-in-variables\u201d problems. Even though it would be expected that this method is more appropriate for noisy time series, it turns out to give the worst predictions.",

For the order estimation, the parametric significance test of conditional mutual information IC(m) is applied, found in an earlier work to be suitable for high order estimation. Here, it is computationally optimized applying an iterative algorithm for calculating IC(m) at increasing order m, enabling the analysis of long symbol sequences of high Markov chain order or LRC. The simulation study shows that when the true order is reasonably small, the estimated order saturates at the true order with the increase of the symbol sequence length, while when the true order is very large or the chain has LRC, the estimated order increases \u2026",

The study area is divided into 5 subareas (seismic zones) that are homogenous from the seismotectonic point of view and the seismic catalog is divided into subsets for four magnitude ranges. Two Markov chains are defined with respect to predefined time window, one having as states the occurrence or not of strong earthquakes in any of the 5 subareas ( states), and one having as states the occurrence or not of strong earthquakes anywhere in Greece at any of the four magnitude ranges ( states). The states constitute the nodes of a network with weighted directed connections defined by the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. he null hypothesis that the Markov chain has no memory is rejected using test statistics for three memoryless models (uniform, Poissonian and fixed Markov chain). It is confirmed that the degree (strength) distribution of the network matches well the limiting state distribution of the Markov chain. In a different approach, two semi-Markov models are developed, one for subareas (5 states) and one for magnitudes (4 states), for the sequence of strong earthquakes using appropriate time step and core matrices.

We compared the efficiency of two methods for feature selection, the Forward Sequential Selection (FSS) and Support Vector Machines with Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE). The classification was applied to 12 extra-cranial preictal EEG recordings of different epileptic patients and gave successful separation between early and late preictal states (about three hours and half an hour before the seizure onset, respectively) using only a small feature subset, which most frequently was comprised of any of the following features: permutation entropy, Higuchi dimension, median of local extremes, energy band and Hjorth complexity. The optimal feature subsets that selected by the two feature selection strategies for the same classification problems were found very often to have common features. Using these feature subsets, clustering with k-means partitioning algorithm was applied to a test set of EEG segments of early and late preictal states from the same recordings. The results indicated a good agreement between the estimated clusters and the original preictal states for the cases where the classification efficiency was high.",

The connections of earthquake networks are constructed from successive earthquakes and the nodes are represented by cells of normal grids that were considered superimposed on the study areas. The dynamic evolution of the network structure is examined at sliding windows for identifying periods of statistically significant change, i.e., the network structure differentiation from that of a random network, where the structure is characterized by selected network measures, including the index of small-worldness property. By studying the structure of complex earthquake network, a distinct dynamic evolution is revealed, 2 months before the main shock occurrence. Particularly, the network measures, such as clustering coefficient and small-worldness \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Local linear prediction is one of several methods that have been applied to prediction of real time series including financial time series. The difference from global linear prediction is that, for every single point prediction, a different linear autoregressive (AR) model is estimated based only on a number of selected past scalar data segments. Geometrically, these data segments correspond to points close to the target point when the time series is viewed in a pseudo-state space with dimension equal to the order of the local AR model.The parameters of the local linear model are typically estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). Apart from potential linearisation errors, a drawback of this approach is the high variance of the predictions under certain conditions. It has been shown that a different set of so-called regularisation techniques, originally derived to solve ill-posed regression problems, gives \u2026",

In the current approach, we concentrate specifically on genes and intergenic regions. To estimate the level and type of correlation in these regions we apply various statistical methods inspired from nonlinear time series analysis, namely the probability distribution of tuplets, the Mutual Information and the Identical Neighbour Fit. The methods are suitably modified to work on symbolic sequences and they are first tested for validity on sequences obtained from well-known simple deterministic and stochastic models. Then they are applied to the DNA sequence of chromosome 1 of arabidopsis thaliana. The results suggest that correlations do exist in the DNA sequence but they are weak and that intergenic sequences tend to \u2026",

In order to predict the turning point magnitudes and times it is proposed to form the state space reconstruction only from the turning points and modify the local (nearest-neighbor) model accordingly. The model on turning points gives optimal predictions at a lower dimensional state space than the optimal local model applied directly on the oscillating time series and is thus computationally more efficient. Simulations on different oscillating nonlinear systems showed that it gives better predictions of turning points and this is confirmed also for the time series of annual sunspots and total stress in a plastic deformation experiment.",

In this work, a large number of Granger causality measures used to form causality networks from multivariate time series are assessed. For this, realizations on high dimensional coupled dynamical systems are considered and the performance of the Granger causality measures is evaluated, seeking for the measures that form networks closest to the true network of the dynamical system. In particular, the comparison focuses on Granger causality measures that reduce the state space dimension when many variables are observed. Further, the linear and nonlinear Granger causality measures of dimension reduction are compared to a standard Granger causality measure on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings containing episodes of epileptiform discharges.",

The measure is an extension of a recently published measure of conditional mutual information from mixed embedding (MIME) for bivariate time series. In the proposed measure of partial MIME (PMIME), the embedding is on all observed variables and it is optimized in explaining the response variable. It is shown that PMIME detects correctly direct coupling and outperforms the (linear) conditional Granger causality and the partial transfer entropy. We demonstrate that PMIME does not rely on significance test and embedding parameters and the number of observed variables has no effect on its statistical accuracy; it may only slow the computations. The importance of these points is shown in simulations and in an application to epileptic multichannel scalp electroencephalograms.",

Moreover, we investigate the effect of the standardization scheme on the feature selection and propose a standardization given by the transform to standard Gaussian distribution. Our interest in this work is in classification of oscillating dynamical systems on the basis of measures computed on time series from these systems. The features to be selected are measures of linear and non-linear analysis of time series, such as auto-correlation and Lyapunov exponents, as well as oscillation characteristics, such as the mean magnitude of peaks. Simulations on known oscillating deterministic and stochastic systems showed that, for repeated realizations of the same classification task, the proposed feature selection scheme selected very often the same best feature subset, giving high classification accuracy for any standardization. We found that, regardless of the standardization, the highest classification accuracy could be obtained with a small feature subset, containing most frequently an oscillating-related feature. The same setting was applied to records of epileptic electroencephalogram signals, giving varying results and dependent on the standardization.",

For the implementa-tion of the test, surrogate data are generated to represent the null hypothesis, ie to possess the sample autocorrelation and amplitude distribution of the given data and be otherwise random. A new method to generate surrogate data is pro-posed, called Statically Transformed Autoregressive Process (STAP), which identifies a normal autoregressive process and a monotonic static transform, so that the transformed realisations of this process fulfill exactly both conditions. The new method does not share the limitation of monotonicity of the transform in the null hypothesis, as does the prominent algorithm of amplitude adjusted Fourier transform (AAFT). The practical advantage of STAP compared to AAFT is that it does not give bias in autocorrelation. The superiority of STAP over AAFT in real applica-tions is demonstrated with two examples.",
