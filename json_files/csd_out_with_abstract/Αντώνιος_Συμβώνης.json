Each site s i , is associated with an axis-parallel w i timesh i  label l i , which can be placed anywhere on the \"boundary\" of the input line L. The main task is to place the labels in distinct positions, so that they do not overlap and do not obscure the site set, and to connect each label with its associated site through a leader, such that no two leaders intersect. We propose several variations of this problem and we investigate their computational complexity under certain optimization criteria.",

Among various types of labeling models, boundary labeling addresses this problem by connecting each site-feature of the illustration to a label outside the illustration by using a leader, ie, a polygonal line from the feature to the label. In this paper, we study a variant of boundary labeling with octilinear leaders, ie, polygonal lines involving horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments.

In this paper, the authors move one step forward by considering one more factor, namely intended reader's skills, and by trying to study text readability from a user-specific perspective. Central to our approach is the notion of the user's profile which carries information regarding the linguistic difficulties a user with dyslexia may experience. Based on the user's profile, they develop heuristics for evaluating text's readability for the specific user. The developed heuristics are incorporated in the text classification services of the iLearnRW project, aiming to facilitate the selection of appropriate/suitable reading resources, written in English or Greek, for children with dyslexia1.",

Although boundary labeling is commonly used, e.g., for technical drawings and illustrations in medical atlases, this problem has not yet been studied in the literature. The problem is interesting in that it is a mixture of a label-placement and a graph-drawing problem.In this paper we investigate several variants of the boundary-labeling problem.

The token-distribution problem is a static variant of the load balancing problem for the case in which the workloads in the system cannot be divided arbitrarily; that is, where each token represents an atomic element of work. A scalable method for distributing tokens over a parallel architecture is the so-called dimension-exchange approach. Our results include improved analysis of two existing dimension-exchange algorithms for token distribution on arbitrary graphs and on arbitrary trees, respectively. In particular, we establish a logarithmic upper bound on the discrepancy of the resulting distribution when the second algorithm is applied to an arbitrary initial distribution on a tree. We then present a new dimension-exchange algorithm for token distribution \u2026",

Detecting periodicity in user behavior not only offers security to the network, but may prevent future malicious activities. In this paper, we present visualization techniques that aim to detect authorized (or unauthorized) user activities that seem to appear at regular time intervals.",

We infer (based on this equivalence) for the class of outerplanar triangulated st-digraphs an upward topological 2-page book embedding with minimum number of spine crossings and at most one spine crossing per edge.

Due to its important applications, as for example in the bipartisation of graphs, this type of coloring has been extensively studied, mainly with respect to the size, degree, diameter, and acyclicity of the monochromatic components. We focus on defective colorings with \u03ba colors in which the monochromatic components are acyclic and have small diameter, namely we consider (edge, \u03ba)-colorings, in which the monochromatic components have diameter 1, and (star, \u03ba)-colorings, in which they have diameter 2. We prove that the (edge, 3)-coloring problem remains NP-complete even for graphs with maximum vertex-degree 6, hence answering an open question posed by Cowen et al.[9], and for planar graphs with maximum vertex-degree 7, and we prove that the (star, 3)-coloring problem is NP-complete even for planar graphs with bounded maximum vertex-degree. On the other hand, we give linear-time algorithms for testing the existence of (edge, 2)-colorings and of (star, 2)-colorings of partial 2-trees. Finally, we prove that outerpaths, a notable subclass of outerplanar graphs, always admit (star, 2)-colorings.",

Scheduled-multicast uses existing or additional memory at internal nodes in the transmission paths from the server to the clients to buffer the data stream, and effectively reduce the bandwidth requirements. We designed a new protocol, scheduled-multicast protocol (SMP), and implemented a prototype system employing SMP to test out the feasibility of scheduled-multicast. The results from our experiments shows that SMP can greatly increase the scalability of the system (i.e., the number of concurrent clients who can be serviced) at a very small cost to the processor utilization. Given the positive results from our prototype, we believe SMP can be used to greatly enhance the scalability of large VoD systems at minimal infrastructure cost.",

The labels must be placed in distinct positions on the boundary of R and they must be connected to their corresponding sites with polygonal lines, called leaders, so that the labels are pairwise disjoint and the leaders do not intersect each other.

Previous models studied in the map labeling literature fail to produce label placements (ie place each label next to the site it describes) without label overlaps for certain instances of the problem with dense point sets. To address this problem, we propose a new approach according to which, given n sites each associated with an axis-parallel rectangular label, we aim to place the labels in distinct positions on the \u201cboundary\u201d of L so that they do not overlap and do not obscure the site set, and to connect each label with its associated site through a leader such that no two leaders intersect. We evaluate our labeling model under two minimization criteria:(i) total leader length and (ii) total number of leader bends. We show that both problems are NP-complete if the labels can be placed on both sides of L, while we present polynomial time algorithms for the case where the labels can be placed on only one side of L.",

The largest number of ply-disks having a common overlap is called the ply-number of the drawing.We focus on trees. We first consider drawings of trees with constant ply-number, proving that they may require exponential area, even for stars, and that they may not even exist for bounded-degree trees.

Thus, by combining above techniques and analysing each user's data a teacher can provide personalized treatment to her/his students. In this paper we present our solution on storing and analysing user data on a centralized server. Our system stores data collected from users with dyslexia. We maintain one user profile per student from data taken from a) user responses on a screening test and b) from user's performance on a set of serious games. The learning process then depends on the above data, so it is important to store and analyse our resources efficiently while respecting the user's \u2026",

Informally, the ply number of a straight-line drawing of a graph is defined as the maximum number of overlapping disks, where each disk is associated with a vertex and has a radius that is half the length of the longest edge incident to that vertex. We show that internally triangulated biconnected planar graphs that admit a drawing with ply number 1 can be recognized in O(n log n) time, while the problem is in general NP-hard. We also show several classes of graphs that have 1-ply drawings. We then show that binary trees, stars, and caterpillars have 2-ply drawings, while general trees have (h+1)-ply drawings, where h is the height of the tree. Finally we discuss some generalizations of the notion of a ply number.",

The iLearnRW software is a newly designed tool that makes use of innovative technology and provides individualized intervention through games that incorporate learning activities, addressing those language areas that are most challenging for children with dyslexia in a highly entertaining and motivating way. Individualized intervention is provided through an underlying user profile, which incorporates these language features and is constantly updated as the child uses the software playing games, presenting language material selected based on his difficulties and recording his progress. A group of 78 students (52 male, 26 female) diagnosed with dyslexia, aged between 9 and 11 years old, was assessed for phonological, morphological and vocabulary skills.

For an arbitrary n-node tree T, it is known that rt(T) < 3n/2 + O(log n). In this paper, by providing a recursive off-line permutation routing algorithm, we show that the routing number of an n-node complete d-ary tree of height h(T) > 1 is bounded from above by n + o(n). This is near optimal since, for an n-node complete d-ary tree T of height h(T) > 1 it holds that rt(T) \u2265 n.",

Boundary labeling addresses this problem by attaching the labels to the boundary of a rectangle that contains all features. Then, each feature should be connected to its associated label through a polygonal line, called leader, such that no two leaders intersect.In this paper we study the boundary labeling problem with octilinear leaders, i.e., leaders involving horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments. In order to produce crossing-free boundary labelings, we combine different pairs of octilinear leaders. Thus, we are able to overcome infeasibility problems that might arise if only a single type of leader is allowed. Our main contribution is a new algorithm for solving the total leader length minimization problem (i.e., the problem of finding a crossing-free boundary labeling, such that the total leader length is \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A drawing of a graph is a monotone drawing if for every pair of vertices u and v there is a path drawn from u to v that is monotone in some direction. In this paper we investigate planar monotone drawings in the fixed embedding setting, i.e., a planar embedding of the graph is given as part of the input that must be preserved by the drawing algorithm. In this setting we prove that every planar graph on n vertices admits a planar monotone drawing with at most two bends per edge and with at most 4n\u221210 bends in total; such a drawing can be computed in linear time and requires polynomial area. We also show that two bends per edge are sometimes necessary on a linear number of edges of the graph. Furthermore, we investigate subclasses of planar graphs that can be realized as embedding-preserving monotone drawings with straight-line edges. In fact, we prove that biconnected embedded planar graphs \u2026",

We also show that there does not exist a universal pointset of size n for paths colored with five colors.

            "Abstract": "A major factor affecting the readability of a graph drawing is its resolution. In the graph drawing literature, the resolution of a drawing is either measured based on the angles formed by consecutive edges incident to a common node (angular resolution) or by the angles formed at edge crossings (crossing resolution). In this paper, we evaluate both by introducing the notion of \u201ctotal resolution\u201d, that is, the minimum of the angular and crossing resolution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time where the problem of maximizing the total resolution of a drawing is studied.The main contribution of the paper consists of drawings of asymptotically optimal total resolution for complete graphs (circular drawings) and for complete bipartite graphs (2-layered drawings). In addition, we present and experimentally evaluate a force-directed based algorithm that constructs drawings of large total resolution.",

In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm which solves the Acyclic-HPCCM problem on any outerplanar st-digraph G.

Each node of T initially contains a packet which has a key-value associated with it. The aim of the heap construction algorithm is to route the packets along the edges of the tree so that, at the end of the routing, the tree is heap ordered with respect to the key values associated with the packets. We consider the case where the routing is performed according to the matching model and we present and analyse an off-line algorithm that heap orders the tree within 2h (T) routing steps, where h (T) is the height of tree T. The main contribution of the paper is the novel analysis of the algorithm based on potential functions. It is our belief that potential functions will be the main vehicle in analysing fast non-recursive routing algorithms.",

However, the classification of a text as readable is based solely in its linguistic complexity and does not take into account the skills of the intended reader. In this paper, we make a first attempt to study user-specific text readability. We focus on readers with dyslexia and documents written in English and Greek. Central to our approach is the notion of the user's profile which carries information regarding the linguistic difficulties a user with dyslexia may experience. Based on the user's profile, we develop heuristics for evaluating text's readability for the specific user. The developed heuristics are incorporated in the text classification services of the iLearnRW1 project, aiming to facilitate the selection of appropriate/suitable reading resources for children with dyslexia.",

Internal labels have been forbidden. In this paper, we allow both. Since clearly internal labels should be preferred, we consider several maximization problems for the number of internal labels and we show that they can be obtained efficiently or in quasi-polynomial time.",
