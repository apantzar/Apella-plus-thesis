Better knowledge about their meaning, usage, accessibility or quality will considerably facilitate an automated processing of Web resources. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) enables the creation and exchange of metadata as normal Web data. Although voluminous RDF descriptions are already appearing, sufficiently expressive declarative languages for querying both RDF descriptions and schemas are still missing. In this paper, we propose a new RDF query language called RQL. It is a typed functional language (a la OQL) and relies on a formal model for directed labeled graphs permitting the interpretation of superimposed resource descriptions by means of one or more RDF schemas.

            "Abstract": "Significant efforts have been dedicated recently to the development of architectures for storing and querying RDF data in distributed environments. Several approaches focus on data partitioning, which are able to answer queries efficiently, by using a small number of computational nodes. However, such approaches provide static data partitions. Given the increase on the continuous and rapid flow of data, nowadays there is a clear need to deal with streaming data. In this work, we propose a framework for incremental data partitioning by exploiting machine learning techniques. Specifically, we present a method to learn the structure of a partitioned database, and we employ two machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to classify new streaming data.",

            "Abstract": "The necessity for ontology building, annotating, integrating and learning tools is uncontested. However, the sole representation of knowledge and information is not enough. Human information consumers and web agents have to use and query ontologies and the resources committed to them, thus the need for ontology storage and querying tools arises. However, the context of storing and querying knowledge has changed due to the wide acceptance and use of the Web as a platform for communicating knowledge. New languages for querying (meta) data based on web standards (eg, XML [23], RDF [17], Topic Maps [16]) have emerged to enable the acquisition of knowledge from dispersed information sources, while the traditional database storage techniques have been adapted to deal with the peculiarities of the (semi) structured data on the web.The purpose of this chapter is to briefly present and evaluate a set of query languages and associated tools for ontology/resource storage and querying aiming to support large-scale Semantic Web [3] applications, the next evolution step of the Web. This list of languages and tools is by no means complete and the tools presented are indicative of the tendency to provide full storage and query support to web-based ontology/metadata standards, such as RDF [17], RDFS [4], Topic Maps [16], DAML+ OIL [9] or the forthcoming Web Ontology Language [15]. Our work in this chapter focuses on the evaluation of querying languages designed for Semantic Web related knowledge representation formalisms rather than general-purpose querying languages (eg, SQL, Datalog, F-logic).

This is a unique and entirely new opportunity for the future of astronomy, the success of which depends upon the decisions being made on existing and new infrastructures. The prospect of combining observations from the future space-based instrument LISA together with third generation ground based detectors will open the way toward multi-band GW astronomy, but will leave the infrasound (0.1\u201310 Hz) band uncovered.

In this paper, we address the problem of evaluating continuous queries over big data streams that are frequently updated, adopting HIFUN, a high-level query language introduced recently. HIFUN offers a clear separation between the conceptual layer, where analytic queries are defined independently of the nature and location of data, and the physical layer where queries are evaluated, by encoding them as map-reduce jobs or as SQL group-by queries.

Trust inferences are transitive associations between users in the context of an underlying social network and are valuable sources of additional information that help dealing with the sparsity and the cold-start problems.

            "Abstract": "We address the problem of synthesizing specifications for composite Web services, starting from those of their component services. Unlike related work in programming languages, we assume the definition of the component services (i.e. their code) to be unavailable - at best, they are known by a specification which (safely) approximates their functional behavior. Within this scenario, we deduce general formula schemes to derive specifications for basic constructs such as sequential, parallel compositions and conditionals and provide details on how to handle the special cases of loops and asynchronous execution. The resulting specifications facilitate service verification and service evolution as well as auditing processes, promoting trust between the involved partners.",

These deal with the succinct and flexible representation of non-effects, indirect effects and preconditions, respectively. The framework exploits the unique features of WSSL, allowing, among others, for: compositions that take into account ramifications of services; determining the feasibility of a composition a priori; and considering exogenous qualifications during the verification process. The framework is implemented using FLUX-based planning, supporting compositions with fundamental control constructs, including nondeterministic ones such as conditionals and loops.

To accomplish this, Telos was designed to be extensible in the sense that the concepts used to capture software knowledge can be defined in the language itself, instead of being built-in. This extensibility is accomplished through powerful metamodeling features, which proved very useful for interrelating heterogeneous models from requirements, model-driven software engineering, data integration, cultural informatics and eLearning. We trace the evolution of ideas and research results in the Telos project from its origins in the late eighties. Our account looks at the semantics of Telos, its various implementations and its applications. We also recount related research by other groups and the cross-influences of ideas thereof. We conclude with lessons learnt.",

In fact, nowadays, there is also a move towards adopting multi-clouds due to the main benefits they introduce, including vendor lock-in avoidance and optimal application design and provisioning via different cloud services. Unfortunately, multi-cloud applications face the challenge that even a single cloud environment exhibits a certain level of dynamicity and uncertainty. As such, a suitable service level cannot be handed over to their customers, which leads to SLA penalty costs and application provider reputation reduction. To address this challenge, we have previously proposed a cross-level and multi-cloud application adaptation architecture. Towards realising such an architecture, this paper focuses \u2026",

Apart from not supporting multi-cloud application management, many platforms usually focus on the deployment and provisioning phases of the cloud-based application lifecycle by neglecting the design phase. However, the design selection of the best possible cloud service composition affects the provisioning phase, as the more distant from optimality is the selected solution, the more adaptation actions will be enacted. To this end, there is a high need for cloud application design tools and methods which can select the best possible cloud service composition based on user requirements. This paper satisfies this need by proposing a cloud service composition approach able to optimally compose \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The current Web evolves rapidly from a Web of information to a Web of Opinions. People are constantly uploading their viewpoints, ratings and comments on any conceivable topic, via blogs, social media websites, commercial websites, wikis and others. Despite some recent efforts to give a more \u201cargumentative character\u201d to the Web, the opinions are still expressed in purely textual form, without any metadata or any other type of annotation that would make them machineunderstandable and processable. Moreover, their persuasive power, ie, the characteristics that determine how an opinion affects the viewpoint of the audience, is largely neglected. Improving Web experience towards this direction would give immense added-value, as it would allow searching for opinions for or against a given claim, understanding the interlinking and interrelationships between opinions (eg, support or opposition) and obtaining a better understanding of the various debates for a well-intended user. Ultimately, it can lead to increased participation of Web users in democratic, dialogical interchange of opinions, more informed decisions by professionals and decision-makers, as well as to an easier identification of biased, misleading or deceptive arguments. This paper presents the vision of the Persuasive Web, whose objective is to allow the above developments through the introduction and application of a formal, machine-readable representation of persuasive arguments that would allow the discovery, tracking, retrieval, combination, interrelation extraction and visualization of the vast variety of viewpoints that already exist on the Web, in a way that goes beyond \u2026",

Determining matching components of database or XML schemas is needed in many applications, eg for e-business and data integration. In this paper a complete generic solution of the schema mapping problem is presented. A hybrid semantic schema mapping algorithm which semiautomatically finds mappings between two data representation schemas is introduced. The algorithm finds mappings based on the hierarchical organization of the elements of a term dictionary (WordNet) and on the reuse of already identified matchings. There is also a graphical user interface that allows the user to parameterize the algorithm in an easy and fast way. Special attention was paid to the collaboration of the algorithm with a matching management tool. This collaboration, as proved by the evaluation of the algorithm, resulted in the creation of a generic system for detecting and managing mappings between schemas of various types and sizes.",

We describe the architecture and the reasoning services of our SW integration middleware, called SWIM, and we present the main design choices and techniques for supporting powerful mappings between different data models, as well as, reformulation and optimization of queries expressed against mediation schemas and views.",

To construct this graph our algorithm exploits the semantics and the structure of the schema and the distribution of the corresponding data/instances. A novel feature of our platform is that it allows summary exploration through extensible summaries. The aim of this demonstration is to dive in the exploration of the sources using summaries and to enhance the understanding of the various algorithms used.",

            "Abstract": "In the last few years, Computer Science has observed a paradigm shift in the way software becomes available to end-users. The emergent paradigm is based on abstracting away from software and considering all resources as services that are available ondemand, forming what is called Service-Oriented Computing (SOC)[67]. SOC relies on services in order to facilitate the development of interoperable, dynamic, inexpensive and widely distributed applications. Services are entities that enable access to one or more capabilities, using a prescribed interface and in conformance to constraints and policies [26]. The interface as well as the constraints and policies are part of each service\u2019s description. Services are platform-independent and become available via a certain network, such as the Internet or the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). An important and distinguishing feature of services is the fact that they are loosely-coupled, allowing ad hoc and dynamic binding in contrast to a dynamically linked library, an assembly or the traditional linker that binds together functions to form an executable.",

            "Abstract": "The evolution of ontologies is an undisputed necessity in current research community. The problem of understanding this evolution is a fundamental problem as, based on this understanding, maintainers of depending artifacts need to take a decision about possible changes. Moreover, as ontologies are often developed by several ontology engineers, it is also important for them to understand what changes have been made by each other. Recent research focuses on just identifying and presenting the changes from one ontology version to another. In this paper, we argue that this is not enough and that we need more fine-grained methods for understanding how the ontology evolved. To this direction, we present a module, named ProvenanceTracker, which gets as input the list of changes between two or more RDF/S ontology versions and can answer fine-grained provenance queries about ontology resources. Our module can identify when a resource was created and how. The sequence of changes that led to the creation of that specific resource can be identified and presented to the user. We evaluate the time complexity of our approach and show that it can possibly reduce the human effort spent on understanding ontology evolution.",

However, most of research approaches focus only on the functional part of semantic Web Service description. The above fact along with the proliferation of Web Services is highly probable to lead to a situation where Web Service registries will return many functionally-equivalent Web Service advertisements for each user request. This problem can be solved with the semantic description of QoS for Web Services. QoS is a set of non-functional properties encompassing performance and networkrelated characteristics of resources. So it can be used for distinguishing between functionally-equivalent Web Services. Current research approaches for QoS-based Web Service description are either syntactic or poor or non-extensible. To solve this problem, we have developed a rich and extensible ontological specification called OWL-Q for semantic QoS-based Web Service description. We analyze all OWL-Q parts and reason that rules should be added in order to support property inferencing and constraint enforcement. Finally, we line out our under-development semantic framework for QoS-based Web Service description and discovery.",

This paper presents a novel framework in order to empower provenance in a mediator based data integration system. We use a simple mapping language for mapping schema constructs, between an ontology and relational sources, capable to carry provenance information. This language extends the traditional data exchange setting by translating our mapping specifications into source-to-target tuple generating dependencies (s-t tgds). Then we define formally the provenance information we want to retrieve i.e. annotation, source and tuple provenance. We provide three algorithms to retrieve provenance information using information stored on the mappings and the sources. We show the feasibility of our solution and the advantages of our framework.",

            "Abstract": "A modern service-based application (SBA) operates in a cross-cloud, highly dynamic environment while comprises various components at different abstraction levels that might fail. To support cross-level SBA adaptation, a cross-cloud Service Level Objective (SLO) monitoring and evaluation system is required, able to produce the right events that must trigger suitable adaptation actions. While most research focuses on SBA monitoring, SLO evaluation is usually restricted in a centralised, single-cloud form, not amenable to heavy workloads that could incur in a complex SBA system. Thus, a fast and scalable event generation and processing system is needed, able to scale well to handle such a load. Such a system must address the cross-level event composition, suitable for detecting complex problematic situations. This paper closes this gap by proposing a novel complex event processing framework, scalable and distributable across the whole SBA architecture. This framework can cover any kind of event combination, no matter how complex it is. It also supports event pattern management while exploits a publish-subscribe mechanism to:(a) synchronise with the modification of adaptation rules directly involving these event patterns;(b) enable the decoupling from an SBA management system.",

Unfortunately, the assumptions made by the authors of [1] in the formulation of their theory restrict its use to a specific class of logics. In this report, we investigate the possibility of extending their framework in a wider class of formalisms by examining the applicability of the AGM postulates in logics originally excluded from the AGM model. We conclude that in the wider class that we consider there are logics which do not admit AGM-compliant operators. As a case study, we investigate the applicability of the AGM theory to Description Logics (DLs). Furthermore, we use our results to shed light on our inability to develop AGM-compliant operators for belief bases.",

This lack of a common QoS meta-model and model causes serious accuracy problems in QoS-based service matchmaking.

            "Abstract": "Most recommendation systems employ variations of Collaborative Filtering (CF) for formulating suggestions of items relevant to users\u2019 interests. However, CF requires expensive computations that grow polynomially with the number of users and items in the database. Methods proposed for handling this scalability problem and speeding up recommendation formulation are based on approximation mechanisms and, even when performance improves, they most of the time result in accuracy degradation. We propose a method for addressing the scalability problem based on incremental updates of user-to-user similarities. Our Incremental Collaborative Filtering (ICF) algorithm (i) is not based on any approximation method and gives the potential for high-quality recommendation formulation (ii) provides recommendations orders of magnitude faster than classic CF and thus, is suitable for online application.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, an increasing interest in recommendation systems has emerged both from the research and the application point of view and in both academic and commercial domains. The majority of comparison techniques used for formulating recommendations are based on set-operations over user-supplied terms or internal product computa-tions on vectors encoding user preferences. In both cases however, the\" identical-ness\" of terms is examined rather than their actual semantic relevance. This paper proposes a recommendation algorithm that is based on the maintenance of user profiles and their dynamic adjustment according to the users' behavior. Moreover, this algorithm relies on the dynamic management of communities, which contain\" similar\" and\" relevant\" users and which are created according to a classification al-gorithm. The algorithm is implemented on top of a community management mechanism. The comparison mechanism used in the context of this work is based on semantic relevance between terms, which is evaluated with the use of a glossary of terms.",

            "Abstract": "The recent advances in the technologies of Web 2.0 changed the role of its users from passive information consumers to active creators of digital content. Web became a universal terrain, wherein humans accommodate their inherent need for communication and self-expression. From a scientific point of view, this new era was accompanied by numerous new challenges. Navigation in dialogues and investigation of the informational requirements is one such challenge, which constitutes a pristine and until recently, almost untouched area. The process of human argumentation, in contrast, has been a longstanding subject of theoretical studies.Computational argumentation is a branch of AI and it offers more accurate and realistic reasoning methods by transferring the cognitive behaviour of people when arguing into its computational models. An extensive overview in the area led us to the observation that it also defines solid and discrete constructs that structure a dialogue. This observation motivated us to develop ArgQL (Argumentation Query Language)[1, 2], a novel, high-level declarative query language that will allow for the navigation and information identification in a graph of interconnected arguments, structured in the principles of argumentation.

However most of the currently available clustered RDF database systems partition data using hash functions and/or vertical and horizontal partition algorithms with a significant impact on the number of nodes required for query answering, increasing the total cost of query evaluation. In this paper we present a novel semantic partitioning approach, exploiting both the structure and the semantics of an RDF Dataset, for producing vertical partitions that significantly reduce the number of nodes that should be visited for query answering. To construct these partitions, first we select the most important nodes in a dataset as centroids, using the notion of relevance. Then we use the notion of dependence to assign each \u2026",

To this direction, using as a starting point an abridged version of the original data source, highlighting the most representative concepts and providing further exploration operators, would greatly improve the exploitation potential of the information they contain. In this paper, we present RDFDigest+, a novel tool that enables effective and efficient RDF/S KB exploration using summaries. The tool employees a diverse set of algorithms for identifying the most important nodes, offering a wide range of possibilities to capture importance. Then the selected nodes can be combined using multiple state of the art algorithms in order to generate a complete schema summary graph. In addition, we present a new approach enabling the dynamic exploration of summaries through two novel operations zoom and extend. Extend focuses on a specific subgraph of the initial summary, whereas zoom on the whole graph, both providing granular information access to the end-user. To make the system more responsive, we enable both offline and online calculations and we also provide approximations and progressive algorithms. The aim of this demonstration is to dive in the exploration of the sources using summaries and to enhance the understanding of the various algorithms used. For the demonstration, we will use five diverse RDF/S KBs, in terms of size, connectivity and complexity, to show the functionality of the system \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The success of the Web Service (WS) paradigm has led to a proliferation of available WSs. As these WSs are advertised in inter and intra-organizational registries/repositories, they have to be discovered based on the functional needs of the user. However, these registries rely on the current WS standard stack that uses WSDL and UDDI for WS description and discovery. Unfortunately, these two standard languages are based on the use of static descriptions of service interfaces and other general non-functional service attributes for publishing and finding WSs. This situation creates two problems. Firstly, syntactic discovery efforts return imprecise and inaccurate results. Secondly, no means are provided in order to select among multiple services that appear to perform the same function. The first problem is solved by combining Semantic Web (SW) and WS technologies. Ontologies are used, which provide meaning to concepts and relationships between them and thus lead to semantic WS descriptions and discovery algorithms. These enhanced discovery algorithms equipped with SW technologies provide more precise and accurate results. One recent result of the joint SW and WS efforts is OWL-S, which is currently a W3C member submission.The second problem can be solved by taking into account a big subset of all possible non-functional properties of WSs, which is called QoS (Quality of Service). QoS is closely related with the performance of a WS as well as with other features and characteristics of a WS that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs. Therefore it has a substantial impact on user's expectations from a service and can \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A cornerstone issue in the realization of the Semantic Web (SW) vision is the achievement of semantic interoperability among legacy data sources spread worldwide. In order to capture information semantics in a machine processable way, various ontology-based formalisms have been recently proposed (eg, RDF/S [20, 5], DAML+ OIL [27], OWL [10]). However, the vast majority of existing legacy data is not yet in RDF/S or any other SW language [23, 25]. As a matter of fact, most of the data is physically stored in relational database (RDB) systems and actually published on the Web or corporate intranets as virtual XML. SW applications, however, require to view data as virtual RDF, valid instance of a domain or application specific RDF/S schema, and to be able to manipulate them with high-level query languages, such as RQL [18] or RVL [24]. Therefore, we need middleware systems that can either republish XML as RDF, or publish RDB data directly as RDF, or-even better-be capable of doing both. Sometimes the practical solution will be to rely just on the virtual XML schema and XML query interface of an existing XML publishing system. At other times, the SW publishing middleware will be built as an alternative to the XML publishing system, taking advantage of direct access to the underlying RDB management system (RDBMS). It is also possible that the SW middleware will have to integrate data in some RDBMS with data in native XML storage. We need to deal flexibly with all these situations in a uniform framework. A decade of experience with information integration architectures based on mediators [8, 29, 26, 21] suggests that it is highly \u2026",

Despite mature work on the related belief revision field, adapting such results for the case of action theories is non-trivial. This paper describes how to address this problem for deterministic, yet partially observable, domains, by proposing a generic framework in the context of the Event Calculus, along with ASP encodings of the revision algorithm and a web-based tester of the formalism implementation.",

In fact, nowadays, there is also a move towards adopting multiclouds due to the main benefits they introduce, including vendor lock-in avoidance and optimal application design and provisioning via different cloud services. Unfortunately, multi-cloud applications face the challenge that even a single cloud environment exhibits a certain level of dynamicity and uncertainty. As such, a suitable service level cannot be handed over to their customers, which leads to SLA penalty costs and application provider reputation reduction. To address this challenge, we have previously proposed a cross-level and multi-cloud application adaptation architecture. Towards realising such an architecture, this paper focuses on supporting cross-level application adaptation through the modelling of adaptation rules that enact adaptation workflows but also on evolving such an adaptation to address both the application and exploited cloud services evolution as well as the provisioning environment\u2019s dynamicity. The modelling of such rules and their execution history is accommodated through corresponding extensions to a state-of-the-art cloud modelling language called CAMEL. Further, a specific selection algorithm for those alternative adaptation rules able to address the current problematic situation is suggested which takes into account their execution history and especially their performance.",

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) aims at facilitating the creation and exchange of metadata as any other Web data. The growing number of available information resources and the proliferation of description services in various user communities, lead nowadays to large volumes of RDF metadata. Managing such RDF resource descriptions and schemas with existing low-level APIs and file-based implementations does not ensure fast deployment and easy maintenance of real-scale RDF applications. In this paper, we advocate the use of database technology to support declarative access, as well as, logical and physical independence for voluminous RDF description bases. We present RDFSuite, a suite of tools for RDF validation, storage and querying. Specifically, we introduce a formal data model for RDF description bases created using multiple schemas. Next, we present the design of a persistent RDF Store (RSSDB) for loading resource descriptions in an ORDBMS by exploring the available RDF schema knowledge. Our approach preserves the flexibility of RDF in refining schemas and/or enriching descriptions at any time, whilst it outperforms, both in storage volumes and query execution time, other approaches using a monolithic table to represent resource descriptions and schemas under the form of triples. Last, we briefly present RQL, a declarative language for querying both RDF descriptions and schemas, and sketch query evaluation on top of RSSDB.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we deal with group decision making and propose a model of dialogue among agents that have different knowledge and preferences, but are willing to compromise in order to collaboratively reach a common decision. Agents participating in the dialogue use internal reasoning to resolve conflicts emerging in their knowledge during communication and to reach a decision that requires the least compromises.

In this work we investigate the conditions under which plan repairing is more efficient than re-planning from scratch. We present a new plan-repairing algorithm, Dynamic Repairing A\u2217(DRA\u2217), and we compare its performance against A\u2217 in a number of different re-planning scenarios. The experimental results indicate that if the percentage of the plan that has been already executed is less than 40% to 50% and the changes in the environment are small or moderate, DRA\u2217 outperforms A\u2217 in terms of speed by a factor of 10% to 80% in the majority of the cases.",

Although a lot of research has been conducted on the functional discovery of WSs, the proposed techniques fall short when faced with the foreseen increase in the number of (potentially functionally-equivalent) WSs. The above situation can be resolved with the addition of non-functional (quality of service (QoS)) discovery mechanisms to WS discovery engines. QoS-based WS matchmaking algorithms have been devised for this reason. However, they are either slow - as they are based on ontology reasoners - or produce inaccurate results. Inaccuracy is caused both by the syntactic matching of QoS concepts and by wrong matchmaking metrics. In this paper, we present two constraint programming (CP) QoS-based WS discovery algorithms for unary constrained WS specifications that produce accurate results with good \u2026",

To enable constructing applications from such services, respective service description and discovery must be supported by considering both functional and non-functional aspects as they play a significant role in the service management lifecycle. However, research in service discovery has mainly focused on one aspect and not both of them. As such, this paper investigates the issues involved in considering both functional and non-functional aspects in service discovery. In particular, it proposes different ways via which aspect-specific algorithms can be combined to generate a complete service discovery system. It also proposes a specific unified service discovery architecture. Finally, it evaluates the proposed algorithms\u2019 performance to give valuable insights \u2026",

In this paper, we investigate the use of RDFS schemas as a means of knowledge representation and exchange in diverse application domains.

The statistical data extracted lead to corollaries about the size and the morphology of RDF/S schemas.

The related approaches in service discovery mainly concentrate on exploiting constraint solving techniques for inferring if the user non-functional requirements are satisfied by the service nonfunctional capabilities. However, as the matchmaking time is proportional to the number of non-functional service descriptions, these approaches fail to fulfill the user request in a timely manner. To this end, two alternative techniques for improving the non-functional service matchmaking time have been developed.

We present a module that receives as input the sequence of changes between the two ontology versions along with a set of queries and automatically identifies the specific change operations that affect the input queries.

            "Abstract": "In a selective information dissemination (SDI) system, users submit profiles consisting of a number of long-standing queries to represent their information needs. The system then continuously collects new documents from underlying information sources, filters them against the user profiles, and delivers relevant information to corresponding users. SDI systems are very important nowadays due to the vast amount of information that flows in the World Wide Web, as they inform users for relevant information, without requiring them to spend time to locate it. This paper presents an SDI system, which takes into account the lexical, as well as the semantic relationships between terms of documents and user profiles. In particular, a user profile is considered relevant to a document, if its terms or their synonyms or hyponyms appear in the document. The paper also presents a profile index structure supporting both the Boolean and Vector Space models.",

As such, conventional single node RDF management systems give their position to clustered ones. However most of the currently available clustered RDF database systems partition data using hash functions and/or vertical and horizontal partition algorithms with a significant impact on the number of nodes required for query answering, increasing the total cost of query evaluation. In this paper we present a novel semantic partitioning approach, exploiting both the structure and the semantics of an RDF Dataset, for producing vertical partitions that significantly reduce the number of nodes that should be visited for query answering. To construct these partitions, first we select the most important nodes in a dataset as centroids, using the notion of relevance. Then we use the notion of dependence to assign each remaining node to the appropriate centroid. We evaluate our approach using three real world datasets and demonstrate the nice properties that the constructed partitions possess showing that they significantly reduce the total number of nodes required for query answering while introducing minimal storage overhead.",

This refers to the ability of users to understand privacy-related documents and their implications via participatory processes, wisdom-of-the-crowds approaches and visual cues.

Automatic discovery of Web services (WSs) can be achieved by incorporating semantics into a richer WS description model (WSDM) and by the use of semantic Web (SW) technologies in the WS matchmaking and selection (i.e., discovery) process. A sufficiently rich WSDM should encompass not only functional but also nonfunctional aspects like quality of service (QoS). QoS is a set of performance and domain-dependent attributes that has a substantial impact on WS requesters' expectations. Thus, it can be used for distinguishing between many functionally equivalent WSs that are available nowadays. This paper starts by defining QoS in the context of WSs.

The ability to efficiently select and compose services in order to accomplish a complex user goal is of utmost importance. However, the problem of on-demand composition still lacks satisfactory solutions for the case of complex services intending to serve non-elementary goals and adhering to constraints. Current service specification proposals include definitions of pre-and post-conditions, i.e., conditions that must be satisfied in the state prior to and after the enactment of the service. However, due to the need for complex compositions, conditions and constraints that do not exist in the individual service specifications arise. For the definition of these conditions, we augment service specifications with invariants and demonstrate how such assertions can be exploited for \u2026",

The proper maintenance of these, usually large, structures and, in particular, the adaptation of ontologies to new knowledge (ontology change) is one of the most challenging problems in the Semantic Web research. Due to the uncontrolled and decentralized nature of the Semantic Web, ontology change is a complicated and multifaceted task; this has led to the emergence of several different, but closely related, research areas that deal with the problem. In this report, we attempt to draw a clear line between these research areas, by underlying their relations, interactions and overlaps. Our work uncovers a certain gap in the current research and proposes a supplementary research direction, based on belief revision. We argue that our approach uncovers an interesting new dimension to the problem that is likely to find important applications in the future.",

Fortunately, the solution is to enforce the semantic QoS-based description and discovery of WSs.

Based on this algorithm, we have extended a CSP-based approach for QoS-based WS discovery.

We advocate for the use of labeling schemes for modeling these hierarchies in order to efficiently answer queries such as subsumption check, descendants, ancestors or nearest common ancestor, which usually require costly transitive closure computations. We first give a qualitative comparison of three main families of schemes, namely bit vector, prefix and interval based schemes. We then show that two labeling schemes are good candidates for an efficient implementation of label querying using standard relational DBMS, namely the Dewey prefix scheme and an interval scheme by Agrawal et al. We compare their storage and query evaluation performance for the 16 ODP hierarchies using the PostgreSQL engine.",

Once Web services become operational, their execution needs to be managed and monitored so that a clear view of how services perform within their operational environment can be gained, informed management decisions can be made and control actions for modifying and adjusting the services' behavior can be performed. Many approaches have been proposed in the literature and have proven that monitoring is crucial for successful Web service deployment. This technical report analyzes the methods that can be used to monitor the execution of a Web service, in order to comply with the corresponding Service Level Agreement (SLAs). Nowadays, most of Web service providers sign SLA contracts with their clients in order to guarantee the offered functionality of their services. A monitoring system is introduced to check violations in the pre-agreed metric values of SLAs. These results can be very helpful for service providers, who can then take corrective actions to improve their services.",

There are two main techniques for QoS-based WS matchmaking (filtering): ontology-based and constraint programming (CP)-based. Unfortunately, the first technique is not efficient as it is based on the rather immature technology of ontology reasoning, while the second one is not accurate as it is based on syntactic QoS-based descriptions and faulty matchmaking metrics. In our previous work, we have developed an extensible and rich ontology language for QoS-based WS description. Moreover, we have devised a semantic alignment algorithm for aligning QoS-based WS descriptions so as to increase the accuracy of QoS-based WS matchmaking algorithms. Finally, we have developed two alternative CP-based QoS \u2026",

Central questions to summarization are: how to identify the most important nodes and then how to link them in order to produce a valid sub-schema graph. In this paper, we try to answer the first question by revisiting six well-known measures from graph theory and adapting them for RDF/S KBs. Then, we proceed further to model the problem of linking those nodes as a graph Steiner-Tree problem (GSTP) employing approximations and heuristics to speed up the execution of the respective algorithms.

In this paper, we present a new approach enabling the dynamic exploration of summaries through two novel operations zoom and extend. Extend focuses on a specific subgraph of the initial summary, whereas zoom on the whole graph, both providing granular information access to the end-user. We show that calculating these operators is NP-complete and provide approximations for their calculation.

This paper aims at proposing a novel monitoring and adaptation framework for Service-based Applications (SBAs) deployed on multiple Clouds. The main functionality of this framework is the discovery of critical event patterns within monitoring event streams, leading to specific Service Level Objective (SLO) violations.

Our focus is on automatic deception detection in text across cultures. We view culture through the prism of the individualism/collectivism dimension and we approximate culture by using country as a proxy. Having as a starting point recent conclusions drawn from the social psychology discipline, we explore if differences in the usage of specific linguistic features of deception across cultures can be confirmed and attributed to norms in respect to the individualism/collectivism divide. We also investigate if a universal feature set for cross-cultural text deception detection tasks exists. We evaluate the predictive power of different feature sets and approaches. We create culture/language-aware classifiers by experimenting with a wide range of n-gram features based on phonology, morphology and syntax, other linguistic cues like word and phoneme counts, pronouns use, etc., and token embeddings. We conducted our experiments over 11 datasets from 5 languages i.e., English, Dutch, Russian, Spanish and Romanian, from six countries (US, Belgium, India, Russia, Mexico and Romania), and we applied two classification methods i.e, logistic regression and fine-tuned BERT models. The results showed that our task is fairly complex and demanding. There are indications that some linguistic cues of deception have cultural origins, and are consistent in the context of diverse domains and dataset settings for the same language. This is more evident for the usage of pronouns and the expression of sentiment in deceptive language. The \u2026",

We exploit a cross-layer monitoring mechanism to detect a wide range of events, based on which we can both reactively and proactively adapt the system. In particular, the detection of event patterns help us to prevent future faults and failures from happening, by firing specific, dynamically derived rules, that map event patterns to suitable adaptation strategies.

The novelty of this paper closes the gap between the different functional layers by defining a cross-layer dependency model indicating relationships of quality aspects from three different semantic quality models. Each of these three quality models define metrics, metric aggregations and computations for each of the separate layers.

The ability to deal with inconsistency and to accommodate change is of utmost importance in realworld applications of ontological reasoning and management, wherein the need for expressing negated assertions also arises naturally. For this purpose, precise, formal definitions of the the different types of inconsistency and negation in ontologies are required. Unfortunately, ontology languages based on Description Logics (DLs) do not provide enough expressive power to represent axiom negations. Furthermore, there is no single, well-accepted notion of inconsistency and negation in the Semantic Web community, due to the lack of a common and solid foundational framework. In this paper, we propose a general framework accounting for inconsistency, negation and change in ontologies. Different levels of negation and inconsistency in DL-based ontologies are distinguished. We demonstrate how this framework can provide a foundation for reasoning with and management of dynamic ontologies.",

In this paper, we drop all such assumptions and determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a logic to support AGM-compliant operators. Our approach is directly applicable to a much broader class of logics. We apply our results to establish connections between the problem of updating in Description Logics (DLs) and the AGM postulates.

Specifically, we focus on: a) improving the identification, disambiguation and linking of entities occurring in data sources and user input; b) offering advanced query services for exploiting the semantics of the data, with reasoning and exploratory capabilities; and c) expanding the typical information seeking dialogue model (slot filling) to better reflect real-world conversational search scenarios.",

The amount and the diversity of the information that need to be stored and processed have led to the adoption of data integration systems in order to deal with information extraction from disparate sources. The mediation between traditional databases and ontologies has been recognized as a cornerstone issue in bringing in legacy data with formal semantic meaning. However, our knowledge evolves due to the rapid scientific development, so ontologies and schemata need to change in order to capture and accommodate such an evolution. When ontologies change, these changes should somehow be rendered and used by the pre-existing data integration systems, a problem that most of the integration systems seem to ignore.

This paper proposes a recommendation algorithm that is based on the maintenance of user profiles and their dynamic adjustment according to the users\u2019 behavior. Moreover, this algorithm relies on the dynamic management of communities, which contain \u201csimilar\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d users and which are created according to a classification algorithm.

Action theories providing an axiomatic basis for managing change are applicable to a wide area of disciplines including software engineering,(cognitive) robotics and data/knowledge base systems. In this paper, we review action theories proposed for reasoning about the dynamics of database systems. We examine how these theories deal with the three infamous problems associated with this area, namely:(a) the frame problem, which refers to the identification of predicates or functions that remain unchanged as a result of action execution,(b) the ramification problem, which refers to determining the indirect effects of actions, and (c) the qualification problem, which refers to determining the preconditions which must hold prior to the execution of an action. We briefly describe the solutions which have been proposed for these problems and position these problems in a temporal database context. We also introduce an abstract solution based on the language of situation calculus. This solution extends the causality-based solution of ramification and qualification problems in conventional databases.",

While sophisticated semantic discovery mechanisms have been invented to overcome the UDDI's syntactic discovery solution in order to provide more recallable and precise results, the amount of functionally equivalent Web services returned is still large. The solution to this problem is the description of the QoS non-functional aspect of Web services. QoS encompasses the performance of Web services and can be used as a discriminator factor for refining Web service advertisement result lists. However, most scientific efforts presented so far are purely syntactic and are not capturing all aspects of QoS-based Web service description leading to imprecise syntactic discovery mechanisms.

To tackle this need, we propose four metric Quality Models that cover quality terms for the Workflow, Service and Infrastructure layers and an additional one for expressing the equality and inter-dependency relations between the previous ones. To support these models we have implemented a cross-layer monitoring system, whose main advantages are the layer-specific metric aggregators and an event pattern discoverer for processing the monitoring log.

Satisfactory performance levels can be reached via using smart methods that intelligently organise the service advertisement space.

            "Abstract": "Object perception is a fundamental sub-field of Computer Vision, covering a multitude of individual areas and having contributed high-impact results. While Machine Learning has been traditionally applied to address related problems, recent works also seek ways to integrate knowledge engineering in order to expand the level of intelligence of the visual interpretation of objects, their properties and their relations with their environment. In this paper, we attempt a systematic investigation of how knowledge-based methods contribute to diverse object perception tasks. We review the latest achievements and identify prominent research directions.",

            "Abstract": "Web Services (WSs) are modular, self-describing, loosely-coupled, platform and programming language-agnostic software applications that can be advertised, located and used across the Internet. They are viewed as one of the promising technologies that could help business entities to automate their operations on the web on a large scale by automatic discovery and consumption of services. Based on the above reasons, the WS paradigm is being adopted by many companies and individuals and many WSs are being deployed and running. However, as all of these WSs are advertised in a UDDI-based repository, an unavoidable fact as UDDI is a de-facto standard, the problem of discovering them based on a requester\u2019s functional needs becomes crucial. UDDI uses a syntaxbased approach for WS description leading to purely syntactic discovery efforts returning imprecise and inaccurate results. OWL-S [OWL-S Coalition 2003] and similar joint Semantic Web and WS efforts solve the problem of syntactic WS description by using ontologies for describing WSs. Ontologies provide meaning to concepts and relationships between them, leading to semantic WS Discovery algorithms, which provide more precise and accurate results. But even if all the advertised WSs satisfying a requester\u2019s functional needs are returned, many results may be produced. So a non-functional concept is needed that will differentiate between the functionally equivalent WS advertisements. This concept is quality of service (QoS). QoS is closely related with the performance of a WS as well as with other features of a WS that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs \u2026",

In answer to this need, we have designed a typed, functional query language, called RQL, whose novelty lies in its ability to smoothly combine schema and data querying. The purpose of this chapter is to present RQL\u2019s formal data model and type system and illustrate its expressiveness by means of exemplary queries. RQL\u2019s formal foundations capture the RDF/S modeling primitives and provide a well-founded semantics for a declarative query language involving recursion and functional composition over complex description graphs.",

            "Abstract": "Ontologies are becoming more and more important in data integration. An important problem when dealing with ontologies is the fact that they are living artefacts and subject to change. When ontologies evolve, the changes should somehow be rendered and used by the pre-existing data integration systems. In most of these systems, when ontologies change their relations with the data sources ie the mappings, are recreated manually, a process which is known to be error-prone and time-consuming. In this paper, we provide a solution that allows query answering under evolving ontologies without mapping redefinition. In order to achieve that, we present a module that enables ontology evolution over traditional ontology-based data integration systems. This module gets as input the different ontology versions and the user query, and answers queries over data integration systems that use different ontology versions. We identify the problems in such a setting and we provide efficient, intuitive solutions. We prove that our approach imposes only a small overhead over traditional query rewriting algorithms and it is modular and scalable. Finally, we show that it can greatly reduce human effort spent since continuous mapping redefinition on evolving ontologies is no longer necessary.",

This work attempts to fill this gap, by proposing an elegant, yet very general, model of describing KR-schemes. This formalization is used to describe any knowledge representation model, including databases, logic-based schemes, semantic networks etc. It is also applied to introduce a general comparison method for KR-schemes and a formal definition of the reduction of one scheme to another. Using this model, we can reason about KR-schemes in an abstract manner and to determine whether a certain reduction is possible or not.",

The ramification problem refers to determining the indirect effects of actions, whereas the qualification problem refers to determining the preconditions which must hold prior to the execution of an action. A solution to these problems in database systems permits reasoning about the dynamics of databases and allows proving consistency properties. These two problems become increasingly complex in temporal databases and no satisfactory solution has been proposed as of yet. In this paper, we describe these two problems in the context of temporal databases and we propose a solution of polynomial complexity based on the language of the Situation Calculus.

As such, the service non-functional aspect should be considered for filtering and selecting among the great number of functionally-equivalent services that will be available for a specific user task. Until now, the state-of-the-art work in non-functional service discovery has exploited constraint solving techniques to optimize the matchmaking time between a non-functional service offer and demand pair. However, as matchmaking time is proportional to the offer number, this work does not scale well so it is not yet appropriate for the IoS. To this end, two alternative techniques are proposed to improve the overall matchmaking time. Both techniques were theoretically and experimentally evaluated. The results show that both techniques optimize the matchmaking time without \u2026",

One of the main reasons for this bottleneck is that NoSQL databases do not support joins. In this poster we present a solution that efficiently supports joins over such databases. More specifically, we present a query optimization and execution module placed on top of Cassandra clusters that is able to efficiently combine information stored in different columnfamilies. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of our solution and the advantages gained when compared to a recent commercial solution by DataStax. To the best of our knowledge our approach is the first and the only available open source solution allowing joins over NoSQL Cassandra databases.",

In this manner, the student is supported throughout the educational process, by interacting with these resources and experiencing an enriched learning process. However, adaptivity and guidance to the student choices are features that seem to be missing from current LMSs. Consequently the students use their own criteria to choose between large collections of resources. As the student abilities are not taken into serious consideration, they are often led to frustration, and wrong choices. This paper focuses on information and communication technologies (ICT) in education. It proposes a prototype that enhances the Moodle LMS's functionality by providing more adaptivity.

Such collections have an established ground truth and are relatively easy to construct across languages. As a result, we introduce a corpus that includes diachronic AFD and normal articles from Greek newspapers and news websites. On top of that, we build a rich linguistic feature set, and analyze and compare its deception cues with the only AFD collection currently available, which is in English. Following a current research thread, we also discuss the individualism/collectivism dimension in deception with respect to these two datasets. Lastly, we build classifiers by testing various monolingual and crosslingual settings. The results showcase that AFD datasets can be helpful in deception detection studies, and are in alignment with the observations of other deception detection works.",

            "Abstract": "Modern service-based applications (SBAs) operate in highly dynamic environments where both underlying resources and the application demand can be constantly changing which external SBA components might fail. Thus, they need to be rapidly modified to address such changes. Such a rapid updating should be performed across multiple levels to better deal, in an orchestrated and globally-consistent manner, with the current problematic situation. First of all, this means that a fast and scalable event generation and detection mechanism should exist to rapidly trigger the adaptation workflow to be performed. Such a mechanism needs to handle all kinds of events occurring at different abstraction levels and to compose them so as to detect more advanced situations. To this end, this paper introduces a new complex event processing framework able to realise the respective features mentioned (processing speed, scalability) and have the flexibility to capture and sense any kind of event or event combination occurring in the SBA system. Such a framework is wrapped in the form of a REST service enabling to manage the event patterns that need to be rapidly detected. It is also well connected to other main components of the SBA management system, via a publishsubscribe mechanism, including monitoring and the adaptation engines.",

This way, one could exploit more than 20 years of research regarding the \u201crationality\u201d of belief change operators, since the concept of rationality is independent of the underlying knowledge representation scheme used. We follow this path by applying a generalized version of the AGM theory of contraction [1, 2] to DLs; the contribution of our current work is the determination of the applicability of the approach in several DLs.

One step towards this goal is the ability to specify educational needs or to describe educational material according to personalized e-learning terminologies and conceptualisations. In this deliverable we investigate how this goal can be achieved in a declarative way using language primitives for defining views over distributed, autonomous RDF bases holding learning object descriptions and schemas. Based on these primitives, we introduce a fully-fledged view definition language, called RVL, for creating not only virtual resource descriptions, but also virtual RDF/S schemas from (meta) classes, properties, and resource descriptions available on a SeLeNe. Furthermore, we illustrate how RVL views can be composed with structured RDF/S queries expressed in a query language like RQL, by means of an internal logical framework (linear Datalog rules) capturing the semantics of the RDF/S model, as well as of RQL queries and RVL views. To the best of our knowledge, RVL is the first declarative view definition language offering such functionality. Finally, we present how the RQL/RVL query processing can be implemented in three different architectural alternatives: the centralized, the mediated and the autonomic scenarios as presented in Deliverable 5.",

CloudSocket is a project dealing with these issues, which facilitates the transformation of business processes into business process as a service (BPaaS) products offered by organisations playing the role of a broker. A respective platform has been produced which enables the management of the whole lifecycle of a BPaaS.",

            "Abstract": "Requirements for widely distributed information systems supporting virtual organizations have given rise to a new category of peer-to-peer (p2p) systems called schema-based. In such systems each peer is a database management system in itself, exposing its own schema. In such a setting, a main objective is the efficient search across peer databases by processing each incoming query without overly consuming bandwidth. In this report, we adopt a super-peer-based architecture and suggest a query routing mechanism, upon which we propose a query processing technique for top-k queries. Top-k queries in the context of p2p systems give the opportunity to filter the results and to eliminate network traffic by choosing the k highest ranked results. We introduce HT-p2p and HT-p2p+, two extended versions of the Hybrid Threshold Algorithm adapted to our p2p scenario. For the evaluation of these algorithms we implemented a prototype system upon the JXTA platform. Extensive experiments with different data sets and parameters have shown promising results about the performance of the query processing strategy.",

The respective technology can also be exploited to perform inferencing for deriving added-value knowledge. As such, LD technology can really assist in performing various analysis tasks over information related to business process execution. In the context of Business Process as a Service (BPaaS), the first real challenge is to collect and link information originating from different systems by following a certain structure. As such, this paper proposes two main ontologies that serve this purpose: a KPI and a Dependency one. Based on these well-connected ontologies, an innovative Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis system is then built which exhibits two main analysis capabilities: KPI assessment and drill-down, where the second can be exploited to find root causes of KPI violations. Compared to other KPI analysis systems, LD usage enables the flexible construction and assessment of any KPI kind allowing experts to better explore the possible KPI space.",

However, such multi-cloud applications face a new challenge related to the dynamicity and uncertainty that even a single cloud environment exhibits. As such, they cannot deliver a suitable service level to their customers, resulting in SLA penalty costs and application provider reputation reduction. To this end, we have previously proposed a cross-level and multi-cloud application adaptation architecture. Towards realising this architecture, this paper proposes two extensions of the CAMEL language allowing to specify advanced adaptation rules and histories. Such extensions not only enable to cover cross-level application adaptation by executing adaptation workflows but also to progress such an adaptation to address both the application and exploited cloud services evolution.",

We introduce an alternative way of building user profiles based on explicit and implicit ratings as well as profile-based recommendation and user-matching algorithms. The paper advocates the use of such algorithms as a tool to automate the discovery and creation of dynamic, virtual communities. Furthermore, rating prediction algorithms are proposed as a means of enhancing the interaction between users and a recommendation system.

We introduce two algorithms optimized for ranking queries in p2p networks and present their characteristics. In the setting of a simulation of large p2p networks, we evaluate the algorithms' performance. Our experiments demonstrate that in some cases a threshold algorithm can improve top-k query processing, while in others it is far more costly. The results show that distributed query processing can be more effective than a simple threshold algorithm in a p2p network.",

QoS encompasses the performance of WSs and can be used as a discriminating factor for refining WS advertisement results.

The main novelty of the proposed semantics is the discrimination among two different roles that attacks play, namely an attack as a generator of conflicts, and an attack as a means to defend an argument. These two roles have traditionally been considered together in the argumentation literature. Allowing some attack types to serve one of those roles only, gives rise to the different semantics presented here.",

In this paper, we present a tool that connects the theoretical results to practical considerations, by producing the appropriate SQL commands in order to address the ramification problem.

            "Abstract": "One of the crucial tasks to be performed towards the realization of the vision of the Semantic Web is the encoding of human knowledge in ontologies using formal representation languages. Creating ontologies is simply the first step; ontologies, just like any structure holding knowledge, need to be updated as well. There are several reasons why an ontology should change: changes could be initiated because of a change in the world being modeled; the users needs may change, requiring a different conceptualization; knowledge previously unknown, classified or otherwise unavailable may become known; or a design flaw may have been noticed in the original conceptualization.In all these cases, the representation of our knowledge in the ontology should be modified so as to form a more accurate or adequate conceptualization of the domain. Such a modification presents several difficulties from both the practical and the theoretical point of view, as it is not always clear what the expected, or desired, result of any particular modification should be, nor how such a result can be determined.",

Ontologies are used to classify the terms used in a particular application, characterize possible relationships, and define possible constraints on using those relationships. Thus, they provide a suitable means for representing context models. The formal semantics of ontology-based approaches also enable simple reasoning tasks on the context information. Rule-based reasoning techniques are also used in order to offer extensive reasoning capabilities.

This aspect of mereology has not yet been formally analyzed. In this paper, we continue previous work by addressing the formalization of some of the reasoning needed to identify other parts of the same whole through knowledge about some parts, or to narrow down the category of wholes a part may have belonged to.

Consequently, as a great number of functionally equivalent services will be available for a specific user task, the service nonfunctional aspect should be considered for filtering and selecting among these services. The state-of-the-art approaches in nonfunctional service discovery exploit constraint solving techniques to optimize the matchmaking time between a service offer and demand pair. However, they do not scale well, as matchmaking time is proportional to the offer number, so they are not yet suitable for the IoS. To this end, this article proposes three novel alternative techniques that intelligently organize the service offer space to improve the overall matchmaking time. These techniques are theoretically and experimentally evaluated. The results show \u2026",

To this direction, NoSQL databases provide new opportunities by enabling elastic scaling, fault tolerance, high availability and schema flexibility. Despite these benefits, their limitations in the flexibility of query mechanisms impose a real barrier for any application that has not predetermined access use-cases. One of the main reasons for this bottleneck is that NoSQL databases do not directly support joins. In this paper, we propose a data management solution, designed initially for eHealth environments, that relies on NoSQL Cassandra databases and efficiently supports joins, requiring no set-up time.

The framework implements the declarative semantics of the underlying logic theories in a forward-chaining rule-based system. This way, it combines the capacity of highly expressive formalisms to represent a multitude of commonsense phenomena with the efficiency of rule-based reasoning systems, which typically lack real semantics and high-level structures.",

We follow two different approaches for offering recommendations to the members of a group: considering the members of a group as a single user, and recommending to this user items that similar users liked, or estimating first how much each group member would like an item, and then, recommend the items that would (dis)satisfy the most (least) members of the group.

Devising such complete specifications comes with many issues that have not been adequately addressed by current service description efforts, such as WSDL, SAWSDL, OWL-S and WSMO. These issues involve the frame, ramification and qualification problems, which deal with the succinct and flexible representation of non-effects, indirect effects and preconditions, respectively. We propose WSSL, a novel specification language for services, based on the fluent calculus, that is expressly designed to address the aforementioned issues. Also, a tool is implemented that translates WSSL specifications to FLUX programs and allows for service validation based on user-defined goals.",

We advocate for the use of labeling schemes for modeling these hierarchies in order to efficiently answer queries such as subsumption check, descendants, ancestors or nearest common ancestor, which usually require costly transitive closure computations. We first give a qualitative comparison of three main families of schemes, namely bit vector, prefix and interval based schemes. We then show that two labeling schemes are good candidates for an efficient implementation of label querying using standard relational DBMS, namely, the Dewey Prefix scheme [6] and an Interval scheme by Agrawal, Borgida and Jagadish [1]. We compare their storage and query evaluation performance for the 16 ODP hierarchies using the PostgreSQL engine.",

In this report, we address this problem when the knowledge base is a set of expressions in propositional logic. We introduce a new representation of propositional expressions using 2-dimensional matrices and provide the theoretical underpinnings of this representation. We prove several propositions regarding matrices and their similarity with classical logic and show why this representation is more expressive than classical propositional logic. We exploit this increased expressiveness to devise a solution to the problem of belief revision in propositional knowledge bases and describe a simple method to perform revisions and contractions under this new notion. Finally, we compare our method with proposed algorithms from the literature.",

In this paper, we present a methodology based on the HIFUN language, and the corresponding algorithms for the incremental evaluation of continuous queries. In essence, our approach is able to process the most recent data batch by exploiting already computed information, without requiring the evaluation of the query over the complete dataset. We present the generic algorithm which we translated to both SQL and MapReduce using SPARK; it implements various query rewriting methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in temrs of query answering efficiency. Finally, we show that by exploiting the formal query rewriting methods of HIFUN, we can further reduce the computational cost, adding another layer of query optimization to our implementation.

The novelty of this paper closes the gap between the different functional layers by defining a cross-layer dependency model indicating relationships of quality aspects from three different semantic quality models. Each of these three quality models define metrics, metric aggregations and computations for each of the separate layers. These quality models are being addressed by a continuously, yet evolving distributed monitoring system.",

Several algorithms have been proposed for the evaluation of top-k queries. A large percentage of them follow the Threshold Approach. In p2p networks, top-k query processing can provide a lot of advantages both in time and bandwidth consumption. We focus on the main adaptations of threshold algorithms fulfilling the requirements of modern p2p applications. We introduce two algorithms optimized for ranking queries in p2p networks and present their characteristics. In the setting of a simulation of large p2p networks, we evaluate the performance of Threshold Algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that in some cases a threshold algorithm can improve top-k query processing, while in others it is far more costly. The results show that distributed query processing can be more effective than a simple threshold algorithm in a p2p network.",

Unfortunately, full-fledged view definition languages for the RDF/S data model are still missing. We propose RVL, a view definition language capable of creating not only virtual resource descriptions, but also virtual RDF/S schemas from (meta)classes, properties, as well as, resource descriptions available on the Semantic Web. RVL exploits the functional nature and type system of the RQL query language in order to navigate, filter and restructure complex RDF/S schema and resource description graphs.",

Our approach, which focuses on indoor environments, uses OWL ontologies to capture and formally model context information, and reasons on the ontology data using rules in order to support personalized context-aware navigation services. To test and demonstrate the proposed approach, a prototype has been developed that documents the flexibility of the design.",

            "Abstract": "Provenance has been widely studied in several different contexts and with respect to different aspects and applications. Although the problem of determining how provenance should be recorded and represented has been thoroughly discussed, the issue of querying data provenance has not yet been adequately considered. In this paper, we introduce a novel highlevel structured query language, named ProvQL, which is suitable for seeking information related to data provenance. ProvQL treats provenance information as a first class citizen and allows formulating queries about the sources that contributed to data generation and the operations involved, about data records with a specific provenance/origins (or with common provenance), and others. This makes ProvQL a useful tool for tracking data provenance information and supporting applications that need to assess data reliability, access control, trustworthiness, or quality.",

            "Abstract": "As Cloud computing becomes a widely accepted service delivery platform, developers usually resort in multi-cloud setups to optimize their application deployment. In such heterogeneous environments, during application execution, various events are produced by several layers (Cloud and SOA specific), leading to or indicating Service Level Objective (SLO) violations. To this end, this paper proposes a meta-model to describe the components of multi-cloud Service-based Applications (SBAs) and an event pattern discovery algorithm to discover valid event patterns causing specific SLO violations. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated based on a real-world application.",

            "Abstract": "An essential matter in heterogeneous database integration is the mapping process. In this report we present a mapping language for information integration under a common knowledge representation model (LAV approach). Based on particular requirements for a sufficient quality of information integration to be achieved, we present the most common cases of heterogeneity encountered in a wide sample of cases from museum collections, archeological, medical and genomic data. and reflect the individual investigated domain. We propose a specific mapping annotation format that is capable to capture all those cases. We assume that the level of detail of this format is sufficient to produce complete mediation of data transformation algorithms without further input from the domain experts. This assumption has to be verified in further work.",
