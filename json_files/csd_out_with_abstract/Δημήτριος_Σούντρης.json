            "Abstract": "Process variability is a challenging fabrication issue impacting, mainly, the reliability and performance of chips. Variability is already present in current technology nodes and is expected to become even more significant in the future. In this work, we focus on the study of performance variation in 16nm FinFET FPGAs. We devise a comprehensive assessment methodology based on multiple programmable sensors with diverse resource and delay characteristics. Additionally, we consider various voltage and temperature conditions and decouple variability to systematic and stochastic. The experimental results on Zynq XCZU7EV show up to 7.3% intra-die variation increasing to 9.9% for certain operating conditions. Our approach demonstrates that logic and interconnect resources present different variability, slightly uncorrelated, which highlights the necessity and way towards more sophisticated mitigation methods/tools.",

The data-path consists of several coarse grained components that their universal type is shown to increase the system\u2019s performance due to significant reductions in latency. An automated methodology, which is based on unsophisticated algorithms, for mapping computational intensive applications on the proposed data-path is also presented. Results on DSP and multimedia benchmarks show an average latency reduction of approximately 21%, combined with an area consumption decrease, when the proposed data-path is compared with a high-performance one. The latency reduction is even greater, 43%, when the comparison is held with a data-path that instantiates primitive computational resources in FPGA hardware.",

The increasing complexity of said models and the need for large-scale or real-time experiments have presented significant challenges to the world of high-performance computing (HPC). We explore Intel\u2019s newest generation of Xeon Phi computing platforms, named Knights Landing (KNL), as a way to match the need for processing power and as an upgrade over the previous generation of Xeon Phi models, the Knights Corner (KNC). Our analysis is done using a simulator, which implements a state-ofthe art physiologically plausible model of the inferiorolive nucleus (InfOli), that has been ported on both generations of Xeon Phi platforms. The application uses the OpenMP interface for parallelization and the available vectorization buffers present in Xeon Phi platforms for Single-Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) processing. In this analysis we provide insight as to how efficiently the application takes advantage of both Xeon Phi architectures and how the KNL measures against its predecessor.

The platform-based design allows to designer to build a customized FPGA architecture, using specific blocks, depending on the application domain requirements. Due to the fact that about 70-90% of typical an FPGA is occupied by routing resources, many researchers have spent much effort on minimizing energy consumption and on achieving higher frequencies. Their clear message was the fact that the interconnection structure dominates the total power dissipation and performance. A typical interconnection network of FPGA consists of the Switch Boxes (SBs) and the wire segments.

To avoid Big Data issues (e.g. high latency of cloud based IoT), the processing of the captured data is starting from the IoT edge node. However, the available processing capabilities and energy resources are still limited and do not allow to fully process the data on-board. It calls for offloading some portions of computation to the gateway or servers. Due to the limited bandwidth of the IoT gateways, choosing the offloading levels of connected devices and allocating bandwidth to them is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a technique for managing computation offloading in a local IoT network under bandwidth constraints.

Foremost is the ability to match the energy uptake and storage, so that the maximal yield possible is attained. This involves sophisticated analogue circuitry, to continuously match the harvesting element. It also involves digital logic exploiting features of the analogue modules, to quantify and control the energy budget at run-time. The overall goal was to minimize periods of energy starvation, as well as periods where harvesting is not possible, due to limited storage capacity. The present paper introduces an on-chip vibration harvesting unit fabricated with the 0.35um AMS CMOS technology, feeding sensors in the presence of extremely volatile energy environments.

            "Abstract": "The workloads of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit a streaming nature that makes them attractive for reconfigurable architectures such as the Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), while their increased need for low-power and speed has established Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-based accelerators as alternative efficient solutions. During the last five years, the development of Hardware Description Language (HDL)-based CNN accelerators, either for FPGA or ASIC, has seen huge academic interest due to their high-performance and room for optimizations. Towards this direction, we propose a library-based framework, which extends TensorFlow, the well-established machine learning framework, and automatically generates high-throughput CNN inference engines for FPGAs and ASICs. The framework allows software developers to exploit the benefits of FPGA/ASIC acceleration without requiring any expertise on HDL development and low-level design. Moreover, it provides a set of optimization knobs concerning the model architecture and the inference engine generation, allowing the developer to tune the accelerator according to the requirements of the respective use case. Our framework is evaluated by optimizing the LeNet CNN model on the MNIST dataset, and implementing FPGA-and ASIC-based accelerators using the generated inference engine. The optimal FPGA-based accelerator on Zynq-7000 delivers 93% less memory footprint and 54% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, and up to 10\u00d7 speedup on the inference execution vs. different Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Central Processing \u2026",

The system scenario concept can contribute to improve these mechanisms exploiting a flexibility decision-making scheme. The current section deploys such a run-time mechanism that mitigates the correction overhead, guaranteeing the performance dependability. As discussed in ch_DVFS we have developed a quite broad range of DVFS configuration knob oriented scenario approaches. These will be partly exploited also here.

            "Abstract": "The constantly increasing computational power of the embedded systems is based on the integration of a large number of cores on a single chip. In such complex platforms, the synchronization of the accesses of the shared memory data is becoming a major issue, since it affects the performance of the whole system. This problem, which is currently a challenge in the embedded systems, has been studied in the High Performance Computing domain, where several message passing algorithms have been designed to efficiently avoid the limitations coming from locking. In this work, inspired from the work on message passing synchronization algorithms in the High Performance Computing domain we design and evaluate a set of synchronization algorithms for multi-core embedded platforms. We compare them with the corresponding lock-based implementations and prove that message passing synchronization \u2026",

Error-correction mechanisms deal with these issues ensuring the operation Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS), paying a price in performance. The current study deploys a run-time mechanism that mitigates the correction overhead, guaranteeing the performance dependability. In this direction, a closed-loop controller absorbs the RAS-induced delay by triggering Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) schemes. The novelty is the run-time adjustment of the DVFS responses to the identified performance variability norms. To achieve this, we exploit an adaptive scenario scheduler that reorganizes the scenario hierarchy at run-time. Compared against an approach utilizing a 30% operation frequency guardband, the proposed configuration achieves an 83.9 \u2026",

This allows the evaluation of the performance of each topology and estimation of the long-term gains. Using a cost function, which includes the additional investment cost, the energy gain can be translated to financial terms. Through this, locations where reconfigurable topologies can be beneficial, both in energy and financial terms, can be identified.

Specifically, the shrinking of transistor and wire size imposes that these components simultaneously are becoming more prone to complete, or parametric, failure at manufacturing time. Additionally, the derived systems are increasingly expensive to produce and less likely to function correctly for as long as intended. In order to address these challenges, the NoC-based systems have to be designed with reliability and fault tolerance features in mind. Toward this goal, a number of design techniques and methodologies are available that promise to provide sufficient fault coverage with controllable overhead in terms of hardware redundancy and performance (e.g., delay/power) degradation.

            "Abstract": "Future integrated systems will contain billion of transistors [9], composing tens to hundreds of IP cores. These IP cores, implementing emerging complex multimedia and network applications, should be able to deliver rich multimedia and networking services. An efficient communication among these IP cores (eg, efficient data transfers) can be achieved through utilization of the available resources. An architecture that is able to accommodate such a high number of cores, satisfying the need for communication and data transfers, is the Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture [2, 5]. Furthermore, the emerging three-dimensional (3D) integration and process technologies allow the design of multi-level Integrated Circuits (ICs). As illustrated in [8], this creates new design opportunities in NoC design. In order to satisfy the demands of emerging systems for scaling, performance and functionality 3D integration is a way to accommodate these demands [3]. For example, a considerable reduction can be achieved in the number and length of global interconnect using three-dimensional integration. On deciding whether to choose a two-dimensional (2D) or 3D NoC as an architecture it is shown in [1, 4] that 3D NoCs are advantageous, providing better performance.In this work we present an exploration methodology designing alternative 3D NoC architectures. We define as 3D NoCs these architectures composed of many layers, where each layer is a two-dimensional NoC grid, where the grids are the same for all the layers, composed of elements of the same type (s). The main objective of the methodology is to derive to heterogeneous 3D NoC topologies with a \u2026",

One optimization area lately addressed is reconfigurable computing, where parts of a DFG are merged and mapped into coarse grained reconfigurable components. This paper presents an alternative approach, the construction of dual mode components which are exchanged with regular components in the resulting RTL architecture. The dual mode components are constructed by exhaustive search for dual mode functional primitives inside the datapath of complicated RTL components. Such components, like multipliers and dividers, that would remain idle in certain control steps, are able to work full-time in two different modes, without any reconfiguration overhead applied to the critical path of the application.

The designer has to take this fact into consideration, together with the system performance, in order to design devices portable or otherwise. An exploration approach for optimising the power and performance of the data-memory hierarchy as well as the instruction memory in the early system-design phase, is introduced. A power- and performance-efficient data-memory hierarchy is obtained by applying data-reuse transformations in a high-level description of the application, whereas the instruction-memory power optimisation, of the selected optimal data hierarchies of the previous step, is achieved by using a suitably selected cache memory. Furthermore, two cache energy models, namely the high-level power model and the architecture-dependent power model \u2026",

Our results show that by taking advantage of the embedded platform specifications, we achieve up to 28.2 % lower execution time and 6.8 % less power dissipation in comparison with the conventional lock-based queue implementation. We show that HPC applications utilizing concurrent queues can be efficiently implemented in embedded systems and that synchronization algorithms from the HPC domain can lead to optimal resource utilization of embedded platforms.",

            "Abstract": "The use of digital equalization is advocated for the cost-sensitive datacom environment, to compensate for the limited bandwidth of the commodity optoelectronic components typically employed in such systems. The need for equalization is exacerbated by the adoption of advanced, multi-level modulation formats such as PAM-4 and PAM-8, which are gaining momentum among research and industrial circles as the means of keeping up with the surging demand for throughput. FPGAs can be considered as an attractive solution to deal with the huge bandwidth demands of the present-day datacenters. This is, due to their highly parallel processing and real-time intelligence to be assimilated into the diverse infrastructure operations. This work presents a real-time feed-forward equalizer (FFE) hardware architecture to support state-of-the-art optical interconnects in rack-torack communication for datacenters. We describe design and implementation techniques to efficiently exploit the inherent parallelism of FFE. We implement the proposed architecture on a Virtex7 XC7VH580T FPGA device and we provide results that confirm the increased efficiency of our design, which achieves a very high throughput rate of up to 20 GSa/s.",

            "Abstract": "The delay distribution of a digital circuit path is crucial for the early reliability evaluation of a digital design. As transistors are shrunk to unprecedented dimensions, accurate yet fast estimation of such distributions remains a valid goal. Such distributions may not be provided or are delivered in a heavily abstracted fashion to designers, which reduces the insight into design dependability. In view of the above observations, we propose a technique that approximates the probability density function of a path of digital circuits by exending a well-known computational kernel, namely the Most Probable Failure Point (MPFP) technique. The output of this concept is the failure probability of standard cells or paths thereof for various target delays. We reformulate MPFP and establish a concise methodology for delay distribution approximation. We present simulations for an inverter and outline projections for more complex gates.",

            "Abstract": "Low and medium bit-rate receivers are met in a wide range of applications including the popular GSM and DECT telecommunication terminals. In principle, receivers falling in this class employ oversampling for synchronization purposes. This paper introduces a novel power-aware architecture for low and medium bit-rate digital receivers that implements power management by dynamically scaling the operation frequency. A real-life DECT receiver is used to compare the conventional and the proposed architecture. Experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture presents significantly reduced power consumption for a negligible increase in area and performance decrease. Specifically, depending on the selected oversampling ratio and the receiver structure, a 40% up to 70% power reduction has been obtained with a 2% and 1.2% increase in area and delay, respectively.",

Automated Design Space Exploration (DSE) becomes an essential design procedure to discover optimized solutions in a reasonable time. For high-quality DSE, the accurate solution evaluation is a strong requirement. To this direction, High-Level Synthesis (HLS) can be used for the characterization of the design solutions. In this paper, we propose (a) a platform design methodology that exploits simulation-induced slacks generated by avoiding simulation re-initializations and exploits the gained time for HLS, and (b) a DSE tool-flow which takes into account multiple HW/SW partitioning schemes and intelligently schedules system evaluations. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology achieves 17% simulation \u2026",

The new European FPGA NGMEDIUM is expected to play a key role in this direction owing to its radiation-hardened process, high-density, and reconfigurability. In the current work, we devise a methodology to evaluate the capabilities of NG-MEDIUM and its programming tools. The proposed methodology involves numerous successive inter-dependent steps for assessing thoroughly the Synthesis, Placement, Routing, and Programming processes. We propose intensive benchmarking based on VHDL algorithms inherited from real Vision-Based Navigation activities. In addition, we present the evaluation of NG-MEDIUM in a hypothetical application scenario, which requires distinct bitstreams/algorithms to interchange depending on the position of a space robot, in-the-field.

            "Abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been established as one of the most fundamental bio-signals for monitoring and assessing the health status of a person. ECG analysis flow relies on the detection of points of interest on the signal with the QRS complex, located around an R peak of the heart beat, being the most commonly used. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, we evaluate the accuracy of various R peak detectors, showing a large number, ie several thousands, of falsely detected peaks. Considering the medical significance of the ECG analysis, we propose a machine learning based classifier to be incorporated in the ECG analysis flow aiming at identifying and discarding heart beats based on erroneously detected R peaks. Using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and extensive exploration, we deliver a tuned classifier that i) successfully filters up to 75% of the false beats, ii) while keeping the correct \u2026",

An inferior placement will not only affect the performance of digital applications mapped onto the FPGA, but might also make the circuit unroutable by producing excessive wirelength, which is beyond the available fabricated routing resources. Throughout this paper we propose a novel placer, based on genetic algorithm, targeting to FPGAs. Rather than relevant approaches which are executed sequentially, the new placer exhibits inherent parallelism, which can be benefit from multi-core processors. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of this solution, since it reduces significantly the execution run-time (on average by 6.3\u00d7), whereas it leads also to average increase in maximum operating frequency by 12%.",

In this paper, we focus on hardware-level approximation by introducing the partial product perforation technique for designing approximate multiplication circuits. We prove in a mathematically rigorous manner that in partial product perforation, the imposed errors are bounded and predictable, depending only on the input distribution. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we apply the partial product perforation method on different multiplier architectures and expose the optimal architecture-perforation configuration pairs for different error constraints. We show that, compared with the respective exact design, the partial product perforation delivers reductions of up to 50% in power consumption, 45% in area, and 35% in critical delay.

The approximations are performed by rounding the high radix values to their nearest power of two. The proposed technique can be configured to achieve the desired energy-accuracy tradeoffs. Compared with the accurate radix-4 multiplier, the proposed multipliers deliver up to 56% energy and 55% area savings, when operating at the same frequency, while the imposed error is bounded by a Gaussian distribution with near-zero average.

            "Abstract": "In the near future, portable embedded devices must run multimedia applications with enormous computational requirements at low energy consumption. These applications demand extensive memory footprint and must rely on dynamic memory due to the unpredictability of input data (eg 3D streams features) and system behaviour (eg variable number of applications running concurrently). Within this context, the dynamic memory subsystem is one of the main sources of power consumption and embedded systems have very limited batteries to provide efficient general-purpose dynamic memory management. As a result, consistent design methodologies that can efficiently tackle the complex dynamic memory behaviour of these new applications for low power embedded systems are in great need. In this paper we propose a step-wise system-level approach that allows the design of platform-specific dynamic memory management mechanisms with low power consumption for such kind of dynamic applications. The experimental results in reallife case studies show that our approach improves power consumption up to 89% over current state-of-the-art dynamic memory managers for complex applications.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers have played a crucial role in providing data fusion and high accuracy classification solutions for various, complex, non-linear problems. Their popularity accompanied by the ever-increasing need of implementing it on computationally weak, portable or even wearable systems has refueled the effort to accelerate their execution. In this paper, we explore FPGA-based acceleration to produce efficient SVM hardware co-processors. We propose a systematic two-level approach for SVM acceleration, which first optimizes the global structure of the original SVM\u2019s behavioral description to exploit the data- and instruction-level parallelism and then further refines it through a targeted design exploration that matches the accelerator\u2019s memory architecture to its computation and memory access patterns. The proposed methodology has been implemented as a \u2026",

After determining the NoC topology for the given application, designing the communication infrastructure is the next step. The routing algorithm is selected based on both the selected topology and design constraints. After the selection of routing algorithm and flow control scheme, the router and link design can begin. In this chapter switching techniques, routing algorithms and flow control schemes are discussed and compared, while the design of a generic 2D and 3D router is illustrated and improvements proposed in the literature are discussed.",

Therefore it is necessary to find proper ways for mitigating the increasing energy cost of HVAC systems (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning). The problem of increased energy requirements becomes far more crucial by taking into consideration the sub-optimal operation of HVAC systems by the occupants. In order to alleviate these drawbacks, throughout this chapter we introduce a decision-making mechanism in order to support the temperature control within buildings. For this purpose, a smart thermostat concept is applied, where emphasis is given to lowering the cost and deployment flexibility, in order to be widely adopted in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Modern micro-service and container-based cloud-native applications have leveraged multi-tenancy as a first class system design concern. The increasing number of co-located services/workloads into server facilities stresses resource availability and system capability in an unconventional and unpredictable manner. To efficiently manage resources in such dynamic environments, run-time observability and forecasting are required to capture workload sensitivities under differing interference effects, according to applied co-location scenarios. While several research efforts have emerged on interference-aware performance modelling, they are usually applied at a very coarse-grained manner e.g., estimating the overall performance degradation of an application, thus failing to effectively quantify, predict or provide educated insights on the impact of continuous runtime interference on per-resource allocations.

Time-zero and time-dependent phenomena need to be carefully considered so that the dependability of digital systems can be guaranteed. Already, architectures contain many mechanisms that detect and correct physically induced reliability violations. In many cases, guarantees on functional correctness come at a quantifiable performance cost. The current paper discusses the FP7-612069-HARPA project of the European Commission and its approach towards dependable performance. This project provides solutions for performance variability mitigation, under the run time presence of fabric variability/aging and built-in reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) techniques.

            "Abstract": "Digital signal processing has emerged in every aspect of modern life, with different implementations found in appliances ranging from simple answering machines to high speed multimedia cloud routers. The design of such appliances requires a number of decision steps, based on diverse criteria like time-to-market, development cost, production cost, production volume, performance, power consumption and algorithm complexity, to name just a few. A crucial decision step is the use of a floating or fixed-point number representation. This paper presents a new paradigm for the design of floating point applications, based on modern hardware design techniques like electronic system level design and high-level synthesis, and the computing capabilities and power efficiency of modern FPGA devices. Specifically, it presents the design of a reusable, floating point, hardware operator library, starting from an open source \u2026",

Towards this direction, the usage of Networks-on-Chip (NoC) is a preferred solution. In this work, we propose a software-supported framework for quantifying the efficiency of heterogeneous 3-D NoC architectures. In contrast to existing approaches for NoC design, the introduced heterogeneous architecture consists of a mixture of 2-D and 3-D routers, which reduces the delay and power consumption with a slight impact on packet hops. More specifically, the experimental results with a number of DSP applications show the effectiveness of the introduced methodology, as we achieve on average 25% higher maximum operation frequency and 39% lower power consumption compared to the uniform 3-D NoCs.",

            "Abstract": "For decades computer architects pursued one primary goal: performance. The even-faster transistors provided by Moore's law were translated into remarkable gains in operation frequency and power consumption. However, the device-level size and architecture complexity imposes several new challenges, including a decrease in dependability level due to physical failures. This makes crucial the usage of fault tolerance. Existing solutions are applied statically at design-time ignoring about constraints posed during execution phase, while they also introduce mentionable overheads in terms of delay and power consumption. In this paper we introduce a software-supported methodology based on game theory for adapting the aggressiveness of fault tolerance at run-time. Experimental results prove the efficiency of our methodology since it achieves comparable fault masking to relevant solutions, but with significant \u2026",

            "Abstract": "FPGA-based accelerators are becoming first class citizens in data centers. Adding FPGAs in data centers can lead to higher compute densities with improved energy efficiency for latency critical workloads, such as financial applications. However FPGA deployment in datacenters brings difficulties both to application developers, and cloud providers. Application writers need to deal with the interfacing of FPGAs on top of application logic/algorithms. On the other hand, cloud providers are reluctant face the risk that their hardware remains underutilized, due to the lack of a sharing mechanism for FPGAs. In this paper, we introduce VineTalk, a framework that reduces the programming effort associated with FPGA-based accelerators and FPGA virtualization. We integrate VineTalk with the Xilinx SDAccel development framework and we map it to the Kintex UltraScale FPGA. Our preliminary evaluation with a use-case of \u2026",

For that purpose, we develop a new methodology consisting of two steps:(i) Exploration and determination of the optimal wire length and (ii) Exploration and determination of the optimal combination of multiple switch-boxes, considering the optimal choice of the former step. The proposed methodology for designing the high performance interconnection architecture is fully-supported by the software tool called EX-VPR. For both steps, the selection criterion for a minimal Energy\u00d7 Delay Product is chosen. Depending on the localized performance and energy consumption requirements of each specific region of FPGA architecture, we derive a set of corresponding spatial routing information of the applications mapped onto FPGA.

This work presents a novel configurable hardware accelerator that is used to speed up the processing of multi-core and cloud computing applications based on the MapReduce programming framework. The proposed MapReduce configurable accelerator is augmented to multi-core processors and it performs a fast indexing and accumulation of the key/value pairs based on an efficient memory architecture using Cuckoo hashing. The MapReduce accelerator consists of the memory buffers that store the key/value pairs, and the processing units that are used to accumulate the key's value sent from the processors. In essence, this accelerator is used to alleviate the processors from executing the Reduce tasks, and thus executing only the Map tasks and emitting the intermediate key/value pairs \u2026",

IoT applications make use of inherently distributed processing. In such networks-of-systems (NoS), computation and communication is tightly coupled. Traditional design of networks and systems in isolation ignores how choices in one influence the other, and approaches for joint network/system co-exploration are lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel prototyping platform to enable comprehensive NoS design space exploration. Fast and accurate host-compiled system models are combined with a standard network simulator to provide a unified network/system co-simulation framework. Furthermore, detailed models of network interfaces and protocol stacks are integrated into host-compiled system and OS models to allow accurately capturing of network and \u2026",

We combine hardware and software techniques to perform on-chip irradiation via a  90 Sr/ 90 Y electron source and assess in detail the degradation of complex SRAM FPGAs. Our methodology combines multiple sensing mechanisms with correlation analysis to facilitate modeling of effects and tuning of a custom ring-oscillator network for future autonomous in-flight use. Focusing on 28-nm Zynq7000 devices, our results show Mrad total ionizing dose tolerance with parameters' degradation in the area of 5%, zero functional errors, and nonuniform spatial response.",

Despite several studies on the scheduling of appliances, a battery, and heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC), there is a lack of a comprehensive and time-scalable approach that integrates predictive information such as renewable generation and thermal comfort. In this paper, we propose an online energy management framework to incorporate the optimal energy scheduling and prediction model of PV generation and thermal comfort by the model predictive control (MPC) approach. The energy management problem is formulated as coordinated three optimization problems covering a fast and slow time-scale.This reduces the time complexity without a significant negative impact on the global nature and quality of the result.

To make this possible, a novel design flow is proposed to perform design exploration of 3D ICs. Power supply voltage and thermal variations are modeled, to allow accurate PPA (power, performance and area) predictions. Using the main parts of this design flow, in a system comprising hundreds of million gates, complicated mechanisms are shown to determine the performance of the system. With increasing number of dies, timing is shown to exhibit 4 distinct regions, where either temperature or voltage drop is the dominant limiting factor. Power consumption does not scale monotonically with increasing die number. As a consequence, optimum system performance is in no way achieved by minimizing temperature and voltage drop, as is assumed in the literature so far. The \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Next generation mobile wireless systems (4G) support a wide range of communication protocols and services, thus opening new design challenges. The desired flexibility requires an effective utilization of system resources. In this article, we introduce the concept of system scenarios in wireless baseband engine signal processing optimization and in digital front-end power optimization. The scenario methodology classifies the system behavior from a cost perspective and provides the necessary information for an effective system tuning. We propose improvements for the clustering of the system executions into scenarios and the detection of scenarios at run time achieving a better trade-off between cost estimation accuracy and detection overhead. The first case study of the paper, using the WLAN communication protocol, demonstrates the accurate prediction of the execution time of each block of bits, which on average is 92% shorter than the worst case allowing us to use the remaining time for the optimization of specifications like power consumption. In the second case study, we concentrate on the efficient signal power management during a WLAN transmission reducing the total energy consumption 50\u201394% based on the throughput utilization.",

            "Abstract": "Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become the implementation medium for the majority of digital circuits. The key to FPGAs popularity is their feature to support application implementation by appropriately (re-) configuring the functionality of hardware resources. This allows FPGAs to provide higher flexibility, rapid product prototyping and significantly reduced non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs, as compared to ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) devices. Additionally, this situation makes the FPGA paradigm to grow in importance, as there is a stronger demand for faster, smaller, cheaper, and lower-energy devices. For decades, semiconductor manufacturers have been shrinking transistor size in Integrated Circuits (ICs) to achieve the yearly increases in performance described by Moores Law, which exists only because the RC delay was negligible, as compared to the signal propagation delay. For sub-micron technology, however, the RC delay becomes a dominant factor. Furthermore,",

Recent works have revealed that the domain of deep neural networks is crossing from embedded systems to data centers. Hence, it has been a race between CPU, GPU and FPGA vendors to offer high performance platforms that are not only fast but also efficient as the energy footprint in the large data centers operating today will be the trade-off for the raw computer power of these platforms.

Exhaustive search of design space using simulation is too slow procedure and needs hundreds of simulations to find the optimal cache configuration.

From an implementation point of view, since the division can be performed by any existing divider, the designer can chose the divider which meets his specifications best. Two possible implementations of the algorithm, namely the sequential and parallel are derived, with several variations, allowing performance, cost, and cost/performance trade-offs.",

This methodology initially predicts areas of the target architecture where faults are most possible to occur and then inserts selectively redundancy only there.

            "Abstract": "Spark is one of the most widely used frameworks for data analytics. Spark allows fast development for several applications like machine learning, graph computations, etc. In this paper, we present Spynq: A framework for the efficient deployment of data analytics on embedded systems that are based on the heterogeneous MPSoC FPGA called Pynq. The mapping of Spark on Pynq allows that fast deployment of embedded and cyber-physical systems that are used in edge and fog computing. The proposed platform is evaluated in a typical machine learning application based on logistic regression. The performance evaluation shows that the heterogeneous FPGA-based MPSoC can achieve up to 11\u00d7 speedup compared to the execution time in the ARM cores and can reduce significantly the development time of embedded and cyber-physical systems on Spark applications.",

The field of personal computing devices, wireless communication systems, home entertainment and wearable computers are some from the plethora of the market products, which are becoming increasingly popular. The other hand, physical and technology issues related to chip packaging, cooling, signal integrity, threshold\u2013voltage fluctuations, and variable supply voltages are some challenging problems. The dynamic power dissipation is caused by the charging and discharging of parasitic capacitances in the circuit. The two main low\u2013power reduction strategies concern the reduction of supply voltage and the switched capacitance. The dynamic power consumption is a dominant power component for the current and future design technologies. The circuit techniques based on \u2026",

The European BRAVE family of FPGAs is considered a promising solution in the generally limited pool of radiation-hardened devices. Our current work develops a methodology to drive the evaluation of the BRAVE EDA tools and devices. The paper focuses on NG-LARGE, ie, the largest FPGA of the 65nm RHBD technology of NanoXplore. The proposed approach consists of numerous inter-dependent steps for assessing the entire FPGA design flow, including highperformance benchmarking with HDL IPs from ongoing Vision-Based Navigation activities, testing on actual HW, as well as comparisons vs state-of-the-art FPGAs.",

Commodity optoelectronic components are used for cost-efficiency, assisted with digital equalizers to mitigate their bandwidth limitations. With optically-switched datacenter architectures gaining momentum, reconfigurable equalizers are sought allowing the receiver to adapt to different fiber lengths, bitrates and modulation-formats associated to different optical paths. An FPGA-based feed-forward equalizer (FFE) reconfigurable in baudrate and modulation-format is demonstrated. We verify its performance with NRZ and PAM-4 experimental data up to 56 GBaud, investigate its accuracy and extract the optimum FFE implementation for different transmission scenarios.",

In this paper, targeting multiplication circuits, ie, the energy-hungry counterpart of hardware accelerators, an extensive exploration of the error--energy trade-off, when combining arithmetic-level approximation techniques, is performed for the first time. Arithmetic-aware approximations deliver significant energy reductions, while allowing to control the error values with discipline by setting accordingly a configuration parameter. Inspired from the promising results of prior works with one configuration parameter, we propose 5 hybrid design families for approximate and energy-friendly hardware multipliers, consisting of two independent parameters to tune the approximation levels.

            "Abstract": "The interconnection structures in FPGA devices increasingly contribute more to the delay, power consumption and area overhead. Three-dimensional (3-D) chip stacking is touted as the silver bullet technology that can keep Moores momentum and fuel the next wave of consumer electronics products. However, the benefits of such an integration technology have not been sufficiently explored yet. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3-D architecture, as well as the software supporting tools for exploring and evaluating application mapping onto 3-D FPGAs, where logic and I/O resources are assigned to different layers. Experimental results shown that such a 3-D architecture is suitable especially for communication intensive applications, since a device with two layers achieves delay reduction, as compared to conventional 2-D FPGAs up to 87% without any overhead in power dissipation.",

Moreover, they must heavily rely on Dynamic Memory (DM) due to the unpredictability of the input data (e.g., 3D streams features) and system behavior (e.g., number of applications running concurrently defined by the user). Within this context, consistent design methodologies that can tackle efficiently the complex DM behavior of these multimedia and network applications are in great need. In this article, we present a new methodology that allows to design custom DM management mechanisms with a reduced memory footprint for such kind of dynamic applications. First, our methodology describes the large design space of DM management decisions for multimedia and wireless network applications.

Aggressive integration requires effective mitigation of such errors, without extreme overheads in power, timing, or silicon area. We demonstrate a hybrid (hardware-software) scheme that mitigates bit flips in data that reside in low-level caches. The methodology is shown to be applicable in streaming applications and we illustrate that with a video decoding case study on a state-of-the-art many-core chip. The single-chip cloud computer is an experimental processor created by Intel Labs. Dedicated on-chip memories are utilized to keep safe copies for key application data, thus allowing rollbacks upon error detection. The experimental results illustrate the tradeoff between application delay, consumed energy, and output fidelity as the injected errors are corrected. When output fidelity is considered as a hard constraint \u2026",

These systems run highly data-dominated applications from multimedia and wireless domains. Most of these applications spend significant amount of execution time in nested-loops. In order to reduce the loop control overhead several loop controller architectures have been proposed in the past. In this paper we present a generic architecture and a compiler technique to significantly reduce the energy overhead related to execution of loop control instructions. The compiler technique not only maps the innermost loops but also maps the outer loops on to the loop controller architecture. Furthermore, we also reduce the number of division operations using induction variable analysis to improve energy efficiency. We show that by utilizing the proposed technique, it is possible to reduce the energy consumption of the branch \u2026",

The hardware accelerator has been mapped to an FPGA board and connected through PCIe to a typical processor. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme can achieve up to 14x speedup compared to a reference, single-core CPU solution.",

Although multi-tenancy has gained a lot of attention to optimize resource efficiency, current state-of-the-art resource orchestrators rely on typical metrics, such as CPU or memory utilization, for placing incoming workloads on the available pool of resources, thus, neglecting the interference effects from workload co-location. In this paper, we design an interference-aware cloud orchestrator, based on micro-architectural event monitoring. We integrate our solution with Kubernetes, one of the most widely used and commercially adopted cloud orchestration frameworks nowadays, and we show that we achieve higher performance, up to 32% compared to its default scheduler, for a variety of cloud representative workloads.",

The foregoing step includes the derivation of novel formulas for calculating the switching activity of basic gates. The latter step includes the development of an algorithm, which propagates the signal probabilities through the network and calculates the switching activity of any logic node. The proposed method provides accurate switching activity values performing their calculation in reduced time interval.

            "Abstract": "Future autonomous spacecraft rendezvous with uncooperative or unprepared objects will be enabled by vision-based navigation, which imposes great computational challenges. Targeting short duration missions in low Earth orbit, this paper develops high-performance avionics supporting custom computer vision algorithms of increased complexity for satellite pose tracking. At algorithmic level, we track 6D pose by rendering a depth image from an object mesh model and robustly matching edges detected in the depth and intensity images. At system level, we devise an architecture to exploit the structure of commercial system-on-chip FPGAs, i.e., Zynq7000, and the benefits of tightly coupling VHDL accelerators with CPU-based functions. At implementation level, we employ our custom HW/SW co-design methodology and an elaborate combination of digital circuit design techniques to optimize and map efficiently all \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Memory latency has always been a major issue in embedded systems that execute memory-intensive applications. This is even more true as the gap between processor and memory speed continues to grow. Hardware and software prefetching have been shown to be effective in tolerating the large memory latencies inherit in large off-chip memories; however, both types of prefetching have their shortcomings. Hardware schemes are more complex and require extra circuitry to compute data access strides, while software schemes generate prefetch instructions, which if not computed carefully may hamper performance. On the other hand, some applications domains (such as multimedia) have a uniform and known a priori memory access pattern, that if exploited, could yield significant application performance improvement. With this characteristic in mind, we present our findings on hiding memory latency using the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A heterogeneous interconnect architecture can be a useful approach for the design of 3-D FPGAs. A methodology to investigate heterogeneous interconnection schemes for 3-D FPGAs under different 3-D fabrication technologies is proposed. Application of the proposed methodology on benchmark circuits demonstrates an improvement in delay, power consumption, and total wire-length of approximately 41%, 32%, and 36%, respectively, as compared to 2-D FPGAs. These improvements are additional to reducing the number of interlayer connections. The fewer interlayer connections are traded off for a higher yield. An area model to evaluate this trade-off is presented. Results indicate that a heterogeneous 3-D FPGA requires 37% less area as compared to a homogeneous 3-D FPGA. Consequently, the heterogeneous FPGAs can exhibit a higher manufacturing yield. A design toolset is also developed to support \u2026",

Designers have now to explore a design space including both per-accelerator architectural parameters as well as inter-accelerator combinations, i.e. different design configurations among the allocated accelerators, as each accelerator instance has different computational requirements, according to different input data, while throughput and area constraints should be met as well. Under such a system scenario, virtual platform prototyping suffers from increased design time phases, since it requires an exponentially larger number of evaluations to succeed adequate coverage of the design space.

From an implementation point of view, since the division can be performed by any existing divider, the designer can choose the divider which best meets his specifications. Although the algorithm is presented for integer numbers, it can be easily generalized for fractions, since it is only a matter of representation.

NoC architectures are able to accommodate a large number of IP cores in the same chip implementing a set of complex applications.

In this paper, we present a systematic methodology for generating an energy efficient application-specific NoC architecture. The methodology framework consists of the following steps: 1) greedy application partitioning, 2) automatic topology generation and extensive exploration, and 3) an energy-aware router optimization so as to find the best architecture that meets applications requirements.

Nowadays large worldwide research centers, eg CERN, Fermilab etc. are continuously investing in resources and infrastructures for progressing knowledge in the fields of particle physics, thus requiring careful studies and planing for the upcoming upgrades of the synchrotrons and the design of future machines. Consequently, there is an emerging need for simulations that incorporate a collection of complex physics phenomena, produce extremely accurate predictions while keeping the computing resources and run-time to a minimum. A variety of simulator suites have been developed, however, they have been reported to lack in simulation speed, features and ease-of-use.

Novel features include: i) multi-objective explorations that allow trade-offs which designers highly need to rightly position their product in the huge search space, ii) a combination of design-time and run-time techniques to boost the cost-efficiency and performance, and iii) automated optimizations that are applied once to reduce design effort and can handle very complex code. These optimizations and automation support will result in reduced exploration design time by at least a factor of 2, decreased memory footprint and memory bandwidth requirements of 30%, and improved energy and power efficiency by a factor of 2.

In the design process of a system embedding concurrent on-line testing techniques, the degradation of TSC property can be fatal for further operation (i.e. space electronics, medical devices). An on-line testing architecture is offered that adjusts the input activity, when low-power management is activated.

            "Abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is the need to build resilient systems. Resilience is an especially difficult challenge in HPC, in which tightly coupled compute jobs typically execute across a large number of nodes for several hours or even days. Without effective provisions for resilience, in hardware and/or software, a single failure in one node or server typically causes a domino effect, resulting in the termination of the whole job. Such job termination normally results in no useful outcome, so the node hours that have already been expended on the job are wasted. Recently, the most common use of supercomputers and HPC systems are applications that solve large-scale real-world simulation problems [1, 2, 3]. Such applications, implemented as workflows or multi-scale systems are inherently fault-tolerant and have error-containment capabilities that eliminate the domino effects caused by failures. However, failure in a node executing a distributed thread leads to contained error recovery, which translates into decreased performance and throughput.System reliability is also an important limiter on the ability to scale to larger systems. This is because increasing the number of nodes causes the overheads of error containment and error recovery to increase exponentially. Reliability is therefore an important requirement and challenge for exascale, as recognized by the HPC strategic research agendas of the European Technology Platform for High Performance Computing (ETP4HPC)[4, 5, 6], Eurolab4HPC [7], the US Department of Energy [8, 9, 10, 11] and the US National laboratories [12, 13].",

The proposed circuits are static and operate in voltage-mode. Moreover, there is no current flow in steady states, and thus, no static power dissipation. Although the comparison in transistor count shows that the proposed quaternary circuits are larger than two respective binary ones, benefits in parallel addition arise from the use of multiple-valued logic. Firstly, the ripple-carry additions are faster because the number of carries is half compared to binary ones and the propagation delay from the input carry through the output carry is relatively small. Secondly, the carry-lookahead scheme exhibits less complexity, which leads to overall reduction in transistor count for addition with large number of bits.",

We create multiple, soft-macro sensors for each distinct resource under evaluation, and we deploy them across the FPGA fabric to measure intra-die variation, as well as across multiple FPGAs to measure inter-die variation. The derived results are used to create device-signature variability maps characterizing the distribution of variability across the die. Our study includes decoupling of variability to systematic and stochastic parts, exploration of variability under various voltage and temperature conditions and correlation analysis between the variability maps of the different resources. Furthermore, we scrutinize the impact of variability on the performance of actual test circuits and correlate the retrieved results with the sensor-based maps.

Future missions, such as the Mars Sample Return or the Lunar Polar Sample Return, already demand longer and faster traversals compared to past missions to maximize their scientific return and reduce operational costs and risks. Autonomous navigation is usually based on computer vision due to the passive mode of operation, simple hardware, small form factor and low power consumption of camera sensors. Computer vision nevertheless entails a rather high computational burden which puts a strain on the limited computational resources available onboard these rovers. This paper describes SPARTAN, an optimized, hardware embedded vision system for autonomous navigation of planetary rovers that meets the high demands of future missions requiring large and fast traversals.",

In this work, we propose a fully softwaresupported exploration methodology capable of defining pattern-based, alternative, interconnection topologies for application-specific multi-layered 3D NoC architectures. The focus of our exploration is on the number of vertical interconnects (or through silicon vias) connecting grids of different layers, considering the mesh and torus architectures. Existing 3D NoCs assume that every router of a grid can communicate directly with the neighboring routers of the same grid and with the ones of the adjacent layers. We show that this full vertical connectivity is not needed. The exploration methodology is able to evaluate pattern-based 3D topologies and propose the ones that meet the design constraints best. We evaluate the exploration employing and extending the Worm Sim NoC simulator and feeding it with various types of traffic. In this way, we achieve a decrease in the number 3D routers and in the number of vertical vias, resulting in a decrease in the area occupied by the switch blocks, reducing energy dissipation and paying a negligible penalty in the latency of the 3D NoC.",

This technique has been implemented on a prototype tool, which was tested successfully using nine real-life applications of industrial relevance.

The wide distribution of defect time scales, accounts for both fast (Random Telegraph Noise - RTN) and near-permanent (Bias Temperature Instability - BTI) defects.

The image split into windows offers reduction of the memory requirements and feasibility of a suitable VLSI implementation of the most time consuming part of the technique, i.e. the SONNC.

We implement the new state-estimator code generation method as a backend for a physics specification language and we apply the backend to generate complete C code implementations of state estimators for both linear systems (Kalman filters) and non-linear systems (extended Kalman filters). The state estimator code generation from physics specification is completely automated and requires no manual intervention. The generated filters can incorporate an Automatic Differentiation technique which combines function evaluation and differentiation in a single process. Using the description of physical system of a range of complexities, we generate extended Kalman filters, which we evaluate in terms of prediction accuracy using simulation traces. The results show that our automatically-generated sensor fusion and state estimation implementations provide state estimation within the same error bound as the human-written hand-optimized counterparts. We additionally quantify the code size and dynamic instruction count requirements of the generated state estimator implementations on the RISC-V architecture. The results show that our synthesized state estimation implementation employing Automatic Differentiation leads to an average improvement in the dynamic instruction count of the generated Kalman filter of 7%-16% compared to the standard differentiation technique.

Although they are a powerful experimentation tool, they are also time-consuming and, often, restrictive. Computational neuroscience attempts to solve this by using biologically-plausible and biophysically-meaningful neuron models, most prominent among which are the conductance-based models. Their computational complexity calls for accelerator-based computing to mount large-scale or real-time neuroscientific experiments. In this paper, we analyze and draw conclusions on the class of conductance models by using a representative modeling application of the inferior olive (InfOli), an important part of the olivocerebellar brain circuit. We conduct an extensive profiling session to identify the computational and data-transfer requirements of the application under various realistic use cases. The application is, then \u2026",

The delay of all the sensors is calibrated to match the worst critical path delay of the target application. In that respect, the monitoring of the sensor network enables the indirect assessment of the functional integrity of the target application. The distributed placement of the sensors provides the desired sensitivity with appropriate granularity across the fabric and allows us to consider the worst-case scenario.

A novel systematic design methodology for implementing a DDFS architecture with reduced memory size is introduced.

Stereo vision is a key enabling technology in this regard, as it can passively reconstruct in three dimensions the surroundings of a rover and facilitate the selection of science targets and the planning of safe routes. Nonetheless, accurate dense stereo algorithms are computationally demanding. When executed on the low-performance, radiation-hardened CPUs typically installed on rovers, slow stereo processing severely limits the driving speed and hence the science that can be conducted in situ. Aiming to decrease execution time while increasing the accuracy of stereo vision embedded in future rovers, this article proposes HW/SW co-design and acceleration on resource-constrained, space-grade FPGAs.

In this paper we propose a software-supported framework for architecture-level exploration and system prototyping on 3-D ICs.

This trend in conjunction to the available technologies for providing advanced sensing, measurement, process control, and communication lead towards the new field of Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Due to superior performance of these systems it is expected to play a major role in the design and development of future engineering platforms with new capabilities that far exceed today\u2019s levels of autonomy, functionality and usability. Although CPS exhibits remarkable characteristics, their design and implementation is a challenging issue, as numerous (heterogeneous) components and services have to be appropriately orchestrated together. The problem of designing efficient decision making mechanisms becomes far more challenging in case the target system has to meet also real-time constraints. Throughout this manuscript, we introduce a novel framework to support the efficient, yet flexible, rapid prototyping of decision-making mechanisms for CPSs. Furthermore, a new toolbox that automates the tasks of our framework was also developed as an open-source software. For evaluation purposes, the proposed solution was applied to a building use case in order to support optimum configuration of smart thermostats.

More specifically, optimized solutions for the selection of the two or three smallest elements out of a given set of numbers are greatly needed for the design of high-speed Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) decoders, as this min-search can be the bottleneck. This paper aims to tackle current limitations by proposing a novel algorithm for solving this problem, where the searching is based on scanning from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) of each input data. A design mapped to reconfigurable logic and a software tool for the automatic generation of synthesizable VHDL codes, implementing such low-latency components are presented as well.

Embedded systems tend to include complex memory organizations but most techniques for dynamic memory management do not deal with the placement of data objects in physical memory modules. Additionally, the performance of hardware-controlled cache memories may be severely hindered when used with linked data structures. We therefore present a methodology to map dynamic data on the multilevel memory subsystem of embedded systems, taking advantage of any available memories (e.g., on-chip SRAMs) and avoiding interference with the cache memories. The resulting data placement uses an exclusive memory model and is compatible with existing techniques for managing static data.

Therefore, run-time information has to be used in order to produce an efficient design. This introduces new challenges, especially for embedded system designers using a Direct Memory Access (DMA) module, who have to know in advance the memory transfer behaviour of the whole system, in order to design and program their DMA efficiently.

Conversely, source code transformations are extensively performed by developers in order to improve the runtime quality of applications, in terms of performance and energy efficiency. These transformations may indirectly affect software security, since they may lead to the introduction of new security issues. In this work, we empirically examine the impact of source code-level energy/performance optimizations on software security and vice versa. The preliminary results of the empirical study suggest that the energy-related transformations may indirectly affect software security, whereas the incremental addition of security mechanisms may lead to an important increase in the energy consumption of software applications.",

Furthermore, thermal profiling is a critical challenge for supporting efficient power management, especially to multi-processor system-on-chips (MPSoCs). This problem becomes even more important if we take into account the computational complexity of existing thermal profiling and analysis approaches. Among others this limitation imposes that thermal analysis is performed solely at design time. However, such a static exploration does not take into account constraints posed during application execution that lead to temperature variations. Hence, new algorithms and software tools able to provide accurate yet fast thermal analysis are upmost required. In this paper, we introduce a new software supported methodology for performing thermal analysis at run-time with different levels of granularity. Additional performance improvement is feasible by applying thermal analysis only to device regions with blocks that operate under high power densities. For demonstration purposes we show how this methodology is applied to an Altera Stratix-based FPGA device. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed methodology, since the average execution time ranges between 41% and 78%, as compared to state of the art relevant solution, without any accuracy degradation at the derived thermal profile.",

Consequently, the current trend in the design of medical systems is to incorporate an ever-increasing number of sensors in the complete system architecture. Manufacturing and incorporating reliable and accurate sensors in a medical system is of great importance, and at the same time, the interpretation of sensor data and knowledge extraction is of the same criticality. In wearable systems, sensor data are combined and correlated to produce a human interpretable outcome. We refer to this procedure as data fusion being executed in a computational machine by a data fusion engine.

This option becomes available using 3D stacking technologies. Our aim is to evaluate the power efficiency of a wider memory interface at the level of the complete system, including the memory, the interface circuitry itself and the processing elements. We want to understand whether this additional bandwidth can be efficiently utilized by the processing elements and enable an overall lower power and higher throughput solution compared to state-of-the-art system implementations.",

The demand for increased clock frequencies and logic density (smaller area footprint) makes the problem even more important. Three-dimensional (3D) architectures are able to alleviate this problem by accommodating a number of functional layers, each of which might be fabricated in different technology. However, the benefits of such integration technology have not been sufficiently explored yet. In this paper, we propose a software-supported methodology for exploring and evaluating alternative interconnection schemes for 3D FPGAs. In order to support the proposed methodology, three new CAD tools were developed (part of the 3D MEANDER Design Framework). During our exploration, we study the impact of vertical interconnection between functional layers in a number of design parameters. More specifically, the average gains in operation frequency, power consumption, and wirelength are 35%, 32%, and 13%, respectively, compared to existing 2D FPGAs with identical logic resources. Also, we achieve higher utilization ratio for the vertical interconnections compared to existing approaches by 8% for designing 3D FPGAs, leading to cheaper and more reliable devices.",

Also, the parameters that affect significantly the performance and power are the configurable logic blocks (CLBs) and the interconnection components. A novel approach for efficient implementation of applications onto reconfigurable architectures is introduced. The main goal of this technique is to spread out the power consumption across the whole device, as well as to minimize it, achieving a more uniform power consumption map across the whole FPGA. This approach is based on finding the optimal CLB placement according to resource utilization map. The proposed methodology can be applied for mapping applications with an efficient power management strategy.

More specifically, the adder (conventional, CMOS or adiabatic) was simulated by PowerMill tool for power dissipation, latency and energy efficiency. In addition, a first estimation of area was done by the transistor count. Both, the conventional and adiabatic adders were simulated at 3.3V and 5V, for a broad range of frequencies, from 5MHz to 50MHz.

To address these issues, new FEC codes, called third-generation codes, have been proposed. A majority of these codes are based on soft-decision decoders and can provide higher coding gain as compared with their predecessors.

Furthermore, such emerging applications require fast time-to-market and reduced development times. So to address the large processing requirements of these applications, novel architectures are required in the domain of high-performance and energy-efficient processors. Relying on Moore\u2019s law, CPU technologies have scaled in recent years through packing an increasing number of transistors on chip, leading to higher performance. However, on-chip clock frequencies were unable to follow this upward trend due to strict power-budget constraints. Thus, a few years ago a paradigm shift to multicore processors was adopted as an alternative solution for overcoming the problem. With multicore processors, we could increase server performance without increasing their clock frequency. Unfortunately, this solution was also found not to scale well in the longer term. The performance gains achieved by adding more cores inside a CPU come at the cost of various, rapidly scaling complexities: inter-core communication, memory coherency and, most importantly, power consumption [1]. In the early technology nodes, going from one node to the next allowed for a nearly doubling of the transistor frequency, and, by reducing the voltage, power density remained nearly constant. With the end of Dennard\u2019s scaling, going from one node to the next still increases the density of transistors, but their maximum frequency is roughly the same and the voltage does not \u2026",

In particular, we explore 4 different demodulation algorithms, we employ both floating- and fixed-point arithmetic, and we insert approximations in the arithmetic units. In terms of accuracy of our most prominent implementations, i.e., for 64-QAM, our designs deliver BER values ranging from 10 \u22121  to 10 \u22124  for SNR 0\u221214dB.

Reprogrammability, although its their key feature, it is used almost exclusively on design time due to the constrains imposed by the modern CAD tools that require even days to run and tens of GB of RAM. In order to effectively utilize FPGAs on run time we propose a novel methodology and the supporting toolflow that enable efficient mapping of multiple applications onto heterogeneous FPGAs. With the use of a floorplanning step, memory optimizations and custom memory allocators, we alleviate the constrains imposed by CAD tools, and provide a proof of concept that application mapping onto FPGAs can be done on run time.

Increased power density results in higher onchip temperature, which creates numerous problems tightly firmed to reliability degradation. Since typical low-power design has been proved inefficient to tackle the temperature increment by itself, device architects are facing the challenge of developing new methodologies to guarantee timing, power, and thermal integrity of the chip. In this paper, we propose a thermal-aware exploration framework targeting temperature hotspots elimination through the efficient exploration of multiple microarchitecture selections over the temperature-area trade-off curve. By carefully planning at design time the resources of the initial microarchitecture that should be replicated, the proposed methodology optimizes the system\u2019s thermal profile and attens on-chip temperature under various design constraints. The introduced framework does not impose any architectural or compiler modification, whereas it is orthogonal to any other thermal-aware methodology. For evaluation purposes, we employ the software-defined radio executed onto a thermal-aware instance of LEON3 processor. Based on experimental results, we found that our methodology leads to an architecture that exhibits temperature reduction of 17 Kelvin degrees, which leads to improvement against aging phenomena about 14%, with a controllable overhead in silicon area about 15%, compared to the initial LEON3 instance.",

The CQ technique is based on image split into sub-images and the use of Kohonen self-organised neural network classifiers (SONNC). Initially, the dominant colours of each sub-image are extracted through SONNCs and then are used for the quantisation of the colours of the entire image. The proposed CQ technique can use both colour components and spatial features, achieving better approximation of the final image to the spatial characteristics of the original one. In addition, for the estimation of the proper number of dominant image colours, a new algorithm based on the projection of the image colours into the first two principal components is proposed. The image split into sub-images offers reduction of the on-chip memory requirements and is suitable for embedded system (or system-on-chip \u2026",

We observe that among the diverse GPU workloads, there exists a significant class of kernels that fail to maintain a sufficient number of active warps to hide the latency of memory operations, and thus suffer from frequent stalling. We argue that the dominant Thread-Level Parallelism model is not enough to efficiently accommodate the variability of modern GPU applications.

Although the comparison in transistor count shows that the proposed quaternary circuits are larger than two respective binary ones, benefits in parallel addition arise from the use of multiple-valued logic. Firstly, the ripple-carry additions are faster because the number of carries are half compared to binary ones and the delay from the input carry through the output carry is relatively small. Secondly, the carry-lookahead scheme exhibits less complexity, which leads to overall reduction in transistor count for addition with a large number of bits.",

A Mars rover should be highly autonomous because communication between the rover and the terrestrial operation center is difficult, and because the vehicle should spend as much of its traverse time as possible moving. Autonomous behavior of the rover implies that the vision system provides both a wide view to enable navigation and three\u2010dimensional (3D) reconstruction, and at the same time a close\u2010up view ensuring safety and providing reliable odometry data. The European Space Agency funded project \u201cSPAring Robotics Technologies for Autonomous Navigation\u201d (SPARTAN) aimed to develop an efficient vision system to cover all such aspects of autonomous exploratory rovers.

The FPGA platforms provide very attractive solutions in such applications, because they support highly parallel processing with low power consumption. In this paper we present an approach to increase productivity when developing real-time image processing algorithms on SoC FPGA devices. Our approach is centered around the fast communication of the HW and SW components and the use of an open-source operating system hosted on the existing embedded processor. Based on this approach we decrease time-to-market while at the same time we avoid hindering the real-time operation of the system. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed system, as a proof of concept, we use the well known Harris detection algorithm \u2026",

Moreover, network-on-chip (NoC) has been proposed as new paradigm for SoC interconnection. For implementing complex applications on NoC platforms, embedded systems require high abstraction level optimizations. To achieve such optimizations, a flexible NoC simulator is needed that provides the essential evaluation metrics. In this paper, we present a new tool based on the Nostrum NoC simulator. We show that it is possible with the evaluation metrics obtained by this simulator to perform optimizations in dynamic network and multimedia applications at the system level. Based on the system level transformations and the new tool we developed, we design application-specific NoC platforms",

This paper presents a methodology for the design of optimized reconfigurable PV modules, balancing losses under uniform conditions and gain under partial shading. First, feasible reconfigurable module instantiations are selected given some design constraints. Then, the search space is further reduced by taking into account the typical operating conditions of the module. Finally, the best module layouts are chosen based on performance consideration.

The high modelling detail goes hand in hand with the need for high model reproducibility, reusability and transparency.

In this work, we present EDEN (Extensible Dynamics Engine for Networks), a new general-purpose, NeuroML-based neural simulator that achieves both high model flexibility and high computational performance, through an innovative model-analysis and code-generation technique. The simulator runs NeuroML v2 models directly, eliminating the need for users to learn yet another simulator-specific, model-specification language. EDEN's functional correctness and computational performance were assessed through NeuroML models available on the NeuroML-DB and Open Source Brain model repositories. In qualitative experiments, the results produced by EDEN were verified against the established NEURON simulator, for a wide range of models. At the same time, computational-performance benchmarks reveal that EDEN runs up to 2 orders-of-magnitude faster than NEURON on a typical desktop computer, and does so without additional effort from the user. Finally, and without added user effort, EDEN has been built from scratch to scale seamlessly over multiple CPUs and across computer clusters, when available.",

In the near future, portable consumer devices must run multimedia and wireless network applications that require an enormous computational performance (1-40GOP S) at a low energy consumption (0.1-2W). In these multimedia and wireless network applications, the dynamic memory subsystem is currently one of the main sources of power consumption and its inattentive management can severely affect the performance and power consumption of the whole system. Within this context, the construction and system-level power evaluation of custom dynamic memory managers is one of the most important and difficult parts for an efficient mapping of such dynamic applications on low-power and high-speed embedded systems. Moreover, they are subjected to design-time constraints due to market competition. As a result, current design technologies fall behind these requirements and consistent high-level design methodologies able to handle such complexity and enabling a short time-to-market are in great need. In this paper, we present a new system-level approach to model complex custom dynamic memory managers integrating a detailed power profiling method. This approach enables the developer to obtain power consumption estimates, memory usage and memory access values to refine the dynamic memory management of the system in a very early stage of the design flow and to explore the large search space of dynamic memory manager implementations without a time-consuming programming effort.",

            "Abstract": "Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) is a major concern for the reliability of decameter to nanometer devices. Older modeling approaches fail to capture time-dependent device variability or maintain a crude view of the device's stress. Previously, a two-state atomistic model has been introduced, which is based on gate stack defect kinetics. Its complexity has been preventing seamless integration in simulations of large device inventories over typical system lifetimes. In this paper, we present an approach that alleviates this complexity. We introduce a novel signal representation for the gate stress. Using this format, atomistic BTI simulations require less model iterations while exhibiting minimum accuracy degradation. We also enable full temperature and voltage supply dependency since these attributes are far from constant in modern integrated systems. The proposed simulation methodology retains both the atomistic \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Modern applications are becoming more complex and dynamic and try to efficiently utilize the amount of available resources on the computing platforms. Efficient memory utilization is a key challenge for application developers, especially since memory is a scarce resource and often becomes systems bottleneck. Thus, the developers can resort to dynamic memory management, i.e., dynamic memory allocation and de-allocation, to efficiently utilize the memory resources. A high-performance adaptive memory allocator is presented in this paper. A memory allocator helps applications to manage more efficiently the memory space that operating systems bestow to them. In our approach, we tune the memory allocator at runtime by predicting the amount of memory to be requested.

The demand for even higher clock frequencies makes this problem even more important. Three-dimensional (3-D) chip stacking is touted as the silver bullet technology that can keep Moores momentum and fuel the next wave of consumer electronics products. However, the benefits of such an integration technology have not been sufficiently explored yet. In this paper, we introduce a novel partitioning scheme based on genetic algorithm targeting 3-D FPGA platforms. Experimental results prove the efficiency of our solution for a wide range of applications, since we achieve to perform application mapping onto devices consisted of fewer TSVs (on average 7.4% fewer TSVs) as compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, we achieve significant smaller total wirelength (on average 12.8%) for comparable operation frequency which leads to mentionable power/energy savings.",

In this work, we present a methodology for the customization of streaming aggregation implemented in modern low power embedded devices. The methodology is based on design space exploration and provides a set of customized implementations that can be used by developers to perform trade-offs between throughput, latency, memory and energy consumption.

Since the power consumption is a critical challenge for designing Three Dimensional (3D) Integrated Circuits (ICs), a novel temperature-aware placement and routing (P&R) algorithm targeting to 3D FPGAs, is introduced. The proposed algorithm achieves to redistribute the switched capacitance over the hardware resources in a rather \u201cbalanced\u201d profile, reducing the maximum value, as well as the total number of power/temperature hotspots. For evaluation purposes, the proposed approach is realized as part of an existing tool, named 3DPRO. Comparing to alternative solutions, we achieve to reduce the percentage of silicon area that operates under high power by 68%, while we also lead to average energy savings about 6%, with negligible penalty in application\u2019s delay.",

However, approximate computing architectures exacerbate the design complexity due to the diversity of inexact techniques and their impact on final circuit implementations. In this brief, we introduce approximate accelerator synthesis, which enables the design of power-optimized inexact circuits under error bound constraints, by leveraging the incorporation of diverse multi-level approximate techniques. We show the high efficiency of adopting multi-level approximation techniques and present a systematic approach for integrating multi-level approximation in hardware accelerator synthesis under error bound and voltage island constraints.",

This paper presents a suite of high performance hardware accelerators for financial applications used in risk valuation (Black & Scholes, Black-76 and Binomial). The accelerators are developed in fixed point using HDL (VHDL) and in floating point using HLS languages. High Level Synthesis (HLS) allows fast implementation of hardware accelerators from the original legacy codes. The HLS hardware accelerators have been mapped onto a PCIe FPGA (ADM-KU3) board, through the Xilinx SDAccel framework and a thorough comparison in terms of resources, performance and accuracy has been performed. The performance evaluation shows that HLS can achieve higher accuracy due to the floating point, but requires up to 20% higher \u2026",

The basic characteristic of these applications are typically large computational requirements and intensive data transfer and storage needs. As a result, the primary platform for such applications is Multiprocessor Systemson-Chip (MPSoCs). These MPSoCs can deliver the computational power required by novel applications. Modern MPSoCs contain a complex memory hierarchy that allows applications to meet their data transfer and storage requirements.

The goal of the current paper is to absorb this variability using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). A closed-loop implementation is proposed, which configures the clock frequency based on observed metrics that encapsulate performance variability due to RAS mechanisms.

In such a case, the design space size explodes. Thus, existing design space exploration (DSE) techniques give poor-quality solutions, as the design space cannot be adequately covered in a fair time.

The paper describes a HW/SW co-design scheme using FPGAs to speed-up the SURF algorithm when executed on a low computational power CPU. It performs algorithmic analysis and restructures the SURF steps leading to efficient hardware implementation, while at the same time it exploits the advantages of the CPU. The HW architecture is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA achieving real-time performance with low hardware cost and highly accurate results.",

For that purpose, the largest part of this report covers the concept of system scenarios, which is the main control principle that will be used for performance variability mitigation. Initially, examples are provided for key methodology terms. Excerpts of system operation (represented by Run Time Situations\u2013RTSs) are to be clustered into representative states of system operation (represented by Scenarios), so that the degrees of performance variability are fully covered. Throughout this report, the predominant control principle assumed is that of system scenarios. Throughout the illustration of such terms, examples are provided drawn primarily from the Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) degradation mechanism. This constitutes a representative example at the silicon device level, which has direct implications for the yield and functionality of greater digital systems. Furthermore, examples are also drawn from other domains such as cloud computing or wireless radios. There is limited reference to dynamic scenarios, which are more complicated and are addressed in future HARPA deliverables (D2. 6).Assuming that a system scenario inventory is present, the HARPA RTE must be able to detect and switch between system scenarios, while signaling the platform knob accordingly to obtain optimal platform configurations. The HARPA RTE is to interact with platform monitors, so that it can detect when a switch between scenarios should materialize. In view of this dynamism, we reflect on the requirements for an efficiently \u2026",

Reconfigurable hardware exploits a huge degree of parallelism and provides flexibility at an affordable energy budget, thus becoming a competitive alternative for high performance Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications, previously dominated by general purpose processing cores and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). This paper describes the design and evaluation of a novel concept for adaptive signal processing on reconfigurable hardware by using an adaptive reverberation algorithm targeting real time streams. Novel solutions were adopted in several critical parts of the signal processing chain in order to achieve a high level of accuracy under real time constraints.

To enforce this trend, designers implementing applications on programmable platforms have to be provided with reliable and in-depth data and instruction analysis that will allow for the early selection of the most appropriate application for a given set of specifications. To address this need, we introduce a new methodology for early and accurate estimation of the number of instructions required for the execution of an application, together with the number of data memory transfers on a programmable processor. The high-level estimation is achieved by a series of mathematical formulas; these describe not only the arithmetic operations of an application, but also its control and \u2026",

We fill this gap, by presenting a technique which achieves parallelization in the memory accesses through four loop transformations. Our estimations from two real-life applications from the multimedia and telecom domain, reveal that using our technique, we can either increase the performance (up to 35%) or lower the energy consumption (up to 20%) for the same cost.",

We show that except the typically expected peak power budget, on-chip memory resources form a severe under-utilization factor in MA platforms, leading up to 75 percent of dark silicon. Recognizing that static memory allocation-the de-facto mechanism supported by modern design techniques and synthesis tools-forms the main source of memory-induced Dark Silicon, we introduce a novel framework that extends conventional high level synthesis (HLS) with dynamic memory management (DMM) features, enabling accelerators to dynamically adapt their allocated memory to the runtime memory requirements, thus \u2026",

Large companies that process big data on modern data centers adopt this technique combined with approximations on algorithm level in order to compute critical workloads every second.

A modified Boolean function, which describes the logic behavior of a signal at any time instance, including time parameter is introduced. Moreover, a mathematical model based on Markov stochastic processes, which describes the temporal and spatial correlation in terms of the associated zero delay based parameters is presented. Based on the mathematical model and considering the modified Boolean function, a new algorithm to evaluate the switching activity at specific time instances using Ordering Binary Decision Diagrams (OBBDs) is also presented.

Here, the idea of exploiting events to trigger the shut-down of hardware resources is applied at the behavioral-level of a DECT digital receiver design. Power management involves a trade-off between the power savings arising from the power-down (or shut-down) parts of the system and the power increase due to the additional logic for the generation of the shutdown signals. For that purpose, taking into account the digital receiver's characteristics, a behavioral-level power management technique is introduced. The efficiency of the proposed technique is proven by its application on an industrial DECT receiver, where a power saving of 50% in terms of the dynamic power consumption is achieved.",

In this paper we develop a platform for the efficient deployment and acceleration of Caffe framework on embedded systems that are based on the Zynq SoC. The most computational intensive part of image classification is the processing of the convolution layers of the deep learning algorithms and more specifically the GEMM (general matrix multiplication) function calls.

Transistor scaling has translated into remarkable gains in operating frequency and reduction in power consumption. However, increased complexity from the device to architecture levels impose several new challenges, including a decrease in dependability/reliability due to physical failures. Reconfigurable platforms are highly susceptible to scaling related complexity, typically resulting in higher power consumption as compared to application-specific integrated circuits. The concern becomes far more important in the 3-D integrated circuit (IC) domain as vertically stacked blocks exhibit increased thermal resistance to the heat sink.

In the current report, we explore the research domain of performance variability, addressing equally parametric and functional reliability concerns.Initially, we introduce basic concepts related to the field. We elaborate on the term of \u201cperformance variability\u201d and show its connotations for both the Embedded Computing (EC) and High Performance Computing (HPC) alike. Then, we reflect on the interplay between functional (related to binary correctness) and parametric (related to parametric performance targets) reliability violations. Through this discussion, we demonstrate how both types of violations are correlated and how each type may propagate to the other under certain performance variability conditions. Furthermore, we perform a brief presentation of state-of-the-art performance dependability metrics, while citing representative prior art samples. In any case, the intention of this project is to remain aligned with industry standard reliability metrics, thus enabling direct comparison of the technical contributions with prior art.",

RAS mechanisms however, come with the cost of extra clock cycles. In addition, a wide variety of dynamic workloads and different input conditions often constitute preemptive dependability techniques hard to implement. To this end, we focus on a realistic case study of a closed-loop controller that mitigates performance variation with a reactive response. This concept has been discussed but was only illustrated on small benchmarks. In particular, the extension of the approach to manage performance of dynamic workloads on a target platform has not been shown earlier. We compare our scheme against the version of a Linux CPU frequency governor in terms of timing response and energy consumption. Finally, we move forward and suggest a new flavor of our \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A novel methodology for designing interconnection architectures, targeting to general-purpose FPGAs, is introduced. The design parameters for this architecture are extracted after the implementation and profiling numerous applications on Virtex FPGAs. Among the design parameters, we study the connectivity demand for each (xy) point of the interconnection network. The derived data are appropriately manipulated to build a topology consisting of different Switch Boxes (SB), which are assigned over the FPGA architecture taking into account the connectivity requirements for each part of the device. The selected architecture resulted from the specific Pareto optimal points which tradeoffs the maximum operation frequency versus the energy consumption. The methodology is software supported by three new CAD tools, part of the MEANDER Framework. Using numerous applications, extensive comparison study in terms of several design parameters proves the efficiency of the proposed interconnection compared to Virtex-style FPGAs. More specifically, we achieve an average increase in operation frequency by 31%, a reduction in leakage power and energy consumption by 8% and 22%, respectively.",

In this work, we present a distributed runtime resource management framework for many-core systems utilizing a network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure.

In addition, moving towards kilo-core processor architectures, centralized resource management approaches will most probably form a severe performance bottleneck, thus the study of Distributed Run-Time Resource Management (DRTRM) schemes is now gaining a lot of attention. In this paper, we propose a job-arrival aware DRTRM framework for applications with malleable characteristics, implemented on top of the Intel Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC) many-core platform.

The considered target architecture consists of, in the general case, multiple processor cores each of which has its own instruction memory and data memory hierarchy. Before coping with data-reuse exploration problem, we have to map a given multimedia application on the multiprocessor environment. For that purpose, the multimedia application is partitioned by employing LSGP partitioning scheme. The proposed methodology is illustrated through a widely-used algorithmic kernel named full search motion estimation. The plethora of experimental results show that there exist close relation among the number of processor cores, and the certain data-reuse transformation from one hand, the power, the area and the performance from the other hand. Significant improvements in terms of data memory power consumption and performance. Furthermore, it is proved that the designer for the total power budget should take into account not only the power consumption related with the data memory but also with the instruction memory.",

First, any word-level parallelism is exploited by using loop transformation techniques, which include a uniformization method, if required, and a decomposition of the index space into disjoint sets, which may be executed in parallel. Second, the architecture of the processing element is specified in detail by analyzing its operation at the bit level. Processors using any arithmetic system may be described. The overall design methodology is illustrated by systematically deriving a processor array for the one-dimensional (1-D) convolution algorithm.

Voltage overscaling (VOS) forms a very promising technique to generate approximate circuits, and its application in cooperation to other approximate techniques is proven to lead to more efficient solutions.

In this brief, we propose VOSsim, a framework that extends state-of-the-art industry strength tools, to enable fast and accurate simulations of voltage overscaled circuits. We extensively evaluate VOSsim showing that it attains 99.2% output and 98.4% power accuracy, with an average speedup of 32\u00d7 in simulation time compared to high-precision SPICE simulations, i.e., the only available solution today for VOS-aware simulation.",

For this reason, it is necessary to extensively profile them with representative samples of the actual input data. An important aspect of this profiling is done at the dynamic data type level, which actually steers the designers choice of implementation of these data types. The behaviour of the applications is then characterized, through an analysis phase, as a collection of software metadata that can be used to optimize the system as a whole.

The Beam Longitudinal Dynamics (BLonD) simulator suite incorporates the most detailed and complex physics phenomena in the field of longitudinal beam dynamics, required for providing extremely accurate predictions. These predictions are invaluable to the operation of existing accelerators, upcoming upgrades, and future studies. To undertake this agenda, and enable for the first time scale-out beam longitudinal dynamics simulations, we implement Hybrid-BLond, a distributed version of BLonD, that efficiently combines horizontal and vertical scaling. We propose a series of techniques that minimize the inter-node communication overhead and improve scalability. Firstly, we exploit \u2026",

This imposes that the development of distinct components cannot be though as affordable for System-on-Chip platforms, whereas a more holistic approach is necessary for deriving optimal solutions. At the same time, the requirement for integrating more functionality in a smaller form factor, or the integration into single chip different technologies (e.g. memory, logic and sensors) pushes traditional semiconductor technology scaling to its limits. Three-dimensional (3-D) chip stacking is touted as the silver bullet technology that can keep Moore's momentum and fuel the next wave of consumer electronic products.

On one hand, dissipating and reducing the increasing power density in modern high performance VLSI cores has become a typical design constraint; on the other hand, a wide spectrum of portable appliances demands for lower power consumptions in order to save battery life. All of these power-derived constraints come together with the higher performance demands that call for aggressive timing optimisation techniques.In this scenario, the design and verification of current VLSI circuits and systems heavily relies on power and timing estimation techniques commonly implemented in CAD tools through the use of behavioural models. The development of these models and tools has become a major issue in the last decade, together with the improvement of low-power and high-performance design methods.",

They are both situated at the operation/instruction concurrency level in the unified design flow of chapter 2.

For demonstration purposes we apply the proposed framework for the 3D physical design of an embedded processor. Experimental results shown that 3D integration can alleviate the constraints posed by increased wire-length, such as power consumption, by about 20% compared to the 2D implementation.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we present a design methodology and associated tool chain for efficient design of complex MPSoC architectures implemented using 3D-Stacked Integrated Circuits (3D-SIC). The proposed framework is based on a three step methodology that combines relatively accurate high-level, and two more accurate low-level prototyping tools. The high-level exploration tool, Nessie, developped at the ULB, allows designers to quickly simulate several system architecture and application scenarios. Using Nessie, the designer can easily explore many different system level options before deciding on the design space points he would like to explore in more details. In this paper, the high-level estimations are subsequently validated using an existing C++, transaction-level, 3D-SIC aware NoC simulator. Then, floorplaning and global routing of the system are performed using a novel tool for 3D physical prototyping \u2026",

Selecting the right algorithm, the reducing of power consumption can be an order of magnitude.

In this section, we explore power optimization and estimation techniques in the algorithm/behavioural level.",

Motivated by the fact that higher quality design solutions are delivered when a larger number of parameters are explored, we study an augmented instance of the design space considering the combined impact of loop-unrolling, operation chaining and resource allocation onto the final datapath. We propose an iterative design space partitioning exploration strategy based on the synergy of an exhaustive traversal together with an introduced heuristic one. The introduced heuristic is based on a gradient-based pruning technique which efficiently evaluates large portions of the solution space in a quick manner. We show that the proposed exploration approach delivers high quality results, with considerable reductions of the exploration\u2019s runtime in respect to the fully exhaustive approach.",

The ECG analysis flow is complex, relies on machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines classifier and in an effort to be executed in real-time Hardware acceleration is required. In this paper we focus on utilizing High Level Synthesis capabilities to produce efficient SVM hardware accelerators, targeting ECG analysis. Our case study is arrhythmia detection using MIT-BIH ECG signal medical database. We show that as a first step, the original code under acceleration can be re-structured in order to create instances which are efficiently transformed into a HW accelerator. As a second step, an exploration is performed on the transformed code in order to determine which HLS directives produce the best outcome in terms of various performance and resources utilization metrics \u2026",

Design of reliable applications on such unreliable architectures requires techniques able to provide a balance between the desired fault masking and the associated performance and power degradation. Starting from a well established solution for reliability improvement in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) domain, we discuss a software-supported methodology that removes redundancy as much as possible from the design without affecting it's efficiency in terms of fault masking. Based on experimental results, our proposed methodology achieves comparable fault masking with commercial solutions, but in reasonable lower mitigation cost.",

            "Abstract": "Real-time applications, hard or soft, are raising the challenge of unpredictability. This is an extremely difficult problem in the context of modern, dynamic, multiprocessor platforms which, while providing potentially high performance, make the task of timing prediction extremely difficult. Also, with the growing software content in embedded systems and the diffusion of highly programmable and re-configurable platforms, software is given an unprecedented degree of control on resource utilization. Existing approaches that are looking into Runtime Resource Management (RTRM) still require big design-time efforts, where profiling information is gathered and analyzed in order to construct a runtime scheduler that can be lightweight. There is a trade-off to be made between design-time and runtime efforts. In this paper we present a framework for RTRM on many-core architectures. This RTRM will offer an optimal resource partitioning, an adaptive dynamic data management and an adaptive runtime scheduling of the different application tasks and of the accesses to the data. Furthermore, the 2PARMA RTRM takes into account: i) the requirements/specifications of many-core architectures, applications and design techniques; ii) OS support for resource management and iii) a design space exploration phase.",

The integration of multiple features on devices with limited resources requires careful and exhaustive exploration of the design search space in order to efficiently map modern applications to an embedded multi-processor platform. The MNEMEE project addresses this challenge by offering a unique integrated tool flow that performs source-to-source transformations to automatically optimize the original source code and map it on the target platform. The optimizations aim at reducing the number of memory accesses and the required memory storage of both dynamically and statically allocated data. Furthermore, the MNEMEE tool flow performs optimal assignment of all data on the memory hierarchy of the target platform. Designers can use the whole flow or a part of it and integrate it into their own design \u2026",

This paper proposes a novel allocation methodology for realizing applications with partial and dynamic features on FPGAs. The methodology was implemented as a manager that incorporates two stages: the first one modifies the configuration data of each partial bitstream by replacing the associated application's functionalities (or slices), its goal being to compact the slice distribution, while keeping the same functionality. The second one determines the appropriate spatial location over the FPGA device where the previously optimized configuration data should be placed. The proposed manager is device independent, since it derives partial configuration data that can program dynamically any island-style or hierarchical FPGA.
