            "Abstract": "Interference issues have been identified as a threat for satellite communication systems and services, resulting in throughput degradation and revenue loss to the satellite operators. The situation is likely to become worse over the next years, as new services are deployed. In this context, an onboard spectrum monitoring unit (SMU) is proposed to detect interference reliably. Current satellite SMUs are deployed on the ground and the introduction of an in-orbit SMU can bring several benefits, eg simplifying the ground based station in multibeam systems. Furthermore, the interference to signal plus noise ratio (ISNR) threshold on the uplink of a satellite forward link is identified as the harmful interference threshold above which the SMU needs to reliably detect interference. Moreover, this paper introduces the hypothesis testing problem required for the detection of interference and provides a performance analysis of the energy detector (ED) to solve this problem. Finally, simulation results are provided for validation.",

However, post-disaster EMS, which nowadays predominantly depends on the wireless communication infrastructure, is significantly lagging behind in terms of innovation, standards, and investments. Since the 5G vision is the revolution of the telecommunication industry, provisions of efficiently handling EMS is expected to be distributed, autonomous, and resilient to the network vulnerabilities due to both manmade and natural disasters. In this article, the 4G LTE approaches for typical post-disaster communication and their shortcomings will be discussed.

In this paper, we propose two spectrum opportunity (or spectrum hole) selection schemes; Minimum Collision Technique (MCT) and Maximum Residual Lifetime Technique (MRLT). The proposed techniques are evaluated by average channel utilization, average channel collision and successful secondary transmission bytes over licensed channels in a specific period of time (100s).

New high bandwidth consuming applications are targeted for B3G networks raising more stringent requirements for Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) architectures and packet schedulers that must be spectrum efficient and deliver QoS for heterogeneous applications and services.

Despite the success of small cells and MIMO in 4G systems, there is no single technology advance that can meet this traffic demand. In fact, today's technology roadmaps depict different mixes of spectrum (Hertz), spectral efficiency (bits per Hertz per cell) and small cells (cells per square kilometre) as a stepping stone towards meeting this ambitious target. Traditionally, purchasing additional spectrum has been a stopgap solution towards satisfying new Quality of Service demands and coping with extra load on the network.

In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol which is based on our Multipath-ChaMeLeon (M-CML) routing protocol. We perform a network optimization analysis of M-CML under a series of simulations taking into account three Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and we provide the results with statistical confidence interval by applying the Wilcoxon signed-rank test model.

The nature of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) makes them suitable to be utilized in the context of an emergency for various rescue teams. However, the security and reliability of the mobile ad hoc based communications can be decisive in the effectiveness and efficiency of rescue missions in extreme emergency cases. Furthermore, these stringent requirements propagate through to upper layers that include transport and application layer. In this paper we propose a framework for handling the P2P overlay serves different purposes and combines different technologies. The general functionalities of the framework are structured and unstructured overlays in MANETs.

            "Abstract": "Contemporary personal computing devices are increasingly required to be portable and mobile enabling user's wireless access, to wired network infrastructures and services. This approach to mobile computing and communication is only appropriate in situations where a coherent infrastructure is available. There are many situations where these requirements are not fulfilled such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and military conflicts to name but a few. A practical solution is to use mobile devices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a network, known as a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in wired networks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the wireless nature of the communication links. Additionally due to the lack of central administration security issues are different from conventional networks. For the purposes of this article we have used the \"WMN test-bed\" to enable secure routing in MANETs. The use of cryptography is an efficient proven way of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are not as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is detrimental to MANETs. In this article we have assessed different cryptographic approaches to securing the OLSR (Optimised Link State Routing) protocol to provide a basis for research. We conclude the paper with a series of performance evaluation results regarding different cryptographic and hashing schemes. Our findings clearly show that the most efficient combination of algorithms used for authentication and encryption are SHA-1 and AES respectively \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Reliability of communication in unpredictable environments with increased complexity and lossless properties is one of the main objectives in wireless communication technologies. The autonomous nature of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) classifies them as an effective solution to address emergency situation scenarios, such as rescue or disaster relief operations that take place in hostile and hazardous environments. This paper proposes a multipath approach based on the proactive Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol called RESCUE OLSR (R-OLSR), designed as an initial approach of the EU-ICT RESCUE project. The protocol exploits its capability to identify and transmit data via multiple paths based on two different relay approaches named Simple Relay Routing (SRR) and Advanced Relay Routing (ARR). The protocol's efficiency is substantiated through a simulation scenario within a MANET \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and variable disease in matters of symptoms, clinical course and outcome. The ultimate goal of currently used drugs and therapeutic strategies is the control of disease activity and the delay of the ongoing disability. During the last decades, a number of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), all products of advanced biotechnology are being used. However, these DMDs are yet partially effective since the ongoing disability progression may hardly be prevented. There is growing evidence that these DMDs might be more effective if more accurate monitoring of the disease itself throughout a period of time might be available. In the new era of MS treatment and on the basis of our current knowledge about MS management, it became pretty clear that the overall therapeutic strategy should always be scheduled on strictly individualized basis. To this, MS patients should be encouraged to take \u2026",

Cooperative sensing can increase the reliability of spectrum hole detection, optimize sensing time and reduce delay in cooperative networks.

In fact, primary users should be protected by any license-exempt transmission. To this end, power control is a pivotal mechanism to be used for interference management in these scenarios. Especially, transmit power control is a vehicle to mitigate interference, in presence of CR technology, when primary receivers are attempting to reach a desired Signal-to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR) level. In this work we assume that a CR network relies on the same spectrum area with a primary network. Our scope is to measure the introduced interference level caused by the CR transmitter and to properly modify its power to allow a legacy user to reach a required SINR \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Due to implementation of routing protocols in limited power supply devices in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), this paper presents and evaluates Rainbow Collection Tree Protocol (RCTP) as an enhanced version of Collection Tree Protocol (CTP). CTP is a lightweight, efficient, robust, and also reliable routing protocol for WSNs. CTP as a cross layer routing protocol is also a platform-independent protocol. It uses Trickle Algorithm to optimize the overhead cost and also makes it quickly adaptable to changes in topology. The basic foundation of CTP is on link quality identification and it uses expected transmission count (ETX). ETX is not stable during the time in real environments and ETX fluctuations cause the routing protocols to not work in optimum level. RCTP uses average expected transmission count (AETX) as link quality metric that has shown it is more stable than ETX. It also uses a new mechanism in parent \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Making handover seamless is one of the key issues in mobility management for next generation all-IP networks. It is important to note that in the next few years the majority of terminals will be mobile and the majority of traffic will originate from IP-based applications offering more and more real-time services. The quality of real-time services like VoIP telephony and Video on demand will depend greatly on the ability to minimize the impact of the handover, hence traffic redirection of ongoing sessions.\u201cContext Transfer\u201d aims to contribute to the enhancement in handover performance. When a mobile node (MN) moves to a new subnet it needs to continue certain transport-or routing-related services that have already been established at the previous subnet. Such services are known as \u2018context transfer candidate services\u2019, and examples include header compression, QoS policy, AAA profile and IPsec state. Re-establishing these services at the new subnet will require a considerable amount of time for the protocol exchanges and as a result time-sensitive real-time traffic will suffer during this time. Alternatively context transfer candidate services state information can be transferred, for example, from the previous access router to the new access router so that the services can be reestablished quickly (see Figure 1). A layer-3 context transfer protocol will result in a quick re-establishment of context transfer candidate services at the new domain. In addition, operating at layer-3 ensures interoperability among layer-2 radio access technologies. It would contribute to the seamless operation of application streams and could reduce susceptibility to errors \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Interference is identified as a critical issue for satellite communication (SATCOM) systems and services. There is a growing concern in the satellite industry to manage and mitigate interference efficiently. While there are efficient techniques to monitor strong interference in SATCOM, weak interference is not so easily detected because of its low interference to signal and noise ratio (ISNR). To address this issue, this paper proposes and develops a technique which takes place on-board the satellite by decoding the desired signal, removing it from the total received signal and applying an Energy Detector (ED) in the remaining signal for the detection of interference. Different from the existing literature, this paper considers imperfect signal cancellation, examining how the decoding errors affect the sensing performance, derives the expressions for the probability of false alarm and provides a set of simulations results \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are fully distributed networks that consist of fully-connected collaborative nodes. Each node in the network can act as a relay, if required, in order to route information from source to destination nodes. Traditional routing approaches that are being further investigated for standardisation at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are flat reactive and proactive routing protocols such as Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing and Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR) respectively. However, in literature, various more elaborate approaches have been presented based on hybrid routing solutions which include nature inspired routing algorithms, cluster based routing as well as proactive-reactive zonal based routing. A further avenue towards optimising the flat routing approaches in MANETs is to adopt a converged hybrid routing approach where the nodes in the network use cognitive algorithms to detect the state of the network and adapt the routing approach to fit these conditions. Furthermore, in order to tackle the issue of deploying ad-hoc networks, a more realistic cognitive and adaptive framework is required. In this paper, we describe our work towards the development of such a converged routing approach and a suitable Cognitive and Adaptive Module (CAM), which is patent pending, for MANET deployments.",

One of the goals of WSNs is to minimize the running cost and therefore Star and Tree topologies have been designed to save energy as they do not require any routing table to send the packets to destination [1]. This paper includes the introduction to topologies supported by IEEE802.15.4, and also we have studied the deploying parameters of tree and star topologies in a test bed environment.

            "Abstract": "Emergency services and networks are an emerging area of scientific research. During an emergency scenario such as forest fires, earthquakes, tsunamis and terrorist attacks rescuers need to establish communication to coordinate their actions by using smart and lightweight mobile devices. To this end, autonomous networks should be utilised to support the afore communications. Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are a characteristic paradigm of IP-based autonomous networks that can be deployed during critical emergency missions. We propose utilising a peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm when designing application layer communication and data sharing technologies between participants of the MANET. The architecture therefore must allow nodes to send and retrieve data without knowledge of the complexities of the network. To this end we propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) architecture which we optimise \u2026",

We examine two types of power control games, namely the non-cooperative and the cooperative power control game. In the case of non-cooperative power control game we find the Nash equilibrium in a distributed way. In the case of cooperative power control game we assume that there exists a central entity called coordinator which announces the calculated Nash bargaining solution to the access points.

            "Abstract": "In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently been proposed for hybrid-access small-cells, promising a manifold network capacity compared to OMA. One of the major issues with the installation of a hybrid-access mechanism in small-cells is the cross-tier interference (intercell interference (ICI)) caused by the macrocell users (MUs) that are unable to establish a connection to the small-cell base station (SBS). In this paper, a joint strategy is proposed for hybrid-access small-cells using the Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform (WHT) with NOMA and interference rejection combining (IRC) to achieve high performance gains and mitigate intercell interference (ICI), respectively. WHT is applied mathematically as an orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) to achieve diversity in communication systems. When applied jointly with NOMA, it ensures better performance gains than the conventional NOMA. It reduces the bit error rate (BER) and enhances subsequent throughput performance of the system. IRC is used at the receiver side for managing the cross-tier interference caused by MUs that are unable to connect to the small-cell base station (SBS) for hybrid-access. The work considers both ideal and nonideal successive interference cancellation (SIC) conditions for NOMA. Mathematical modeling is provided for the proposed joint strategy for HetNets and the results validate it in terms of BER and subsequent user throughput performance, compared to the conventional NOMA approach.",

RCTP is an enhanced version of Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) as a lightweight routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)s. This paper analyses the impact of the Radio Frequency (RF) range to reducing the number of nodes which receive the signal by using a novel Parent Forwarding Region (PFR) technique. EFRCTP as a Geographical Routing Protocol (GRP) reduces the number of forwarding nodes and finally reduce the number of packets are sent and received and also to reduce collision in the network. A series of performance evaluations through Matlab and Omnet++ simulations show significant improvements in network performance parameters and total energy consumption over CTP and directed flooding routing protocols.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we are concerned with security for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). Due to the decentralized and self-organizing MANET nature, which implies no direct trusted relationships among nodes, threshold secret sharing algorithms can play a key role in solving the problem of single point of failure in the traditional public-key infrastructure (PKI) architecture. We first motivate the need for efficient secret sharing techniques by reviewing security requirements for MANETs with a view of creating a prototype implementation, focusing on threshold cryptographic techniques for key management solutions. With the aim of designing a computationally lightweight secret sharing scheme, we then propose a novel technique for multi-secret sharing that will improve some aspects of the key management.",

The proposed scheme greatly improves spectrum utilization and provides improved QoS for the secondary users. The secondary data delivery time is adapted in different spectrum opportunities through ASOA scheme based on the estimated collision rates in a sophisticated way. The performance evaluations in terms of the channel utilization, channel collision, secondary data delivery and handoff rates are assessed and compared with the Maximum Idle Channel Remaining Lifetime (MICRL) schemes. The simulation results confirm the viability of the ASOA scheme in comparison with MICRL schemes.",

Such Internet peripheral networks are being termed as the Internet of things (IoT) whereby smart objects and devices will be connected together in a fully distributed fashion to provide ubiquitous services through pervasive networking. Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) is regarded as one of the pervasive self-organised networks that will play a major role in autonomic future internet communication. There are several wellknown challenges to be addressed in order to enable MANET deployments of large islands of interconnected smart devices. Therefore, in this paper, we perform simulations using the ns-2 software, for various well-known routing protocols for MANETs in order to determine the scalability of these protocols.

Broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA) is one of the best positioned radio access technologies to provide broadband access with performances that surpass current 3G mobile data rates and are similar to wired xDSL systems. The paper addresses the solutions which are proposed and demonstrated in the frame of the IST-STRIKE project to enhance spectral efficiency for BFWA and to guarantee end-to-end quality of service (QoS) through a dual mode HiperMAN/HiperLAN system. The first aspect is covered by the use of multi-transmit multi-receive (MTMR) techniques.

            "Abstract": "Due to implementation of routing protocols in limited power supply devices in wireless sensor networks, this paper present a new version of Collection Tree Protocols (CTP). CTP is a light routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that the basic foundation is on following the data toward the sink with minimum overhead. CTP uses ETX as link communication quality metric between nodes. The previous researches show that ETX is not stable during the time in real environment and its fluctuation causes the routing protocols make mistake to choose the best path to the destination. CTP-R uses AETX as link metric that it has been shown is more stable than ETX. CTP-R is a cross-layer integration of tree topology and quality link metric to select the relay node plus a mechanism to make it capable to avoid the dead end routes and finally detect and route around connectivity holes. Detecting and routing around connectivity holes (Rainbow) could enhance performance of CTP to avoid the dead end routes and also loop routes without increasing any overhead to the system. CTP-R is an energy efficient protocol and achieves an improved performance in term of packet delivery ratio, packet travel time and total energy consumption.",

            "Abstract": "Video compression in medical video streaming is one of the key technologies associated with mobile healthcare. Seamless delivery of medical video streams over a resource constrained network emphasizes the need of a video codec that requires minimum bitrates and maintains high perceptual quality. This paper presents a comparative study between High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and its potential successor Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in the context of healthcare. A large-scale subjective experiment comprising of twenty-four non-expert participants is presented for eight different test conditions in Full High Definition (FHD) videos. The presented analysis highlights the impact of compression artefacts on the perceptual quality of HEVC and VVC processed videos. Our results and findings show that VVC clearly outperforms HEVC in terms of achieving higher compression, while maintaining high quality in FHD videos. VVC requires upto 40% less bitrate for encoding an FHD video at excellent perceptual quality. We have provided rate-quality curves for both encoders and a degree of overlap across both codecs in terms of perceptual quality. Overall, there is a 71% degree of overlap in terms of quality between VVC and HEVC compressed videos for eight different test conditions.",

            "Abstract": "Energy is an expensive commodity in Long term Evolution-Advanced (LTEA) networks. In the recent years many researchers have proposed different approaches to minimize energy consumption in LTEA according to mobile users' point of view. In this paper we analyze the energy consumption of the network according to the operators' point of views. Network sharing and the Self Organized Network (SON) technologies are attractive solutions for cost reduction, and minimizing energy utilization in LTEA. The purpose of this paper is to provide a novel framework for minimizing energy cost per bit and assist with Self Organized Load Balancing algorithm (SO-LB) in shared network. Simulation results show that, by employing SO-LB in a shared network, it is possible to save 15-20% of the energy normally consumed in the LTEA non shared networks.",

With all the efforts of the satellite community, the current 5G system is highly dominated by the terrestrial developments, lacking however the proof-of-concept, which will provide the functional input to support the satellite related standardization. This article presents the preparatory work and the first results of the SATis5 testbed project, including the pragmatic analysis of the 5G use cases from a satellite perspective, the targeted Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the convergent system and the integrated 5G architecture. From all of these, a set of critical technology elements is determined, providing a perspective of the specific features which will be implemented and evaluated in the testbed, as well as a direction towards 5G standardization for the satellite community.",

A key feature of immersive communication is the ability for participants to interact with the remote environment, and to detect and evaluate that interaction via their senses [1]. Thus, immersive communication is evolving in a variety of directions. One possible goal is to emulate reality, in which case high fidelity, realistic renderings are important and spatial relationships must be maintained. Another possible goal is to achieve a state of immersive communication that goes beyond reality, for example, enabling millions of people to attend a lecture or a music concert in which everyone has a front row seat [1, 2].Commercial world has an \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) impose strict requirements in terms of battery life, communication overhead and network latency, therefore optimization should be made to applications and services such as domain name service (DNS), dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and session initiation protocol (SIP) if they are to be considered for use on MANETs. Due to the decentralized and self-organizing nature of MANETs, such applications could utilize a distributed name resolution/data storage service. Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) enable these features by virtually organizing the network topology in a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay. P2P overlays have been designed to operate on the application layer without knowledge of the underlying network thus causing poor performance. To address this problem, we propose and evaluate two different DHTs integrated with MANET routing in order to optimize the overall performance of MANET communications when P2P applications and services are used. Both architectures share the same functionality such as decentralization, self-reorganization, and self-healing but differ in MANET routing protocol. Performance evaluation using the NS2 simulator shows that these architectures are suited to different scenarios namely increasing network size and peer velocity. Comparisons with other well-known solutions have proven their efficiency with regard to the above requirements.",

In such extreme emergency scenarios, protocols need to be energy efficient and scalable. We therefore proceed to integrate the E2 mechanism with the scalable ChaMeLeon (CML) protocol and consequently term it as E2CML. We support the E2 mechanism design using an energy consumption model for MANET nodes and use a packet delivery delay model to explain the scalability and energy efficiency of CML. Through the integration process of E2-CML, we primarily aim at satisfying the requirements for emergency MANETs (eMANETs), but also intend to demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is portable across popular protocols such as Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Ad hoc On-Demand Vector (AODV).

In such post-disaster scenarios, the base stations (BS) could possibly be dysfunctional or overloaded by an excessive number of user calls or data, whereas user terminals are likely to be partially connected to or fully isolated from the BS radio signals. In this paper, we study the network behavior during the post-disaster when BSs undergo the thinning process due to the damage to the network infrastructure. During network recovery phase, we also study the network performance when new temporary BSs are distributed which will bring the network into BS superposition phase.

            "Abstract": "During the past years, a dramatic increase of peripheral self organised autonomic networks interworking with the traditional infrastructure networks has been highly noticed. Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) have become an interesting topic for research because of their independent nature in terms of network infrastructure and can play a vital role in future Internet communication. A lot of effort has been made in designing efficient routing protocols for MANETs, mainly because of their unique characteristics, such as dynamic topology, high mobility and limited bandwidth. In this paper we evaluate the performance of our Multipath-ChaMeLeon (M-CML) routing protocol and compare to other proactive protocols; Optimised Link State Protocol (OLSR) and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV). For this reason, we have considered 2 different scenarios for MANETs by varying the number of nodes and speed \u2026",

We proposed a new way of maximization of the network throughput, and we provided new ways toward the provision of fairness. We computed an NE and NBS of an NPG and CPG, respectively. Regarding strategies and the best game to be played, there is no single answer. The best solution depends on the perspective. However, the CPG is more effective in terms of clients' experienced quality of service. Our future work involves experimenting with more than two APs in the shared area and evaluating various quality of service metrics.",

In particular, we assumed that the primary transmitter and PR handshake so that the same spectrum bands can be utilized while also avoiding interference. For this reason, the handshaking technique occurs when the base station or primary receivers (PR) sends a beacon signal over the licensed spectrum network. We followed two techniques to calculate the expected aggregated interference caused by CRs that miss the beacon signal.",

Furthermore, a hybrid scheme is proposed to handle macro-mobility (mobile IP for non-real-time services and SIP for real-time services). The internetworking between micromobility and macro-mobility is implemented at an entity called the enhanced mobility gateway. Both qualitative and quantitative results have demonstrated that the performance of the proposed mobility management is better than existing schemes. Furthermore, a context transfer solution for AAA is proposed to enhance the multilayer mobility management scheme by avoiding the additional delay introduced by AAA security procedures.",

            "Abstract": "Routing protocol plays an important role in data communication. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is used in the scenarios that need to use efficient routing protocols. One issue in term of efficiency in routing protocols in WSNs is energy consumption. Radio Frequency (RF) modules consumed most of energy in wireless sensors and focusing on this part could make an impact of increasing system lifetime. Metrics is an important part in any routing protocol. Most efficient metrics need to send packets to maintain link quality measurement by using RF module. Link quality may be measured by receiving packets and then save energy. Using Received signal strength indication (RSSI) or Link Quality Indication (LQI) of received packets does not need to use RF module to send packets to measure the link quality. In this paper, symmetry of RSSI and LQI in two directions have been studied and also relation between Expected Transmission Count (ETX), RSSI and LQI as link quality metrics. The evaluation in this paper is based on a series of WSN testbeds in real scenarios. The collected data from testbed shows symmetry in RSSI in both directions and also a significant correlation between RSSI and distance that makes it a capable link quality metric to be employed in routing protocols for devices that work in limited resources scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "WiMAX is a wireless digital communication system based on the IEEE 802.16 standard which provides broadband wireless Internet access at very high rates that is up to 70 Mbps or a data rate of about 3 Mbps within a radius of 30-mile (data rate increases as the distance decreases). With the rapid increase in the wireless broadband use, the need for wireless fixed and mobile metropolitan area networks has ever been increasing. Multimedia communications, including audio and video are highly bandwidth demanding and error sensitive. When the coverage area of the wireless network technology is as high as with WiMAX, security becomes one of the most important issues. WiMAX, both mobile and fixed, has many attractive features such as connection-oriented MAC layer, provision of the Quality-of-Service (QoS) for different applications, efficient mobility and power save mode features. Needless to say, all these attractive features must be protected against malicious activities by security mechanisms. Providing secure multimedia communications by using a broadband wireless technology like WiMAXis likely to be challenging due to time or space overhead that occur. Security mechanisms might increase packet sizes thus delay, jitter and throughput are increased. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of secure video transmission over WiMAX networks under different cryptographic algorithms by using the OPNET simulator. The outcome of the results show negligible overhead introduced by the security extensions giving credence to their application in security sensitive scenarios.",

We explore a new dimension to spectrum sharing by proposing a decentralized competitive open market approach-based model, where the different mobile network operators (MNOs) have the opportunity to lease the spectrum to UAV base stations (UAV-BSs), leading to new revenue generation opportunities. The proposed spectrum sharing mechanism is based on the logarithmic utility function and willingness to pay of each UAV-BS. We provide a trade-off analysis between spectrum sharing and price offered by the MNOs, highlighting the impact of \u2026",

Therefore, investment in cybersecurity is an important financial and operational decision. Typical information technology investments aim to create value, whereas cybersecurity investments aim to minimize loss incurred by cyber attacks. Admittedly, cybersecurity investment has become an increasingly complex one since information systems are typically subject to frequent attacks, whose arrival and impact fluctuate stochastically. Further, cybersecurity measures and improvements, such as patches, become available at random points in time making investment decisions even more challenging.

            "Abstract": "The throughput of the next-generation wireless network (WN) should be significantly improved to satisfy the explosive growth of the variety of applications and the amount of data traffic. Various technologies such as OFDMA, NOMA, cooperative multi-point, and so on, have been proposed to improve the throughput of WN. The existing technologies can improve the performance of user throughput in WN via more effective resource utility. However, the data attachment (DA) messages which contain the base station number, frequency sub-channel number, and so on, are generally ignored and treated as invalid messages. Such a direct ignoring of DA may be a waste of the available resources for transmitting the wireless data, especially when the large-scale era of the 5G of wireless network is employed to support wireless transmission.

            "Abstract": "With the advent in services such as telemedicine and telesurgery, provision of continuous quality monitoring for these services has become a challenge for the network operators. Quality standards for provision of such services are application specific as medical imagery is quite different than general purpose images and videos. This paper presents a novel full reference objective video quality metric that focuses on estimating the quality of wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) videos containing bleeding regions. Bleeding regions in gastrointestinal tract have been focused in this research, as bleeding is one of the major reasons behind several diseases within the tract. The method jointly estimates the diagnostic as well as perceptual quality of WCE videos, and accurately predicts the quality, which is in high correlation with the subjective differential mean opinion scores (DMOS). The proposed combines motion quality estimates, bleeding regions\u2019 quality estimates based on support vector machine (SVM) and perceptual quality estimates using the pristine and impaired WCE videos. Our method Quality Index for Bleeding Regions in Capsule Endoscopy (QI-BRiCE) videos is one of its kind and the results show high correlation in terms of Pearson\u2019s linear correlation coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman\u2019s rank order correlation coefficient (SROCC). An F-test is also provided in the results section to prove the statistical significance of our proposed method.",

This paper is motivated by the need for space-efficient secret sharing schemes. We first propose a simple probabilistic algorithm which can be used, prior to secret sharing, in order to split a given secret into public and private data. The public data can be made openly available, and any specific secret sharing method can be used in order to share the private data. We then show that, combined with a previously published space-efficient single secret sharing method, this yields a novel probabilistic matrix-based online multi-secret sharing method with small expected share size. In particular, compared with other matrix-based approaches, our scheme is of similar expected computational cost but smaller share size. Finally, we report on an implementation of our method and evaluate its performance. Our algorithm could \u2026",

Some techniques could help wireless sensors to find its location without using any hardware device that are called range free techniques.

Such wireless multimedia systems should be designed with the purpose of maximizing the quality perceived by the users. For instance, quality parameters can be measured at the receiver-side and fed back to the transmitter for system optimization. Measuring 3D video quality is a challenge due to a number of perceptual attributes associated with 3D video viewing (e.g., image quality, depth perception, naturalness). Subjective as well as objective metrics have been developed to measure 3D video quality against different artifacts. However most of these metrics are Full-Reference (FR) quality metrics and require the original 3D video sequence to measure the quality at the receiver-end.

The ever increasing demand for vehicular traffic consumption is providing the impetus for a new architectural design that can harness the benefits of D2D for vehicular users, taking a step toward offloading vehicular traffic from the core network. We propose the notion of extending D2D for vehicular scenarios with the potential to coordinate vehicular traffic using the LTE band. Furthermore, we then extend this approach by investigating cognitive radio in synergy with a geo-location database, to exploit white spaces as a means of further offloading vehicular users.

Security provisioning is an essential requirement in any such all-embracing network but this introduces an additional delay component to the total handoff delay crucially affecting the prime objective towards seamless mobility. In this paper we present a context transfer solution for seamless and secure multimedia services over all-IP infrastructures. The solution will act as an adhesive between the AAA and mobility management message exchanges by using the latter to forward AAA state information locally. For such a solution existing messages cellular IP were used as triggers and additional messages were introduced to carry the desired AAA context information. The results have shown that the overall handoff delay is reduced by approximately a factor of twenty. Additional results demonstrate the effect of AAA Context Transfer on multimedia services when integrated with the interworking mobility solution of SIP/Cellular IP [1].",

The design of an effective routing protocol is one of the main challenges in the ad-hoc networking paradigm and the utilisation of an adequate link cost metric is essential. In this paper, the validity of ETX (Expected Transmission Count) as a link cost metric is investigated by studying its behaviour in real-time testbeds. In our performance evaluation, the ETX performance was studied in different distance scenarios. Subsequently, the main observation was that ETX values was not steady over time and usually fluctuated for a fixed scenario. Fluctuation in the ETX values affects a routing protocol in wrongly identifying the best path based on current ETX link cost and therefore new \u2026",

            "Abstract": "(WiMAX), is one of the latest technologies in the wireless world. The main goal of WiMAX is to deliver wireless communications with quality of service (QoS) guarantees, security, and mobility. In this article, we have evaluated the performance of the Internet Protocol security (IPSec) over WiMAX networks. We have also illustrated the results of the simulations. We have also depicted the processing time and the throughput introduced when IPSec is applied over WiMAX technology (IEEE 802.16). WiMAX is a wireless digital communication system based on the IEEE 802.16 standard that provides broadband wireless Internet access at very high rates that is up to 70 Mb/s or a data rate of about 3 Mb/s within a radius of 50 km (data rate increases as the distance decreases)[1]. With the rapid increase in the wireless broadband use, the need for wireless fixed and mobile metropolitan area networks has ever been increasing. The main idea in Europe is to provide a wireless metropolitan area network, mainly last mile connectivity, with the line-of-sight (LoS) as well as non-LoS transmission",

We use the term emergency MANETs (eMANETs) in order to describe Next Generation Networks (NGNs) which are deployed in emergency cases such as forest fires and terrorist attacks. Secure routing in MANETs is critical. Due to the absence of a central authority, intermediate nodes act as routers forwarding packets across a multihop path. A well known attack against the conventional operation of routing protocols such as the Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, is the wormhole attack. Secure routing in eMANETs is critical due to the fact that secure multimedia communications should be established among the devices of the recovery workers.",

A size threshold point between proactive and reactive routing approaches is established using a probabilistic analytical model using dimensional cardinalities of the effective operation area, called the critical area (CA). CML adapts its routing behaviour according to the network size in order to improve overall routing efficiency while preserving acceptable quality of service (QoS) relative to well known protocols that are Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing and Optimized Link Sate Routing (OLSR).

Routing Protocols in WMNs have a vital role in data communication and the main key in all routing protocols is metric. In this paper, most of the metrics in WMNs are considered in different categories. Link-quality and Load-dependant metrics are covered most of the metrics and then later metrics for multi channels networks are considered. Expected Transmission Count (ETX) as a famous link-quality metric with all its divisions have been studied and then more metrics which consider more wireless parameters such as intra and inter interferences have been added. In the last sections, some metrics which provide for multi channel networks and multi interface devices are mentioned and also metric for cognitive radio environment. In the end of the paper, conclusion with a comparison table has been provided to compare metrics in WMNs.",

Seamless delivery of medical video streams over a resource constrained network emphasizes the need of a video codec that requires minimum bitrates and maintains high perceptual quality. This paper presents a comparative study between High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and its potential successor Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in the context of healthcare. A large-scale subjective experiment comprising of twenty-four non-expert participants is presented for eight different test conditions in Full High Definition (FHD) videos. The presented analysis highlights the impact of compression artefacts on the perceptual quality of HEVC and VVC processed videos. Our results and findings show that VVC clearly outperforms HEVC in terms of achieving higher compression, while maintaining high quality in FHD videos. VVC requires upto 40% less bitrate for encoding an FHD video at excellent perceptual quality. We have provided rate-quality curves for both encoders and a degree of overlap across both codecs in terms of perceptual quality. Overall, there is a 71% degree of overlap in terms of quality between VVC and HEVC compressed videos for eight different test conditions.",

The paper substantiates the efficiency of the protocol through a simulation scenario within a MANET using the NS-3 simulator. The acquired results indicate that M-CML routing approach combined with an intelligent link metric such as the ETX reduces the effects of link instabilities and enhances the network performance in terms of resiliency and scalability.",

A wireless sensor network (WSN) is usually deployed in scenarios where efficient and energy-aware routing protocols are desired. In wireless sensors, the radio-frequency (RF) modules consume most of the energy. Routing metrics are important in determining paths and maintaining the quality of service in routing protocols. The most efficient metrics need to send packets to maintain link-quality measurement using the RF module. In this article, two prominent link-quality metrics-received signal strength indication (RSSI) and link-quality indication (LQI)-are introduced; the symmetry of RSSI and LQI in two directions has been studied, and relations between the expected transmission count (ETX), RSSI, and LQI as link-quality metrics have been analyzed.

Peer-to-peer overlay networks have the potential to accommodate largescale, decentralised applications that can be integrated into a MANET architecture to enable peer-to-peer communication among different mobile peers. These overlay architectures must be very resilient and their utilisation, reliability and availability must satisfy the needs of mobile computing. One must also heed the fact that the wireless nature of the medium introduces security vulnerabilities. The aim of the work described in this paper is twofold. First, we describe our peer-to-peer distributed hash table (DHT) architecture entitled Reliable Overlay Based Utilisation of Services and Topology (ROBUST). This is designed to be efficiently applied to MANETs. We additionally propose security extensions to protect the ROBUST signalling messages against malicious activities. We evaluate the ROBUST performance as well as the security extensions under varying levels of mobility and network sizes by building a custom DHT module for the network simulator ns-2. The outcome of the results show negligible overhead introduced by the extensions giving credence to their application in security sensitive scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "Security for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is a critical and thoroughly examined scientific area that has attracted the interest of many researchers. Many countermeasures against compromised or selfish nodes consider intrusion detection systems (IDS). In this paper we use game theory to model noncooperative security games between a MANET, which is defended by IDS operating at each node as well as a group of collaborative malicious nodes called malicious coalition. Our work innovates by finding the defend and attack probability distributions, of any MANET and malicious coalition, that maximise the utility of the players at the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of a non-cooperative security game between the aforementioned entities. To go a step further, this paper proposes a way to derive the intrusion detection or the attack effort respecting the corresponding energy costs of the MANET and the malicious coalition. Parameters such as intrusion detection rate, attacking cost, defending cost, false alarm detection rate and false alarm cost critically affect the final defending and attacking distribution probabilities as we have shown in this paper. Numerical results have been illustrated showing the changes at MANET\u2019s utility, at NE, as a function of the packet size, the intrusion detection rate and the mobility.",

            "Abstract": "In many extreme emergency cases such as forest fires or tube terrorist attacks, the rescuers have difficulty using traditional legacy networks due to destruction or collapse of the infrastructure in such events. We use the term emergency mobile ad hoc networks (eMANETs) in order to describe next generation networks (NGNs) which are deployed in emergency cases. The security of these networks is critical. Especially secure routing is important given the fact that potential attackers aim to disrupt the appropriate operation of the routing protocol within an eMANET. In this paper we propose a game theoretic approach called AODV-GT (AODV-game theoretic) and we integrate this into the reactive ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol to provide defense against blackhole attacks. AODV-GT is based on the concept of non-cooperative game theory. AODV-GT outperforms AODV in terms of malicious \u2026",

This chapter addresses the open issues in the field of QoS and QoE assessments. First, the perceptual characteristics of the multiview content are analyzed, and then a survey on the existing approaches for QoS and QoE estimation is performed. The analysis is then focused on the subjective aspects of QoE \u2026",

Previously, the focus of MIMO-OFDM research in high performance metropolitan area network (HIPERMAN) systems was on space time coding (STC) and beamforming. Recently, multi-user detection (MUD) has emerged as a novel approach in MIMO-OFDM-based HIPERMAN systems. In this paper, we have proposed a new MAC design, which includes the new and flexible MAC frame structure and an efficient dynamic resource allocation algorithm, in order to accommodate the MUD techniques in uplink transmission in HIPERMAN systems. The performance of the new MAC design has been evaluated via simulation means. The simulation results show that the new MAC design based on MUD can significantly increase the system capacity.",

The ultimate goal of currently used drugs and therapeutic strategies is the control of disease activity and the delay of the ongoing disability. During the last decades, a number of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), all products of advanced biotechnology are being used. However, these DMDs are yet partially effective since the ongoing disability progression may hardly be prevented. There is growing evidence that these DMDs might be more effective if more accurate monitoring of the disease itself throughout a period of time might be available. In the new era of MS treatment and on the basis of our current knowledge about MS management, it became pretty clear that the overall therapeutic strategy should always be scheduled on strictly individualized basis.

WSNs are used in three-dimensional (3D) scenarios such as the surface of sea or lands with different levels of height. This paper presents and evaluates the Three-Dimensional Position-Based Adaptive Real-Time Routing Protocol (3DPBARP) as a novel, real-time, position-based and energy-efficient routing protocol for WSNs. 3DPBARP is a lightweight protocol that reduces the number of nodes which receive the radio frequency (RF) signal using a novel parent forwarding region (PFR) algorithm. 3DPBARP as a Geographical Routing Protocol (GRP) reduces the number of forwarding nodes and thus the traffic and packet collision in the network. A series of performance evaluations through MATLAB and Omnet++ simulations show significant improvements in network performance parameters and total energy consumption over the 3D Position-Based Routing Protocol (3DPBRP) and Directed Flooding Routing Protocol (DFRP).",

In this paper, we present two mobility management architectures based on SIP and Mobile IP protocols. These configurations mainly allow/provide mobility in two different layers namely the application and network layers and due to that our proposal is so-called multilayered. Such mobility should be present over heterogeneous networks, such as UMTS, WLANs, as well as, fixed networks. The two proposed architectures are evaluated in terms of mobility-related metrics and for two types of traffic, real time and non real time.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we propose a power control policy over an imperfect fading channel within a cognitive spectrum sharing area. In particular, our proposed scheme maximizes the secondary user effective capacity subject to the average interference power and the secondary user transmit power constraints. We also investigate the minimization of average interference power at the Primary Receiver (PR) under required effective capacity of the secondary user with respect to imperfect Channel State Information (CSI) between cognitive radio transmitter and the PR link. Furthermore the impact of the Quality of Service (QoS) exponent on effective capacity in imperfect channel is studied. The analytical results reveal that the effective capacity of the Secondary User (SU) under given average interference power and peak power constraints increases due to growing channel state error of the secondary transmitter-primary receiver \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In conventional cognitive radio systems, the secondary user employs a \u201clisten-before-talk\u201d paradigm, where it senses if the primary user is active or idle, before it decides to access the licensed spectrum. However, this method faces challenges, with the most important one being the reduction of the secondary user's throughput, as no data transmission takes place during the sensing period. In this context, the idea of simultaneous spectrum sensing and data transmission is proposed. This paper studies a system model where this concept is obtained through the collaboration of the secondary transmitter with the secondary receiver. First, the secondary receiver decodes the signal from the secondary transmitter, removes it from the total received signal, and then carries out spectrum sensing in the remaining signal in order to determine the presence/absence of the primary user.

However, a security infrastructure (e.g., AAA) introduces additional impairments, in the form of delay components, to the total handoff performance crucially affecting the prime objective towards seamless and secure mobility. In this work, a Context Transfer solution is proposed, in order to support seamless and secure multimedia services over all-IP infrastructures. The solution acts as an adhesive between the AAA and mobility management entities by using the latter to forward AAA state information locally. In this solution, the mobility management protocol is used to trigger Context Transfer and additional messages have been introduced to carry the desired AAA context information. The results presented here show that the overall handoff delay is reduced significantly \u2026",

A major hurdle towards the deployment of emergency MANETs (eMANETs) is the design of a distributed routing protocol that can adapt to its highly dynamic topology where the number of nodes in the network frequently varies. This paper presents ChaMeLeon (CML), a hybrid and adaptive routing protocol designed to adapt to the rapid topological changes in extreme emergency MANETs (eMANETs) when operating within a predefined disaster area. CML adaptively changes its routing behavior according to the number of nodes in the network, so that it can provide a more efficient routing approach than purely proactive or reactive routing protocols for varying size networks. The protocol can operate in one of three routing phases which \u2026",

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) may provide a viable solution as a fast and easily deployable network infrastructure for all types of emergency services in the context of such emergency situations. The ways in which users of the network are able to collaborate and interact with each other is a fundamental part of the emergency management process. Consequently a main research area lies in the development and deployment of overlay networks which cater for communication, collaboration and service discovery between participants. In this paper we discuss the motivations for furthering the research of overlay network architectures in emergency situations, we analyze the important concepts related to peer-to-peer overlay networks in general and thus propose two novel architectures for multiple cross-layer peerto-peer overlay networks.",

In recent years many researchers have proposed different approaches to minimize energy consumption in LTEA.

SON has the potential for self-configuring, self-optimizing, self-healing and minimizing the energy consumption in the network and by deploying Relay Nodes (RNs) it enhances the capacity, the diversity and fairness in the network. In this paper we consider the self-optimizing and self-healing properties of SON and propose a novel energy efficient SON based position aided relay algorithm.

Although much research in energy efficiency has been geared towards hardware power optimization, the energy consumption of new generation wireless (3G and 4G) is sensitive on the design and flexibility of the dynamic resource allocation protocol, with a high fraction of the holistic power consumption attributed to the data transmission over the wireless connection. This sensitivity suggests that there is an opportunity for optimization of the energy consumption based on communications protocols, namely the link and transport layer protocols. In this chapter, we extend the analysis given in the prequel to understand how the link level performance interacts with the system level to form part of the system level model for analyzing system performance in cellular networks. Moreover, this chapter focuses on the dynamic resource allocation entity which is responsible for managing radio resources in wireless systems.

In this context, an on-board spectrum monitoring unit (SMU) can be used to detect interference reliably. Current satellite SMUs are deployed on the ground and the introduction of an in-orbit SMU can bring several benefits, e.g. simplifying the ground based station in multibeam systems. This paper proposes a two-step algorithm for on-board interference detection, exploiting the frame structure of DVB-S2X standard, which employs pilot symbols for data transmission. Assuming that the pilot signal is known at the receiver, it can be removed from the total received signal. Then, an Energy Detection (ED) technique can be applied on the remaining signal in order to decide the presence or absence of interference. The simulation results show \u2026",

In this paper, we present a 5G-oriented network architecture that is based on satellite communications and multi-access edge computing to support eMBB applications, which is investigated in the EU 5GPPP phase-2 satellite and terrestrial network for 5G project. We specifically focus on using the proposed architecture to assure quality-of-experience (QoE) of HTTP-based live streaming users by leveraging satellite links, where the main strategy is to realize transient holding and localization of HTTP-based (e.g., MPEG-DASH or HTTP live streaming) video segments at 5G mobile edge while taking into account the characteristics of satellite backhaul link.

Researchers in the area of WMNs address some issues like low throughput and high latency. Routing Protocols in WMNs have a vital role in data communication and the key parameter in all routing protocols is link metrics. In this paper the majority of link metrics in WMNs are studied in different categories. Link-quality and traffic-aware metrics account for most of the metrics, however multi channel network and cognitive radio systems are also considered in detail. In each section, by reviewing the metrics and its performance in detail, summary and comparison tables of link quality metrics are also provided to enable better understanding of this topic.",

These challenges open the possibility to use NOMA schemes in future radio access networks. In these schemes, the users are multiplexed in the power domain in the transmitter and de-multiplexed using successive interference cancellation in the receiver. In this work, we propose a hybrid resource allocation technique that consists of orthogonal and non-orthogonal radio resources and also study the improvements in cell capacity achieved in several proposed cases. To this end, we use millimeter- wave-based single-cell deployment to evaluate the performance of this hybrid scheme.",

This paper presents and evaluates an Energy Efficient Position Based Adaptive Real-Time Routing protocol (EFPBARP) as a novel, real-time, position based and energy efficient routing protocol. EFPBARP is a lightweight protocol that reduces the number of nodes which receive the RF signal using a novel Parent Forwarding Region (PFR) algorithm. EFPBARP as a Geographical Routing Protocol (GRP) reduces the number of forwarding nodes and thus the traffic and packet collision in the network. A series of performance evaluations through Matlab and Omnet++ simulations show significant improvements in network performance parameters and total energy consumption over CTP and Directed Flooding Routing Protocol (DFRP).",

The nature of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) makes them suitable to be utilized in the context of an extreme emergency for all rescue teams. Therefore the network and the application layer security is critical for ad-hoc communications and encompasses several issues which need consideration. Thus, a main area of research lies in the investigation and development of secure routing and application protocols for MANETs. In this paper we discuss the motivation towards securing MANETs communications in extreme emergency cases, we analyze important security concepts in MANETs and we propose our ideas on a novel secure suite of protocols called PEACE1 Security Platform (PSP). The suite will provide a high trust level of detection and prevention against various attacks in MANETs.",

We use the term emergency MANETs (eMANETs) in order to describe next generation IP-based networks, which are deployed in emergency cases such as forest fires and terrorist attacks. The main goal within the realm of eMANETs is to provide emergency workers with intelligent devices such as smart phones and PDAs. This technology allows communication \"islets\" to be established between the members of the same or different emergency teams (policemen, firemen, paramedics). In this article, we discuss an adaptive and secure routing protocol developed for the purposes of eMANETs. We evaluate the performance of the protocol by comparing it with other widely used routing protocols for MANETs. We finally show that the overhead introduced due to security considerations is affordable to support secure ad-hoc communications among lightweight devices.",
