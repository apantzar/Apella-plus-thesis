Linear algebra and especially the solution of linear systems of equations lies at the heart of many applications in scientific computing. This paper describes and analyzes three parallel versions of the dense LU factorization method that is used in linear system solving on a multicore using OpenMP interface. More specifically, we present two naive parallel algorithms based on row block and row cyclic data distribution and we put special emphasis on presenting a third parallel algorithm based on the pipeline technique. Further, we propose an implementation of the pipelining technique in OpenMP. Experimental results on a multicore CPU show that the proposed OpenMP pipeline implementation achieves good overall performance compared to the other two naive parallel methods. Finally, in \u2026",

On the other hand, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have also been increasingly adopted for various tasks, enabling deep learning techniques on graphs without feature engineering.

Thus the neural network operation in every node is exactly the same at all levels of the hierarchical integration. The hidden RBF response units are recursive.

In this work we discuss a naive and two optimised CUDA algorithms for the two kernel estimation methods: univariate and multivariate. These optimised algorithms are based on the use of shared memory tiles and loop unrolling techniques. We also present exploratory experimental results of the proposed CUDA algorithms according to the several values of parameters such as number of threads per block, tile size, loop unroll level, number of variables and data (sample) size. The experimental results show significant performance gains of all proposed CUDA algorithms over serial CPU version and small performance speed-ups of the two optimised CUDA algorithms over naive GPU algorithms. Finally, based on extended performance results are obtained general conclusions of all proposed CUDA algorithms for some parameters.",

The algorithms are adaptations of three standard techniques for matrix factorization: Standard Singular Value Decomposition (sSVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Correspondence Analysis (CA). PCA and CA can be described as singular value decompositions of appropriately transformed matrices. CA is conceptually similar to PCA and treats rating data using a consistent weighting scheme. To our knowledge, CA has not been previously used in the context of CF. The main purpose of this paper is to test how the corresponding CF variations behave under rating data sets of different sparsity and size. A series of experiments were executed, aiming to evaluate the three algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets, MovieLens and Jester, indicated that CA-Cf outperforms SVD-Cf and PCA-Cf in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for small numbers of retained dimensions, regardless of the different data set characteristics. Nevertheless, SVD-Cf displayed the overall highest accuracy.",

The local approach delivers breakthrough performance in many application domains. This paper considers local learning versions of regularization networks (RN) and investigates several options for improving their online prediction performance, both in accuracy and speed. First, we exploit the interplay between locally optimized and globally optimized hyper-parameters (regularization parameter and kernel width) each new predictor needs to optimize online. There is a substantial reduction of the operation cost in the case we use two globally optimized hyper-parameters that are common to all local models. We also demonstrate that this global optimization of the two hyper-parameters produces \u2026",

The approach constructs a mapping of all ensemble members to a mutual affinity matrix based on classification rates between them. After the mapping of all members the Affinity Propagation clustering algorithm is used for the selection phase.

However, by testing only 30 values for L and 30 values for C via 10-fold cross-validation, the learning phase must build 9000 different ELM models, each with a different pair {L, C}. Since these models are not independent from one another, the essence of managing and drastically reducing the computational cost of the ELM model selection relies on matrix decompositions that avoid direct matrix inversion and allow producing reusable matrices during the cross-validations. Still, one can find many matrix decompositions and cross-validation versions that result in several combinations. In this \u2026",

However, a number of pedagogical problems appear when confronted with asynchronous distance education (Ritchie and Hoffman, 1997; Wulf, 1996; Pernici and Casati, 1997; Relan and Gillani, 1997; Hunt 1999; Pritichard, 1998; Khan, 1997; Harasim, 1990; Hall, 1997b; Holden and Wedman, 1993).Students may feel isolated due to the distance factor or due to the lack of live interactions with the tutor or with classmates.

Since PNN model is inherently parallel three common parallel approaches are studied here, namely data parallel, neuron parallel and pipelining. Localization methods via clustering algorithms are utilized to reduce the hidden layer size of PNNs. A problem of localization may be present in the case of multi-class data. In this paper we propose two simple fast approximate solutions. The first is using sigma smoothing parameters obtained from the parallel PNN initial training directly to clustering. In this case a substantial reduction of neurons is achieved without significant loss of recognition accuracy. The second is an effort for an additional tuning. Via confidence outputs we employ a chain training approach to tune for the best possible PNN architecture.",

We then modify some parameters of the algorithms to observe their effects on the performance. Our objective is to show that, despite many believes that Message Passing scheme should give a better performance, Shared Memory scheme results in a similar performance in some conditions and thus can be considered as an excellent alternative for those who want to implement parallel Evolutionary algorithms.",

In this paper we parallelize two kernel estimation methods such as the univariate and multivariate kernel estimation from the field of the computational econometrics on multi-core platform using different programming frameworks such as Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel Cilk++, Intel TBB, SWARM and FastFlow. The purpose of this paper is to present an extensive quantitative (i.e., performance) and qualitative (i.e., the ease of programming effort) study of the multi-core programming frameworks for these two kernel estimation methods.",

In this paper, we present a basic parallel implementation and different optimization techniques of two important two-dimensional pattern matching algorithms, Baker and Bird and Baeza-Yates and Regnier, on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform. The performance of the proposed parallel implementations is evaluated for the GPU architecture and for different problem parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that there is performance gain of the optimized GPU implementations over the unoptimized implementation. Additionally, it is shown that the parallel implementation of Baeza-Yates and Regnier has a significantly higher performance gain comparing to that of the Baker and Bird algorithm.",

Regularization neural networks are used for both the modules as well as the combiner committee in an embedded architecture. After the committee training no module will know anything else except its own local data. This privacy preserving obligation is a challenging problem for trainable combiners but crucial in real world applications. Only classifiers in the form of binaries or agents can be sent to others to validate their local data and sent back average classification rates. From this fully distributed and privacy preserving mutual validation a coarse-grained matrix can be formed to map all members. We demonstrate that it is possible to fully exploit this mutual validation matrix to efficiently train another regularization network as a meta learner combiner for the \u2026",

This space may be modeled in a variety of ways, such as with trajectories of the movement of the articulators-certain parts of the human vocal tract-derived by means of some specialized medical imaging device, or by using linguistics-related abstract classes to describe the evolution of the articulatory state through time. The problem is by far non-trivial, mainly due to the one-to-many nature and the high non-linearity of the acoustic to articulatory mapping. Numerous approaches towards its solution have been proposed. Such a solution could have several applications, with most important the probability of improving the performance of current automatic speech recognition systems.",

As such, many works utilize a smaller number of training epochs during search phase evaluations. In this work, we study the effect of reduced training in neural architecture search. We focus on the retention of relative rankings between architectures when they are trained with different optimizers and for various epochs.

The first algorithm uses SVD in order to reduce the dimension of the active item's neighborhood. The second algorithm initially enhances Item-based Filtering with demographic information and then applies SVD at various points of the filtering procedure. The presentations of both algorithms include a detailed step-by-step description and a series of experiments. In both cases the results show that a reduction in the dimension of the item neighborhood via SVD, either by itself or combined with the usage of relevant demographic information, is promising, since it does not only tackle some of the recorded problems of Recommender Systems, but also assists in increasing the accuracy of systems employing it.",

            "Abstract": "This work describes a probabilistic neural network (PNN) committee machine for Peer-to-Peer data mining. The pattern neurons of the PNN committee are composed of locally trained class-specialized regularization network Peer classifiers. The training takes into account the asynchronous distributed and privacy-preserving requirements that can be met in P2P systems. The Peer classifiers are first trained in parallel based on their local data. While no local data exchange is possible among them, the peers can exchange their classifiers in the form of binaries, or agents. Then an asynchronous distributed computing P2P cycle is executed to construct a mutual validation matrix. The train set of one Peer becomes the validation set of the other and only average rates are returned back. From this matrix we demonstrate that it is possible to perform weight based ensemble selection of best peer members for every class \u2026",

Consequently, a large number of multimedia tools have been created, always following the trend of simpler and easier multimedia development. After outlining the transition from hardcore programming to modern multimedia authoring systems, this paper leads the way through a large variety of products, trying to determine the criteria upon which one should base a software investment. To facilitate this attempt, a series of variables is introduced and, based on these variables, a typical evaluation takes place. Following that pattern, each tool is examined separately so that a reasonable amount of data is gathered and treated as the basis for a 5-scale point system. Informal as this may be, it not only helps in ranking the tools examined, but also in extracting the necessary statistics \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this article, we review a specific speech processing research area called acoustic-to-articulatory inversion of speech, or simply speech inversion, which has attracted many researchers and scientists during the last 35 years. The underlying problem refers to the mapping from the acoustic space, which is well-defined since it consists of acoustic signals, to the articulatory space. The latter is somewhat vague, since it may manifest itself in a variety of ways, though it is always assumed that it bears some kind of connection to the human speech production system and the relative position of the articulators-the parts of the human vocal tract. We consider three major classes of models for the articulatory space, be it theoretical models, classic but of little practical interest, medical scanning models, where articulatory data are derived directly from the human subject by means of a specialized device such as an electromagnetic articulograph or an electropalatograph, and, finally, linguistics-derived models, which relate a given phoneme to a vector of phonetic features. A number of approaches have been proposed in the quest for a solution to the speech inversion problem such as codebook approaches, neural network approaches, constrained optimization approaches, analytical approaches as well as stochastic modelling and statistical inference methods such as mixture density networks or Kalman filtering. The recovery of the articulatory space from the speech acoustic signal could have a variety of applications such as building visual aids for hearing impaired people or as a means of study in phonetics and phonology.

While global learning algorithms create a global model for all testing points, the local learning algorithms use neighborhoods to learn local parameters and create on the fly a local model specifically designed for any particular testing point. This approach delivers breakthrough performance in many application domains. Usually however the computational overhead is substantial, and in some cases prohibited. For speeding up the online predictions we exploit both multithreaded parallel implementations as well as interplay between locally optimized parameters and globally optimized parameters. The multithreaded local learning regularization neural networks are implemented with OpenMP. The accuracy of the algorithms is tested against several benchmark datasets. The parallel efficiency and speedup is evaluated on a multi-core system.",

Latent factor models can tackle some fundamental challenges of CF, such as data sparsity and scalability. In this work, we present an optimal scaling framework to address these problems using Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CatPCA) for the low-rank approximation of the user-item ratings matrix, followed by a neighborhood formation step. CatPCA is a versatile technique that utilizes an optimal scaling process where original data are transformed so that their overall variance is maximized.

In one of its most common forms, it utilizes an artificial palate with 62 silver electrodes embedded in its tongue-facing surface. At small regular time intervals it is recorded whether a specific electrode is contacted or not by the tongue, leading to tongue-palate contact patterns. EPG is nowadays a relatively well-estabilshed tool in phonetic research, in the clinical treatment of people with articulation difficulties or cleft palate, and also in the teaching of second languages. Still, the derivation of EPG data is a rather expensive and difficult process. What is suggested herein is that a means of estimating EPG patterns directly from the acoustic speech signal-with no need of any special equipment-would be of great value to speech pathologists and phoneticians alike.This paper presents work \u2026",

The experimental part of this work first locates the ideal parameter settings for the algorithm, and concludes by contrasting it with plain item-based filtering which utilizes the original, high dimensional neighborhood. The results show that a reduction in the dimension of the item neighborhood is promising, since it does not only tackle some of the recorded problems of recommender systems, but also assists in increasing the accuracy of systems employing it.",

Most research focuses on searching for small blocks of deep learning operations, or micro-search. This method yields satisfactory results but demands prior knowledge of the macro architecture\u2019s structure. Generally, methods that do not utilize macro structure knowledge perform worse but are able to be applied to datasets of completely new domains. In this paper, we propose a macro NAS methodology which utilizes concepts of Regularized Evolution and Macro Neural Architecture Search (DeepNEAT), and apply it to the Fashion-MNIST dataset. By utilizing our method, we are able to produce networks that outperform other macro NAS methods on the dataset, when the same post-search inference methods are used. Furthermore, we are able to achieve 94.46% test accuracy \u2026",

The technique focuses on matrix computations, and more specifically, on how we can detect and correct the probable faults in a matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplication. According to the [HA 84] Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance is distinguished by three characteristics: The encoding of the data used by the algorithm, the redesign of the algorithm to operate on the encoded data, and the distribution of the computation steps in the algorithm among computation units. In [KPD98], the authors present a technique, based on checksum and reverse computation called Rollback Recovery Method and they implement it on varius matrix operations (matrix multiplication, Cholesky, QR and LU factorization and Hessenberg reduction).In this paper we apply three different schemes, Basic ABFT, Rollback Recovery and Recomputation on matrix multiplication for different matrix dimensions, and we give experimental results on the error detection and recovery performance of every one of the three methods. We consider errors that occur during computation. We suppose these errors are random and we apply several values of error probability. We suppose that, errors occur because of transient hardware problems or faulty data propagation.",

However if the number N of pattern neurons grows large, the evaluation of a single unknown sample has still O (N) complexity, which is not scale well. Parallelism can efficiently work towards speeding up the large neural networks. Whereas the PNN run time can be reduced by parallelism, its computational cost can be decreased by keeping only the globally most important pattern neurons. While such parsimonious global models have been studied for a long time, there is another way that is related to local learning algorithms. Maintain all N pattern neurons but to classify any unknown x use only the local ones, the k nearest neighbor to x neurons. This local learning PNN is investigated here.

Although powerful and flexible tool for many automation tasks, their design requires intensive human effort. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the architecture itself can contribute more to the network's performance than its training. It is thus easy to see the necessity of automating the task of architecture design, as it will lead to even further improvements in the field. In this paper we implement a synchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning method in order to generate fully convolutional architectures, inspired by recent research in Neural Architecture Search and Reinforcement Learning.

Often, these kernels are computation-intensive, so the sequential execution time is quite large. Therefore, it is profitable to use a multi-core platform as a high performance system for the execution. For the parallelization of the kernels from scientific computing on multi-core platforms there are many representative parallel programming libraries. These libraries are Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel Cilk++, Intel TBB, Intel ArBB, SMPSs, SWARM and FastFlow. These libraries based on a small set of extensions to the C programming language and involve a relatively simple compilation phase and potentially much more complex runtime system. The question that is imposed by programmers is which is the appropriate libary for implementing computational kernels on multi-core so that there is a balance between easy programming effort and the high performance. The aim of this presentation is to show an unified and systematic quantitative and qualitative study of multi-core programming libraries for implementing basic kernels that based on row partitioning method. The quantitative study is based on the assess the performance of the multithread kernels on Dual Opteron 6128 CPU with eight processor cores (16 cores total) and we measured the execution time as a function of the number of cores (ie from 1 to 16) and of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Electropalatography is a well established technique for recording information on the patterns of contact between the tongue and the hard palate during speech, leading to a stream of binary vectors called electropalatograms, consisting of elecropalatographic events - contacts or non-contacts between the tongue and the palate. A data-driven approach to mapping the speech signal onto electropalatographic information is presented. A combination of principal component analysis and support vector regression is used, yielding classification scores of more than 93% on individual electropalatographic events, for a single speaker. This may be viewed as a special case of the, well-known in the speech community, speech inversion problem which refers to inferring production parameters from the speech signal",

We test the efficiency of the resulting approach on two commonly used CF approaches (User-based and Item-based CF). The experimental part of this work involves a number of variations of the proposed approach.

While the majority voting is the most popular combination rule many ties in votes can occur, especially in multi-class problems.

A fast algorithm, which works without the need of any matrix in memory, is Subtractive Clustering, but it requires user-defined bandwidth parameters.

The aim of this paper is to present a parallel implementation of the revised simplex algorithm. Our parallel implementation focuses on the reduction of the time taken to perform the basis inverse, due to the fact that the total computational effort of an iteration of simplex type algorithms is dominated by this computation. This inverse does not have to be computed from scratch at any iteration. In this paper, we compute the basis inverse with two well-known updating schemes:(i) The Product Form of the Inverse (PFI) and (ii) A Modification of the Product Form of the Inverse (MPFI); and incorporate them with revised simplex algorithm. Apart from the parallel implementation, this paper presents a computational study that shows the speedup among the serial and the parallel implementations in largescale LP problems. The test set used in the computational study is the Netlib set of linear problems. The parallelism is achieved using OpenMP in a shared memory multiprocessor architecture.",

The obtained experimental results demonstrate that the dynamic allocation of vector pointers achieve better performance than the original one for computing dot product computation.

The effect of real code representation to the parallel memetic algorithms can make multimodal and non-linear problems easier to solve. In this paper, the characterisitics of the typical two models of parallel memetic algorithms are compared. Those models are the master slave model and the island model. In the master slave model, the ideal parallel efficiency cannot be reached to 100%. Therefore, it is concluded the island model is suitable for PC cluster systems. In addition, we study some special features of the running platforms for PMAs, and basically find out that heterogeneous computing can be as efficient or even more efficient than homogeneous computing for parallel memetic algorithms.",

Hidden Marcov Models have intrinsic properties, which make them very attractive for sign language recognition. Explicit segmentation on the word level is not necessary for either training or recognition. Language and context models can be applied on several different levels and much related development of this technology has already been done in the field of speech recognition. Consequently, sign language recognition seems an ideal machine vision application of HMM technology, offering the benefits of problem scalability, well defined meanings, a pre-determined language model, a large base of users and immediate applications for a recognizer.

FCMs are fuzzy weighted directed graphs with feedback that create models that emulate the behaviour of complex decision processes using fuzzy causal relations. The existence of two causal relations of opposite sign between two nodes makes the graph of the FCM imbalanced. The degree to which the whole digraph of the FCM is balanced or imbalanced is given by the Balance Degree. Various types of Balance Degree exist for signed directed graphs. We proposed a new type of Balance degree that is suitable for FCMs. The new degree is evaluated by exhaustively searching all the paths that are created in the graph and gives an indication of the dynamical behaviour that we should expect from the FCM. This is important because the conclusions that we draw from the FCM are coming from the study of its dynamical behaviour.",

Selecting exemplars and clustering data around them is also important for enhancing the performance in evolutionary computation, multi-optima evolutionary search and differential evolution.

            "Abstract": "Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) is an Artificial Neural Networks technique that incorporates ideas from Fuzzy Logic, to create a Decision Support System. Using this strucrure we develop a qualitative model of the relationships that exist in the field of political decisions in the case of \u201cGreat Albania\u201d. The model that is constructed is examined statically using graph theory techniques to identify the direct vicious or virtuous cycles of the decision process. Additionally graph\u2018s density and the conceptual centrality of model\u2019s concepts are calculated. The dynamical behavior of the model is studied through computer simulations and conclusions are drawn for decisions to be taken. The role of Greece in the case of \u201cGreat Albania\u201d is examined and possible ways are identified that make FCM an important and useful tool for the decision makers. Conclusions are drawn for the use of FCM as a decision support system for political decisions in general.",

Basic matrix computations such as vector and matrix addition, dot product, outer product, matrix transpose, matrix - vector and matrix multiplication are very challenging computational kernels arising in scientific computing. In this paper, we parallelize those basic matrix computations using the multicore and parallel programming tools. Specifically, these tools are Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel Cilk++, Intel TBB, Intel ArBB, SMPSs, SWARM and FastFlow. The purpose of this paper is to present a quantitative and qualitative study of these tools for parallel matrix computations.

The first method is the static master-worker with uniform distribution strategy, the second one is the dynamic master-worker with allocation of subtexts and the third one is the dynamic master-worker with allocation of text pointers. Fur-ther, we propose a hybrid parallel method that combines the advantages of static and dynamic parallel methods in order to reduce the load imbal-ance and communication overhead. This hybrid method is based on the following optimal distribution strategy: the text collection is distributed proportional to workstation's speed. We evaluated the performance of four methods with clusters 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 heterogeneous workstations. The experimental results demonstrate that the dynamic allocation of text pointers and hybrid methods achieve better performance than the two original ones.",

The hidden RBF neurons in all the tree nodes of the hierarchy are composed of fully functional RBF Neural Networks that have the classical two synaptic link sets, one for the RBF centers and the other for the linear output weights. The Markov chain rule is specifically used in the RBF summations and permits this hierarchical functionality in a fractal-like fashion which supports a clear recursion. Thus the Neural Network operation is exactly the same at all levels. We further analyze the general framework where classical RBF Neural Network training algorithms can be applied, specifically for finding the centers and calculating the linear output weights. This framework is fast, simple and facilitates easy parallel implementations which are the main targets of this study.",

The array is based on parallelization of a recent LCS algorithm which consists of two phases, i.e. preprocessing and computation. The computation phase is based on bit-level dynamic programming approach. Implementations of the preprocessing and computation phases are discussed on the same processor array architecture for the LCS problem. Further, we propose a block processor array architecture which reduces the overall communication and time requirements.

At the end of the training phase no Peer will know anything else besides its own local data. This privacy-preserving obligation is a challenging problem for trainable combiners but is crucial in real world applications. Only classifiers are transmitted to other peers to validate their data and send back average accuracy rates in a classical asynchronous peer-to-peer execution cycle.

The use of GPUs as processing elements was very limited until recently, when the concept of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) was introduced. GPGPU made possible to exploit the processing power and the memory bandwidth of the GPUs with the use of APIs that hide the GPU hardware from programmers. This paper presents experimental results on the parallel processing for some well known on-line string matching algorithms using one such GPU abstraction API, the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).",

These implementations are based on the data allocation and dynamic load balancing strategies. The first implementation is the dynamic master-worker with allocation of vectors where the master distributes vectors (data) and computations to the workers whereas the second one is the dynamic master-worker with allocation of vector pointers where the vectors are supposed to be replicated among participating resources beforehand and the master distributes computations to the workers. We also report a set of numerical experiments on a heterogeneous platform where computational resources have different computing powers. Also, the workers are connected to the master by links of same capacities. The obtained experimental results demonstrate that the dynamic allocation of vector pointers achieve better performance than the original one for computing dot product computation.The paper also presents and verifies an accurate timing model to predict the performance of the proposed implementations on clusters of heterogeneous workstations. Through this model the viability of the proposed implementations can be revealed without the extra effort that would be needed to carry out real testing.",

In this paper we first describe the execution steps of this algorithm, then we proceed with extended experiments.
