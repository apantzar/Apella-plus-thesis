In this paper, we present efficient algorithms to construct and search a space-efficient data structure in the k-dimensional space that is based on Graph Dominance Drawing. Our algorithms construct this data structure in O (km) time, while it can be stored in O (kn) space. Any reachability query is answered in constant time, since no \u201cfalsely implied paths (fips)\u201d are introduced. We also present experimental results that show that the number of dimensions, k, in the solutions produced by our techniques is low. Additionally, we present a new method for constructing random DAGs with prespecified structure and density. The analysis of our experimental results reveals an interesting interplay between density and structure.",

These devices are often used to access social networks, route networks, or other kinds of networks that for example may deal with the job of the user. Although designing drawing algorithms and visualization systems tailored for mobile devices would be the best choice in this case (see, eg,[1]), this is often not possible, as for example the drawing of the network might be computed by some diagram server in a collaborative environment, or attached to an e-mail, or returned by a web application that does not consider limited display capabilities.

In many practical applications each graphical feature may have more than one label. The need for assigning multiple labels is necessary to display different attributes of an object. Even though many algorithms exist for the labeling problem, very little work has been directed towards positioning multiple labels per graphical feature in a map or drawing. We refer to this problem as the Multiple Label Placement (MLP) problem. In this paper we present a model and expand the rules that govern a good assignment of several labels per graphical feature. In addition we introduce techniques to solve this problem. We have applied these techniques to drawings of graphs, and we present very encouraging experimental results.",

Our technique uses the third dimension almost exclusively for the display of the isa relationships (links) while the property relationships (links) are placed on some layer (plane). Thus the semantic difference between isa links and property links, which should be as vertical or as horizontal as possible respectively, is emphasized.

            "Abstract": "An st-orientation of a biconnected undirected graph defines a directed graph with no cycles, a single source s and a single sink t. Given an undirected graph G as input, linear-time algorithms have been proposed for computing an st-orientation of G. Such an orientation is useful especially in graph drawing algorithms which use it at their first stage [23]. Namely, before they process the original undirected graph they receive as input, they transform it into an st-DAG, by computing an st-orientation of it. In this paper we observe that using st-orientations of different longest path lengths in various applications can result in different solutions, each one having its own merit. Guided by this intuition, we present results concerning applications of proposed algorithms for longest path parameterized st-orientations. Specifically, we show how to achieve considerable space savings (eg, O (n)) for visibility representations of planar graphs by using st-orientations computed by algorithms that can control the length of the longest path. Also, we apply our results to the graph coloring problem, where we use an st-orientation as an intermediate step to compute a good coloring of a graph, and to other problems, such as computing space-efficient orthogonal drawings and longest paths.",

            "Abstract": "Recent research has exploited graph theory in the development and implementation of an advanced electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis framework for modelling and visualizing cognitive brain functions under normal or pathological conditions. There is special interest in using graph theory to study brain networks, since it offers a unique perspective to the study of local and distributed brain interactions.Most brain disorders and cognitive brain functions remain largely unresolved. Imaging modalities like positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are valuable tools in identifying activations localized to specific brain regions (lobes). However, in comparison to classical electrophysiological techniques like the EEG, which capture the electrical activity that define neuronal communication, they represent indirect measures of neural activity and are characterized by rather poor temporal responses. All of these approaches focus on identifying the exact location of activations in the brain, which is a vital step towards understanding the brain\u2019s internal function. Modelling dynamic and synchronization phenomena in the brain will hopefully explain \u2018how\u2019psychological mechanisms function.",

The representation is modified so as to: 1) preserve the positions of the nodes relative to one another; and 2) simplify the visual representation of the graph by sharing drawn lines between different distinct edges in such a way as to enable the different distinct edges, despite such sharing, to still be recognized by a user.

            "Abstract": "Stable bacterial polymorphism on a single limiting resource may appear if between the evolved strains metabolic interactions take place that allow the exchange of essential nutrients [8]. Towards an attempt to predict the possible outcome of longrunning evolution experiments, a network based on the metabolic capabilities of homogeneous populations of every single gene knockout strain (nodes) of the bacterium E. coli is reconstructed. Potential metabolic interactions (edges) are allowed only between strains of different metabolic capabilities. Bacterial communities are determined by finding cliques in this network. Growth of the emerged hypothetical bacterial communities is simulated by extending the metabolic flux balance analysis model of Varma et al [2] to embody heterogeneous cell population growth in a mutual environment.Results from aerobic growth on 10 different carbon sources are presented. The upper bounds of the diversity that can emerge from single-cloned populations of E. coli such as the number of strains that appears to metabolically differ from most strains (highly connected nodes), the maximum clique size as well as the number of all the possible communities are determined. Certain single gene deletions are identified to consistently participate in our hypothetical bacterial communities under most environmental conditions implying a pattern of growth-condition-invariant strains with similar metabolic effects. Moreover, evaluation of all the hypothetical bacterial communities under growth on pyruvate reveals heterogeneous populations that can exhibit superior growth performance when compared to the performance of the \u2026",

It enables the user to prepare and analyze a diagrammatic description of requirements using the statechart notation. ViSta includes a template wizard, a graphical editor and a statechart visualization tool. The template wizard guides the user through the steps necessary for the extraction of relevant information from a textual description of requirements. This information is stored in a database that is used by the statechart visualization tool to automatically generate statechart layouts. The statechart visualization tool offers a framework that combines hierarchical drawing, labeling, and floorplanning techniques. Hence, the automatically produced drawings enjoy several important aesthetic properties: they emphasize the natural hierarchical decomposition of states into substates; they have a low number of edge crossings \u2026",

The VPH Network of Excellence (NoE) has been set up to help develop common standards, open source software, freely accessible data and model repositories, and various training and dissemination activities for the project. It is also working to coordinate the many clinically targeted projects that have been funded under the FP7 calls. An initial vision for the VPH was defined by the FP6 STEP project in 2006. In 2010, we wrote an assessment of the accomplishments of the first two years of the VPH in which we considered the biomedical science, healthcare and information and communications technology challenges facing the project (Hunter et al. 2010 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 368, 2595\u20132614 (doi:10.1098/rsta.2010.0048)). We proposed that a not-for-profit professional umbrella organization, the VPH Institute, should be established as a means of sustaining the VPH vision beyond the time-frame of the NoE. Here, we update and extend this assessment and in particular address the following issues raised in response to Hunter et al.: (i) a vision for the VPH updated in the light of progress made so far, (ii) biomedical science and healthcare challenges that the VPH initiative can address while also providing innovation opportunities for the European industry, and (iii) external changes needed in regulatory policy and business models to realize the full potential that the VPH has to offer to industry, clinics and society generally.",

More general requirements are that the number of edge crossings, the number of edge bends, the drawing area, etc., are kept low. These are well addressed by Orthogonal Drawings (OD), where edges are chains of horizontal and vertical segments (see, eg,[4]). Unfortunately, OD algorithms do not control the flow of the edges in a desired direction. Overloaded Orthogonal Drawing (OOD) is a recent visualization paradigm conceived for drawing directed graphs, that merges and enforces the benefits of HD and of OD [2]. Indeed, edges are still represented using only horizontal and vertical segments, and if the digraph is acyclic, any directed edge (u, v) is drawn as an upward-rightward polyline consisting of one bend point \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in studying the underlying neural mechanism of cognitive brain activity as well as in diagnosing certain pathologies. Noninvasive imaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and dynamic signal acquisition techniques such as quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) have been vastly used to estimate cortical connectivity and identify functional interdependencies among synchronized brain lobes. In this area, graph-theoretic concepts and tools are used to describe large scale brain networks while performing cognitive tasks or to characterize certain neuropathologies. Such tools can be of particular value in basic neuroscience and can be potential candidates for future inclusion in a clinical setting. This paper discusses the application of the high time resolution EEG to resolve interdependence patterns using both linear and nonlinear techniques. The network formed by the statistical dependencies between the activations of distinct and often well separated neuronal populations is further analyzed using a number of graph theoretic measures capable of capturing and quantifying its structure and summarizing the information that it contains. Finally, graph visualization reveals the hidden structure of the networks and amplifies human understanding. A number of possible applications of the graph theoretic approach are also listed. A freely available standalone brain visualization tool to benefit the healthcare engineering community is also provided (http://www.ics.forth.gr/bmi/tools.html).",

But when it comes to highdegree and massive graphs, even orthogonal drawings have difficulties producing a clean and simple visualization. In this paper we present a technique called Overloaded Orthogonal Drawing that greatly improves the readability by proposing a new vertex placement and reframing the orthogonal edge routing approach. We first place the vertices on grid points following a relaxed version of dominance drawing, called weak dominance condition. Edge routing is implied automatically by the vertex coordinates. In order to simplify these drawings we use an overloading technique of the edges. All algorithms are simple and easy to implement and can be applied to directed acyclic graphs, planar, non-planar and undirected graphs. We also present bounds on the number of bends and the area. Overloaded orthogonal drawings present several interesting properties such as efficient visual edge confirmation as well as clarity of the drawing.",

Additionally, we extend this framework, by bundling and drawing all the edges of the DAG in  time, using minimum extra width per path. We also provide some comparison to a well known hierarchical drawing framework, widely known as the Sugiyama framework, as a proof of concept. The experimental results show that our algorithms produce drawings that are better in area and number of bends, but worse for crossings in sparse graphs. Hence, our technique offers an interesting alternative for drawing hierarchical graphs. Finally, we present an  time algorithm that computes a specific order of the paths in order to reduce the total edge length and number of crossings and bends.",

It emphasizes the needs that led to the creation of this tool by presenting similar works in the field and by describing how our tool contributes to the existing scenery. It also describes the methods used for the calculation of the graph metrics (global network metrics and vertex metrics), which carry the brain network information. To make the methods clear and understandable, we use an exemplar dataset throughout the paper, on which the calculations and the visualizations are performed. This dataset consists of an alcoholic and a control group of subjects.",

Most previously existing algorithms restricted the attention to graphs of maximum degree four. Here we study orthogonal drawing algorithms that work for any input graph, and discuss different models for such drawings. Then we introduce the three-phase method, a generic technique to create high-degree orthogonal drawings.

            "Abstract": "QRS detection performance can depend on the type of noise present in each lead involved in the overall processing. A common approach to QRS detection is based on a QRS enhanced signal obtained from the derivatives of the pre-filtered leads. However, the signal pre-filtering cannot be able to perform a complete noise rejection and the use of derivatives can enhance the noise as well. In many cases the noise occurs only on one lead and the addition of a noisy lead to the QRS enhanced signal decreases the overall detection performances of the QRS detector. For this reason the noise estimation on each channel, providing information for the channel inclusion or rejection in building the QRS enhanced signal, can improve the overall performances of the QRS detector. The results have been evaluated on the 48 records of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database where each ECG record is composed by 2 leads \u2026",

A new class of efficient phylogeny programs allows for computation of large evolutionary trees comprising 500\u20131.000 organisms within a couple of hours on a single CPU under elaborate optimization criteria. However, it is difficult to extract the valuable information contained in those large trees without appropriate visualization tools. As potential solution we propose the application of treemaps to visualize large phylogenies (evolutionary trees) and improve knowledge-retrieval. In addition, we propose a hybrid tree/treemap representation which provides a detailed view of subtrees via treemaps while maintaining a contextual view of the entire topology at the same time. Moreover, we demonstrate how it can be deployed to visualize an evolutionary tree comprising 2.415 mammals. The respective software \u2026",

The aim of DAGView is to produce clear visualizations of directed acyclic graphs in which every edge and the potential existence of a path can be immediately spotted by the user. Several criteria that users identified as important in a layout are met, such as underlying grid, crossings and bends that appear perpendicular. The main algorithm is based on the layout of directed acyclic graphs but can be extended to handle directed graphs with cycles and undirected graphs, taking into account user preferences and/or constraints. Important tasks that are used in user studies are performed efficiently within the DAGView framework.",

Additionally, our approach has the feature that a few transitive edges are not drawn in the drawing, thus reducing the visual complexity of the resulting drawing. Furthermore, the problems involved in our framework require only polynomial time. The channel decomposition is a partition of the vertex set of the graph into channels, where a channel is a relaxed path. Our framework offers a suite of solutions depending upon the requirements, and it consists of only two steps:(a) the cycle removal step (if the directed graph contains cycles) and (b) the channel decomposition and hierarchical drawing step. Our framework does not introduce any dummy vertices and it keeps the vertices of a path/channel vertically aligned. The time complexity of the main drawing algorithms of our framework is O (km), where k is the number of paths/channels, typically much smaller than n (the number of vertices).",

            "Abstract": "Among the various frameworks in which electroencephalographic (EEG) signal synchronization has been traditionally formulated, the most widely studied and used is the coherence that is entirely based on frequency analysis. However, at present time it is possible to capture information about the temporal profile of coherence, which is particularly helpful in studying non-stationary time-varying brain dynamics, like the wavelet coherence (WC). In this paper we propose a new approach of studying brain synchronization dynamics by extending the use of WC to include certain statistically significant (in terms of signal coherence) time segments, to study and characterize any disturbances present in the functional connectivity network of schizophrenia patients. Graph theoretical measures and visualization provide the tools to study the \"disconnection syndrome\" as proposed for schizophrenia. Specifically, we analyzed \u2026",

Additionally, our approach has the advantage that only the necessary edges are drawn in the drawing, thus reducing the visual complexity of the resulting drawing. Furthermore, most problems involved in our framework require only polynomial time. Our framework offers a suite of solutions depending upon the requirements, and it consists of only two steps: (a) the cycle removal step (if the graph contains cycles) and (b) the channel decomposition and hierarchical drawing step. Our framework does not introduce any dummy vertices and it keeps the vertices of a channel vertically aligned. The time complexity of the main drawing \u2026",

The produced layers can be explored and combined by the user to gradually acquire details. We present a user study to test the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we performed an experimental analysis on popular force-directed graph drawing algorithms, in order to evaluate what is the algorithm that produces the smallest number of layers and if there is any correlation between the number of crossings and the number of layers of a graph layout.

Breast cancer is both genetically and histopathologically heterogeneous, and the underling development mechanisms remain largely unknown. Global expression analysis using microarrays offers unprecedented opportunities to obtain molecular signatures of the state of activity of diseased cells and patient samples. The predictive power of this approach is much greater than that of currently used approaches, but remains to be validated in prospective clinical studies. The PrognoChip project is based on the synergy between Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics, following the lines of the new raising discipline of Biomedical Informatics. In this context we are moving towards the specification and creation of an Integrated Clinico-Genomics Information Technology Environment (ICG-ITE) where, the smooth integration between the clinical and the genomics worlds as well as the intelligent processing of the underlying data, enables the identification of reliable and clinically valid (ie, in terms of prognosis) molecular (gene) markers.",

In this paper we customize these concepts and present experimental results that clearly show the interplay between bends, crossings and clarity. Additionally, our algorithms have direct applications to the important problem of showing and storing transitivity information of very large graphs and databases. Only a subset of the edges is drawn, thus reducing the visual complexity of the resulting drawing, and the memory requirements for storing the transitivity information. Our algorithms require almost linear time, , where  is the number of paths/channels,  and  is the number of vertices and edges, respectively. They produce progressively more abstract drawings of the input graph. No dummy vertices are introduced and the vertices of each path/channel are vertically aligned.",

Even though in practice a label is usually associated with a line (edge), point (node) or area, this method can be extended to produce labeling solution for any graphical feature with explicit geometric representation (in two or three dimensions). This method first finds a labeling solution for a set of graphical features G by eliminating a subset of the set of potential label placements for any member of G, and reducing the labeling problem to a maximum matching problem of a bipartite graph. Next, if there are graphical features in G that have no label placement assigned to them yet, a backtracking algorithm may be used to improve the space available for the labeled graphical features. It may be shown that the labeling problem is NP-hard if any graphical feature in G is a line or point. As a result, the GFLP problem cannot be solved in \u2026",

Examples of interesting inferences include the induction of the absence or presence of some causal relation between two variables never measured together. cSAT+ converts the problem to a series of SAT problems, obtaining leverage from the efficiency of state-of-the-art solvers. In our empirical evaluation, it is shown to outperform ION, the first algorithm solving a similar but more general problem, by two orders of magnitude.",

We present optimal parallel algorithms that construct graph layouts with O(n) maximum edge length, O(n2) area, and at most 2n+4 bends (for biconnected graphs) and 2.4n+2 bends (for simply connected graphs). All three of these quality measures for the layouts are optimal in the worst case for biconnected graphs. The algorithm runs on a CREW PRAM in O(log n) time with n/log n processors, thus achieving optimal time and processor utilization. Applications include VLSI layout, graph drawing, and wireless communication.",

            "Abstract": "We study planar drawings of directed graphs in the L-drawing standard. We provide necessary conditions for the existence of these drawings and show that testing for the existence of a planar L-drawing is an NP-complete problem. Motivated by this result, we focus on upward-planar L-drawings. We show that directed st-graphs admitting an upward-(resp. upward-rightward-) planar L-drawing are exactly those admitting a bitonic (resp. monotonically increasing) st-ordering. We give a linear-time algorithm that computes a bitonic (resp. monotonically increasing) st-ordering of a planar st-graph or reports that there exists none.",

            "Abstract": "Metabolic interactions involve the exchange of metabolic products among microbial species. Most microbes live in communities and usually rely on metabolic interactions to increase their supply for nutrients and better exploit a given environment. Constraint-based models have successfully analyzed cellular metabolism and described genotype-phenotype relations. However, there are only a few studies of genome-scale multi-species interactions. Based on genome-scale approaches, we present a graph-theoretic approach together with a metabolic model in order to explore the metabolic variability among bacterial strains and identify and describe metabolically interacting strain communities in a batch culture consisting of two or more strains. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the bacterium E. coli across different single-carbon-source conditions. A different diversity graph is constructed for each growth condition. The graph-theoretic properties of the constructed graphs reflect the inherent high metabolic redundancy of the cell to single-gene knockouts, reveal mutant-hubs of unique metabolic capabilities regarding by-production, demonstrate consistent metabolic behaviors across conditions and show an evolutionary difficulty towards the establishment of polymorphism, while suggesting that communities consisting of strains specifically adapted to a given condition are more likely to evolve. We reveal several strain communities of improved growth relative to corresponding monocultures, even though strain communities are not modeled to operate towards a collective goal, such as the community growth and we identify the range \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In a \\emph{fan-planar drawing} of a graph an edge can cross only edges with a common end-vertex. Fan-planar drawings have been recently introduced by Kaufmann and Ueckerdt, who proved that every -vertex fan-planar drawing has at most  edges, and that this bound is tight for . We extend their result, both from the combinatorial and the algorithmic point of view. We prove tight bounds on the density of constrained versions of fan-planar drawings and study the relationship between fan-planarity and -planarity. Furthermore, we prove that deciding whether a graph admits a fan-planar drawing in the variable embedding setting is NP-complete.",
