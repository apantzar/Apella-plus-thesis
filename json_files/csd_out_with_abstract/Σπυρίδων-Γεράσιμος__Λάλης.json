            "Abstract": "Energy costs contribute significantly to the total cost of operation for cloud and edge infrastructure providers. Both conventional (Voltage and Frequency Scaling) and more aggressive (undervolting, overclocking) techniques can be applied to reduce the energy footprint of the infrastructure and thus the cost of the operator. However, these techniques may affect the quality of service (QoS), potentially activating service level agreement (SLA) violation penalties for the provider. In this paper we model and study this tradeoff. We find that undervolting is the most effective of the three techniques in reducing infrastructure operation cost. We identify optimal operating points, and we study the effect of different parameters, such as the severity of SLA penalties, the length of the job and the existence of error protection mechanisms, on the optimal operating point and the extent of potential benefits.",

            "Abstract": "The proliferation of resourceful mobile devices that store rich, multidimensional and privacy-sensitive user data motivate the design of federated learning (FL), a machine-learning (ML) paradigm that enables mobile devices to produce an ML model without sharing their data. However, the majority of the existing FL frameworks rely on centralized entities. In this work, we introduce IPLS, a fully decentralized federated learning framework that is partially based on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). By using IPLS and connecting into the corresponding private IPFS network, any party can initiate the training process of an ML model or join an ongoing training process that has already been started by another party. IPLS scales with the number of participants, is robust against intermittent connectivity and dynamic participant departures/arrivals, requires minimal resources, and guarantees that the accuracy of the trained model quickly converges to that of a centralized FL framework with an accuracy drop of less than one per thousand.",

To this end, we present a script-based mechanism for letting nodes produce artificial sensor values, transparently to the application. The user can write and upload scripts, and activate/deactivate script execution for selected nodes and sensors, at any point in time, without changing the node firmware. Our implementation requires little memory and has negligible runtime overhead, thus can be adopted for resource-constrained nodes.",

Travel cost stands for the energy spent by the vehicle to move between locations. Refueling opportunities are offered at known locations where the vehicle can harvest or re-gain some of the lost energy. The objective is to visit a set of predefined locations without exhausting the energy of the vehicle. We describe the problem in a formal way, and propose a heuristic algorithm for taking routing decisions at runtime. We evaluate the algorithm for a grid topology as a function of the number of locations to be visited and the autonomy degree of the vehicle, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves good results as long as the energy margins are not very tight.",

            "Abstract": "Service migration between datacenters can reduce the network overhead within a cloud infrastructure; thereby, also improving the quality of service for the clients. Most of the algorithms in the literature assume that the client access pattern remains stable for a sufficiently long period so as to amortize such migrations. However, if such an assumption does not hold, these algorithms can take arbitrarily poor migration decisions that can substantially degrade system performance. In this paper, we approach the issue of performing service migrations for an unknown and dynamically changing client access pattern. We propose an online algorithm that minimizes the inter-datacenter network, taking into account the network load of migrating a service between two datacenters, as well as the fact that the client request pattern may change \u201cquickly\u201d, before such a migration is amortized.

            "Abstract": "Several applications may trade-off output quality for energy efficiency by computing only an approximation of their output. Current approaches to software-based approximate computing often require the programmer to specify parts of the code or data structures that can be approximated. A largely unaddressed challenge is how to automate the analysis of the significance of code for the output quality. To this end, we propose a methodology and toolset for automatic significance analysis. We use interval arithmetic and algorithmic differentiation in our profile-driven yet mathematical approach to evaluate the significance of input and intermediate variables for the output of a computation. Our methodology effectively matches decisions of a domain expert in significance characterization for a set of benchmarks, and in some cases offers new insights.

Metacomputations are expressed in the form of workflows thereby enabling a flexible combination of data and program objects that can reside on different servers or grid resources. Workflow descriptions are associated with ontology concepts and can be activated as a side-effect of searching for information to produce new data on demand.

However, preventing discrimination, or even detecting ongoing discrimination, is difficult in practice. Instead, our solution (which we call surelinks) forces the discriminator to introduce more easily detectable loss and delay, and then moves traffic away from offending paths. Surelinks combine three techniques: encryption of aggregate traffic between edge nodes, multipath routing to circumvent performance problems, and stealth probing for accurate measurements in an adversarial setting. Experiments with our prototype system, implemented in the Click router, demonstrate that surelinks have practical overhead comparable to destination-based forwarding.",

Thus we focus on what we refer to as soft actuation: issuing low-key, non-verbal hints to the user, prompting him to optionally perform specific actuating actions.

While it is possible to determine a safe undervolting level for each application, typically only the most conservative setting is applied statically across all workloads. In this paper, we go a step further and investigate the gains that can be achieved by dynamically and transparently changing the level of CPU undervolting at runtime. To enable this functionality, we design and implement a novel, OS-level, context-aware dynamic undervolting mechanism, able to decide and apply voltage levels according to the specific tolerance of each workload that executes on a multicore CPU at a particular time. Our mechanism can further differentiate between the user-and kernel-level code executed within the same application thread, enabling the exploitation of differences in their undervolting \u2026",

On the other hand, suitable mechanisms are used to monitor the execution of the applications at runtime in order to check conformance to the restrictions posed by the authorities, as well as to handle related violations in an automated way.

In particular, it is important to tolerate failures of the mission control computer as smoothly as possible, avoiding roll-backs that might lead to inconsistencies.

Given that many resources are contributed by machines located at a far distance from the PC, we needed a network file system protocol that operates over high latency links, and which is able to handle synthetic files in a satisfactory way. A further requirement was that legacy applications, designed for the original file system protocol, should continue working as transparently as possible, with minimal or no changes.

While having many gadgets can be great fun, the user will also be faced with the burden of managing a highly decentralized, uncoordinated, heterogeneous and dynamic device ecosystem. Currently, the problem is typically \u201csolved\u201d by letting the user act as a mediator between these devices. This approach, apart from not being much fun, cannot possibly scale to a large number of devices. As another, relatively recent option, data and applications can be placed in the cloud. However, the flexible exploitation of the hardware and software resources of other devices remains a challenge. The Octopus system [1, 2] tackles this problem by applying the principle of centralization (as the cloud paradigm) in conjunction with an open, simple and flexible resource sharing architecture. All applications run in a single computer, called the computer, while every other smart device connects to the computer over the network to provide special resources or act as interactive terminals for these applications. Like Octopus itself, the standard GUI terminal support for the Octopus is implemented on top of Inferno [3]. Even though Inferno has been ported on many platforms (eg, Linux, Windows, MacOSx, Plan9, Solaris and BSD), in practice only a few people will go through the installation process merely so that they can run an Octopus terminal. Moreover, for all practical purposes, one cannot expect that Inferno will or should be ported on all platforms.

In this paper, we study the problem of identifying an assignment scheme between the interacting components of an application, such as processes and virtual machines, and the computing nodes of a cloud system, such that the total amount of resources consumed by the respective application is minimized. Because centralized solutions are deemed unsuitable for large distributed systems or large-scale applications, we propose a fully distributed algorithm (called DRA) to overcome scalability issues.

A central problem is to plan these missions so as to minimize the completion time. This planning must also consider the typically limited autonomy of drones and the need to change their batteries in order to support longer missions. The problem becomes even harder when multiple drones are involved and there is uncertainty about the energy that will be consumed to move between the points of interest in the target area. In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm for tackling this problem in an online fashion, which takes into account the actual energy costs that occur during the mission in order to adapt the planned paths. The algorithm works in an optimistic way, assuming that the costs will not always be the worst possible. Still, it guarantees that all vehicles will always \u2026",

Consequently, there is a need for more energy efficient servers to empower traditional centralized (Cloud) data-centers as well as emerging decentralized data-centers at the Edges of the Internet. In this paper, we present our approach, which aims at developing a new class of micro-servers\u2013the UniServer-that exceed the conservative energy and performance scaling boundaries by introducing novel mechanisms at all layers of the design stack. The main idea lies on the realization of the intrinsic hardware heterogeneity and the development of mechanisms that will automatically expose the unique varying capabilities of each hardware component and allow their operation at new extended operating points. Low overhead schemes are employed to monitor and predict the hardware behavior and report it to the system software, which is responsible for optimizing the system operation in terms of energy or performance, while guaranteeing non-disruptive operation under extended operating points. To efficiently manage any potential fault that may incur under extended margins, we aim at identifying critical/vulnerable software structures and developing low cost techniques for protecting them. This eventually, allows us to enhance the fault tolerance of the overall system software that is representative of any state of the art cloud data-center, since it adopts a virtualization environment as well as popular resource management packages.

            "Abstract": "One of the challenges in drone-based systems is to support automated landing with a high precision that goes beyond the accuracy of standard off-the-shelf GPS. Various efforts have been made to support this, mainly using vision-based and infrared sensors. However, using a single sensor inevitably introduces a single point of failure. To address this problem, we combine a vision-based sensor that detects special visual markers with a sensor that tracks an infrared beacon. We also support a more cautious landing approach for the case where these sensors temporarily fail to detect their targets. We implement our solution in the context of a mature autopilot framework, through modular extensions that are transparent to the rest of the software stack. We evaluate these mechanisms by conducting field experiments using a custom drone, activating faults in the individual precision landing sensor subsystems in a \u2026",

In this paper we tackle RMP when multicast transfers are available. We give a formal problem statement as a Mixed Integer Programming problem. It turns out that the problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we resolve to scheduling heuristics in order to find good solutions. Through simulations we identify different tradeoffs between performance and execution time and conclude on the most attractive approaches.",

Given that this problem is NP-complete, we introduce several different heuristics to solve it, and evaluate them via simulations.",

In this paper, we present two agent migration algorithms with the aim of minimizing the total network overhead. The first one takes independent single agent migration decisions, while the second one considers groups of agents for migration. Both algorithms work in a fully distributed fashion based on the knowledge available locally at each node, and can be used both for one-shot initial application deployment as well as for the continuous updating of agent placement. We also propose two methodologies to tackle the problem when WSN nodes have limited capacity \u2026",

The runtime system can apply a number of different policies to decide whether it will execute less-significant tasks accurately or approximately. The experimental evaluation indicates that our system can achieve an energy reduction of up to 83% compared with a fully accurate execution and up to 35% compared with an approximate version employing loop perforation.

            "Abstract": "Wireless communications are vulnerable against radio frequency (RF) jamming which might be caused either intentionally or unintentionally. A particular subset of wireless networks, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) which incorporate a series of safety-critical applications, may be a potential target of RF jamming with detrimental safety effects. To ensure secure communication and defend it against this type of attacks, an accurate detection scheme must be adopted. In this paper we introduce a detection scheme that is based on supervised learning. The machine-learning algorithms, KNearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forests (RF), utilize a series of features among which is the metric of the variations of relative speed (VRS) between the jammer and the receiver that is passively estimated from the combined value of the useful and the jamming signal at the receiver. To the best of our knowledge, this metric has never been utilized before in a machine-learning detection scheme in the literature. Through offline training and the proposed KNN-VRS, RF-VRS classification algorithms, we are able to efficiently detect various cases of Denial of Service Attacks (DoS) jamming attacks, differentiate them from cases of interference as well as foresee a potential danger successfully and act accordingly.",

WANs and wireless networks have achieved high throughput, but limitations on the speed of light put a strict boundary on latency. New protocols have to be deployed in order to reduce the effects of latency. At the same time, legacy systems and applications designed for the original protocols should continue working as transparently as possible, with minimal or no changes. The present work is centered on network file system protocols used both to control devices and access data files. These protocols are strongly affected by high latency. This is the case of Styx, a protocol currently used by Grid middleware for scientific workflows, supercomputer systems, embedded device controllers, and ubiquitous computing environments. This paper describes Op, a new file protocol we implemented to bridge Styx over high-latency links.

A popular alternative to datagram-and stream-based communication is the Publish/Subscribe (P/S) paradigm, where message forwarding and reception is done based on a topic or content descriptions instead of an address. Several middleware systems have been built to support this form of communication, on top of the socket API. Taking a different approach, we discuss how P/S networking can be supported through the socket API, so that this can serve as a universal interface for supporting different communication abstractions. To this end we introduce a new address family and extend the semantics of selected socket primitives to support P/S functions \u2026",

However, that implies that certain threads will be unable to exploit performance enhancing features which are available on selected cores and exposed to the ISA, through specialized instructions.

Trans4SCIF library is primarily intended for high-throughput applications. It uses RDMA transfers over the native SCIF support, in a way that is transparent for the application, which has the illusion of using conventional stream sockets. We also discuss the integration of Trans4SCIF with the ZeroMQ messaging library, used extensively by several applications running at CERN. We show that this can lead to a substantial, up to 3x, increase of application throughput compared to the default TCP/IP transport option.",

For non-significant tasks, the developer can also supply less costly, approximate versions. The target energy consumption for a given execution is specified when the application is launched.

            "Abstract": "The state of the ocean evolves and its dynamics involves transitions occurring on multiple scales. For efficient and rapid interdisciplinary forecasting, ocean observing and prediction systems must have the same behavior and adapt to the ever-changing dynamics. The present research aims to set the basis of a distributed system for real-time interdisciplinary ocean field and uncertainty forecasting with adaptive modeling and adaptive sampling. The scientific goal is to couple physical and biological oceanography with ocean acoustics. The technical goal is to build a dynamic system based on advanced infrastructures, distributed/Grid computing and efficient information retrieval and visualization interfaces. Importantly, the system combines a suite of modern legacy physical models, acoustic models and data assimilation schemes with new adaptive modeling and adaptive sampling software. The legacy systems are encapsulated at the binary level using software component methodologies. Measurement models are utilized to link the observed data to the dynamical model variables and structures. With adaptive sampling, the data acquisition is dynamic and aims to minimize the predicted uncertainties, maximize the sampling of key dynamics and maintain overall coverage. With adaptive modeling, model improvements are dynamic and aim to select the best model structures and parameters among different physical or biogeochemical parameterizations. This presentation outlines and illustrates the concept, architecture and components of such a Dynamic Data Driven Application System (DDDAS). Current technical and scientific progress is \u2026",

Most agent placement and migration algorithms proposed in the literature, assume that the communication rates between agents remain stable for a sufficiently long time to amortize the migration costs. Then, the problem is that frequent changes in the application-level communication may lead to several non-beneficial agent migrations, which may actually increase the total network cost, instead of decreasing it. To tackle this problem, we propose two distributed algorithms that take migration decisions in an online fashion, trying to deal with fluctuations in agent communication. The first algorithm is more of theoretical value, as it assumes infinite storage to keep information about the message exchange \u2026",

In addition, significant flexibility can be gained by letting clients install and run custom, application-specific sensing and processing tasks directly on the nodes of the WSN. However, this raises the issue of how clients can interact with such tasks in parallel to the regular access of the WSN. We propose an approach for supporting both information flows simultaneously and in a uniform way, via an open web-based service interface that can be flexibly extended through appropriate XML descriptions which specify the format of the respective message exchanges. This allows clients to perform both the regular interactions with the WSN and the custom interactions with the application tasks that have been deployed on the sensor \u2026",

The problem this approach faces is that Styx behaves badly for high latency links, no matter what the bandwidth is because of the RPC roundVtrip time accumulation. We have implemented a new protocol, Op (Octopus Protocol), which reduces drastically the num ber of RPCs needed for the operations and so behaves well for high latency links. Furthermore, we have implemented a client and a server that can be used to interconnect different Styx islands in a transparent way, keeping all other software unaware of the new protocol.

            "Abstract": "Many embedded wireless systems can benefit from causal and totally ordered communication (CATOC) in order to achieve reliability and logical consistency at the application level. In this paper, we present a sequencer-based CATOC protocol designed to exploit the physical broadcast capability of wireless interfaces. Under ideal conditions, the propagation and delivery of an application message to the entire group costs only 2 packet transmissions, or just 1 transmission if the message originates from the sequencer. Furthermore, we propose different flow-control policies for reducing the number of collisions in case of contention, as well as to improve fairness among the members of the process group. We evaluate our implementation over an IEEE 802.15.4 network for different group sizes and application messaging rates, showing that the choice of the flow-control policy can radically affect protocol performance.",

            "Abstract": "As the domain of cyber-physical systems continues to grow, an increasing number of tightly-coupled distributed applications will be implemented on top of wireless networking technologies. Some of these applications, including collaborative robotic teams, work in a coordinated fashion, whereby a distinguished node takes control decisions and sends commands to other nodes, which in turn perform the requested action/operation and send back a reply/acknowledgment. The implementation of such interactions via reliable point-to-point flows may lead to a significant performance degradation due to collisions, especially when the system operates close to the capacity of the communication channel. We propose a coordinated protocol which exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless medium in order to support this application-level interaction with a minimal number of message transmissions and predictable \u2026",

Shared-ISA asymmetric multicore processors overcome programmability problems in disjoint-ISA systems and enhance single-ISA architectures with instruction based asymmetry. In such a design, processors share a common, baseline ISA and performance enhanced (PE) cores extend the baseline ISA with instructions that accelerate performance-critical operations. To exploit asymmetry, the scheduler should be able to migrate threads based on their acceleration potential.",

In fact, a given replica placement scheme may have to be redefined as object popularity changes. Given two replica placement schemes X  old  and X  new , the Replica Migration Problem (RMP) is to compute a schedule of replica transfers and deletions that lead from X  old  to X  new  in the shortest time possible. In this paper, we provide a rigorous problem formulation and prove that even for trivial cases RMP is intractable. We also propose a set of heuristics and evaluate them for different scenarios using simulations.",

            "Abstract": "CPUs typically operate at a voltage which is higher than what is strictly required, using voltage margins to account for process variability and anticipate any combination of adverse operating conditions. However, these worst-case scenarios occur rarely, if ever, thus the operating voltage is overly pessimistic resulting in excessive power dissipation which leads to decreased performance under power capping. In this paper, we investigate the impact of reducing voltage margins beyond the nominal level on the efficiency of CPU power capping mechanisms, for three commercial systems, two Applied Micro ARMv8 micro-servers (X-Gene2 and X-Gene3) and an Intel x86-64 (Xeon E3). We show that CPU power capping at reduced voltage margins compared with Intel's RAPL and Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS) mechanisms results in performance improvement by up to 64% and 24% on average, respectively.

In ADIOS, coarse grain distributed computations, involving several different program components, are structured according to a distributed Model-View-Controller architecture. Design support is offered via interfaces and a base class, through which the fundamental behavior of program components is established within a concrete framework. In addition, appropriate communication mechanisms are provided to back up the data exchange between the various components. Consisting of only few Java classes, ADIOS is lightweight and promotes disciplined prototyping of metacomputations while allowing for the integration of legacy code.",

Among the various factors that affect the degree to which these margins are actually needed to avoid errors during program execution, the impact of compiler and source code optimizations has not been explored yet.

Objects, appliances and physical spaces are also being augmented with digital features, resulting in a ubiquitous infrastructure that can be controlled through computer technology. As we move beyond the physical\u2013and mental\u2013boundaries of the desktop, one of the key challenges becomes to combine the devices and artifacts that are available, whether carried by people or situated in a given environment, to support personal computing. Moreover, this must be done in a way that shields users from the technical intricacies of the computer so that they are able to focus on the task at hand without having to continuously deal with setting up and providing input to the system. In the 2WEAR project (http://2wear. ics. forth. gr) we explore the concept of a personal system that is formed by putting together computing elements in an ad-hoc fashion using short-range radio. Certain elements are embedded into wearable objects, such as a wristwatch and small computing modules that can be placed inside a wallet. Others have the form of more conventional portable computers, like PDAs and mobile phones. Also, there are stationary elements, some of which are visible, such as big screens and home appliances, while others are not directly perceivable by the user, such as network access points and backend servers. This setting deviates from the conventional computing paradigm in significant ways.

In this paper, we introduce the mechanism of programmable virtual onboard sensors, for letting sensor nodes produce artificial sensor values as dictated by the user, transparently to the application. Virtual onboard sensors are programmed using a simple script-like language, which is interpreted at runtime on the wireless sensor nodes. The user can deploy sensor scripts in the WSN and activate the virtual sensor mode for selected nodes and sensors at any point in time, without changing the node firmware and without stopping the application that runs on the nodes.

To address this challenge, we propose an active replication approach adapted to the characteristics of this particular type of system. Our solution relies on signed messages and requires N= 2\u00d7 f+ 1 mission controller replicas to tolerate f Byzantine failures.

Reducing the network traffic caused by the application components is a crucial issue for the increase in the lifetime of wireless embedded systems, since it is widely known that the communication cost plays the most significant role in the energy consumption of embedded devices. To this end, most placement algorithms place or move an agent towards the center of gravity of the communication workload. However, if the target node does not have enough capacity, the attempt is usually aborted. In this paper, we introduce eviction-enabled algorithms that allow nodes to free capacity by forcing a locally hosted agent to move to another node, even at a loss, to accept a new and potentially more beneficial agent \u2026",

This world is far from perfection: users face decentralized, uncoordinated, heterogeneous, and highly dynamic, practically uncontrolled environments. It is hard to develop and deploy applications for such a world. One of the aims of pervasive computing is to be able to build applications that could be used from anywhere, and than could exploit resources available anywhere. That is, today, it is difficult to use different resources smoothly, unless one sits in front of the computer where they were deployed. We argue that one way to solve this problem is to first apply centralization as a design principle, and then recognize the existence of other computers running their native OS\u2019s, importing their devices and controlling them from a central computer. Doing so it would be possible both, to easily build systems that can leverage on all the devices available to a given user, independently of its location, and to easily use those systems. Our preliminary work, derived from the Plan B OS, strongly suggests so. This paper describes the evolution of Plan B, called Octopus, designed along this principle.",

At the same time, it can be useful to let clients deploy custom sensing and processing tasks directly on the sensor nodes.

We propose an approach for adopting a unified web-based interface for both information flows. This way, WSN clients do not have to deal with different interface technologies. Moreover, the gateway of the WSN can handle both flows using the same protocol translation engine.

The significance-aware runtime system uses an application-specific analytical energy model to identify the degree of concurrency and approximation that maximizes quality while meeting user-specified energy constraints.

The platform does not rely on pre-planned infrastructure; instead, it exploits objects that are already available in the home and exposes their joint sensing, actuating and computing capabilities to home automation applications. We advocate an incremental process of the platform formation and introduce tangible, object-like artifacts for representing important platform functions. One of those artifacts, the application pill, is a tiny object with a minimal user interface, used to carry the application, as well as to start and stop its execution and provide hints about its operational status. We also emphasize streamlining the user\u2019s interaction with the platform. The user engages any UI-capable object of his choice to configure applications, while applications issue notifications and alerts exploiting whichever available objects can be used for that purpose. Finally, the paper briefly describes an actual implementation of the presented end-user model.",
