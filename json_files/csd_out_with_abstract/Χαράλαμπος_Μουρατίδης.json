            "Abstract": "Developers face many challenges in the development of modern information systems. These challenges are mainly associated with characteristics that modern information systems need to demonstrate, such as openness, variety, adaptability, interoperability, and security. Although many new techniques and technologies are being developed on a regular basis, to enable developers to deal with most of these challenges, security engineering has not yet received the attention it deserves.Security engineering of information systems is concerned mainly with methods providing cost-e\u00a4 ective and operationally e\u00a4 ective protection of information systems from undesirable events (Lane, 1985). Usually the goal when developing an information system is to provide as much security as possible, sometimes trading security requirements o\u00a4 against other functional and nonfunctional requirements. To help developers to perform such trade-o\u00a4 s and develop, as much as possible, secure information systems, methods, techniques, and tools are needed. Thus, it has been extensively argued (Devanbu & Stubblebine, 2000; McDermott & Fox, 1999; Tryfonas, Kiountouzis, & Poulymenakou, 2001) in the literature, especially during the last few years, that it is necessary to integrate security issues into software engineering and introduce methods and languages that will consider security as an integral part of the information systems development process. However, up to now, the literature has failed to provide evidence of such methods and languages. In other words, we lack a complete methodology that will provide methods and processes to guide developers \u2026",

However, organizations are still facing difficulties in identifying a flow for executing, in a coherent, linear and effective way, these activities, and a complete toolkit for supporting this.

For example, NASA has proposed missions where multiagent systems, working in space or on other planets, will need to do their own reasoning about safety issues that concern not only themselves but also that of their mission.

These systems should be able to securely negotiate such arrangements and decide which credentials can be requested and which credentials may be disclosed. Such systems may encounter environments that are only partially understood and where they must learn for themselves which aspects of their environment are safe and which are dangerous.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years maritime logistics infrastructures are the global links among societies and economies. This challenges adversaries to intrude on the cyber-dependent ICTs by performing high-level intelligent techniques. A potential cyber-attack on such infrastructures can cause tremendous damages starting from supply chain service disruption ending up with threatening the whole human welfare. Current risk management policies embed significant limitations in terms of capturing the specific security requirements of ICTs and control/monitoring devices, such as IoT platforms, satellites and time installations, which are primary functioning for the provision of Maritime Logistics and Supply Chain (MLoSC) services. This work presents a novel risk assessment methodology capable of addressing the security particularities and specificities of the complex nature of SCADA infrastructures and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) of the Maritime Logistics Industry. The methodology identifies asset vulnerabilities and threats to estimate the cyber-risks and their cascading effects within the supply chain, introducing a set of subsequent security assessment services. The utilization of these services is demonstrated via a critical, real-life SCADA scenario indicating how they can facilitate supply chain operators in comprehending the threat landscape of their infrastructures and guide them how to adopt optimal mitigation strategies to counter or eliminate their cyber-risks.

In that respect, providing stakeholders with quantifiable evidences that the countermeasures deployed on the system are operating adequately is an important step towards better control of security failures for network administrators on one hand, and an increase in end users' trust in using these systems on the other. It is in that perspective that BUGYO, a methodology to assess the security of telecommunication networks and services in terms of assurance levels, was proposed to address the shortcomings of existing security assurance and risks management methodologies in measuring \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) is a software paradigm that has grasped the attention of researchers the last few years. As a result, many different methods have been introduced to enable developers develop multi-agent systems. However, so far, security requirements have been mainly neglected, and the common approach towards the inclusion of security within a system is to identify security requirements after the definition of the system. This approach has provoked the emergence of computer systems afflicted with security vulnerabilities. In this paper we propose an analysis, based on the measures of criticality (how critical an actor of the system is) and complexity (represents the effort required by the actors of the system to achieve the requirements that have been imposed to them), which aims to identify possible bottlenecks of a multi-agent system with respect to security. An integrated agent-based health and social care information system is used as a case study throughout this paper.",

However, as more and more companies are beginning to embrace the trend, it has also become clearer that the model offers unprecedented opportunities to cybercriminals: either by enabling them to compromise a myriad of services in a single shot or by allowing cyber-criminals to amplify their capabilities through a leverage of the technology offered by the cloud.This paper highlights the importance of an informed choice of a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in minimising one's exposure to the insecurity of a cloud context. The paper proposes a well-defined approach, known as the Complete-Auditable-Reportable or C.A.RE, as a way to minimise one's exposure to the insecurity we live within the cloud. The C.A.RE approach helps to determine the adequacy of a CSP \u2026",

To retain the underlying business behaviour during their modernisation, the MARBLETM framework has been developed for the extraction of business process models from their source code. Building on top of that work, in this paper we propose an integrated approach for transforming the extracted legacy process models into Secure Tropos goal models. Such models facilitate the elicitation of security requirements in a high level of abstraction, which are then incorporated back into the process models of the modernised systems as security features. Therefore high level models can be derived from legacy source code with minimal manual intervention, where security can be elaborated by non-technical stakeholders in alignment with organisational objectives.",

However, a careful analysis of software development processes shows that the definition of security requirements is, usually, considered after the design of the system. This is, mainly, due to the fact that agent oriented software engineering methodologies have not integrated security concerns throughout their developing stages. The integration of security concerns during the whole range of the development stages could help towards the development of more secure multiagent systems. In this paper we introduce a constraint-based approach that extends the Tropos methodology in order to model security concerns throughout the whole development process. A description of the new concepts is given along with a security oriented process that integrates these concepts in Tropos.",

The primary aim of this paper is to explore the current literature in the ISMS as specified by the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, aiming to provide a mapping of their contributions with the requirements of the standard. An objective of this study is to explore the ways in which the literature addresses the requirements of the ISMS. This study uses semi-quantitative analysis in order to gain insights into the concepts and techniques around the ISMS and to systematically obtain data to help with identifying the research gaps. One of the findings of this review is to encourage to benefit from available literature and to develop an ISMS to promote their corporate compliance with a well-established standard. The most striking result from the review is that the majority of approaches proposed by scholars between 2005 to 2018 are with limited support in adopting the information security management system. Another important finding is that almost all available approaches fundamentally lack the motivation to focus on the analysis and application of the ISMS with no single study enable organisations to adopt the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.",

We believe that security being a multi-faceted problem, a single security ontology is not enough to guide SR Engineering (SRE) efficiently. Indeed, security ontologies only focus on technical and domain independent aspects of security. Therefore, one can hypothesize that domain knowledge is needed too.

            "Abstract": "Advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have had significant impact on every-day life and have allowed us to share, store and manipulate information easily and at any time. On the other hand, such situation also raises important privacy concerns. To deal with such concerns, the literature has identified the need to introduce a Privacy by Design (PbD) approach to support the elicitation and analysis of privacy requirements and their implementation through appropriate Privacy Enhancing Technologies. However, and despite all the work presented in the literature, there is still a gap between privacy design and implementation. This paper presents a set of Privacy Process Patterns that can be used to bridge that gap. To demonstrate the practical application of such patterns, we instantiate them in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), we use them in conjunction with the Privacy Safeguard \u2026",

Our adopted MBS approach is underpinned by a metamodel independent of any specific methodology. It allows for security considerations to be embedded within any situated agent methodology which then prescribes security considerations within its work products. Using a standard model-driven engineering (MDE) approach, these work products are initially constructed as high abstraction models and then transformed into more precise models until code-specific models can be produced. A multi-agent system case study is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed security-aware metamodel.",

            "Abstract": "It is widely recognised that successful online systems are not those that simply fulfil some functional specifications, but rather systems that are developed to also meet a number of non-functional requirements such as security, reliability and trust. It is also generally accepted that the development of quality online systems is not anymore just the task of single individuals or mono-cultural teams but it often involves diverse and disperse teams with members from different cultures and backgrounds. Some non-functional requirements (such as security or reliability) enjoy a general consensus, independent of the cultural background of the developers. Unfortunately, this is not the case for trust, despite the growing interest in trustworthy information systems. The very nature of trust indicates that it is understood differently by different individuals and relates to personal experiences more than other non-functional requirements. In this paper we identify the field of study to support the inclusion of considerations regarding trust in the design of online systems, to provide the understanding and support that is in par with security or reliability.",

However, this approach often leads to problems, which translate into security vulnerabilities. From the viewpoint of the traditional security paradigm, it should be possible to eliminate such problems through better integration of security and systems engineering. This paper argues for the need to develop a methodology that considers security as an integral part of the whole system development process. The paper contributes to the current state of the art by proposing an approach that considers security concerns as an integral part of the entire system development process and by relating this approach with existing work. The different stages of the approach are described with the aid of a case study; a health and social care information system.",

            "Abstract": "\u200b Privacy is a burden for most organizations, the more complex and wider an organization is, the harder to manage and enforce privacy is. GDPR and other regulations on privacy impose strict constraints that must be coherently enforced, considering also privacy needs of organization and their users. Furthermore, organizations should allow their users to express their privacy needs easily, even when the process that manages users' data is complex and involves multiple organizations. Many research work consider the problem using simplistic examples, with solutions proposed that never actually touch pragmatic problems of real, large organizations, with thousands of users and terabytes of personal and sensitive data. This book faces the privacy management problem targeting actual large organizations, such as public administrations, including stakeholders in the process of definition of the solution and evaluating the results with its actual integration in four large organizations. The contribution of this book is twofold: a privacy platform that can be customized and used to manage privacy in large organizations; and the process for the design of such a platform, from a state-of-the-art survey on privacy regulations, through the definition of its requirements, its design and its architecture, until the evaluation of the platform.",

These systems are used not only by major corporations and governments but also by individual users. Such wide use of information systems has resulted in these systems containing a large amount of critical information, which inevitably need to remain secure. Therefore, although it is important to ensure that software systems are developed according to the user needs (functional requirements), it is equally important to ensure that these systems are secure. However, traditionally, security is considered after the definition of the system, meaning that security mechanisms are fitted into pre-existing designs. Usually, in practise, a fit-all solution is assumed where security mechanisms, such as authentication, are inserted into the system",

Thus, security and safety are two central issues when developing and deploying such systems.In complex and rich environments, such as multiagent system environments, it is often necessary to involve the agents of the system in achieving some of these design goals, by making the goals explicit for the agent itself. For example, the agent must be aware of user-specified safety conditions if it is going to avoid violating them. This often means that an agent needs to be able to identify, assess, and mitigate many of the risks it faces. This is particularly true when the agent is going to be deployed in dangerous environments without immediate user input, for example, command of a spacecraft where communication with mission control involves considerable delays.",

Despite the many advantages, such as economic benefit, a rapid elastic resource pool, and on-demand service, the paradigm also creates challenges for both users and providers. There are issues, such as unauthorized access, loss of privacy, data replication, and regulatory violation that require adequate attention. A lack of appropriate solutions to such challenges might cause risks, which may outweigh the expected benefits of using the paradigm. In order to address the challenges and associated risks, a systematic risk management practice is necessary that guides users to analyze both benefits and risks related to cloud based systems.

            "Abstract": "The term security assurance has been used in the computer science literature to express the confidence that one has in the strength of the security measures. The need for a methodology to measure current security assurance levels of a system has been reported in the literature as vital in order to maintain and improve the overall security. However, a scrutiny of the literature reveals that in the area of IT security assurance, a large number of research questions still remain without an answer. Although a number of works have been presented in recent years, especially with respect to assurance metrics development, little effort has been made in developing a robust operational methodology for the evaluation of IT service infrastructures security assurance. This paper captures the current status of research efforts made in the field of security assurance evaluation. It collects previous and current academic, normalization and commercial work on security assurance, and establishes a comprehensive state of the art in the domain. In addition, the paper outlines the general features of an ongoing work aiming at the development of a security assurance evaluation framework that takes into account the evolving and ubiquitous IT infrastructures. The novelty of this ongoing work lies not only on the adaptability of the security assurance evaluation system to the evolving infrastructure model but also on the use of a \u201cbottomup\u201d approach in evaluating the security assurance level of a service using aggregation techniques. The methodology is intended to assist network managers in addressing more promptly security failures within the infrastructure as well as to \u2026",

For research, GIS are often used in conjunction with other technologies to form geocomputational environments or are at the core of location-based services (LBS). Given this technological heterogeneity coupled with the complexity of spatial data and the phenomena they represent, we discuss in this paper the applicability of the agent-oriented paradigm to GIS. However, enhanced features are needed for agent technology to be effective in the GIS domain. In this paper we present the structure of such an advanced feature.

Specifically, theoretical proposals for the development of reusable security-related method fragments from the agent-oriented methodology Secure Tropos are discussed. Since the OPF repository has already been enhanced by fragments from Tropos and other non-security-focussed agent-oriented software development methodologies, the only method fragments from Secure Tropos not already contained in this repository are those that are specifically security-related. These are identified, clearly defined and recommended for inclusion in the current OPF repository of method fragments. \u00a9JOT 2010.",

In particular, the paper presents results from a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project between the School of Computing, IT and Engineering at the University of East London and the London-based award winning pre-employment company Powerchex Ltd. The Secure Tropos methodology, which is based on the principle of secure by design, has been applied to the project to guide the development of a web based system to support employment reference and background checking specifically for the financial services industry. Findings indicate the potential of the methodology for the development of secure web based systems, and support the argument of incorporating security considerations from the early stages of the software development process, ie, the idea of secure by design. The developed system was tested by a third, independent to the project, party using a well known method of security testing, ie, penetration testing, and the results provided did not indicate the presence of any major security problems. The experience and lessons learned by the application of the methodology to an industrial setting are also discussed in the paper. last couple of years meant that the financial services industry is faced with large changes and as such the development of software systems to support the financial services industry and peripheral sectors introduces a number of new challenges and difficulties.

However, a careful analysis of software development processes shows that the definition of security requirements is, usually, considered after the design of the system.

The integration of security concerns during the whole range of the development stages could help towards the development of more secure multiagent systems. In this paper we introduce extensions to the Tropos methodology to enable it to model security concerns throughout the whole development process.

Questions can be enriched with metadata that enables other components of the VisiOn Privacy Platform to relate the questions and corresponding answers to data items, systems and groups of persons involved in information processing tasks. For example, if a service offered by a PA system requires a citizen to agree on the processing of his/her personal data, a question may read \u201cDo you allow the PA system to store your personal data?\u201d.

The research to date from the industry and academia tended to focus on the overall description of the standard and such expositions are unsatisfactory because little is being contributed to the practicality of the Information Security Management System (ISMS) structure. The generalisability of much-published research on the standard is insufficient for organisations aiming to implement the standard. An objective of this paper is to offer a direction towards a new modelling language to assist organisations to better understand the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001 standard. The methodological approach took in developing our proposed research was found by systematically investigating the current gap in the literature and to explore the underlying needs of organisations to adopt the ISMS. This paper contributes a set of original components and concepts to holistically capture, model, and manage the requirements of the standard.

However, the level of confidence inspired from a statement or an action depends on the quality of its source. Similarly, the assurance that the deployed security mechanisms exhibit an appropriate posture depends on the quality of the verification process adopted. This paper presents a novel taxonomy of quality metrics pertinent for gaining assurance in a security verification process. Inspired by the systems security engineering capability maturity model and the common criteria, we introduce five ordinal quality levels for a verification process aimed at probing the correctness of runtime security mechanisms. In addition, we analyse the mapping between the quality levels and different capability levels of the following verification metrics families: coverage, rigour, depth and independence of verification \u2026",

To this end, the authors advocate a solution that can be efficiently realized through modeling the application behavior as a Markov decision process, on top of which probabilistic model checking is applied. The article explains the main steps in this approach and illustrates its use in online analysis and decision making regarding elasticity decisions. The runtime analysis is capable of providing evidence for key security-related aspects of the running applications, such as the probability of data leakage in the next hour.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing is a paradigm that is utilised by cloud service providers to offer computational resources as procurable services to consumers. Whereby security is a primary concern to both consumers and cloud service providers, as confidential data and processes are offloaded to third party providers when utilising cloud services. Addressing security is therefore a non-trivial task due to the importance of the enabling technology, such as virtualisation, coupled with social factors considering consumer needs and physical properties such as geo-location influencing jurisdiction on resources and processes. Consumers have security needs to ensure their data and processes are kept secure, where cloud service providers are responsible for identifying security requirements in cloud computing environments and providing assurance that security needs are satisfied through transparency. In order to provide transparency of security requirements in cloud computing environments, concepts unique to the cloud computing paradigm such as multi-tenancy, dissemination of resources and responsibility needs to be captured. By adapting a security requirements engineering approach, security issues are identified early in the software development life-cycle. This ensures the security needs within a system is identified and well-understood before committing to implementation and deployment, where it is exponentially more difficult to address underlying security issues. In this thesis we present the Secure Cloud Environment Framework (SCEF), a decision support framework enabling developers to elicit cloud security requirements from cloud computing \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Maritime information infrastructures have developed to highly interrelated cyber ecosystems, where ports as well as their partners are connected in dynamic Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based maritime supply chains. This makes them open and vulnerable to the rapidly changing ICT threat landscape. Hence, attacks on a seemingly isolated system of one business partner may propagate through the whole supply chain, causing cascading effects and resulting in large-scale impacts. In this article, we want to present a novel risk management methodology to assess the risk level of an entire maritime supply chain. This methodology builds upon publicly available information, well-defined mathematical approaches and best practices to automatically identify and assess vulnerabilities and potential threats of the involved cyber assets. This leads to a constantly updated risk evaluation of each business partner's cyber assets together with their cyber interconnections with other business partners. The presented risk management methodology is based on qualitative risk scales, which makes the assessment as well as the results more intuitive. Furthermore, it enables a holistic view on all of the integrated ICT-systems as well as their interdependencies and thus can increase the security level of both a whole supply chain and every participating business partner.",

As a result, computerised health and social care information systems are gaining popularity. The development of such systems, mostly so far, follows an ad-hoc pattern. However, in order to effectively deal with the characteristics of such systems such as size, security, unpredictability, and openness; appropriate software engineering methodologies and paradigms should be employed for their development. This paper defines a set of requirements that a methodology should demonstrate and it argues for the appropriateness of the Secure Tropos agent oriented methodology for the development of health and social care information systems. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated with the aid of a real-life case study, the electronic Single Assessment Process system, an information system to support integrated assessment of the health and social care needs of older people. The application of the proposed methodology on the case study indicated that the methodology satisfies the identified requirements.",

Since the majority of such processes involve the exchange of sensitive third party information, their compliance to security constraints needs to be verified before they can be implemented. Current attempts for the verification of security compliance of design-time business process models involve the transformation of both the model and the desired security properties into formal specifications, which can be then used as input for automated model checkers. Such an approach is usually costly both in terms of time and specialised knowledge, while also its coverage can be limited to specific types of security requirements.

As such, this paper proposes an approach (supported by a system) which will complement security requirements engineering methodologies by gathering continuous evidence to inform on whether the security requirements elucidated during system development stage have been correctly implemented and as such, they can be relied upon to effectively protect system assets at runtime.

This year\u2019s workshops were held in conjunction with two major, international computing research conferences: the first, in May 2006, was affiliated with the AAMAS conference in Hakadote, Japan and chaired by Garcia, Ghose and Kolp. The second was held in conjunction with the international CAiSE conference held in Luxembourg (June 2006) and chaired by Bresciani, Henderson-Sellers and Mouratidis.(Details of all preceding workshops are to be found at http://www. aois. org.) The best papers from both these meetings were identified and authors invited to revise and extend their papers in light of the reviewers\u2019 comments and feedback at the workshop. Following submission to this compendium volume, another round of reviews was undertaken resulting in what you can read here.

Therefore, identifying and analysing relevant legal regulations and aligning them with security requirements become necessary for the effective development of secure software systems.

This situation, together with the lack of appropriate background and knowledge of laws and regulations, introduces a challenge for software developers. In particular, it makes difficult to perform (i) the elicitation of appropriate security requirements from the relevant laws and regulations; and (ii) the correct tracing of the security requirements throughout the development stages.

            "Abstract": "Privacy is becoming more and more a prominent concern for most countries, particularly for those of them that are moving toward the implementation of e-government [18] where software systems dealing with personal information (ie, citizens, customers, etc.) have to be compliant with national and international privacy laws [26]. Moreover, while privacy has been frequently identified as a main concern for Public Administrations (PAs) while dealing with citizens\u2019 information for performing their activities and providing services [18, 43], several recent studies have shown that citizens might refrain from using services when their privacy is endangered [49, 56]. According to Spiekermann et al.[72], an increasing majority of US and EU citizens say that existing laws and organizational practices do not provide a reasonable level of privacy protection and that companies share personal information inappropriately. As an answer, the newEuropean Privacy directives [14] introduced a number of privacy-related rules to increase the citizens\u2019 trust in PAs and their services. Despite this, organizations still suffer from several shortcomings that can endanger citizens\u2019 information such as bad security practices, hacker and, most importantly, insider attacks, data thefts, etc.[1].",

            "Abstract": "Developing a trustworthy information system is a challenging task. The overall trustworthiness of an information system depends on trust relationships that are generally assumed without adequate justification. However, lack of appropriate analysis of such relationships and of appropriate justification of relevant trust assumptions might lead to systems that fail to fully achieve their functionalities. Existing literature does not provide adequate guidelines for a systematic process or an appropriate modeling language to support such trust-focused analysis. This paper fills this gap by introducing a process that allows developers to capture possible trust relationships and to reason about them. The process is supported by a modeling language based on a set of concepts relating to trust and control and a CASE tool. An illustrative example from the UK health care domain is used to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Security can play an important role in the development of some multi agent systems. However, a careful analysis of software development processes indicates that the definition of security requirements is, usually, considered after the design of the system. This approach, usually, leads to problems, such as conflicts between security and functional requirements, which can translate into security vulnerabilities. As a result, the integration of security issues in agent oriented software engineering methodologies has been identified as an important issue. Nevertheless, developers of agent oriented software engineering methodologies have mainly neglected security engineering and in fact very little evidence has been reported on work that integrates security issues into the development stages of agent oriented software engineering methodologies. This thesis advances the current state of the art In agent oriented software engineering in many ways. It identifies problems associated with the integration of security and software engineering and proposes a set of minimum requirements that a security oriented process should demonstrate. It extends the concepts and the development process of the Tropos methodology with respect to security to allow developers, even those with minimum security knowledge, to identify desired security requirements for their multi agent systems, reason about them, and as a result develop a system that satisfies its security requirements. In doing so, this research has developed (1) an analysis technique to enable developers to select amongst alternative architectural styles using as criteria the security requirements of the \u2026",

However, the adoption of cloud includes release of control over valuable assets, which constitutes trust in the cloud provider of paramount importance. In this paper we extend the framework by incorporating trust and control concepts in its language and adding a new activity to properly identify and reason about trust assumptions during the selection of appropriate cloud provider. Also, the CASE tool was extended to support the new activity. A case study is used to illustrate the usefulness of our approach.",

A multi-agent system case study is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed security-aware metamodel.",

On the positive side, the user is obtaining advantages from GDPR. However, organisations are facing many difficulties in interpreting GDPR, and to properly applying it, and, in the meanwhile, due to their lack of compliance, many organisations are receiving huge fines from authorities. An important challenge is compliance with the Privacy by Design and by default (PbD) principles, which require that data protection is integrated into processing activities and business practices from the design stage. Recently, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) released an official document with PbD guidelines, and there are various efforts to provide approaches to support these. However, organizations are still facing difficulties in identifying a flow for executing, in a coherent, linear and effective way, these activities, and a complete toolkit for supporting this. In this paper, we propose the design of such flow, and our comprehensive supporting toolkit, as part of the DEFeND EU Project platform. Within DEFeND, we identified candidate tools, fulfilling specific GDPR aspects, and integrated them in a comprehensive toolkit: the DEFeND Data Scope Management service (DSM). The aim of DSM is to support organizations for continuous GDPR compliance through model-based Privacy by Design analysis. Here, we present DSM, its design, flow, and a preliminary case study and evaluation performed with pilots from the healthcare, banking, public administration and energy sectors.",

In this paper we present results from the development of a technique, which is based on the use of scenarios, to test the reaction of an information system against potential security attacks.",

Current software systems contain sensitive information and therefore it is important that considerable efforts are made to secure such information. To improve the security of software systems, recent research has identified that security analysis should be integrated into software engineering techniques and security should be considered from the early stages of the software systems development process. Although, researchers have focused their efforts towards this direction, recent studies have identified that educational curriculum is not properly addressing this issue. In this experience paper we present the experiences and lessons learned from developing and running a module in Secure Software Systems Engineering at MSc Level.",

Despite this reliance, these systems are often unreliable, prone to errors, and pose vulnerabilities for potential security attacks. We are often faced with a choice between using a valuable (or even an essential) system, which is not fully trustworthy, or else forgoing the services it provides. Developing a trustworthy software system is a challenging task. The system's overall trustworthiness depends on trust relationships that are usually assumed and not properly analysed during the analysis and design of the system. The lack of appropriate analysis of such trust relationships, or the lack of appropriate justification of relevant trust assumptions, usually results in systems that can potentially fail to fully achieve those functionalities that depend on such trust relationships.

The two main frameworks are VisiOn Desktop Framework and the VisiOn Web Framework. Each has unique goals, requirements, functionalities. The PAs use both however a citizen only interacts with the desktop framework.The desktop framework mainly aims to perform a privacy analysis. The above mentioned analysis relies on model-based analysis methodologies. Analyzing system models allows a system designer to focus on specific aspects of the systems\u2014such as privacy and security\u2014and identify privacy and security threats from the early phases of the system development. Several modeling tools are integrated into the VisiOn Privacy Platform to conduct the privacy and security analysis. The VisiOn web Framework is the main interface for citizens in order to access information about how their data is managed, and to define their privacy policies. Moreover, public administrations will be able to use web framework for generation of questions, check how the access to the data of the citizens they have is accessed and by whom,",

            "Abstract": "Research on next-generation 5G wireless networks is currently attracting a lot of attention in both academia and industry. While 5G development and standardization activities are still at their early stage, it is widely acknowledged that 5G systems are going to extensively rely on dense small cell deployments, which would exploit infrastructure and network functions virtualization (NFV), and push the network intelligence towards network edges by embracing the concept of mobile edge computing (MEC). As security will be a fundamental enabling factor of small cell as a service (SCaaS) in 5G networks, we present the most prominent threats and vulnerabilities against a broad range of targets. As far as the related work is concerned, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate security challenges at the intersection of SCaaS, NFV, and MEC. It is also the first paper that proposes a set of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Securing an information system (IS) involves continual detection and response to security obstacles at all stages of the system\u2019s lifecycle. During early requirements engineering, one way to facilitate these tasks is to use secure actor and goal models that represent desired IS behaviour, including responses to security obstacles. We propose the Security Obstacle Detection and Response (SODR) method for detecting and responding to security obstacles during the construction of secure actor and goal models in early RE. SODR relies on a justification process, in which arguments about potential security obstacles related to IS assets are made explicit, submitted to justification, leading either to the identification of justified responses to the given security obstacles or the rejection of these obstacles. SODR thereby ensures that the arguments behind the identified security obstacles and chosen responses are explicit, so that they can be constructed, openly questioned, and revised in a structured and rigorous manner. The proposed method is supported by the SODR-Tool.",

After looking at the limitations and barriers of existing research and industrial approaches, with respect to the engineering of secure software systems, we briefly describe a methodology, which considers both the social and the technical aspects of security and supports the objective of considering security from the early stages of the software systems development. Moreover, we also argue that, in order to provide a security focus throughout the development lifecycle, we need to look at the issue collectively, rather than individually, by establishing a discipline that will form the basis of an in depth understanding of the security issues involved in the development of software systems; provide the appropriate knowledge and best practice to assist software and security engineers in developing secure software systems; and also educate system users on security related issues.",

The utility offered through information technologies has improved productivity and performance within for-profit organisations that have availed themselves of networked infrastructures that promote ease of access, remote access to data and enhanced speed and service. However, these assets also entail potentially damaging outcomes through threats to the network. Problems in network security have emerged from the different priorities that stakeholders have in respect to the data management infrastructure. These priorities are highly subjective and range from increased ease of use to increased limitations placed upon access and every point in between. These priorities are the result of two separate criteria that exist for users of a networked system: first, users want to enjoy efficient and pleasant experiences when using a system; second, users recognise specific risks and associate these with computer networks. Risk management is a significant component of network security, especially in respect to how the prerogatives of any network security system are defined.",

The security requirements are derived from the need to address two specific kinds of threats that exist in cloud databases, namely data leakage, mainly due to malicious activities of actors hosted on the same physical machine, and data loss after one or more node failures. A key feature of our approach is that we account for multiple cloud providers offering resources of different characteristics. We explain that usually there is a trade-off between performance and security requirements and we derive a model checking approach to drive runtime decisions that strike a user-defined balance between them taking into account the infrastructure heterogeneity.

            "Abstract": "Digital technology provides unique opportunities to revolutionize the healthcare ecosystem and health research. However, this comes with serious security, safety, and privacy threats. The healthcare sector has been proven unequipped and unready to face cyberattacks while its vulnerabilities are being systematically exploited by attackers. The growing need and use of medical devices and smart equipment, the complexity of operations and the incompatible systems are leaving healthcare organizations exposed to various malware, including ransomware, which result in compromised healthcare access, quality, safety and care. To fully benefit from the advantages of technology, cybersecurity issues need to be resolved. Cybersecurity measures are being suggested via a number of healthcare standards which are often contradicting and confusing, making these measures ineffective and difficult to implement. To place a solid foundation for the healthcare sector, in improving the understanding of complex cybersecurity issues, this paper explores the existing vulnerabilities in the health care critical information infrastructures which are used in cyberattacks and discusses the reasons why this sector is under attack. Furthermore, the existing security standards in healthcare are presented alongside with their implementation challenges. The paper also discusses the use of living labs as a novel way to discover how to practically implement cybersecurity measures and also provides a set of recommendations as future steps.

Nevertheless, inherent cloud security issues make organisations hesitant towards the migration of their services to cloud. In parallel, the cloud service-oriented nature requires a specific and more demanding description of the business functional requirements intended for migration. Organisations need to transform their functional requirements based on a specific language, taking into account the respective non-functional requirements of the migrating services. Thus, the need for an approach that will holistically capture organisations' security and privacy requirements and transform them to cloud service requirements is immense. To this end, this paper presents an approach that takes as input abstract security and privacy requirements and produces through a semi-automatic process various alternative implementation options for cloud services. To achieve that a series of model transformations are utilised in order to create a mapping between the organisational and the operational level of the system's analysis.",

As a result, many different methods have been introduced to help developers in the development of multi-agent systems. However, so far, these methods have mainly neglected security requirements. The common approach towards the inclusion of security within a system is to identify security requirements after the definition of the system. However, this approach has provoked the emergence of computer systems afflicted with security vulnerabilities. In this paper we propose an analysis, based on the measures of criticality (how critical an actor of the system is) and complexity (represents the effort required by the actors of the system to achieve the requirements that have been imposed to them), which aims to identify possible bottlenecks of a multi-agent system with respect to \u2026",

In particular, the proposed approach takes the high-level concepts and modelling activities of the secure Tropos methodology and enriches them with a low level security-engineering ontology and models derived from the UMLsec approach. A real case study from the e-commerce sector is employed to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.",

Assumptions exist about trust relationships among actors within the system environment, which play an important role in modelling and analysing security.

In this paper, the authors introduce trust-based concepts to identify these trust assumptions, and integrate the trust concepts with security concepts for the development of secure software systems. For this purpose, Secure Tropos\u2019 security modelling activities are extended with trust modelling activities based on the trust-based concepts.

Over the last two decades many algorithms have been applied in the areas of classification, association, prediction and filtering of data. Such systems would allow managers of smaller businesses to determine the significance of large volumes of data quickly and just as importantly data can be classified and ordered based on the importance of the data to a predefined task for smaller businesses. Mantagno et al (2002) proposed using neural networks for identifying organisational improvement strategies. Even though Mantagno\u2019s research focused on large organisations we believe it is imperative that smaller businesses adopt a similar approach as it could well be the deciding factor between business decline and business survival. Choy et al (2003) supports this approach in arguing that there has to be a technological searching strategy to support businesses and effective management. Although it is now possible to find many neural network models being incorporated into business applications it is still uncommon in the smaller business sector. This paper is a review of neural network algorithms applicable to SMEs.",

A technical dimension that is related to the available technology and the infrastructure of information systems, and a social dimension that is related to the impact of the human factor on the security of a system. Both dimensions need to be looked at in order to effectively develop secure information systems. Towards such a treatment of security, it is really important that security is considered from the early stages of the development process in order to gain an in-depth understanding of the technical and social issues that might affect the security of an information system. On the other hand, it is equally important to provide the appropriate knowledge to assist information systems developers in dealing with the technical and the social dimensions of security and also educate system users on issues related to the security of information systems. This chapter motivates the establishment of a secure by design philosophy of secure information systems development; it discusses its characteristics, vision, principles and practices and it identifies a list of important challenges related to it.",

Since the late 1980s, the CAiSE conferences have provided a forum for the presentation and exchange of research results and practical experiences within the? eld of Information Systems Engineering. The conference theme of CAiSE 2004 was Knowledge and Model Driven Information Systems Engineering for Networked Organizations. Modern businesses and IT systems are facing an ever more complex en-ronment characterized by openness, variety, and change. Organizations are-coming less self-su? cient and increasingly dependent on business partners and other actors. These trends call for openness of business as well as IT systems, ie the ability to connect and interoperate with other systems. Furthermore, organizations are experiencing ever more variety in their business, in all c-ceivable dimensions. The di? erent competencies required by the workforce are multiplying. In the same way, the variety in technology is overwhelming with a multitude of languages, platforms, devices, standards, and products. Moreover, organizations need to manage an environment that is constantly changing and where lead times, product life cycles, and partner relationships are shortening.

Since users are becoming more concerned about the amounts of their personal data handled, stored and shared by such systems it is imperative to identify methods for developing privacy-aware information systems. Current approaches either focus on the elicitation of user requirements at an abstract high level or approach the issue of privacy exclusively from a technical point of view. As a result, privacy implementations are often misaligned with the overarching system goals. This work improves the current situation by presenting an approach for the design of privacy-aware business processes. Goal models are created as a first step, for privacy requirements elicitation, and are then transformed into process models, thus bridging the gap between high level goals and low level processes.

This paper extends the Secure Tropos methodology to enable a clear alignment, between security requirements and security mechanisms, and a reasoning technique to optimise the selection of security mechanisms based on these security requirements and a set of other factors. The extending Secure Tropos supports modelling and analysis of security mechanisms; defines mathematically relevant modelling concepts to support a formal analysis; and defines and solves an optimisation problem to derive optimal sets of security mechanisms.

It is based on an agent-oriented approach, and extends it with the use of security patterns. Agent-oriented software engineering provides advantages when modeling security issues, since agents are often a natural way of conceptualizing an information system, in particular at the requirements stage, when the viewpoints of multiple stakeholders need to be considered. Our approach uses the Tropos methodology for modeling a system as a set of agents and their social dependencies, with specific extensions for representing security constraints. As an extension to the existing methodology we propose the use of security patterns. These patterns capture proven solutions to common security issues, and support the systematic and structured mapping of these constraints to an architectural model of the system, in particular for non \u2026",

Most GIS functions require interaction with human experts. This is considered problematic since it causes extra complexity and increases the amount of resources required. Agent technology has the potential to assist in reducing this problem. However the current application of software agents to the GIS domain is very limited and fails to take into account the full functionality and advantages of agent technology. In this paper we discuss the application of agents in GIS and argue for the need to produce an agent- based framework for GIS. By way of context we define a novel agent-based system for one important aspect of GIS, the construction of a variogram.

Security modelling languages exist to reason on security in the early phases of IS development, when the most crucial design decisions are made. Reasoning on security involves analysing risk, and effectively communicating risk-related information. However, we think that current languages can be improved in this respect. In this paper, we discuss this issue for Secure Tropos, the language supporting the eponymous agent-based IS development. We analyse it and suggest improvements in the light of an existing reference model for IS security risk management. This allows for checking Secure Tropos concepts and terminology against those of current risk management standards, thereby improving the conceptual appropriateness of the language.

This enforces data subjects (e.g., citizens, customers) rights by enabling them to have more information regarding usage of their data, and to take decisions (e.g., revoking usage permissions). Moreover, organizations are required to trace precisely their activities on user data, enabling authorities to monitor and sanction more easily.

Inspired by the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM) and the Common Criteria, we tailored five ordinal levels of quality levels for probes performing the verification of system security measures; different levels of quality being possible depending on the coverage, rigor, depth and Independence of the verification. The metric taxonomy is intended to assist IT Products manufacturers in developing their products or systems and in identifying security requirements to be satisfied for their products or systems to be assured at some level of quality as far as assurance evaluation is concerned. It could also benefit consumers in supporting them in selecting IT security products depending on their organizational needs, while IT security evaluators may use it as reference when forming judgments about the quality of a security product.",

This paper presents a pattern language for guiding developers, especially those without previous Tropos experience, through the various design challenges faced when using Tropos. The patterns format allows us to motivate the modelling constructs, justify each of the development stages, and address specific modelling problems. These patterns are inter-linked in such a way that developers can navigate from higher-level to lower-level patterns as they apply the Tropos methodology. The paper has two goals: to motivate the use of agent-oriented methodologies such as Tropos to a wider set of developers, and to provide guidance for the different development activities of the Tropos methodology.

Network resources, especially in a Smart School, are in short supply and relatively expensive to acquire, therefore a control mechanism should be in place so that available resources can be allocated for legitimate usages only. An intelligent mechanism using Fuzzy Logic is deployed for the purpose of knowledge learning in order to process all the user requests accordingly. A decision of granting a network resource request needs to be based on several data sets that represent the current network state, transmission state and users. The system is analysed and designed using the Tropos Methodology. Tropos was chosen because it covers four stages of development. The proposed system was modelled using Fuzzy Logic algorithms for simulation purposes in order to find the relationship between two fuzzy sets with the computed allocated time.",

Amongst them, secure Tropos has been proposed as a structured approach towards the consideration of security issues in the development of multiagent systems. In this paper we enhance secure Tropos by integrating to its stages:(i) a process for selecting amongst alternative architectural styles using as criteria the security requirements of the system;(ii) a pattern-based approach to transform security requirements to design, and (iii) a security attack scenarios approach to test the developed solution.

The literature provides works that focus on discussing security and privacy issues for cloud systems but such works do not provide a detailed methodological approach to elicit security and privacy requirements neither methods to select cloud deployment models based on satisfaction of these requirements by cloud service providers. This work advances the current state of the art towards this direction. In particular, we consider requirements engineering concepts to elicit and analyze security and privacy requirements and their associated mechanisms using a conceptual framework and a systematic process.

Nevertheless, current practices towards securing software systems fail to take into account security issues during the early development stages and also cannot properly address the unique characteristics and needs of the cloud environment. To address such issues, Secure Tropos was developed as a security-oriented requirements engineering approach, offering a modeling language and sets of diagrams which facilitate the elicitation and elaboration of security features for software systems. In this work, we introduce Secure Tropos by discussing its main concepts, their relations and the main diagrams used to capture the different aspects of a software system.

Transportation, telecommunications, entertainment, health care, military, education and so on; the list is almost endless. These systems are used not only by major corporations and governments but also across networks of organizations, SME\u2019s and by individual users. Such wide use has resulted in these systems containing a large amount of critical information and processes, which inevitably need to remain secure. Therefore, although it is important to ensure that systems are developed according to the user needs, it is equally important to ensure that these systems are secure. However, the common approach towards the inclusion of security within a software system is to identify security requirements after the definition of a system. This typically means that security enforcement mechanisms have to be fitted \u2026",

The translation justifies the system security concerns, and keep the traceability of the security decisions. Our proposal is based on the systematic domain model for information systems security risk management (ISSRM); thus, it preserves the semantics of both security languages\u2019 constructs and synchronise the mechanisms across language boundaries to elicit, correct and complete security requirements.

In this work we introduce process-level security patterns, each of which contains the main activities required for the operationalisation of different security requirements.

To that end, a goal-to-process transformation approach, with a clear security orientation, is introduced, as part of a wider framework.

            "Abstract": "\u2014For software systems that process and manage sensitive information, compliance with laws has become not an option but a necessity. Analysing relevant laws and aligning them with the system requirements is necessary for attaining compliance issues. But analyzing laws within the context of software system requirements is a difficult task, mainly because the concepts used in legal texts are different compared to the concepts used in requirements engineering. This paper contributes to that direction. In particular it presents a process to model and analyse laws and regulations and to support the elicitation of security requirements based on the relevant legal and system context. Finally a case study is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.",

            "Abstract": "Older people often have a complex mixture of health and social care needs and                    several different health and social care professionals are involved in their                    care. National policy in England is to promote the single assessment process                    (SAP), an integrated assessment of health and social care needs of older people.                    However, most of the current information systems do not adequately provide the                    functionality that is required by health and social care professionals. In this                    paper we discuss the suitability of agent technology, explaining why we selected                    it as offering the greatest potential for efficient and flexible information                    collection and sharing, and for supporting effective care planning. Also, we                    point out benefits derived from the use of agent technology in the development                    of health and social care systems, such as \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a modelling framework to support Internal Control. The proposed framework is intended to be used for the design and evaluation of internal controls by organisations and their auditors. One component of the framework is a modelling language and the other is a process to establish internal controls. The proposed modelling language is based on Secure Tropos modelling language. It extends Secure Tropos in several ways in order to conceptualize some aspects of internal controls in which organisational structure and relationships between major stakeholders are taken into account. In this paper we describe the proposed framework by presenting an internal control model and show how risks can be analysed in the models according to the proposed process.",

            "Abstract": "Soliciting and managing the protection of information assets has become a objective of paramount importance in an organizational context. Information Security Management System (ISMS) has the unique role of ensuring that adequate and appropriate security tools are in place in order to protect information assets. Security is always seen in three dimensions of technology, organization, and people. Undoubtedly, the socio-technical challenges have proven to be the most difficult ones to tackle. Social Engineering Attacks (SEAs) are a sociotechnical challenge and considerably increase security risks by seeking access to information assets by exploiting the vulnerabilities in organizations as they target human frailties. Dealing effectively and adequately with SEAs requires practical security benchmarking together with control mechanism tools, which in turn requires investment to support security and ultimately organizational goals. This paper contributes in this area. In particular, the paper proposes a language for managing SEAs using several concepts such as actor, risks, goals, security investment and vulnerabilities. The language supports in-depth investigation of human factors as one of the main causes of SEAs. It also assists in the selection of appropriate mechanisms considering security investment to mitigate risks. Finally, the paper uses a real incident in a financial institution to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.",

Recent developments in ICT have significantly boosted research and development activities aimed at the creation and management of cultural heritage resources. As a result, information systems play an increasingly important role on storing and managing cultural heritage information and allowing preservation of the information in a digital way. To support such effort, a number of cultural heritage conceptual models have been developed and presented in the literature. However, such models they focus on the heritage entities and information, but fail to include issues such as privacy and trust. Our research has shown that these are important issues to consider in order to have a complete cultural heritage model. This paper presents the first \u2026",

However, designing cloud services capable to assist a cloud investigation process is of vital importance and recent research efforts concentrate on these directions. In addition, digital forensics methods cannot support a cloud investigation since cloud environments introduce many differences compared to traditional IT environments. This paper moves current research one step further by identifying the major concepts, actors and their relationships that participating in a cloud forensics process through the introduction of a new meta-model. The paper presents a running example as well for better understanding the suggested concepts.",

The performance requirements refer to strict latency limits on the query response time. The security requirements are derived from the need to address two specific kinds of threats that exist in cloud databases, namely data leakage, mainly due to malicious activities of actors hosted on the same physical machine, and data loss after one or more node failures. We explain that usually there is a trade-off between performance and security requirements and we derive a model checking approach to drive runtime decisions that strike a user-defined balance between them. We evaluate our proposal using real traces to prove the effectiveness in configuring the trade-offs.",

Cloud computing undisputedly has influenced profoundly in this direction by providing many benefits such as accessibility and availability of resources to organisations. But the economical advantage and the cost impacts are far more attractive to organisations than anything else when it comes to cloud computing. This convenient and attractiveness comes with new phases of security and risk challenges for both cloud providers and clients which requires investment for managing and mitigating them. The challenges get more complicated as the service itself passes geographical and national boundaries which create a completely new paradigm for security, risk, privacy, and more importantly cost implications. Social Engineering Attacks (SEAs) are example of those risks that are very attractive way for attackers for accessing \u2026",
