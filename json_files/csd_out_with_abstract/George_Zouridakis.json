A connectivity matrix was computed for each subject individually and then group templates were estimated by averaging all matrices in each group. Furthermore, we performed classification of the subjects using support vector machines and Fisher's criterion to rank the features and identify the best subset for maximum separation of the groups. Our results show that a combined model based on connectivity matrices and graph theory measures can provide 87.5% accuracy in separating the two groups.

We explore this question in the context of the Naval Research Laboratories Navigation Task that is used for selecting and training future submarine pilots. About 50% of participants fail to achieve the desired competence level on the task, even after a large number of trials. A central question in this project is whether we can analyze learning failures rapidly enough to intervene during training. To this end, we set out to identify a neural signature of strategy formulation by adopting a system-of-systems approach to dynamically track the learning state of a subject using measurements of brain activity and coordinated visuomotor actions throughout the learning process. We analyzed the spatiotemporal profiles of brain activation using a coherence measure and interpreted them based on the visuomotor performance data. Our results show the \u2026",

Using 197 sets of multispectral images-taken under while, blue, yellow, and red light-representing 16 Buruli and 181 non-Buruli lesions, we achieved overall classification sensitivity of 90.0%, specificity of 93.3%, and receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of 97.1%.

We address the problem of detecting local dermoscopic features from epiluminescence (ELM) microscopy skin lesion images. We formulate the recognition of local dermoscopic features as a multi-instance learning (MIL) problem. We employ the method of diverse density (DD) and evidence confidence (EC) function to convert MIL to a single-instance learning (SIL) problem. We apply Adaboost to improve the classification performance with support vector machines (SVMs) as the base classifier. We also propose to boost the selection of instance prototypes through changing the data weights in the DD function. We validate the methods on detecting ten local dermoscopic features from a dataset with 360 images. We compare the performance of the MIL approach, its boosting version, and a baseline method without using MIL \u2026",

For each channel, the processed single trials were separated into two groups, one with trials in which the N100 component had the same phase as the average response and another one with trials having the opposite phase. Our results show that the proposed method can effectively extract only the activity related to the experimental task, while removing artifacts and background activity, and that the sources of the N100 component that are typically localized on the floor of the Sylvian fissure are primarily due to in-phase responses.",

Functional imaging based on NIRS (fNIRS) can detect both oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) levels related to neural metabolic activity, whereas BOLD fMRI (blood-oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging) can only detect signals related to deoxy-Hb. Thus, during task execution, only fNIRS can determine the differential temporal activation/deactivation of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb hemodynamic signals as the blood-oxygen demand changes. We have previously shown that as metabolic demand increases, temporal changes in oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb levels can be temporally decoupled (ie, oxy-Hb level can decrease while deoxy-Hb level increases \u2026",

While there is an increased interest in determining methods to restore consciousness in these patients, the process is complex and challenging, due in part to the diverse aetiology of these states of consciousness, and also to the intricate cerebral connectivity involved in their treatment. Here, we present the CRECER Combined Method Therapy (CCMT), used in a case study of a patient who showed signs of emergence from the vegetative state after neurorehabilitation. Neurorehabilitation therapy was applied simultaneously with pharmacological treatment, stimulation, and neuroimaging techniques to help adjust drug dosage. The results of this study suggest that this combined approach to treatment promoted connectivity \u2026",

We use ICA to separate the activity of neuronal generators from the contribution of the various noise sources, under the assumption that improved AEP estimates will result in improved accuracy in source localization.

To demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, we analyze hemodynamic data recorded from human subjects performing an orthogonal movement task. Our results show that phase space plots can quantify the dynamic time-varying relationships between the two variables based on the trajectory of the loci of data points in the phase space plots. In particular, the location of the phase space plots in different quadrants provides a specific coupling relationship between the two hemodynamic variables. The orientation of the loci of points characterizes further the relationship between these two variables, which can be directly or inversely proportional. The locus of the trajectory along a straight line or an elliptical path can reveal the phase relationship between the two variables. Thus, using phase space analysis on these two simultaneously recorded hemodynamic variables can uniquely identify the movement direction encoded by the motor cortex.",

In this paper, we use simulated data and actual recordings from normal subjects to compare the effectiveness of two methods at removing extraneous activity from single-trial responses, namely, wavelet denoising and our recently proposed procedure, which is based on independent component analysis. Our results show that the new technique can separate individual components from the entire response waveform, and it can also uncover the dynamic evolution of brain responses that cannot be revealed by standard averaging techniques.",

In the biomedical application of skin cancer screening, many categories of descriptors (such as texture, color, and asymmetry) have been used to represent a skin lesion image. The feature combination approach firstly generates classifiers using each category of features alone and combines them linearly together to decide on whether the skin lesion is cancerous or not.

Current study followed an \u201cattack strategy\u201d to compare the rich-club and small-world network organization models using Magnetoencephalo\u00acgraphic (MEG) recordings from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients and neurologically intact controls to identify the topology that describes the underlying intrinsic brain network organization. We hypothesized that the reduction in global efficiency caused by an attack targeting a model\u2019s hubs would reveal the \u201ctrue\u201d underlying topological organization. Connectivity networks were estimated using mutual information as the basis for cross-frequency coupling. Our results revealed a prominent rich-club network organization for both groups. In particular, mTBI patients demonstrated hyper-synchronization among rich-club hubs compared to controls in the \u03b4 band and the \u03b4-\u03b31, \u03b8-\u03b31, and \u03b2-\u03b32 frequency pairs.

Motor cortical hemodynamic responses were recorded using 64 spatially distributed optrodes from 14 normal subjects during free arm orthogonal movements in the x-and y-directions on a horizontal plane. The time course of oxy-(HbO2) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb), and of their summation (HbO2+ Hb) and difference (HbO2\u2013Hb) signals, representing the hemodynamic profiles of total oxygen delivery and extraction, respectively, were computed for the localized neuronal populations in the motor cortices underlying the optrodes. Analysis of the above hemodynamic signals revealed that they could be temporally, spatially, or spatiotemporally decoupled, depending on the movement direction. Thus, by analyzing the spatiotemporal profiles of brain activation we could identify the direction of the orthogonal movements uniquely.

Methods: Two synchronized networks were observed to subserve consciousness, one retrolandic (cognitive network) and the other frontal (executive control network).Results: The synchronization between these networks is severely impaired in patients in the MCS when compared to patients with SND, who show better levels of consciousness and a preserved state of alertness. The executive control network could facilitate the synchronization and coherence of large populations of distant cortical neurons using high frequency oscillations on a precise temporal scale. If synchrony and coherence are lost, consciousness is altered or \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The evaluation of the topological properties of brain networks is an emergent research topic, since the estimated cerebral connectivity patterns often have relatively large size and complex structure. Since a graph is a mathematical representation of a network, the use of a theoretical graph approach would describe concisely the topological features of the functional brain connectivity network estimated using neuroimaging techniques. In the present study, we analyze the changes in brain synchronization networks using high-resolution EEG signals obtained during performance of a complex goal-directed visuomotor task. Our results show that the cortical network is more stable when subjects reach the goal than when they fail by hitting an obstacle. These findings suggest the presence of a possible cerebral \u201cmarker\u201d for motor actions that result in successful reaching of a target.",

One of these theories affirms that the average response results from synchronous phase-resetting in the ongoing activity provoked by the stimulus. Testing the relationship between the phase in the ongoing EEG activity at the stimulus time and the response after the stimulus we pretend to find a relationship in accordance with this theory. In this study, data from 19 normal subjects were recorded using an EEG recorder system. Observing the Cz channel, the phase of the ongoing activity at the time of stimulus arrival was estimated and compared with the response obtained from the same signal after applying an iterative Independent Component Analysis algorithm. Applying this algorithm, basically two kinds of EEG responses are detected for each single trial observing the N100 peak. One response follows the same pattern as the average EP and the other response follows just the opposite one. In this paper we present the relationship found between the phase and the percentage of found trials with these two kinds of responses.",

In this paper, we compare the performance of iICA at estimating single-trial responses with ensemble averaging and wavelet transform (WT) denoising.We analyzed simulated evoked potentials (EPs) and actual recordings of the auditory N100 component from 33 normal subjects, and the performance of each method was quantified in terms of the average root-mean-square error and average correlation before and after processing.We found that WT gave a smoother overall average EP, while i \u2026",

AEPs are often contaminated by biological noise, such as eye blinks and muscle activity, as well as by extraneous interference. ICA is used to extract the activity of neuronal generators from the noisy recordings. Simulation results show that the method can recover a variety of signals when only noise-contaminated mixtures of these signals are observed.

Previous efforts in MTL have mostly assumed that all tasks have the same input space. However, auxiliary tasks can have different input spaces, since their learning targets are different. Thus, to handle cases with heterogeneous input, in this paper we present a newly developed model using heterogeneous auxiliary tasks to help main task learning. First, we formulate a convex optimization problem for the proposed model, and then, we analyze its hypothesis class and derive true risk bounds. Finally, we compare the proposed model with other relevant methods when applied to the problem of skin cancer screening and public datasets. Our results show that the performance of the proposed method is highly competitive compared to other relevant methods.[pdf][supplementary]",

            "Abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a completely noninvasive method of functional imaging. MEG performs noninvasive functional imaging by recording the magnetic flux on the head surface associated with electrical currents in activated set of neurons, estimating the location of such sets, and projecting the location onto the MRI of the brain to identify and visualize the activated brain region. MEG has rapidly evolved in the last two decades due to the introduction of whole head systems and advances in computer technology. MEG is now the imaging modality of choice where a precise and high degree of localization is required. Ongoing studies show that it provides superior temporal and spatial resolution when compared to functional MRI. MEG is the only imaging technique that can reveal brain function over millisecond intervals. Magnetoencephalography was initially used to localize the primary sensory cortices \u2026",

Averaging, however, eliminates all temporal variability of the recorded signals and, therefore, hampers the exploration of the temporal dynamics underlying the generation of the N100 component. In this study, we analyzed EPs on a single-trial basis using an iterative independent component analysis procedure that is capable of extracting individual components out of an entire EP waveform. This approach allowed estimation of an N100 in each single trial and measurement of its morphological features such as polarity, which could be either negative (most frequently) or positive (less frequently). In the latter case, the N100 component was termed aberrant. We analyzed responses from 23 normal controls (NC) and 15 schizophrenia \u2026",

In this work, we investigated changes in mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) patients using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state recordings and a DFC approach. The activity of several well-known brain rhythms was first beamformed using linearly constrained minimum norm variance of the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical brain regions of interest. A DFC graph was formulated using the imaginary part of phase lag value which were obtained from 30 mTBI patients and 50 normal controls. Filtering each quasi-static graph statistically and topologically, we estimated a normalized Laplacian transformation of every single quasistatic graph based on the degree of each node. Then, the related eigenvalues of the synchronization of each node were computed by incorporating the complete topology. Using the neural-gas algorithm, we modelled the evolution of the eigenvalues for each group, resulting in distinct FC microstates (FC\u03bcstates). Using the so-called chronnectomics (transition rate, occupancy time of FC\u03bcstate, and Dwell time) and complexity index over the evolution of the FC\u03bcstates, we evaluated the level of discrimination and derived statistical differences between the two groups. In both groups, we detected equal number of FC\u03bcstates with statistically significant transitions in the \u03b4, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3low frequency bands. The discrimination rate between the two groups was very high in the \u03b8 and \u03b3low bands, followed by a statistically significant difference between the two groups in all \u2026",

A promising tool for exploring potential biomarkers for mTBI is magnetoencephalography which has the advantage of high spatial and temporal resolution. By adopting proper analytic tools from the field of symbolic dynamics like Lempel-Ziv complexity, we can objectively characterize neural network alterations compared to healthy control by enumerating the different patterns of a symbolic sequence. This procedure oversimplifies the rich information of brain activity captured via MEG. For that reason, we adopted neural-gas algorithm which can transform a time series into more than two symbols by learning brain dynamics with a small reconstructed error.

Thus, it is essential to educate the public about risk factors and augment screening for melanoma to reduce fatalities.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for detecting the socalled blue-whitish veil color feature. Our results show that when the blue-whitish veil is combined with the regression feature can provide sensitivity and specificity of 95.64% and 72.30%, respectively.

In this paper, we present a new methodology for early detection of skin cancer based on the analysis of a pair of cross-polarization and side-transillumination images to examine surface pigmentation and vascularization characteristics of a lesion. Initially, the two images are automatically segmented by three separate procedures, and then the most accurate results are selected by a scoring stage. Finally, classification of the lesion as malignant or benign is accomplished by measuring the amount of hypervascularity around the pigmented area. When applied to a set of skin lesions, the two-stage methodology provided a 93.3% success rate of correct image segmentation, and it was able to classify correctly lesions as malignant or benign with 86.9% accuracy. The automatic segmentation procedure was validated against expert manual segmentation, whereas the final lesion classification was validated against findings from pathology. These results provide strong support for the importance of transillumination imaging in the early detection of skin cancer.",

In this chapter, we present a smartphone digital dermoscopy application that can analyze high-resolution images of skin lesions and provide the user with feedback about the likelihood of malignancy. The same basic procedure has been adapted to evaluate other skin lesions, such as the flesh-eating bacterial disease known as Buruli ulcer. When implemented on the iPhone, the accuracy and speed achieved by this application are comparable to that of a desktop computer, demonstrating that smartphone applications can combine portability and low cost with high performance \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Diagnosing and monitoring recovery of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is challenging because of the lack of objective, quantitative measures. Diagnosis is based on description of injuries often not witnessed, subtle neurocognitive symptoms, and neuropsychological testing. Since working memory (WM) is at the center of cognitive functions impaired in mTBI, this study was designed to define objective quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) measures of WM processing that may correlate with cognitive changes associated with acute mTBI. First-time mTBI patients and mild peripheral (limb) trauma controls without head injury were recruited from the emergency department. WM was assessed by a continuous performance task (N-back). EEG recordings were obtained during N-back testing on three occasions: within five days, two weeks, and one month after injury. Compared with controls, mTBI patients showed abnormal induced and evoked alpha activity including event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS). For induced alpha power, TBI patients had excessive frontal ERD on their first and third visit. For evoked alpha, mTBI patients had lower parietal ERD/ERS at the second and third visits. These exploratory qEEG findings offer new and non-invasive candidate measures to characterize the evolution of injury over the first month, with potential to provide much-needed objective measures of brain dysfunction to diagnose and monitor the consequences of mTBI.",

In this paper, a novel segmentation scheme is proposed to detect the border of Buruli lesions in cross-polarization dermoscopic images that were obtained under white light illumination. The method consists of three main steps: first, segmentations in different color spaces by thresholding are fused to form an initial contour, then a level set segmentation is applied to both the luminance and color components of the image, and finally, decisions for each pixel are made by a support vector machine classifier. Experimental results with 26 images show that the proposed methodology outperforms other state-of-art segmentation approaches for Buruli images.",

To study the general applicability of the method, it was also applied to five magnetoencephalographic (MEG) datasets. For each channel, single trial responses were extracted using the iICA approach followed by separating trials into two groups one with trials having the same and the other having the opposite phase as the average response. Topographic phase maps were constructed by calculating, for each channel, the percentage of trials that go in-phase (%IP) with the average. The phase maps were found to follow a trend that was similar to amplitude distribution. With EEG, the channels with high %IP were clustered mainly along the midline \u2026",

Using images acquired in living eyes, we modeled the ALCS in 3D and transformed 2D AOSLO images onto the 3D surface to better characterize laminar pores.Methods:: AOSLO images of the ALCS were acquired in vivo in the control and glaucomatous eyes of a rhesus monkey with unilateral experimental glaucoma and were used to calculate laminar pore areas. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT)[Spectralis HRA+ OCT] cross-sectional radial scans (20 field, 48 B-scans) of the optic nerve head were acquired in both eyes. The ALCS was manually marked in SDOCT B-scans using a custom MATLAB program. A thin plate spline was fit to the marked points to model the ALCS in 3D.

            "Abstract": "Ischemic stroke is fundamentally a multiscale phenomenon [1]. Occlusion of blood vessels in the brain triggers a cascade of changes including: 1. synaptic glutamate release, related to excitotoxicity; 2. elevated extracellular potassium, leading to spreading depression; 3. cell swelling, reducing the extracellular volume and diffusion; 4. production of reactive oxygen species, which give rise to inflammation. These cascades occur over multiple time-scales, with the initial rapid changes in cell metabolism and ionic concentrations trigging several damaging agents that may ultimately leads to cell death. Tissue affected by ischemic stroke is divided into three regions; 1. a core where cells suffer irreparable damage and death, 2. a penumbra where cells may recover with reperfusion, 3. a further region of edema where spontaneous recovery is expected. Multiscale modeling and multiphysics modeling is essential to capture \u2026",

In this paper, we present a new two-step approach that focuses on removing well-defined artifacts, such as eye movements and muscle activity, before iICA processing. Extended analyses with both simulated data and actual recordings from normal subjects demonstrate that this procedure gives better results than iICA alone.

            "Abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may affect normal cognition and behavior by disrupting the functional connectivity networks that mediate efficient communication among brain regions. In this study, we analyzed brain connectivity profiles from resting state Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings obtained from 31 mTBI patients and 55 normal controls. We used phase-locking value estimates to compute functional connectivity graphs to quantify frequency-specific couplings between sensors at various frequency bands. Overall, normal controls showed a dense network of strong local connections and a limited number of long-range connections that accounted for approximately 20% of all connections, whereas mTBI patients showed networks characterized by weak local connections and strong long-range connections that accounted for more than 60% of all connections. Comparison of the two distinct general patterns at different frequencies using a tensor representation for the connectivity graphs and tensor subspace analysis for optimal feature extraction showed that mTBI patients could be separated from normal controls with 100% classification accuracy in the alpha band. These encouraging findings support the hypothesis that MEG-based functional connectivity patterns may be used as biomarkers that can provide more accurate diagnoses, help guide treatment, and monitor effectiveness of intervention in mTBI.",

In this study, we investigated abnormal alterations due to mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) using DFC of the source reconstructed magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state recordings. Brain activity in several well-known frequency bands was first reconstructed using beamforming of the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical brain regions of interest. A DFC graph was formulated using the imaginary part of phase-locking values, which were obtained from 30 mTBI patients and 50 healthy controls (HC). Subsequently, we estimated normalized Laplacian transformations of individual, statistically and topologically filtered quasi-static graphs. The corresponding eigenvalues of each node synchronization were then computed and through the neural-gas algorithm, we quantized the evolution of the eigenvalues resulting in distinct network microstates (NMstates). The discrimination level between the two groups was assessed using an iterative cross-validation classification scheme with features either the NMstates in each frequency band, or the combination of the so-called chronnectomics (flexibility index, occupancy time of NMstate, and Dwell time) with the complexity index over the evolution of the NMstates across all frequency bands. Classification performance based on chronnectomics showed 80% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, and 49% specificity. However, performance was much higher (accuracy: 91 - 97 %, sensitivity: 100%, and specificity: 77 \u2013 93 %) when focusing on the microstates. Exploring the mean \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This study provides experimental evidence that there is temporal decoupling between the hemodynamic responses of oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) as detected by functional nearinfrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Using 64 spatially distributed optrodes to record motor cortical activities during a free arm movement task (right-left and front-back movements), we detected that the temporal profile of oxy-and deoxy-Hb responses are desynchronized and decoupled (ie, oxy-and deoxy-Hb levels do not rise and fall at the same time). We correlated four different measures of hemodynamic profiles with the arm movements, namely, oxy-(HbO2) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and their summation (HbO2+ Hb) and difference (HbO2-Hb) signals. These measures correspond to the changes in oxygen delivery, oxygen extraction, total blood volume delivered, and total oxygenation with specific movement directions, respectively. They revealed different components of the hemodynamic response in a localized neuronal population in the motor cortex. The results suggested that, by using these four measures, oxygen delivery and oxygen extraction can be coupled in one movement direction, but decoupled in another movement direction for the same human subject executing the same movement task. Oxygen delivery and oxygen extraction do not always co-vary together temporally. Thus, using a single measure of oxygen delivery or extraction alone may not be sufficient to determine whether the cortical area is activated or deactivated. Rather, a combination of all four measures of hemodynamic signals that represent temporal coupling and decoupling of oxygen \u2026",
