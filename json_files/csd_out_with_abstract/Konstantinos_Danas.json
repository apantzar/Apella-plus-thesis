Our numerical computations for the mechanical response of various regular and chiral unit cells with a permanently magnetized elliptic inclusion show distinct features depending on the aspect ratio and the orientation of the inclusion. It is observed that the mechanical deformations are selectively preferred at certain directions, which make the magnetic inclusions align themselves along their easy axes, reducing the net magnetic moment. In particular, for the microstructural orientation angle of 30-60 degrees, the simple shear mode is observed to facilitate easy magnetic alignments and thus becomes energetically favorable over the uniaxial tension/compression mode.

They have tremendous importance to the applications in the display technology in the form of LCDs. Responses of such materials are deeply connected with the multi-field coupling of mechanical, electrical, magnetic or thermal fields. The Twisted Nematic Device (TND) is the most widely used for LCDs, and it is the objective of the present investigation.The TND consists of a liquid-crystal layer anchored between two parallel plates. One of the plates is rotated with respect to the other by an angle\u2206 \u03c6. In the absence of a transverse (ie, normal to the bounding plates) electric field, all the directors are parallel to the bounding plates and form helices that rotate the light by\u2206 \u03c6, allowing its passing through the two polarized end plates. When the applied transverse electric field exceeds a critical value, the directors suddenly acquire a transverse component. This phenomenon, termed the Freedericksz transition, is responsible for the change of polarization direction in the light, which prevents its passage through the device.",

Cooperation of the two otherwise independent loading mechanisms-mechanical pre-compression and magnetic field-allows one to bring the structure near a marginally stable state and then destabilize it with either magnetic or mechanical fields. We demonstrate for the first time that the critical magnetic field is a decreasing function of pre-compression and vice versa.

            "Abstract": "Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) are a class of solids that consist of a rubber matrix filled with magnetizable particles, typically sub-micron sized iron particles (see Rigbi and Jilk\u00e9n (1983) and Ginder et al.(1999)). The interest in these materials stems from their strong magnetoelastic coupling properties. The application of an external magnetic field h, tends to align the initially random magnetization vectors of the particles with the applied external field. As a result the interparticle magnetic forces result in the macroscopic magnetostriction of the MRE. Although theoretical research in general coupled field theories in mechanics was actively conducted from the early fifties to the early seventies, the attention that this area received in the next twenty years was considerably diminished, perhaps due to the absence of technologically relevant applications. One might also speculate as an additional factor the lack, at the time, of the appropriate computer hardware that is required to handle the complicated numerical calculations necessary for the solution of the resulting boundary value problems (geometric nonlinearities, coupling between mechanical and magnetic fields). The situation changed in the late nineties, due to an application-driven strong interest in MR devices (see for example Carlson and Jolly (2000)) and recent experimental investigations of Ginder et al.(1999) on MREs and their applications as well as the more recent studies of Hubert et al.(2003), Coquelle and Bossis (2006), Diguet et al (2009, 2010).

For positive triaxiality (with overall tensile hydrostatic stress), two different macroscopic failure mechanisms are possible, depending on the level of the triaxiality. At high triaxiality, void growth induces softening of the material, which overtakes the intrinsic strain hardening of the matrix phase, leading to a maximum in the effective stress\u2013strain relation for the porous material, followed by loss of ellipticity by means of dilatant shear localization bands.

Indeed, as recently indicated by experimental observations (Srivastava et al.[2012]) at high enough temperatures on tensile specimens, the growth of initially present processing induced voids in a nickel based single crystal superalloy as well as in standard polycrystals played a significant role in limiting creep life. The presence of voids in metals is known to be one of the major causes of ductile failure, as addressed in pioneering works by (Mc Clintock [1968], Rice and Tracey [1969], Gurson [1977]). Most of the studies have been carried out in the case of two-phase material systems comprising an isotropic rate independent matrix phase (metal usually described by von Mises yield criterion) and a voided phase (pores of spherical, spheroidal or arbitrary ellipsoidal shapes).Far fewer results have been obtained for rate-dependent anisotropic matrix systems, generally based on a phenomenological Hill-type matrix. However, there is no damage ductile growth model for the case of porous single crystals. When these material systems are subjected to external loads impurities fail or decohere leading to the creation of pores, which in turn evolve in size, shape and orientation (Srivastava and Needleman [2012]). This complex evolution of microstructure together with the evolution of the rate-dependant matrix anisotropy is critical in the prediction of the eventual fracture of the specimen under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions.",

Multiphase TRIP steels are considered as composite materials with a ferritic matrix containing bainite and retained austenite, which gradually transforms into martensite. The effective properties and overall behavior of TRIP steels are determined by using homogenization techniques for nonlinear composites. A methodology for the numerical integration of the resulting elastoplastic constitutive equations in the context of the finite element method is developed and the constitutive model is implemented in a general-purpose finite element program. The constitutive model is used also for the calculation of \u2018\u2018forming limit diagrams\u2019\u2019for sheets made of TRIP steels; it is found that the TRIP phenomenon increases the strain at which local necking results from \u2026",

The resulting effective back stress in the porous solid, similar to the macroscopic stress and plastic strain, has non-zero hydrostatic terms and depends on the porosity, the void shape and orientation as a result of the homogenization process. Subsequently, a complete set of equations is defined to describe the evolution of the microstructure, i.e., void volume fraction (porosity), (ellipsoidal) void shape and orientation both in the elastic and the plastic regimes.

In order to understand the coupling between the macroscopic multiaxial loading and the microscopic defects, we propose to investigate the evolution of an elasto-plastic porous material up to failure under low cycle fatigue conditions. The analysis is performed numerically, using finite elements, on a periodic 3D unit-cell under the assumption of finite strains and subjected to various stress triaxialities, translated as ratios between deviatoric, hydrostatic stress and Lode angles. The present discussion introduces several novel factors in the analysis: (i) 3D geometry in cyclic loading (ii) finite strains (iii) free evolving void shape (iiii) different hardening laws.

Periodic finite element (FEM) calculations are carried out under a finite strain deformation process keeping the absolute value of the stress triaxiality and the Lode angle constant during the cycle. As a result of the applied loading conditions, the void geometry, both volume and shape, change significantly leading to porosity and void shape ratcheting. The void shape becomes non-spherical from the very first cycle leading to a markedly asymmetric cyclic response of the material. This, in turn, results in an observed maximum stress as a function of the number of cycles.

As a consequence, the new model improves on earlier homogenization estimates, which have been found to be quite accurate for low triaxialities but overly stiff for sufficiently high triaxialities and nonlinearities. Additionally, the estimates delivered by the model exhibit a dependence on the third invariant of the macroscopic stress tensor, which has a nontrivial effect on the effective response of the material at moderate triaxialities.

In this first study, we focus our experimental and 3D printing efforts to isotropic random microstructures consisting of single-sized (i.e. monodisperse) spherical voids embedded in a homogeneous solid matrix. The 3D printed specimens are realized by use of the random sequential adsorption method. A detailed FE numerical study allows to define a cubic representative volume element (RVE) by combined periodic and kinematically uniform (i.e. average strain or affine) boundary conditions. The resulting cubic RVE is subsequently assembled to form a standard dog-bone uniaxial tension specimen, which \u2026",

Each module consists of multiple elemental beams and is arranged in series to form the hierarchical beam. We show, through a combination of experiments and computations, that these beams exhibit stable and realizable higher-order buckling modes. By contrast to the canonical Euler buckling problem, such modes emerge naturally in the proposed self-similar beams since they correspond to almost identical critical loads. By harnessing the imperfection sensitivity of the hierarchical structures, we 3D-print weakly imperfect polymer samples with a small geometric imperfection corresponding to the desired eigenmode. We subsequently carry out uniaxial compression experiments and show in practice that higher-order patterns can be triggered selectively upon buckling. Moreover, these \u2026",

The sandwich system is subjected to simple shear, and the effect of thickness of crystal layer and of interfaces upon the overall response are explored. When the interface has a modulus less than that of the bulk material, both the predicted plastic size effect and the Bauschinger effect are considerably reduced. This is due to the relaxation of the dislocation stress field by the relatively compliant surface layer. On the other hand, when the interface has a modulus equal to that of the bulk material a strong size effect in hardening as well as a significant reverse plasticity are observed in small specimens.

Under higher imposed hydrostatic pressures, the deformation mechanism transitions to a more homogeneous incompressible mode. However, DVC analyses revealed that under all triaxialities there are regions with local dilatory and compaction responses, with the magnitude of dilation and the number of zones wherein dilation occurs decreasing with increasing triaxiality.

The non-trivial interaction of the two fields leads to a decrease of the critical magnetic field with applied pre-compression, while the observed wrinkling patterns evolve into crinkles, a bifurcation mode that is defined by the accompanied curvature localization and strong shearing of the side faces of the wrinkled geometry. Using a magneto-elastic variational formulation in a two-dimensional finite element numerical setting, we find that the crinkling is an intrinsic feature of magnetoelasticity and its presence is directly associated with the repulsive magnetic forces of the neighboring wrinkled-crinkled faces.

The present results indicate that the absolute value of the stress triaxiality as well as of the value of the Lode angle are critical for the microstructure evolution and the subsequent material response. In addition, even though the macroscopic applied strains are relatively small, i.e., in the order of a few per cent, the local strains obtained near the pore surface can increase significantly (even more than 100%) due to significant localization of the deformation. This in turn leads to a critical evolution of the pore shape and as a consequence to porosity evolution.",

            "Abstract": "Ductile fracture at the high triaxiality regime is well-known to be controlled by void nucleation, growth and coalescence. However, under low stress triaxiality conditions and general three dimensional finite deformations, damage is still poorly predicted due to the complex loading state and microstructural changes under such a condition. Experimental results have revealed not only void growth, but also important void shape change and void rotation under shear-dominated loading. The ability of ductile damage models to predict both void growth with shape change and void rotation is thus crucial for complex loading applications. In the present study, a Gurson-like nonlinear homogenization-based model (namely GVAR) is proposed and compared with the constitutive models for elasto-plastic porous materials developed in Kailasam and Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (1998) (VAR model) and Danas and Aravas (2012) (MVAR \u2026",

Using a coupled electromechanical variational formulation, the problem is treated as a bifurcation instability triggered by an externally applied electric field. More specifically, we study a finite thickness liquid-crystal layer, anchored between two infinite parallel plates relatively rotated with respect to each other by a given twist angle and subjected to a uniform electric field perpendicular to these bounding plates. The novelty of the proposed analysis lies in the fully three-dimensional formulation of the TND problem that considers all possible bounded perturbations about the principal solution. By scanning a wide range of the liquid crystal's material parameter space, we establish whether the Freedericksz transition is global, ie, has an eigenmode \u2026",

One way to achieve this is by exploiting the unstable regime of MRE substrate/layer assemblies subjected to transverse magnetic fields. In this work, we study the response of such an assembly subjected to a transverse magnetic field and in-plane stress.

The climb motion of the dislocations is assumed to be governed by a drag-type relation similar to the glide-only motion of dislocations: such a relation is valid when vacancy kinetics is either diffusion limited or sink limited. The DDP framework is employed to predict the effect of dislocation climb on the uniaxial tensile and pure bending response of single crystals. Under uniaxial tensile loading conditions, the ability of dislocations to bypass obstacles by climb results in a reduced dislocation density over a wide range of specimen sizes in the climb-assisted glide case compared to when dislocation motion is only by glide. A consequence is that, at least in a single slip situation, size effects due to dislocation starvation are reduced. By contrast, under pure bending \u2026",
