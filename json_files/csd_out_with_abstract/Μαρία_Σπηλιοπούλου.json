Much literature is devoted to topic evolution in finite document sequences assuming a fixed vocabulary. In this study, we propose \u201cTopic Monitor\u201d for the monitoring and understanding of topic and vocabulary evolution over an infinite document sequence, i.e. a stream. We use Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) for topic modeling and propose new folding-in techniques for topic adaptation under an evolving vocabulary. We extract a series of models, on which we detect index-based topic threads as human-interpretable descriptions of topic evolution.",

An important question is the learning of models upon the primary objects (patients, customers) rather than the transactions, especially when these models are subjected to drift.We address this problem by combining advances of online clustering on multivariate data with the trajectory mining paradigm. We model the measurements of each individual primary object (e.g. its transactions), taken at irregular time intervals, as a trajectory in a high-dimensional feature space. Then, we cluster individuals with similar trajectories to identify sub-populations that evolve similarly, e.g. groups of customers that evolve similarly or groups of employees that have similar careers.We assume that the multivariate trajectories are generated by drifting \u2026",

But particularly in the context of the Internet, content and structure change rather quickly, and the way a web site is used may change often, either due to changing information needs of its visitors, or due to an evolving user group. Therefore, the discovered usage patterns need to be updated continuously to always reflect the actual behaviour of the visitors.In this article, we introduce PAM, an automated Pattern Monitor, which can be used to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound and the patient's reaction to it. Although much progress has been made, tinnitus remains a scientific and clinical enigma of high prevalence and high economic burden, with an estimated prevalence of 10%\u201320% among the adult population. The EU is funding a new collaborative project entitled \u201cUnification of Treatments and Interventions for Tinnitus Patients\u201d(UNITI, grant no. 848261) under its Horizon 2020 framework. The main goal of the UNITI project is to set the ground for a predictive computational model based on existing and longitudinal data attempting to address the question of which treatment or combination of treatments is optimal for a specific patient group based on certain parameters. Clinical, epidemiological, genetic and audiological data, including signals reflecting ear-brain communication, as well as patients' medical history, will be analyzed making use of existing databases. Predictive factors for different patient groups will be extracted and their prognostic relevance validated through a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) in which different patient groups will undergo a combination of tinnitus therapies targeting both auditory and central nervous systems. From a scientific point of view, the UNITI project can be summarized into the following research goals:(1) Analysis of existing data: Results of existing clinical studies will be analyzed to identify subgroups of patients with specific treatment responses and to identify systematic differences between the patient groups at the participating clinical centers.(2) Genetic and blood biomarker analysis: High throughput Whole Exome Sequencing \u2026",

Approaches for the extraction of semantics focus mostly on learning hierarchical hypernym-hyponym relations. The extraction of co-hyponym and co-meronym sibling semantics is performed to a much lesser extent, though they are not less important in ontology engineering.In this paper we will describe and evaluate the XTREEM-SG (Xhtml TREE Mining \u2013 for Sibling Groups) approach on finding sibling semantics from semi-structured Web documents. XTREEM takes advantage of the added value of mark-up, available in web content, for grouping text siblings. We will show that this grouping is semantically meaningful. The XTREEM-SG approach has the advantage that it is domain and language independent; it does not rely on background knowledge, NLP software or training.In this paper we apply the XTREEM-SG approach \u2026",

These online stores are supported by sophisticated systems that manage the products and record the activity of customers. There exist many research works that strive to answer the question\" what items are the customers going to like\" given their historic profiles. However, most of these works miss to take into account the time dimension and cannot respond efficiently when data are huge. In this paper, we study the problem of recommendations in the context of multi-relational stream mining. Our algorithm first separates customers based on their historic data into clusters. It then employs collaborative filtering (CF) to recommend new items to the customers based on their clustering structure. We evaluate our algorithm on two data sets, MovieLens and a synthetic data set.",

We face two challenges. First, we have less information on healthy participants than on the patients. Second, the values of the medical tests for patients, even after treatment started, remain well-separated from those of healthy people; this is typical for neurodegenerative diseases, but also for further brain impairments. Our approach encompasses methods for modelling patient evolution and for predicting the health improvement of different patients\u2019 subpopulations, i.e. prediction of label if they recovered or not. We test our approach on a cohort of patients treated after brain trauma and a corresponding cohort of controls.",

At present, the study of an outcome on a population-based cohort is hypothesis-driven, i.e. the expert must specify the variables to be studied. Our approach rather operates in a data-driven, semi-automated way, enabling the expert to identify variables of relevance and generate hypotheses on them.Methods: Our system DIVA supports the Discovery, Inspection and VAlidation of subpopulations with increased prevalence of an outcome, without requiring parameter tuning.

One of the best methods to impute these missing values is Multiple Imputations by Chained Equations (MICE) which has the drawback that it can only model linear relationships among the variables in a multivariate time series. The advancement of deep learning and its ability to model non-linear relationships among variables make it a promising candidate for time series imputation. This work proposes a modified Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDA) based approach to impute multivariate time series data in combination with a preprocessing step that encodes time series data into 2D images using Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF).

This is done without assuming any prior knowledge about the data. However, in many cases, a certain amount of domain or background knowledge is available, and instead of simply using it for the external validation of the clustering results, this knowledge can be used to guide the clustering process. In non-stream data, domain knowledge is exploited in the context of semi-supervised clustering.In this paper, we extend the static semi-supervised learning paradigm for streams. We present C-DenStream, a density-based clustering algorithm for data streams that includes domain information in the form of constraints. We also propose a novel method for the use of background knowledge in data streams. The performance study over a number of real and \u2026",

Many studies investigate the quality of the labels submitted by human annotators, but there is less work on understanding how annotators label. It is quite natural to expect that annotators learn how to annotate and do so gradually, in the sense that they do not know in advance which of the tweets they will see are positive and which are negative, but rather figure out gradually what makes up the positive and the negative sentiment in a tweet. In this paper, we investigate this gradual process and its temporal dynamics. We show that annotators undergo two phases, a learning phase during which they build a conceptual model of the characteristics determining the sentiment of a tweet, and an exploitation phase during which they use their conceptual model, albeit learning \u2026",

Although composed of unstructured texts, documents contained in archives such as annual reports to shareholders, medical patient records and public announcements often share an inherent, though undocumented structure. In order to enable information integration of text collections with related structured data sources, this inherent structure should be made explicit as detailed as possible. The goal of this study is the establishment of a methodology for the integration of text documents with structured records into a hyper-archive of application-specific entities. The text documents are of implicit structure which has been explicated by data mining techniques as proposed in the DIAsDEM framework for semantic tagging of domain-specific text documents. The result is a probabilistic DTD that serves as a basis for the matching of schemata and for the matching of data instances.",

The symptoms often reduce the patient\u2019s quality of life. The TrackYourTinnitus (TYT) mobile health (mHealth) crowdsensing platform was developed for two operating systems (OS)\u2014Android and iOS\u2014to help patients demystify the daily moment-to-moment variations of their tinnitus symptoms. In all platforms developed for more than one OS, it is important to investigate whether the crowdsensed data predicts the OS that was used in order to understand the degree to which the OS is a confounder that is necessary to consider.Objective: In this study, we explored whether the mobile OS\u2014Android and iOS\u2014used during user assessments can be predicted by the dynamic daily-life TYT data.Methods: TYT mainly applies the paradigms ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and mobile crowdsensing to collect dynamic EMA (EMA-D) daily-life data. The dynamic daily-life TYT data that were analyzed included eight questions as part of the EMA-D questionnaire. In this study, 518 TYT users were analyzed, who each completed at least 11 EMA-D questionnaires. Out of these, 221 were iOS users and 297 were Android users. The iOS users completed, in total, 14,708 EMA-D questionnaires; the number of EMA-D questionnaires completed by the Android users was randomly reduced to the same number to properly address the research question of the study.

            "Abstract": "Traditional active learning tries to identify instances for which the acquisition of the label increases model performance under budget constraints. Less research has been devoted to the task of actively acquiring feature values, whereupon both the instance and the feature must be selected intelligently and even less to a scenario where the instances arrive in a stream with feature drift. We propose an active feature acquisition strategy for data streams with feature drift, as well as an active feature acquisition evaluation framework. We also implement a baseline that chooses features randomly and compare the random approach against eight different methods in a scenario where we can acquire at most one feature at the time per instance and where all features are considered to cost the same. Our initial experiments on 9 different data sets, with 7 different degrees of missing features and 8 different budgets show that \u2026",

Medical researchers are interested in the progress of a disease and in the evolution of individuals subjected to treatment. We investigate the evolution of patients on the basis of medical tests before and during treatment after brain trauma: we want to understand how similar patients can become to healthy participants. We face two challenges. First, we have less information on healthy participants than on the patients. Second, the values of the medical tests for patients, even after treatment started, remain well-separated from those of healthy people; this is typical for neurodegenerative diseases, but also for further brain impairments. Our approach encompasses methods for modelling patient evolution and for predicting the health improvement of different patient subpopulations, dealing with the above challenges \u2026",

Recently, several methods for sharing and dissemination this knowledge have emerged, among them is the idea of trading knowledge in marketplaces. Currently e-marketplaces for knowledge goods proliferate. In this study, we investigate the characteristics that allow the trading of knowledge to model as a tradeable good. As not all types of knowledge can be traded, different types of tradeable knowledge call for different exchange frameworks. We discuss two types of such frameworks with respect to the knowledge assets, the pricing system and the quality evaluation method.",

Common generic approaches, that are usable with any classifier and any performance measure, are either slow like error reduction, or heuristics like uncertainty sampling. In contrast, our Probabilistic Active Learning (PAL) approach offers versatility, direct optimisation of a performance measure and computational efficiency. Given a labelling candidate from a pool, PAL models both the candidate\u2019s label and the true posterior in its neighbourhood as random variables. By computing the expectation of the gain in classification performance over both random variables, PAL then selects the candidate that in expectation will improve the classification performance the most.

Classification rule discovery algorithms are an appropriate tool for discovering such subpopulations: they scale well, even for multi-dimensional data and deliver comprehensible patterns. However, they may generate hundreds of rules and thus call for exploration methods. In this study, we extend the tool Interactive Medical Miner for the discovery of classification rules, into the Interactive Classification rule Explorer ICE, which offers functionalities for rule exploration, grouping, rule visualization and statistics.

Examples are (a) companies registered at stock exchange and reporting their progress at the end of each year, and (b) students whose performance is evaluated at the end of each semester. On such data, domain experts also pose questions on how the individual objects will evolve: would it be beneficial to invest in a given company, given both the company\u2019s individual performance thus far and the drift experienced in the model? Or, how will a given student perform next year, given the performance variations observed thus far? While there is much research on how models evolve/change over time [Ntoutsi et al., 2011a], little is done to predict the change of individual objects when the states are not \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Huge amounts of textual streams are generated nowadays, especially in social networks like Twitter and Facebook. As the discussion topics and user opinions on those topics change drastically with time, those streams undergo changes in data distribution, leading to changes in the concept to be learned, a phenomenon called concept drift. One particular type of drift, that has not yet attracted a lot of attention is feature drift, ie, changes in the features that are relevant for the learning task at hand. In this work, we propose an approach for handling feature drifts in textual streams. Our approach integrates i) an ensemble-based mechanism to accurately predict the feature/word values for the next time-point by taking into account the different features might be subject to different temporal trends and ii) a sketch-based feature space maintenance mechanism that allows for a memory-bounded maintenance of the feature \u2026",

One reason is that bundling requires seamless de-assembling and re-assembling of business processes, whilst processes in telecommunication companies are often product-dependent and hard to virtualize. We propose a framework for the planning of the virtualization of processes, intended to assist the decision maker in prioritizing the processes to be virtualized: (a) we transfer the virtualization pre-requisites stated by the Process Virtualization Theory in the context of customer-oriented processes in the telecommunication industry and assess their importance in this context, (b) we derive IT-oriented requirements for the removal of virtualization barriers and highlight their demand on changes at different levels of the organization \u2026",

Only a small fraction of items can be rated by a single user. Consequently, there is plenty of unlabelled information that can be leveraged by semi-supervised methods. We propose the first semi-supervised framework for stream recommender systems that can leverage this information incrementally on a stream of ratings. We design several novel components, such as a sensitivity-based reliability measure, and extend a state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithm by the capability to extend the dimensions of a matrix incrementally as new users and items occur in a stream. We show that our framework improves the quality of recommendations at nearly all time points in a stream.",

In such applications, background knowledge about group-membership or non-membership of some instances may be available and its exploitation so interesting. Recently, such knowledge is being expressed as constraints and exploited in constraint-based clustering. In this paper, we enhance the density-based algorithm DBSCAN with constraints upon data instances \u2013 \u201cMust-Link\u201d and \u201cCannot-Link\u201d constraints. We test the new algorithm C-DBSCAN on artificial and real datasets and show that C-DBSCAN has superior performance to DBSCAN, even when only a small number of constraints is available.",

Since tinnitus affects the quality of life of patients and is associated with comorbidities like depression, the screening step involves the acquisition of extensive amounts of information, which may contribute to the design of a personalized treatment. Often times, it can be observed that patients give up their treatment before completion (i.e., they constitute \u201cdropout\u201d cases). In this study, we investigate how multi-target classification on the screening data can contribute to characterize patients that will drop out of the study. For our analysis, we base or considerations on the target variable \u201ctinnitus loudness\u201d, i.e. the subjectively perceived loudness of the phantom signal.

We set the scene by elaborating on where uncertainty comes from and what the ground truth is. In real world applications, the data observed may not be as expected: they may violate constraints, or, more generally, disagree with the anticipated model of the world. This leads to two orthogonal cases: The data may be erroneous, ie they must be corrected. Or, the model may outdated and must be adjusted to the data. After elaborating on this fundamental distinction, we address the issues of measuring uncertainty and exploiting uncertainty in real applications. We conclude with a list of challenges that should be addressed when dealing with uncertainty.",

This came at the cost of storing multiple entity-centric models in primary memory, many of which would never be used again as their entities would not receive future instances in the stream.

For the many Web resources that are not self-descriptive, such as images, tagging is the sole way of associating them with concepts explicitly expressed in text.

However, a tag still and inevitably expresses the personal perspective of each user upon the tagged resource. This personal perspective should be taken into account when assessing the similarity of resources with help of tags.

            "Abstract": "Texts rating products and services of all kind are omnipresent on the internet. They come in various languages and often in such a large amount that it is very time-consuming to get an overview of all reviews. The goal of this work is to facilitate the summarization of opinions written in multiple languages, exemplified on a corpus of English and Finnish reviews. To this purpose, we propose a framework that extracts aspect terms from reviews and groups them to multilingual topic clusters.For aspect extraction we work on texts of each language separately. We evaluate three methods, all based on neural networks. One of them is supervised, one unsupervised, based on an attention mechanism and one a rule-based hybrid method. We then group the extracted aspect terms into multilingual clusters, whereby we evaluate three different clustering methods and juxtapose a method that creates clusters from multilingual word embeddings with a method that first creates monolingual clusters for each language separately and then merges them. We report on our results from a variety of experiments, observing the best results when clustering aspect terms extracted by the supervised method, using the k-means algorithm on multilingual embeddings.",

This task involves combining the streams, and exploiting associations between the target label and attribute values in the fast streams.

In this work, we propose an incremental clustering approach for the exploitation of user constraints on data streams. Conventional constraints do not make sense on streaming data, so we extend the classic notion of constraint set into a constraint stream. We propose methods for using the constraint stream as data items are forgotten or new items arrive. Also we present an on-line clustering approach for the cost-based enforcement of the constraints during cluster adaptation on evolving data streams. Our method introduces the concept of multi-clusters (m-clusters) to capture arbitrarily shaped clusters. An m-cluster consists of multiple dense overlapping regions, named s-clusters, each of which can be efficiently represented by a single point.

This includes changes in customer preferences, in network intrusion patterns, in the formulation of spam mails, in the topics being emphasized in the news. There is much research devoted in adapting models and patterns to the current state of the changing population. However, tracing and understanding the changes themselves is an issue of no less importance: It delivers valuable insights on the trends of the population and contributes in well-informed strategic decisions. We will discuss the issue of pattern change detection for evolving data, including stream data, with special emphasis on cluster evolution.Pattern change detection can be studied from different perspectives: In the simplest case, it involves comparing a pair of patterns drawn from distinct population samples and testing whether the two samples refer to the same population. These samples may be collected at different time intervals, as is eg the case for sales data for two consecutive months. They may also differ with respect to some property of the population, such as the purchase location, the type of payment or the gender of the customers. Research methods that compare patterns for the detection of differences include [6; 2; 5; 12]. Pattern change detection can also be observed as a spatiotemporal phenomenon. This perspective is adopted among else in [1; 9]. In [1], a cluster is defined as a spatial object-a densification of the topological space.

In this study, we used cluster analysis to identify distinct tinnitus phenotypes based on self-report questionnaire data and implemented a visualisation tool to explore phenotype idiosyncrasies. 1228 patients with chronic tinnitus from the Charit\u00e9 Tinnitus Center in Berlin were included.

Some papers argue that uncertainty sampling performs badly due to missing exploration, others report good results using an SVM. This paper investigates whether uncertainty sampling is able to explore the data space due to the kernel trick used by the SVMs. Hence, we evaluate this on multiple synthetic and real datasets and the effects of parameter tuning and kernel selection for different evaluation criteria.",

While conventional methods process an appropriately prepared corpus, XTREEM-SP operates upon an arbitrarily heterogeneous Web Document Collection on a given topic and returns sibling relations between concepts associated to it.

However, producing a reliable crowd labeled training corpus is challenging and resource consuming.

In this study, we postulate that label quality can also be affected by inherent ambiguity of the documents to be labeled. Such ambiguities are not known in advance, of course, but, once encountered by the workers, they lead to disagreement in the labeling - a disagreement that cannot be resolved by employing more workers. To deal with this problem, we propose a crowd labeling framework: we train a disagreement predictor on a small seed of documents, and then use this predictor to decide which documents of the complete corpus should be labeled and which should be checked for document \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Applications that learn from opinionated documents, like tweets or product reviews, face two challenges. First, the opinionated documents constitute an evolving stream, where both the author's attitude and the vocabulary itself may change. Second, labels of documents are scarce and labels of words are unreliable, because the sentiment of a word depends on the (unknown) context in the author's mind. Most of the research on mining over opinionated streams focuses on the first aspect of the problem, whereas for the second a continuous supply of labels from the stream is assumed. Such an assumption though is utopian as the stream is infinite and the labeling cost is prohibitive. To this end, we investigate the potential of active stream learning algorithms that ask for labels on demand. Our proposed ACOSTREAM 1 approach works with limited labels: it uses an initial seed of labeled documents, occasionally requests additional labels for documents from the human expert and incrementally adapts to the underlying stream while exploiting the available labeled documents. In its core, ACOSTREAM consists of a MNB classifier coupled with \"sampling\" strategies for requesting class labels for new unlabeled documents. In the experiments, we evaluate the classifier performance over time by varying: (a) the class distribution of the opinionated stream, while assuming that the set of the words in the vocabulary is fixed but their polarities may change with the class distribution; and (b) the number of unknown words arriving at each moment, while the class polarity may also change. Our results show that active learning on a stream of opinionated documents \u2026",

The present study used data from the mobile application \u201cTrackYourTinnitus\u201d to explore whether tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress fluctuate within a 24-h interval. Multilevel models were performed to account for the nested structure of assessments (level 1: 17,209 daily life assessments) nested within days (level 2: 3,570 days with at least three completed assessments), and days nested within participants (level 3: 350 participants). Results revealed a time-of-day-dependence of tinnitus. In particular, tinnitus was perceived as louder and more distressing during the night and early morning hours (from 12 A.M. \u2013 8 A.M.) than during the upcoming day. Since previous studies suggested that stress (and stress-associated hormones) show a circadian rhythm and this might influence the time-of-day-dependence of tinnitus, we evaluated whether the described results change when statistically controlling for subjectively reported stress-levels. Correcting for subjective stress-levels, however, did not change the result that tinnitus (loudness and distress) was most severe at night and early morning. These results show that time-of-day contributes to the level of both tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress. Possible implications of our results for the clinical management of tinnitus are that tailoring the timing of therapeutic interventions to the circadian rhythm of individual patients (chronotherapy) might be promising.",

This has resulted in reliance on crowdworking for label acquisition. However, these labels come with a penalty of unreliability, which gives rise to the need for assessing the reliability of labels. One such assessment can be performed by determining the difficulty of the labeling task performed by the crowdworker. Assessing annotator stress levels while performing a task can be indicative of its difficulty. We propose a time series classification approach that learns on stress signals of crowdworkers to distinguish between easy and difficult exemplary instance-labeling tasks. To transfer this classifier for a labeling task of different nature, we propose two types of time series classification models: a global model trained on the data of all label annotators, and individual-centric models trained on the time series of each annotator. We incorporate this approach into an instance-labeling framework that encompasses one phase for learning on exemplary tasks and one phase for the characterization of unknown tasks. In other words, the model is trained on a data distribution and is then used for classifying data from another distribution. We show that the individual-centric models achieve better performance than their global counterparts on many occasions, and we report notable performance by the classification models overall.",

In diesem Beitrag wird das DIAsDEM-Vorgehensmodell zur semiautomatischen semantischen Annotation fachspezifischer Textarchive vorgestellt. Es beinhaltet einen komplexen Text Mining-Proze\u00df, um die diesen Archiven h\u00e4ufig inh\u00e4rente, jedoch undokumentierte semantische Struktur zu entdecken, eine XML DTD abzuleiten und die Texte in semantisch ausgezeichnete XML-Dokumente zu \u00fcberf\u00fchren. Dabei wird ein Clustering-Algorithmus des SAS Enterprise Miner im Rahmen eines Plug-In-Konzepts verwendet. Die Qualit\u00e4t der Auszeichnung wird im Rahmen einer Fallstudie evaluiert.",

            "Abstract": "Companies with web presence rely on web usage analysis to obtain insights on customer behavior, associations among products, impact of advertisement banners, web marketing campaigns and product promotions. The validity of these results depends heavily on the accurate reconstruction of the visitors' activities in the web site. To this end, many sites employ cookies that distinguish among different users coming from the same proxy server or anonymizer. However, the set of activities thus grouped together refer to the whole lifetime of a cookie at the user's host. The activities performed during each visit to the web site, the\" sessions\", are not grouped properly, thus prohibiting the monitoring of changes in the user's behaviour and in her interaction with the site during each session. The reconstruction of user sessions, the so-called\" sessionizing\" is blurred by client caches and multiple instantiations of the user's browser. \u042bessionizing tools exploit information on the site's topology and statistics on its usage, in order to assess the correct contents of a user session. These tools are based on heuristic rules and on assumptions about the site's usage, and are therefore prone to error. In this study, we provide a formal framework for the evaluation of the accuracy of sessionizing tools. We introduce a set of measures that compute the extent to which real sessions are successfully reconstructed by different sessionizers. The wide range of measures proposed reflects the fact that some web usage analysis applications require exact reconstruction of a session, while for others ordering and page revisits are not important. On the basis of these measures, we \u2026",

One way to support this goal is to make the semantics of small document regions explicit, e.g. as XML labels, so that query engines can exploit them. To this purpose, the topics of the small document regions must be discovered from the texts; differently from document labelling applications, fine-grain topics cannot be listed in advance for arbitrary collections. Text-understanding approaches can derive the topic of a document region but are less appropriate for the construction of a small set of topics that can be used in queries.To address this challenge we propose the coupling of text mining, prior knowledge explicated in ontologies and human expertise and present the system RELFIN, which is designed to assis \u2026",

However, the reliability of crowdsourced labels remains a challenge. Many approaches rely on domain experts who are scarce and expensive. In this work, we propose to use Twitter to acquire labels and to juxtapose them with crowdsourced ones. This allows us to measure annotator reliability. Since annotator expertise may vary, depending on content, we propose a new topic-based reliability measurement approach. We compare our model with Kappa Weighted Voting and Majority Voting as baseline methods, and show that our approach performs well and is robust when up to 30% of the annotators is not reliable.",

With these features we train classifiers on a set of tumors that are difficult to classify, even for human experts. We show that the features of the most suspect region alone cannot distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, yet the properties of this region are indicative of tumor malignancy for the dataset we studied.",

Subjective tinnitus is defined as a phantom perception of a tone or noise in the absence of any physical source. It is known to be a heterogeneous condition, both in the way of manifestation and of generation. In general,\u201cheterogeneity\u201d describes the fact that there is a non-uniform appearance of a substance, organism, or disease. Whenever there is a non-uniformity in at least one quality, we can call it \u201cheterogeneous.\u201d Tinnitus patients differ on at least four dimensions: First, tinnitus patients may present diverse clinical profiles with respect to the perception of tinnitus (eg, laterality of tinnitus, tinnitus pitch, ringing, buzzing, hissing, or cricket sounds). Additionally, tinnitus can be occasional or permanent, acute or chronic, pulsatile, or constant. Second, while there are multiple ways of perceiving tinnitus, it is also associated with multiple causal risk factors\u2014hearing loss, temporomandibular joint disorder, and aging being among the most common ones. There are also numerous related comorbidities that add to the complex clinical picture of tinnitus (eg, hyperacusis, depression, sleep disorders, headache, concentration problems). A third dimension is the associated tinnitus distress, the psychological reaction to the ongoing tinnitus perception; it can differ largely among patients.

In addition, customer interactions, including personalized content, e-mail campaigns, online customer service, and online surveys provide new channels of communication that were not previously available or were very inefficient. The Web is revolutionizing the way businesses interact with each other (B2B) and with each customer (B2C). It has introduced entirely new ways of doing commerce, including auctions and reverse auctions, micro-segmented offers, dynamic pricing, and up-to-date content. It also made it imperative for organizations and companies to optimize their electronic business.Knowledge about the customer is fundamental for the establishment of viable e-commerce solutions. As described by Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon. com, and mentioned by Joseph Pine in his book The Experience Economy (Pine et al.), customer experience is the key to building customer loyalty in an on-line store because leaving the store is only one click away. Web mining for e-commerce is the application of mining techniques to acquire this knowledge for improving e-commerce. The use of mining techniques in e-commerce can help improve cross-sells, up-sells, assortments shown, ads shown. In addition, clickstream collection allows for unprecedented measurement of site activities, conversion rates, and the effect of action (Kohavi, 2001).",

For the analysis of visitor navigation behaviour in such web sites, we propose the web usage miner (WUM), which discovers navigation patterns subject to advanced statistical and structural constraints.

Traditionally, communities are observed as a static phenomenon. However, they are evolving constellations, which emerge, lose members and obtain new ones and potentially, grow, coerce, split or decline. Such dynamic phenomena require the study of social networks across the time axis. We propose the graph mining algorithm DENGRAPH for the discovery and monitoring of evolving communities. Data mining methods are successfully used for community discovery but are mostly limited to the static perspective. Taking a dynamic perspective implies the study of a stream of interactions among community members. Accordingly, our DENGRAPH is an incremental graph mining algorithm, which detects and adapts communities over time. We report on \u2026",

It combines established clustering techniques, inspired by semi-supervised learning, which are used to capture the structure of the unlabelled data, with the recently introduced probabilistic active learning approach, which is used for the selection among clusters. The labels actively selected by COPAL are then available for training an arbitrary adaptive stream classifier. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated on several synthetic and \u2026",

We introduce a new privacy concern, website privacy as a special case of business privacy. We define the possible adversaries who could be interested in disclosing website information and the vulnerabilities in the query log, which they could exploit. We elaborate on anonymization techniques to protect website information, discuss different types of attacks that an adversary could use and propose an anonymization strategy for one of these attacks. We then present a graph-based heuristic to validate the effectiveness of our anonymization method and perform an experimental evaluation of this approach. Our experimental results show that the query log can be appropriately anonymized against the specific attack, while retaining a significant volume of useful data.",

While there is much research on finding the concrete influential members of a social network, there are less findings about the properties distinguishing between an influential and a non-influential user. A major challenge is the absence of a ground truth, on which supervised learning can be performed. In this study, we propose a complete framework for supervised separation between influential and non-influential users in a social network. The first component of our framework, the InfluenceLearner, extracts a Relation Graph and an Interaction Graph from a social network, computes network properties from them and then uses them for supervised learning. The second component of our framework, the SNAnnotator, serves for the establishment of a ground truth through manual annotation of tweets and users: it contains a crawling mechanism that produces a batch of tweets to \u2026",

After dataset filtering, a total of 2172 past members of Tinnitus Talk were included in the analyses. Nine predefined reasons for discontinued usage of Tinnitus Talk were included in the survey as well as one open question. Moreover, there were 14 predefined questions focusing on perception of Tinnitus Talk (usefulness, content, community, and quality of members\u2019 posts). Mixed methods analyses were performed. Frequencies and correlation coefficients were calculated for quantitative data, and grounded theory methodology was utilized for exploration of the qualitative data.Results: Quantitative analysis revealed reasons for discontinued use of Tinnitus Talk as well as associations of these reasons with perceptions of Tinnitus Talk and age. Among the eight predefined reasons for discontinued use of Tinnitus Talk, the most frequently reported was not finding the information they were looking for (451/2695, 16.7%).

However, investigations on how samples recruited by different methods differ from each other are lacking. In the present study, three large samples each recruited by different means were compared: N=5017 individuals registered at a self-help web platform for tinnitus (crowdsourcing platform Tinnitus Talk), N=867 users of a smart mobile application for tinnitus (crowdsensing platform TrackYourTinnitus), and N=3786 patients contacting an outpatient tinnitus clinic (Tinnitus Center of University Hospital Regensburg). The three samples were compared regarding age, gender, and duration of tinnitus (month or years perceiving tinnitus; subjective report) using chi-squared tests. The three samples significantly differed from each other in age, gender, and tinnitus duration (p20 years). Implications of these findings for clinical research are that newer technologies such as crowdsourcing and crowdsensing platforms offer the possibility to reach individuals hard to get in contact with at an outpatient tinnitus clinic. Depending on the aims and the inclusion / exclusion criteria of a given study, different recruiting strategies (clinic and / or newer technologies) offer different advantages and disadvantages. In general, study results might be increased when tinnitus study samples are recruited in the clinic as well as via crowdsourcing and crowdsensing.",

Based on the KDD-driven DIAs-DEM framework, we propose a new method to derive an archive-specific structured XML document type definition (DTD). Our approach utilizes association rule discovery and sequence mining techniques to structure a previously derived flat, i.e. unstructured DTD. We introduce the notion of a probabilistic DTD that is derived by discovering associations among and frequent sequences of XML tags, respectively.",

Building on a probabilistic active learning framework, our approach is non-myopic, fast, and optimizes a performance measure (like accuracy) directly.

            "Abstract": "Numerous stream mining algorithms are equipped with forgetting mechanisms, such as sliding windows or fading factors, to make them adaptive to changes. In recommender systems those techniques have not been investigated thoroughly despite the very volatile nature of users' preferences that they deal with. We developed five new forgetting techniques for incremental matrix factorization in recommender systems. We show on eight datasets that our techniques improve the predictive power of recommender systems. Experiments with both explicit rating feedback and positive-only feedback confirm our findings showing that forgetting information is beneficial despite the extreme data sparsity that recommender systems struggle with. Improvement through forgetting also proves that users' preferences are subject to concept drift.",

Next to detecting change, it is also important to interpret it. Consider customer profiling as an example: Is a cluster corresponding to a group of customers simply disappearing or are its members migrating to other clusters? Does a new cluster reflect a new type of customers or does it rather consist of old customers whose preferences shift? To answer such questions, we have proposed the framework MONIC [20] for modeling and tracking cluster transitions. MONIC has been re-discovered some years after publication and is enjoying a large citation record from papers on community evolution, cluster evolution, change prediction and topic evolution.",

We define a community as a high-level temporal structure composed of \u201ccommunity instances\u201d that are defined conventionally through observable active participation and are captured at distinct timepoints.

DIAsDEM focuses on archives characterized by a peculiar terminology and by an implicit structure such as court filings and company reports. In the knowledge discovery phase, text units are iteratively clustered by similarity of their content. Each iteration outputs clusters satisfying a set of quality criteria. Text units contained in these clusters are tagged with semiautomatically determined cluster labels and XML tags respectively. Additionally, extracted named entities \u2026",

This leads often to semantic ambiguities: Popular tags are associated with very disparate meanings, even to the extend that some tags (eg\u201d beautiful\u201d or\u201d toread\u201d) are irrelevant to the semantics of the resources they annotate. We propose a method that learns a topic model for documents under a tag and visualizes the different meanings associated with the tag. Our approach deals with the following problems. First, tag miscellany is a temporal phenomenon: tags acquire multiple semantics gradually, as users apply them to disparate documents. Hence, our method must capture and visualize the evolution of the topics in a stream of documents. Second, the meanings associated to a tag must be presented in a human-understandable way; This concerns both the choice of words and the visualization of all meanings. Our method uses AdaptivePLSA, a variation of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis for streams, to learn and adapt topics on a stream of documents annotated with a specific tag. We propose a visualization technique called Topic Table to visualize document prototypes derived from topics and their evolution over time. We show by a case study how our method captures the evolution of tags selected as frequent and ambiguous, and visualizes their semantics in a comprehensible way. Additionally, we show the effectiveness by adding alien resources under a tag. Our approach indeed visualizes hints to \u2026",

Whenever a recommendation is formulated, though, or the similarity between two students is assessed, each of the observed individuals is at some, a priori unknown and typically not observable intermediate state of the learning process. This process manifests itself as a drifting stream of activities. Learning methods that adapt their models to the current state of this stream allow the formulation of recommendations aligned to the current learning stage of a student, taking into account students that evolve/learn similarly to her. The underlying technology is that of stream mining, rather than data mining.This talk is on the potential and challenges of conventional stream mining and relational stream mining for educational purposes. We start with mining over a conventional stream of activities \u2026",

We propose a mining approach for cohort analysis in a longitudinal population-based epidemiological study, and show that modelling and exploiting the evolution of cohort participants over time improves classification quality towards an outcome (a disease). Our mining workflow encompasses steps for tracing the evolution of the cohort participants and for using evolution features in classification. We show that our approach separates better between classes and that change in the values of variables is predictive. We report on results for the liver disorder hepatic steatosis (high fat accumulation in the liver), but our approach is appropriate for classification of longitudinal epidemiological data on further disorders.",

One such need is to acquire insights to cross-references among entities in the databases, whereby search hits with many cross-references are expected to be more informative than those with few cross-references. In this work, we investigate to what extend this expectation holds.

To this purpose, we use a two-level stream clustering algorithm that extracts features and subfeatures from an opinionated stream, and couple it with dedicated feature-specific classifiers that assess the polarity of each extracted (sub)feature. We evaluate our method on a stream of reviews and we elaborate on how changes in the arrival rate of features (drift) affects algorithm performance.",

Streaming data can be considered as one of the main sources of what is called big data. While predictive modeling for data streams and big data have received a lot of attention over the last decade, many research approaches are typically designed for well-behaved controlled problem settings, overlooking important challenges imposed by real-world applications. This article presents a discussion on eight open challenges for data stream mining. Our goal is to identify gaps between current research and meaningful applications, highlight open problems, and define new application-relevant research directions for data stream mining. The identified challenges cover the full cycle of knowledge discovery and involve such problems as: protecting data privacy \u2026",

A total of 78 nonclinical participants, who provided 1 PSRS assessment and at least 4 repeated PSS-4 measurements, were included in this pilot study. Linear multilevel models were used to analyze the time trend of stress levels and interactions with perceived stress reactivity.Results: Across the whole sample, stress levels did not change while using TYS (P=. 83). Except for one subscale of the PSRS, interindividual differences in perceived stress reactivity did not influence the trajectories of stress levels. However, participants with higher scores on the PSRS subscale reactivity to failure showed a stronger increase of stress levels while using TYS than participants with lower scores (P=. 04).Conclusions: TYS tracks the stress levels in daily life, and most of the results showed that stress levels do not change while using TYS. Controlled trials are necessary to evaluate whether it is specifically TYS or any other influence that worsens the stress levels of participants with higher reactivity to failure.",

For a data set where textual data stemming from web document structure is to be vectorized the need for a enhanced term weighting scheme arose. In this publication we introduce a term weighting scheme which improves the behavior compared to the traditional TFxIDF scheme by adding a component which is based on the linguistically inspired notion of domain relevance. Domain relevance measures the degree to which a term is regarded as more relevant within a data set compared to a reference data set. By means of this external component a potential weakness of TFxIDF on non standard distributed data sets is overcome. This weighting scheme favours domain relevant terms, which can be regarded as more useful in settings where the clustering is performed to be consumed by an human supervisor e.g for \u2026",

It is argued that this approach has three significant advantages. Firstly, with the expansion of clataset size, the tract ability of mining from the complete dataset may be difficult on a regular basis, secondly, changes in observations (and therefore in the observed system) can be more easily discovered by inspecting changes in extracted rules over time (or",

Our approach is based on iterative clustering of text units into homogeneous groups whose labels form the XML tags surrounding their contents and from which the document type definition for the collection is derived. DIAsDEM further incorporates a sophisticated mechanism for the preparation of texts on a specific knowledge domain that are characterized by jargon and syntax deviating from conventional linguistic rules. A case study on the semantic tagging of texts from the German Commercial Register archive demonstrates the advantages and applicability radius of our approach.",

            "Abstract": "In diabetic patients, excessive peak plantar pressure has been identified as major risk factor for ulceration. Analyzing plantar pressure distributions potentially improves the identification of patients with a high risk for foot ulceration development. The goal of this study was to classify regional plantar pressure distributions. By means of a sensor-equipped insole, pressure recordings of healthy controls (n = 18) and diabetics with severe polyneuropathy (n = 25) were captured across eight foot regions. The study involved a controlled experimental protocol with multiple sessions, where a session contained several cycles of pressure exposure. Clustering was used to identify subgroups of study participants that are characterized by similar pressure distributions. For both analyzed groups, the number of clusters to best describe the pressure profiles was four. When both groups were combined, analysis again led to four distinct clusters. While three clusters did not separate between healthy and diabetic volunteers the fourth cluster was only represented by diabetics. Here the pressure distribution pattern is characterized by a focal point of pressure application on the forefoot and low pressure on the lateral region. Our data suggest that pressure clustering is a feasible means to identify inappropriate biomechanical plantar stress.",

Social tagging addresses information overload by easing the task of locating interesting entities in a social network. Nevertheless, users can still be overwhelmed by too many tags posted at each moment. A process is needed that offers an accurate overview of the representative entities and their relationships with each other, while dealing with the dynamics of social tagging and of tags\u2019 semantics. We propose a method for the automated summarization of an evolving multi-modal social network, focusing on the entities that stay representative over time for some subnetwork in the social tagging system. We report on experiments with real data from the Bibsonomy social tagging system, where we compare our dynamic approach with a static one.",

The preferences, however, are not static. They are subject to concept drift or even shift, as it is known from e.g. stream mining. They undergo permanent changes as the taste of users and perception of items change over time. Therefore, it is crucial to select the actual data for training models and to forget the outdated ones.The problem of selective forgetting in recommender systems has not been addressed so far. Therefore, we propose two forgetting techniques for incremental matrix factorization and incorporate them into a stream recommender. We use a stream-based algorithm that adapts continuously to changes, so that forgetting techniques have an immediate effect on recommendations.

However, since communities are not static, but change over time, it is necessary to provide methods to determine and observe the community transitions and to extract the factors that cause the development. We regard a community as an object that exists over time and propose to observe community transitions along the time axis. For this we partition the time axis under observation by time windows. In each time window, a set of interactions between community participants is aggregated. These static networks are analyzed for subcommunities by applying community detection mechanisms. Through this we detect communities in each interval and can observe if communities persist over time or undergo a transition. We present community transitions and the observable indicators for the respective development. We furthermore present a software environment that incorporates several community detection and analysis methods to analyze community transitions. It supports a dynamic temporal community analysis and provides several forms of visualizations and analysis settings thus providing an interactive tool to observe community dynamics.",

When utilizing these aspects, valuable outlier information can be extracted, which can be then used for condition-based monitoring, alert management, or predictive maintenance. In this work, we compare different types of outlier detection methods and scores in the light of the aforementioned production levels with the goal to develop a modelfor outlier detection that incorporates these production levels.The proposed model, in turn, is basically inspired by a use casefrom the field of additive manufacturing, which is also known asindustrial 3D-printing.

In order to facilitate efficient, structure-based search in archives and to enable information integration of text collections with related data sources, this inherent structure should be made explicit as detailed as possible. Inferring a semantic and structured XML document type definition (DTD) for an archive and subsequently transforming the corresponding texts into XML documents is a successful method to achieve this objective. The main contribution of this paper is a new method to derive structured XML DTDs in order to extend previously derived flat DTDs. We use the DIAsDEM framework to derive a preliminary, unstructured XML DTD whose components are supported by a large number of documents. However, all XML tags contained in this preliminary DTD cannot a priori be assumed to be mandatory. Additionally, there is no fixed order of XML tags and automatically tagging an archive using a derived DTD always implicates tagging errors. Hence, we introduce the notion of probabilistic XML DTDs whose components are assigned probabilities of being semantically and structurally correct. Our method for establishing a probabilistic XML DTD is based on discovering associations between, resp. frequent sequences of XML tags.",

Web mining, a much younger discipline, concentrates on the analysisofdata pertinentto theWeb. Web mining methods areappliedonusage data and Web site content; they strive to improve our understanding of how the Web is used, to enhance usability and to promote mutual satisfaction between e-business venues and their potential customers. In the last years, the interest for the Web as medium for communication, interaction and business has led to new challenges and to intensive, dedicated research. Many of the infancy problems in Web mining have now been solved but the tremendous potential for new and improved uses, as well as misuses, of the Web are leading to new challenges.",

The analysis of experimental data, eg from category learning experiments, is a major challenge due to confounding factors related to perceptual processing, feedback value, response selection, as well as inter-individual differences in learning progress due to differing strategies or skills. We use machine learning to investigate (Q1) how participants of an auditory category-learning experiment evolve towards learning,(Q2) how participant performance saturates and (Q3) how early we can differentiate whether a participant has learned the categories or not. We found that a Gaussian Mixture Model describes well the evolution of participant performance and serves as basis for identifying influencing factors of task configuration (Q1). We found early saturation trends (Q2) and that CatBoost, an advanced classification algorithm, can \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Data Mining (DM) has enjoyed great popularity in recent years, with advances in both research and commercialization. The first generation of DM research and development has yielded several commercially available systems, both stand-alone and integrated with database systems; produced scalable versions of algorithms for many classical DM problems; and introduced novel pattern discovery problems. In recent years, research has tended to be fragmented into several distinct pockets without a comprehensive framework. Researchers have continued to work largely within the parameters of their parent disciplines, building upon existing and distinct research methodologies. Even when they address a common problem (for example, how to cluster a dataset) they apply different techniques, different perspectives on what the important issues are, and different evaluation criteria. While different approaches can be complementary, and such a diversity is ultimately a strength of the field, better communication across disciplines is required if DM is to forge a distinct identity with a core set of principles, perspectives, and challenges that differentiate it from each of the parent disciplines. Further, while the amount and complexity of data continues to grow rapidly, and the task of distilling useful insight continues to be central, serious concerns have emerged about social implications of DM. Addressing these concerns will require advances in our theoretical understanding of the principles that underlie DM algorithms, as well as an integrated approach to security and privacy in all phases of data management and analysis.

We propose a semi-supervised opinion stream classification algorithm that uses only an initial training set of labeled documents for polarity learning and gradually adapts to changes in the vocabulary.

            "Abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a popular means to obtain labeled data at moderate costs, for example for tweets, which can then be used in text mining tasks. To alleviate the problem of low-quality labels in this context, multiple human factors have been analyzed to identify and deal with workers who provide such labels. However, one aspect that has been rarely considered is the inherent difficulty of tweets to be labeled and how this affects the reliability of the labels that annotators assign to such tweets. Therefore, we investigate in this preliminary study this connection using a hierarchical sentiment labeling task on Twitter. We find that there is indeed a relationship between both factors, assuming that annotators have labeled some tweets before: labels assigned to easy tweets are more reliable than those assigned to difficult tweets. Therefore, training predictors on easy tweets enhances the performance by up to 6% in our experiment. This implies potential improvements for active learning techniques and crowdsourcing.",

One of the key properties of a stream classifier is adaptation to concept drifts and shifts; this is typically achieved through ageing of the data. Surprisingly, for one of the most popular classifiers, Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), no ageing has been considered thus far. MNB is particularly appropriate for opinionated streams, because it allows the seamless adjustment of word probabilities, as new words appear for the first time. However, to adapt properly to drift, MNB must also be extended to take the age of documents and words into account.In this study, we incorporate ageing into the learning process of MNB, by introducing the \u2026",

In spite of its important applications, classification of streaming multi-label data is largely unexplored. Existing approaches try to tackle the problem by transferring traditional single-label stream classification practices to the multi-label domain. Nevertheless, they fail to consider some of the unique properties of the problem such as within and between class imbalance and multiple concept drift. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-label stream classification approach that employs two windows for each label, one for positive and one for negative examples. Instance-sharing is exploited for space efficiency, while a time-efficient instantiation based on the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is also proposed. Finally, a batch-incremental thresholding technique is proposed to further deal with the class imbalance problem. Results of an empirical comparison against two other methods on three real world datasets are in favor of the proposed approach.",

However, gender-associated differences in psychological response profiles and coping strategies may differentially affect tinnitus chronification and treatment success rates. Thus, understanding gender-associated differences may facilitate a more detailed identification of symptom profiles, heighten treatment response rates, and help to create access for vulnerable populations that are potentially less visible in clinical settings. Our research questions are: RQ1: how do male and female tinnitus patients differ regarding tinnitus-related distress, depression severity and treatment response, RQ2: to what extent are answers to questionnaires administered at baseline associated with gender, and RQ3: which baseline questionnaire items are associated with tinnitus distress, depression and treatment response, while relating to one gender only? In this work, we present a data analysis workflow to investigate gender-specific differences in N=1,628 patients with chronic tinnitus (828 female, 800 male) who completed a 7-day multimodal treatment encompassing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physiotherapy, auditory attention training and information counseling components.

The joint workshop on Web Mining and Social Network Analysis took place at the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). It attracted 23 submissions, of which 14 were accepted for presentation at the workshop. Eight of them have been extended for inclusion in this volume. WEBKDD is one of the most traditional workshops of the ACM SIGKDD internationalconference, under the auspices of which it has been organizedsince 1999. The strong interest for knowledge discovery in the Web, fostered not least by WEBKDD itself, has led to solutions for many problems in the Web\u2019s p-mature era. In the meanwhile, the Web has stepped into a new era, where it is experienced as a social medium, fostering interaction among people, enabling and promoting the sharing of knowledge, experiences and applications, char-terized by group activities, community formation, and evolution. The design of Web 2. 0 re? ects the socialcharacterof the Web, bringing new potential and new challenges. The 9th WEBKDD was devoted to the challenges and opportunities of mining for the social Web and promptly gave rise to the joint event with the First Workshop on Social Network Analysis (SNA-KDD). Social network research has advanced signi? cantly in the last few years, strongly motivated by the prevalence of online social websites \u2026",

These are terms that share a common, a priori unknown parent such as co-hyponyms and co-meronyms. In this study, we present our results on the discovery of pairs or groups of sibling terms with XTREEM-SA (Xhtml TREE mining for sibling associations), an algorithm that extracts semantics from Web documents. While conventional methods process an appropriately prepared corpus, XTREEM-SA takes as input an arbitrary collection of Web documents on a given topic and finds sibling relations between terms in this corpus.

            "Abstract": "Chronic tinnitus, the perception of a phantom sound in the absence of corresponding stimulus, is a condition known to affect patients\u2019 quality of life. Recent advances in mHealth have enabled patients to maintain a \u2018disease journal\u2019of ecologically-valid momentary assessments, improving patients\u2019 own awareness of their disease while also providing clinicians valuable data for research. In this study, we investigate the effect of non-personalised tips on patients\u2019 perception of tinnitus, and on their continued use of the application. The data collected from the study involved three groups of patients that used the app for 16 weeks. Groups A & Y were exposed to feedback from the start of the study, while group B only received tips for the second half of the study. Groups A and Y were run by different supervisors and also differed in the number of hospital visits during the study. Users of Group A and B underwent assessment at baseline, mid-study, post-study and follow-up, while users of group Y were only assessed at baseline and post-study. It is seen that the users in group B use the app for longer, and also more often during the day. The answers of the users to the Ecological Momentary Assessments are seen to form clusters where the degree to which the tinnitus distress depends on tinnitus loudness varies. Additionally, cluster-level models were able to predict new unseen data with better accuracy than a single global model. This strengthens the argument that the discovered clusters really do reflect underlying patterns in disease expression. View Full-Text",

Accurately predicting the taxi-demand is crucial for taxi-companies to effectively allocate their fleet to taxi-stands and reduce the waiting time for passengers thus increasing their overall satisfaction and customer retention. Nowadays precise information about taxi-rides is available and can be used to infer the taxi-passenger demand across different locations and time-points. In this paper, we propose an approach for predicting the pick-demand of a given taxi-stand, that takes into account not only the demand-history of the particular stand but it also considers information from neighboring stands. Our model is an LSTM neural network augmented with information from the spatial neighborhood of the stands.

In this paper, we present an approach that looks for properties of a given problem domain which manifest due to the interactions that take place in the domain.

The characteristics of the site, such as the site structure, as well as the methods used for data collection (e.g., the existence of cookies and reliable synchronization across multiple servers) may necessitate the use of different types of heuristics.

            "Abstract": "Models and patterns discovered upon accumulating or streamed data must be updated whenever the data change. However, whether a pattern is still valid or useful is not determined solely by its statistical properties; it also depends on the expert\u2019s perception and the demands of the application. These can be best expressed as \u201cuser constraints\u201d. Constraint clustering methods enjoy increasing attention, because constraints can capture the expert\u2019s perspective of the domain, so that solutions with given properties are derived, thus improving quality and, sometimes, convergence time of the clustering algorithm. We propose a model for user constraints upon clusters over data streams. We introduce different types of constraints, needed to express phenomena associated with cluster semantics and with the role of individual objects in the clusters, while taking account of data decay, as is typical in data streams. We further present a mechanism that updates the set of constraints as data decay. To support the enforcement of constraints during re-clustering, we propose a method that ranks the constraints to be enforced and we extend the constraint-based K-means of [16] into a clustering algorithm that enforces a prioritized set of constraints.",

Whilst cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) approaches have been shown to be effective, not all patients benefit from psychological or psychologically anchored multimodal therapies.

Objective The study aimed to develop machine learning models that use variables (or \u201cfeatures\u201d) obtained before treatment to characterize patients\u2019 tinnitus-related distress status after treatment. Whilst initially all available variables were considered for model training, the final model was required to achieve highest predictive performance using only a small number of features.   Methods 1,416 tinnitus patients (decompensated tinnitus: 32%) who completed a 7-day multimodal treatment encompassing tinnitus-specific components, CBT, physiotherapy and informational counseling were included in the analysis. At baseline, patients were assessed using 205 features from 10 questionnaires comprising sociodemographic and clinical information. A data-driven workflow was developed consisting of (a) an initial exploratory correlation analysis, (b) supervised machine learning to predict tinnitus-related distress after treatment (T1) using baseline data only (T0), and (c) post-hoc analysis of the best model to facilitate model inspection and understanding.

In this work, we propose a new algorithm for stream-based active learning that decides immediately whether to acquire a label (selective sampling). To this purpose, we extend our pool-based Probabilistic Active Learning framework into a framework for streams. In particular, we complement the notion of usefulness within a topological space (\u201cspatial usefulness\u201d) with the concept of \u201ctemporal usefulness\u201d. To actively select the instances, for which labels must be acquired, we introduce the Balanced Incremental Quantile Filter (BIQF), an algorithm that assesses the usefulness of instances in a sliding window, ensuring that the predefined budget restrictions will be met within a given tolerance window. We compare our approach to other active learning approaches for streams and show the competitiveness of \u2026",

We consider the case of a user who enters such a social platform and wants to get an overview of a particular domain. The folksonomy provides abundant information for that task in the form of documents, tags on them and users who contribute documents and tags. We propose a process that identifies a small number of thematically\u201d interesting objects\u201d with respect to subject domains. Our novel algorithm CrossSense builds clusters composed of objects of different types upon a data tensor. It then selects pivot objects that are characteristic of one cluster and are associated with many objects of different types from the clusters. Then, CrossSense collects all the folksonomy content that is associated with a pivot object, ie the object\u2019s world: We rank pivot objects and present the top ones to the user. We have experimented with Bibsonomy data against a baseline that selects the most popular users, documents and tags, accompanied by the objects most frequently co-occurring with them. Our experiments show that our pivot objects exhibit more homogeneity and constitute a smaller set of entities to be inspected by the user.",

Some of those sequences may contain important information in various forms, such as patterns, with respect to the disease under study, while others may be on features of little relevance to the outcome. In this work, we propose a framework for Discovery, Selection and Exploitation (DiSelEx) of longitudinal epidemiological data, aiming to identify informative patterns among these sequences. DiSelEx combines sequence clustering with supervised learning to identify sequence groups that contribute to class separation. Newly derived and old features are evaluated and selected according to their redundancy and informativeness regarding the target variable. The selected feature set is then used to learn a classification model \u2026",

For authorial clustering on shorter texts (paragraph-length texts that are typically shorter than conventional documents), the document representation is particularly important. We propose a high-level framework which utilizes a compact data representation in a latent feature space derived with non-parametric topic modeling. Authorial clusters are identified thereafter in two scenarios:(a) fully unsupervised and (b) semi-supervised where a small number of shorter texts are known to belong to the same author (must-link constraints) or not (cannot-link constraints).",

However, transforming textual legacy data into semantically annotated XML documents should be automated to minimize costly human effort. In this paper, we present the DIAsDEM framework for semi-automated semantic tagging of domain-specific text documents in a case study. Our framework includes a complex knowledge discovery process that groups structural text units (eg, sentences) based on similarity of their content, derives semantic labels for qualitatively acceptable clusters, semantically tags text units and derives a preliminary unstructured XML DTD for the archive. We apply this framework to collections of publicly available Commercial Register archives and finally evaluate the quality of our approach.",

Usually, their discovery is based on sets of labeled examples and an analysis of the inherent information of the features w. r. t. the target variable. However, obtaining large sets of labeled examples may be not feasible and the sole label consideration could even dilute characteristics unique to distinct subgroups. In such cases, instead of considering the value of the target variable, expert knowledge on the similarity between examples could be utilized. In this work we propose a new algorithm for the \"Discovery of Relevant Example-constrained Subspaces\" (DRESS) which uses constraints on the similarity between examples to discover feature sets that describe a target concept. DRESS exploits the density of clusters and the distance-behavior between constrained examples \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this article, we introduce a general framework for monitoring patterns and detecting interesting changes without continuously mining the data. Using our approach, the effort spent on data mining can be drastically reduced while the knowledge extracted from the data is kept up to date. Our methodology is based on a temporal representation for patterns, in which both the content and the statistics of a pattern are modeled. We divide the KDD process into two phases. In the first phase, data from the first period is mined and interesting rules and patterns are identified. In the second phase, using the data from subsequent periods, statistics of these rules are extracted in order to decide whether or not they still hold. We applied this technique in a case study on mining mail log data. Our results show that a minimal set of patterns reflecting the invariant properties of the dataset can be identified, and that interesting \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Lexical approaches for sentiment analysis like SentiWordNet rely upon a fixed dictionary of words with fixed sentiment, ie, sentiment that does not change. With the rise of Web 2.0 however, what we observe more and more often is that words that are not sentimental per se, are often associated with positive/negative feelings, for example,\" refugees\",\" Trump\",\" iphone\". Typically, those feelings are temporary as responses to external events; for example,\" iphone\" sentiment upon latest iphone version release or\" Trump\" sentiment after USA withdraw from Paris climate agreement.",

            "Abstract": "Reports on major events like hurricanes and earthquakes, and major topics like the financial crisis or the Egyptian revolution appear in Internet news and become (ir) regularly updated, as new insights are acquired. Tracking emerging subtopics in a major or even local event is important for the news readers but challenging for the operator: subtopics may emerge gradually or in a bursty way; they may be of some importance inside the event, but too rare to be visible inside the whole stream of news. In this study, we propose a text stream clustering method that detects, tracks and updates large and small bursts of news in a two-level topic hierarchy. We report on our first results on a stream of news from February to April 2011.",

Query clustering allows for the identification of similar queries and forms the basis for recommendations and query personalization. In this study, we propose constraint-based query clustering to enhance the query grouping process: Prior knowledge about the similarity of given queries is used to guide the formation of clusters, thus resulting in more homogeneous and reliable groups. We apply the constraint-based clustering algorithm C-DBSCAN [10] on query logs and show that constraints improve cluster quality.",

On the other hand, we still lack context-and privacy-aware algorithms to extract the knowledge after a proper curation and enrichment of the datasets.",
