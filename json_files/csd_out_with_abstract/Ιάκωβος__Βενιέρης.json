            "Abstract": "The paper studies two resource allocation strategies (GRID, anti-EMI) for multi-user OFDMA systems. These strategies are evaluated after being compared with the Round Robin and the FFR strategy in terms of mean throughput and mean dissipated power. All investigated strategies assign resources without Channel State Information (CSI), while both GRID and anti-EMI inherently combat Co-Channel Interference (CCI); hence they enhance mean throughput. Simulations indicate that GRID outperforms Round Robin and FFR in all scenarios into consideration and competes the anti-EMI strategy in various network orientations. The latter is justified especially for highly populated scenarios (i.e. 50% probability failure and 2 subcarriers per MT). As for the FFR strategy, simulations verify that the spectral efficiency is not the optimum, which fact has been already verified in the respective literature as well. Finally, the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The goal of this paper is to investigate the performance of MIMO-WCDMA networks, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed at the reception. Multipath propagation is exploited, as the individual received signals can be seen as different instances of the same physical phenomenon (i.e. transmission and reception of WCDMA sequences). In this context, the received data are first transformed using an orthogonal representation. Afterwards, the constructed covariance matrix is used in order to reduce the overall complexity of a proposed transmission strategy for signal transmission in MIMO-WCDMA networks in diversity combining transmission mode. As results indicate, for a 2\u00d72 MIMO orientation (i.e. two transmit and receive antennas) and six multipath components, the complexity of the proposed algorithm can be reduced up to 15%/60% for SNR equal to 0/5 dB, respectively.",

The differentiated service (DiffServ) architecture is preferred over \"hard quality of service\" (QoS) integrated service (IntServ) architecture. Moreover it applies perfectly to triple play, as it satisfies differing QoS requirements. In addition, latest developments in the area of video and audio encoding impose new challenges in content delivery systems. The combination of these three technologies is expected to raise additional QoS related issues. Problems such as full exploitation of available bandwidth and providing adequate QoS to subscribed users by meeting the requirements of all three supported services (video, voice and data) must be addressed.

Since Genetic Algorithms are, in general, weak in the local exploration of the search space, a hill climbing technique is incorporated in the Genetic Algorithm (GA) developed in this paper to improve its efficiency. Furthermore, an adaptive policy controls its parameters, contributing to its robustness and rendering the whole procedure reliable and efficient under static or dynamic environment conditions. Under various conditions and environments, our simulation results indicate that the empirical performance of the proposed GA compares favourably to some of the most known and effective deterministic heuristic algorithms.",

As it evolves towards an information-centric operation, it records everything and forgets nothing, assuming that every online resource disclosed by people (photos, posts, multimedia files, etc.) is permanently valid and is to be stored forever. However, throughout their lives, people tend to change, both in their habits as well as in their views and opinions. In many situations, as the years go by, information released loses relevance or people may decide they no longer want others to access information they have previously published. The work presented in this paper strives for a new information persistence paradigm, whereby the enforcement of \u201cdigital forgetting\u201d is implemented over an information-centric model for the Internet. The defined solution enables the definitive elimination of digital objects, either on-demand or on a pre-scheduled basis \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Despite the usefulness of network monitoring for the operation, maintenance, control and protection of communication networks, as well as law enforcement, network monitoring activities are surrounded by serious privacy implications. The inherent \u201cleakage-proneness\u201d is harshened due to the increasing complexity of the monitoring procedures and infrastructures, that include multiple traffic observation points, distributed mitigation mechanisms and even inter-operator cooperation. In this paper, an innovative approach aiming at realising the \u201cprivacy by design\u201d principle in the area of network monitoring is presented; it relies on service-orientation primitives and abstractions, in order to verify and, when needed, to adjust network monitoring workflows, so that they become inherently privacy-aware before being deployed for execution.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, several mature workflow modelling technologies have emerged. Nevertheless, they all present certain expressiveness limitations concerning primarily two aspects: first, none of them manages to adequately capture all three core workflow perspectives, that is, control, data and resource; further, they typically are either data-centric or control flow oriented, being, therefore incapable of supporting domains that involve both execution patterns. In light of these issues, this study describes an innovative, highly expressive framework for workflow modelling, guided by the  flexibility by design  principle. Main characteristics of the proposed approach include the following: (i) it enables the comprehensive specification of workflow elements, providing extensive coverage of all aforementioned perspectives; (ii) it introduces the novel concept of  assets , as a means for representing the entities being subject to the \u2026",

The framework adopts a three-tier architecture. The front-end part is mainly based on dynamic Web pages for the selection of antenna parameters, enhanced by the VRML standard for visualization of the geometry and results. The middle part of the architecture is based on Java servlets, which are responsible for handling the front-end communication with the remote user and setting up the simulation. Finally, the back end of the architecture is responsible to distribute the computations to a set of computing nodes. This part employs a purely Web-based mobile agent platform, responsible for the execution of partial simulation code to remote hosts.

The proposed architecture exploits the enhanced service control processing features offered by the IN technology to support location management. The access signaling protocol structure is based on the principles of separation between call and bearer channel control, employed in fixed broadband access networks. The design objective is to minimize the changes required to the wired network signaling, by taking advantage of the well-developed capability sets. This allows the easy introduction of the wireless ATM technology (W-ATM) into the real world. It is shown that the proposed signaling protocol model provides cost-effective implementations without degrading the agreed Quality of Service \u2026",

New applications such as Google AdSense and BitTorrent can profit from the use of these resources. An efficient way of discovering and reserving these resources is by using the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concept. SOA can be considered as a philosophy or paradigm in organizing and utilizing services and capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership domains. This paper presents an architecture that can be used to support end-to-end resource virtualization for Web 2.0 applications and in particular for peer-to-peer applications by using the Service Oriented Architecture concept.",

The core principles leveraged towards the creation of secure transactions are the use of advanced security and privacy mechanisms that have never been used within eGov and an advanced role of the eIDs, notably not only as passive identification tokens, but as essential functional components undertaking critical processing tasks.",

The objectives of the proposed policy are to utilize the buffer space efficiently to coordinate with the class-based queuing (CBQ) scheduling algorithm adopted by the IP routers, and mainly to be able to adjust the quality spacing between the different QoS traffic classes. Using OPNET Modeler 6.0.L as a simulation platform, the proposed scheme is compared along with conventional buffer management policies, such as complete partitioning (CP), push-out (PO) and push-out with threshold (POT). Numerical results demonstrate the controllable relative differentiation between classes achieved by the proposed scheme.",

The main innovative feature of the architecture is the definition of the Resource Control Layer that resembles a distributed Bandwidth Broker and offers a feasible way to implement admission control at the edges and manage the resources of the network. The paper focuses on the definition of specific Network Services targeting different kinds of applications. They are implemented within the network through the appropriate Traffic Classes, which properly set various parameters of the network routers.",

One of such situations where both ontology reasoning and rule engines can be applied as technological solutions is the design of an information system that enforces restrictions related to user privacy protection. During the design of such a system, privacy related restrictions could be expressed either as rules into an ontology describing the privacy world of a user, or as a set of straightforward Jess rules.

The next-generation of wireless systems will support a diverse set of access technologies and mobile devices, formulating a broad heterogeneous environment with increased requirements on network support operations. It is expected that the demanding breed of multimedia applications will even more considerably require Quality of Service support throughout the end-to-end path. This paper first provides a tutorial approach on next-generation wireless network architectures and more specifically on end-to-end QoS provision.

The starting point of this paper is the broadband intelligent network which adopts a centralised approach in processing IN service requests. The performance bottlenecks of the IN architecture, centred around the core service processing unit, (i.e. service control point (SCP)) are studied and compared to alternative architectures enabling distribution of intelligence to others than the SCP entities of the IN. We consider a distributed intelligent network architecture based on CORBA and mobile agents technology. We evaluate the performance of this architecture by simulation using a set of detailed models developed to represent the internal operations of the system.

To evaluate the performance of the network platform and the proposed strategy, the system is studied for different network orientations. According to the results, the platform is a good reality simulator, whereas owning to the proposed Radio Resource Management (RRM) algorithm the mean capacity can reach a 12-fold increase especially for highly noisy operating environments.",

            "Abstract": "Radical progress in the field of deep learning (DL) has led to unprecedented accuracy in diverse inference tasks. As such, deploying DL models across mobile platforms is vital to enable the development and broad availability of the next-generation intelligent apps. Nevertheless, the wide and optimised deployment of DL models is currently hindered by the vast system heterogeneity of mobile devices, the varying computational cost of different DL models and the variability of performance needs across DL applications. This paper proposes OODIn, a framework for the optimised deployment of DL apps across heterogeneous mobile devices. OODIn comprises a novel DL-specific software architecture together with an analytical framework for modelling DL applications that: (1) counteract the variability in device resources and DL models by means of a highly parametrised multi-layer design; and (2) perform a principled optimisation of both model- and system-level parameters through a multi-objective formulation, designed for DL inference apps, in order to adapt the deployment to the user-specified performance requirements and device capabilities. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework consistently outperforms status-quo designs across heterogeneous devices and delivers up to 4.3x and 3.5x performance gain over highly optimised platform- and model-aware designs respectively, while effectively adapting execution to dynamic changes in resource availability.",

            "Abstract": "The evolution of quality of service mechanisms in the Internet is prominent nowadays. The Integrated and Differentiated services, along with the evolving Bandwidth Broker concept complement each other to offer the required quality. One significant aspect towards this direction is the capability for users and applications to convey their QoS requests to the core network entities. This paper discusses a middleware architecture that seamlessly supports legacy non-QoS-aware applications to take advantage of the quality provisions. The proposed middleware can also leverage existing QoS-aware or newborn applications. It is destined to cooperate with the QoS management entities of the Aquila architecture in the access and core networks, even though it can also be used in conjunction with existing architectures.",

Heterogeneity and globalization of network resources have, on one hand, increased user expectations for flexible and easy-to-use environments and, on the other, propounded entirely novel ways to face the management problem. Several research efforts recognize the need for integrated solutions to manage both network resources and services in open and global environments. Undoubtedly, these solutions should permit the coexistence of different management models and should interoperate with legacy systems. The presented management system, QoS management tool (QMTool), aspires to address the heterogeneity, complexity, and dynamic behavior of QoS-enabled IP networks by taking advantage of the optimum fit of a number of novel technologies.

This article discusses the need to standardize an end-to-end QoS protocol. It does not, however, focus on the signaling mechanism, since there is currently a relevant ongoing activity in IETF. Instead, it concentrates on the formulation of the QoS information describing the QoS requirements of the session to be established. It presents the generic service specification framework that not only enables the QoS requirements of a specific session to be captured (like a generic QoS \u2026",

However, Cloud Computing emerges as a strong alternative by offering reliable solutions for resource demanding applications and workflows that are of scientific nature. In this paper we propose a Cloud Platform that supports the simulation of complex electromagnetic problems and incorporates classification (SVM) and resource allocation (Ant Colony Optimization) methods for the effective management of these simulations.",

A new architecture is described which aims to bring these concepts closer to practical realization in wide-area networks. The new architecture supports the integrated as well as differentiated services approaches in a smoothly integrated way, and uses the capabilities of an underlying ATM network to realize QoS.

In this paper, we present a production management platform that combines agent-based techniques with the Service Oriented Architecture paradigm. This platform takes advantage of the functionality offered by the semantic web language OWL, which allows the users and services of the platform to speak a common language and, at the same time, facilitates risk management and decision making.",

Apart from its natural role as a unifier, IP also comprises the main drive for network evolution towards all-IP network infrastructures. In this regard, we exploit IP as an enabler for the evolution of the UMTS packet-switched core network, eliminating its duality at user and transport level. We focus on mobility management in the core network, which is handled by pure IP mechanisms (Mobile IPv6, MIPv6), and on the support of fast handoff across UMTS access networks by means of the IETF\u2019s Fast MIPv6 proposal. Emphasis is put on identifying the proper interaction points between the Fast MIPv6 operation and the UMTS-specific Serving Radio Network Subsystem (SRNS) relocation procedure in order to provide a seamless handoff service to \u2026",

The primary goal of this study is to present the efficiency of a simple hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm on the design of a network infrastructure including decisions concerning the locations and sizes of links. A complementary goal is to also address quality of service issues in the design process. Optimization objectives in this case are the network layout cost and the average packet delay in the network. Therefore a multi-objective instance of the hybrid PSO algorithm is applied. The particular hybrid PSO includes mutation to avoid premature convergence. For the same reason repulsion/attraction mechanisms are also applied on the single objective case. Mutation is passed on to the mufti-objective instance of the algorithm. Obtained results are compared with corresponding evolutionary approaches.",

It notes that until now, convergence between Internet and PSTN has taken place mainly at the transport and (less so) signalling layers. Even there however, the integration is not seamless enough to guarantee the ability to use the same IN superstructure over both constituents. This is an important concern given the investments that have been made in IN technology and its ability to introduce new services expeditiously. Further, the Internet world is more service-rich than PSTN and has a completely different service model. Telephony services are but a small fraction of the services that Internet can offer. Can IN retain its validity when examining provision of services other than telephony? How can IN concepts be put to use to allow interworking between, for instance, the web and the phone?

The lack of signalling capability in a Virtual Path (VP)-based operation chosen for the ATM PON necessitates a flexible Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) allocation scheme for supporting basic functions like routing and addressing. This VPI allocation scheme should be kept transparent for the standardized ATM interfaces which leads to the introduction of a VPI translation function at the entrance and exit of the ATM PON. This in turn calls for the design of a new (ATM PON)-(B-ISDN-Local EXchange (LEX)) fast interaction protocol which should serve the ATM PON specific requirements and also be general enough to be used with other PONs.",

This is the case of dial-up connection where the telephony access network is used to connect the Internet service provider with the user. This would be also the case when the telephony service providers are routing calls through IP networks to reduce costs. In these cases, only the lowermost layers are replaced and so the homogenization of provided services can be viewed less portentously.

Multiple proprietary and commercial protocols and APIs can be used to implement this interface. The paper examines the realization of \"Le\" interface according to the proposed 3GPP standards, namely the mobile location protocol (MLP) over HTTP and the mobility API of OSA/Parlay using middleware technologies. The performance of both approaches is evaluated. Furthermore, with respect to the mobility API of OSA/Parlay, three implementations, based on respective middleware technologies (CORBA, RMI and Web Services over SOAP), are examined, for evaluating the performance of each OSA/Parlay gateway.

It deviates from traditional IN in two prominent ways: first, by substituting message-based protocols with a CORBA distributed processing environment. The new communications infrastructure not only serves to convey IN flows, but also functions as a potent unifying location-transparent layer. Second, the new architecture makes heavy use of mobile agent technology. Service logic programs are implemented as mobile agents, and are thus not constrained to control the switch's operations remotely from a central location. Instead, they can migrate and control its operations locally. The infrastructure elements of the architecture exploit this ability of service logic programs by cloning them and dragging their clones to the appropriate locations in response to excess processing or signaling load.

In parallel, the need to deliver media content to a great variance of mobile and wireless devices is delineated as the indisputable future trend. This paper presents the Enamorado architecture that provides advances towards reconfiguration capabilities in both software and hardware, decoupling the development of new mobile devices from the advance in new content formats. Particularly, an intelligent decision system is presented, which selects the most appropriate content format in terms of device limitations, end-user preferences, current network conditions, request arrival rate and the reconfiguration overhead, aiming at maximizing the number of admitted users without compromising the user's quality standards.

This profound change is expanding to substantially affect modern enterprise operations and especially corporate information management practices. Well-established business models are upgraded to capture value from the establishment of dynamic coalitions and virtual organizations among remote stakeholders. However, these collaboration formulations dictate the concentration, use, and circulation of corporate information and sensitive personal data, and thus ignite severe security and privacy concerns. Enterprises against this background are more than willing to invest in terms cost and time in order to enforce the necessary countermeasures and thus build and maintain the trustworthiness of involved operations. This chapter studies how legislation and inherent characteristics of this new collaboration paradigm affect the qualities of trust and highlights prominent features of security and privacy protection measures that can deal with emerging trust issues.",

In this paper a solution for the context-aware development of web applications consisting of web services is presented. The methodology proposes a model based approach and advocates in favour of a complete separation of the web application functionality from the context adaptation at all development phases (analysis, design, implementation). In essence, context adaptation takes place on top of and is transparent to the web application business functionality. Starting from UML diagrams of independent web services and respective UML context models, our approach can produce a functional composite context-aware application. At execution level this independence is maintained through an adaptation framework based on message interception.",

In the following analysis two kinds of messages are assumed: messages that enter the system from outside and messages that are feed-backs of other messages. Messages (i) belonging to the first category define a message class (s (ij), containing themselves as well as all their feed-backs. The first message of each class is called the generator message of this class and it is the only message for which the relation s (ij= i holds.

As results indicate, the deployment of PCA technique in MIMO-WCDMA networks can significantly reduce the number of active channels that need to be fed back to the transmitter. In particular, for 10/20/30 active users and six multipath components, the mean number of estimated channels that are necessary for appropriate signal reception are 4.2/3.88/3.89 for a Signal to Noise Ratio equal to 6 dB.",

In comparison to traditional allocation strategies, for 2/3/4/5 subcarriers per mobile subscriber and different permission ratios (10%, 30%, 40%), simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms enhance the capacity (mean number of mobile subscribers) of the overall system.

In this context, all individual multipath components are first processed by a space - time RAKE receiver, and then PCA is employed on the received data matrix. The maximum eigenvalue along with the corresponding eigenvector are fed back to the transmitter, who formulates a modified correlation matrix. This matrix is used in order to determine the significant terms that are taken into account during transmission matrix formulation.

A route fitness (cost) function is used to assign selection probabilities to every candidate path and arriving connection requests are routed independently according to these path probabilities. This cost function has been chosen in a way to achieve a successful trade-off between the use of minimum-hop routes and the application of the load-balancing concept. Moreover we show that the performance of the proposed algorithm and other probabilistic routing algorithms can be enhanced with the application of scaling techniques that are used in genetic algorithms (GAs) maximizing the network revenue.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, a novel transmission strategy for Mutliple Input Multiple Output Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (MIMO-WCDMA) orientations operating in frequency-selective fading environments is investigated, in terms of overall algorithmic complexity reduction. To this end, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed on the received data matrix, in order to define the significant terms that are taken into account during transmission matrix formulation. According to the presented results, feedback information of only the primary eigenvector of the corresponding covariance matrix of the received data matrix is required, in order to maintain the mean Bit Error Rate (BER) at acceptable levels. In particular, a complexity reduction of up to 10% can be achieved, when comparing BER values derived by the selection of all components of the received covariance matrix during transmission matrix formulation, and the corresponding BER when selecting half of the components. This reduction is maintained to 10%, when considering a realistic four-element antenna design; however, in this case mean BER inaccuracy is further reduced to 1%. View Full-Text",

The proposed AS algorithm is based on the maximization of the ratio of desired user's signal power to the interference power caused to the network. Performance metrics are derived, such as the mean number of active users for various modulation types and services, after a sufficient number of Monte Carlo simulations. As results indicate, our proposed AS approach can provide significant throughput gain especially in cases of high data rates per active user. In particular, for three allocated subcarriers per MS, 16-QAM modulation type and 10% blocking probability, this strategy provides 33% gain on the mean number of active users compared to the case where interference \u2026",

In that respect, many organizations use security policies to control access to sensitive resources and the employed security models must provide means to handle flexible and dynamic requirements.

Consequently, the mobile user is demanding appropriate technical solutions to make use of customized information and communication services. In this context the notion of next-generation networks (NGNs), which are driven by the convergence of the entertainment sector, the mobile Internet, and fixed/mobile telecommunications, is emerging. Such NGNs are aggregating a variety of different access networks and supporting the seamless connection of an open set of end-user devices, and due to the adoption of an all-IP network paradigm they enable a much better integration of voice and data services. Coincidently the buzzword \u2018fixed mobile convergence\u2019(FMC) describes the current trend towards providing common services across fixed and mobile networks resulting in the medium term in the full integration of fixed and mobile telecommunication networks. The adoption of appropriate middleware technologies and the provision of-called service delivery platforms driven by the ongoing innovation in the field of information technologies provides today the technical foundation for supporting terminal, personal and service mobility and thus the implementation of real seamless information and communication services. Furthermore, users are nowadays looking, in light of an omnipresent service environment, for a much higher degree of customization and context awareness in the services they use.

One possible approach is the use of relays that forward information from the base station (BS) to the mobile stations (MSs). However, up to now, the proposed relaying schemes are focusing solely on channel characteristics. In this work, a novel, content\u2010aware relaying scheme is introduced, where the MSs can act as active relays based on their requested content and channel quality. Content awareness is achieved with a cross\u2010layer algorithm, which considers an information\u2010centric networking layer.

The DiffServ architecture consists of two key components: traffic conditioning at the edge and Per Hop Behavior (PHB) at the edge and the core. Traffic Conditioners contain various elements such as classifier, meter, marker, shaper and dropper. The PHB mechanisms include the queue management and the scheduling. This paper addresses the impact of traffic conditioning and PHB mechanisms implemented in routers (edge) on the overall performance in Differentiated Services architecture, by using OPNET as the simulation tool. We have implemented the single and dual Token Bucket algorithms, the WRED/RIO queuing schemes with two sets of parameters (min, max, maxp), the RED dropping schemes, and the packet schedulers First In First Out (FIFO) and Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ). A number of different Network Services has implemented, each one using a different traffic class. Each traffic class uses a different traffic profile and output queue. We investigate the effect of network transient, as expressed by changes in traffic load, on the performance of the scheduling algorithms and queuing/dropping schemes, in terms of both packet delay and queue size requirements. The simulation results are relative with the utilization on the backbone interface.",

Standardization assumes a critical role in the industrial adoption of cyber-physical systems, namely in the integration of legacy systems as well as the smooth migration from existing running systems to the new ones. This paper analyses some existing standards in related fields and presents identified limitations and efforts for a wider acceptance of such systems by industry. Special attention is devoted to the efforts to develop a standard-compliant service-oriented multi-agent system solution within the ARUM project.",

The need to deliver media content to a great variety of mobile and wireless devices is delineated as the indisputable future trend. This is instigated by the fact that wireless networks can now support the quality requirements of media streaming delivery, while mobile devices are able to present a variety of media content. This paper presents the Enamorado architecture that allows decoupling the development of mobile devices from advances in content formats and implements an intelligent system that selects the most appropriate content format in terms of for example device limitations, end-user preferences and current network conditions. This is particularly important, in cases which demand maximising the number of admitted users, without compromising the user's quality standards. Finally, this paper presents a \u2026",

The idea is to integrate the full scale, variety, velocity, variability and the related determinants of a complex operations\u2019 system into one computable model. The atomic elements of this network are managed nodes being exposed to risk, thus becoming source or target of unplanned events, of positive or negative impacts and propagation effects. Management is understood as continuing effort of operations\u2019 intelligence to realise and evaluate risk and to effectively act on it. The challenges are vast increases of the resolution of object and time and the accelerating change, of particularly technological innovation. These are reasons that RLs become more and dynamic, that models need to identify and capture interdependency across local and global levels and life-cycles, that learning needs to be directly integrated into the managerial workflows. Therefore, the RL concept allows for the integration of the \u201cBig V\u201d of data (volume, velocity, variability etc.) as well as for human and machine intelligence respectively learning.

Traffic Classes provide the traffic handling mechanisms for each Network Service and are composed of a set of admission control rules, a set of traffic conditioning rules and a per-hop behavior (PHB). Different traffic-handling mechanisms are proposed for each network service and are implemented with the use of the OPNET simulation tool.

The Internet community currently concentrates its efforts on mechanisms that support QoS in various layers of the OSI model. Apart from that, the Internet community is trying also to define the protocols, through which applications and users will signal their QoS requirements to the lower network layer mechanisms. The latter task, however, is not trivial, especially for legacy applications that cannot be modified and recompiled. This paper presents a framework for a middleware component that supports QoS for legacy applications. It mainly focuses on the support of a proxy-based framework for the identification of flows, the measurement of basic QoS parameters and the definition of an API that can be used by middleware components or even applications.

            "Abstract": "We evaluate a variation of random early detection (RED) for IP gateways (G/Ws), which drops/marks packets by controlling the average queue delay than the average queue size. The new algorithm is applied when the bandwidth of the outgoing connection varies over time and the service rate is explicitly advertised to the boundary G/W, such as in the available bit rate (ABR) transfer capability. The mechanism embodies the features of RED for congestion avoidance, and additionally guarantees the required queue delay commitments. The mechanism is proposed as complementary to RED, for delay sensitive traffic classes. Performance results using the OPNET simulation package proven that the mechanism is adaptive to changes in the backbone available bandwidth and offers the target QoS in terms of delay.",

The TDMA multiplexing of traffic entering such a system is governed by the MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol, which arbitrates the allocation of bandwidth to the shared feeder. At the same time the need to integrate telecom services presenting demanding quality requirements with plain Internet best-effort services over the same infrastructure, brings new issues to the design of such an access mechanism. The MAC protocol as the only arbiter of the upstream bandwidth directly affects the Quality of Service (QoS) provided to each upstream traffic flow and must meet several constraints.

Initially, the paper shows why power is considered to be a constraint by discussing the processes by which energy is consumed within the nodes. Our goal is to prove that the use of battery as a basic power provider of the nodes is very restrictive, because of its short lifetime. Furthermore, the operations which lead to the consumption of the power inside mobile nodes are defined,(eg the processes followed during the messages exchange between the nodes). Consequently strategies for energy conservation are proposed in order to extend the uptime of the nodes. In addition, the solar cells, an alternative method for energy recharging of the nodes is presented, from a theoretical point of view. Finally the paper examines how power resource limitations affect routing.",

The proposed scheme minimizes service disruption due to handover, by using conditional tunneling of multicast traffic on a per flow (rather than per mobile node) basis. Moreover, a simple buffering technique is proposed, enabling the temporary storage of the tunneled before the handover packets thus eliminating packet loss occurring during the link layer handover period. Also, multicast traffic recipients experience reduced handover latency due to the timely configuration of the network routers providing the multicast service \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Modern simulation applications that carry out large scale iterative processes, such as Monte-Carlo simulations, or manipulate large data structures, tend to be extremely timeconsuming due to the shortage of computational resources or the inherent nature of the simulation itself. Typical simulations can take up to several days to complete on conventional systems, while high-end supercomputers can be cost-prohibitive. Therefore, the need for effective parallelization of software execution and resource management is more imperative. The goal of this paper is to present a fully-distributed platform that enables software simulations to be executed within user-acceptable time periods, by predicting the resource requirements of each simulation. In this context, the platform analyzes files that contain historical data about past executions of the particular simulation. Processor and memory utilization, overall execution time, level of parallelization and distributed execution are some of the information collected and used by an efficient training algorithm, in order to determine the optimal amount of resources to be allocated in a particular simulation. The training algorithm applies several machine-learning techniques such as multi-linear regression in order to efficiently predict the resource vector that will satisfy the user requirements.",

            "Abstract": "The goal of the study presented in this work is to evaluate the performance of MIMO-WCDMA networks in spatial multiplexing transmission mode. In this context, different bit streams are transmitted from each transmit antenna, in a wireless environment with multipath propagation. Due to the inherent complexity of the network orientation (increased number of active users, multipath components, and transmitted bit streams) a simulation platform has been developed executing independent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in parallel. Moreover, a proposed transmission algorithm is evaluated as well, which is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) at the reception. As results indicate, for a 4\u00d72 MIMO orientation (four transmit antennas and two receive antennas) in a multipath propagation environment with 6 multipath components, the selection of the first 5 eigenvectors (i.e. eigenvectors that correspond to the first 5 \u2026",

In this context, we study and analyze the implications of the link-layer agnostic operation of IP handover control on handover performance, having as a reference the fast mobile IPv6 protocol. We show that the behavior of the protocol (i.e., whether a reactive or proactive operation will be executed) is highly dependent on the timely availability of link layer information. A non-exhaustive list of generic link-layer triggers used for this purpose, as identified by the IEEE 802.21 WG, is also presented. Last, we apply this generic framework to a WLAN environment running fast mobile IPv6 and study the improvements in fast handoff support.",

The IN concept is based on the introduction of intelligent servers in the network, able to handle complex service requests by cooperating with the signalling system of the network. The design and implementation of the physical entities participating in an IN session is a critical issue as it defines the system performance. In this paper we propose a methodology for modelling the physical and functional entities which is used to capture the performance of IN\u2010based configurations.

This way the cost and complexity of the development and integration process is reduced, as well as the service administration overhead, which is distributed among service providers and does not burden the network operator. Most existing solutions for standardized access to core network operations follow the middleware paradigm that encapsulates network operations and provides open interfaces to outside service providers.

To achieve such goals, AQUILA implements an overlaid distributed control layer, the resource control layer, implementing a novel mechanism for dynamic control of intradomain resources, the dynamic resource pool. On the interdomain aspects, the AQUILA architecture extends the BGRP framework for the aggregation of interdomain reservations to overcome scalability issues.

The high possibility of a link breakdown due to low energy supplies in a ubiquitous computing environment, such as a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), raises service-provider selection issues with regard to achieving the best possible service reliability. Every node requiring a specific service must choose a provider under certain criteria. This article provides an overview of standardized service-discovery and delivery solutions.

Non-linear constraints were enforced on the solution set, related to the multi-antenna system aperture efficiency and related to the mismatching when the array is scanned. The obtained optimized configurations for an array composed of 16 dipoles resulted in reducing the sidelobes up to 2.5 dB, when scanned 60 away from broadside, compared to a linear array with elements spaced \u03bb/2 apart.

            "Abstract": "The provisioning of quality of service guarantees over a region spanning multiple administrative domains is nowadays one of the most basic and crucial issues. A scalable and efficient end-to-end QoS architecture is indispensable for ensuring the desired QoS guarantees to QoS-aware services. Towards this end, this paper introduces a scalable inter-domain resource control architecture for Differentiated Services networks. The proposed architecture is based on the Border Gateway Resource Protocol framework, while scalability issues are further elaborated. Therefore, our discussion mainly extends to Quiet Grafting mechanisms, which succeed in significantly limiting the signalling load and efficiently handling the resources reserved between domains. Extended simulation scenarios verify the efficiency of the proposed \u2018quiet grafting mechanisms\u2019, while the applicability of the results, especially with respect to real \u2026",

The GPRS and the UMTS architecture carry the heritage of the GSM's philosophy regarding the user/network authentication and the data ciphering. So, the corresponding three nodes (MS, VLR, and HLR) of these systems are involved as well in the authentication and data ciphering procedures. Moreover, the methods of the conventional cryptography have been adopted by all three systems.

Differentiated Services (DiffServ) has evolved from the IETF's earlier Integrated Services (IntServ) standard as a solution to the service quality challenges. In this paper, a novel buffer management scheme called CBQ priority buffer management (CPBM) is presented for IP routers, using the class based queueing (CBQ) scheduler, in a combined IntServ and DiffServ architecture. The objectives of the CPBM scheme are to cope with the various QoS requirements of the IP layer service classes, to utilize the buffer space as efficiently as possible and to successfully coordinate with the CBQ scheduling mechanism in order to improve packet loss performance.

The proposed handover supporting mechanism achieves minimization of the multicast service disruption period by suggesting the conditional tunneling of multicast traffic among the network nodes involved in the procedure. Tunneling is performed after the establishment of multicast membership information at the access router at which the mobile is anticipated to attach, but before the actual handover execution. In this way the mobile is enabled to receive the requested multicast traffic immediately after its attachment to the new network.

Furthermore it presents the way in which issues arising from that introduction manifest themselves, their interrelations and the potential design pitfalls they can lead to. The paper proposes a set of implementation principles for service design and identifies their implication on the overall system architecture but also to the service creation process itself.

In this context, we study and analyze the implications of the link-layer agnostic operation of the IP handover control on the handoff performance, having as a reference the fast mobile IPv6 protocol. We show that the behavior of the protocol is highly dependent on the timely availability of link layer information - this determines whether a reactive or a proactive operation is executed. Last, we provide some quantitative results for performance metrics such as the disruption time and the packet loss perceived, by a single mobile host under varying conditions of link-layer trigger time availability, buffering capabilities and beacon intervals.",

            "Abstract": "The DiffServ framework has been proposed as a candidate for the provision of QoS support in the UMTS Core Network, not only in the literature but also in the 3GPP specifications. This paper proposes specific traffic conditioning, scheduling and buffer management algorithms for the UMTS Core Network, based on the concepts of the DiffServ framework. Simulations show that the proposed mechanisms can provide the requirements imposed by the four traffic classes defined within the context of the UMTS QoS architecture.",

            "Abstract": "This paper discusses the design of a network management system that supports QoS in IP networks. The proposed architecture, namely QMTool, uses the evolving Differentiated Services paradigm and provides end-to-end QoS for IP based applications. The novel aspects of the proposed approach rely on the integration of a collection of mechanisms including QoS provisioning for different types of traffic, flow level admission control and resource management mechanisms that interact with the routers of a network. We focus our attention on the dynamic aspects of QoS management, which is achieved by introducing a set of new technologies. The concept of the proposed management system is described in detail followed by notes of implementation issues.",

            "Abstract": "The Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm controls the average queue size of Internet Protocol (IP) gateways by marking packets. Although RED provides efficient congestion avoidance, it cannot provide queuing delay control when the output bandwidth varies over time. In this paper, we introduce Delay RED (DRED), a variation of RED, which marks packets by monitoring the average queue delay. The mechanism embodies all the features of RED and additionally controls the average queue delay, even when the output service rate varies over time, such as with the Available Bit Rate (ABR) transfer capability. DRED is proposed as a complementary mechanism to RED and can be used for congestion avoidance and for applications requiring a better Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of delay. The performance of DRED has been verified on the OPNET simulation package. DRED proved to be adaptive to the ABR \u2026",

            "Abstract": "During the past few years, mobile communications has significantly proliferated throughout the world. Second-generation (2G) mobile systems have achieved a great penetration into the mobile voice and low-bit-rate (around 9.6 kbps) data services market. However, the capabilities of 2G networks with regard to data services are very limited, and costs have been discouraging, especially when compared with wired data technology. Because mobile communications has turned into a necessity nowadays, the commercial and research communities have begun to focus on the evolution of third-generation (3G) cellular mobile systems that can offer high-speed and sophisticated wireless data services in mobile environments at a lower cost.3G technology is a direct evolution of 2G, with an intermediate step widely known as 2.5 G cellular technology. In particular, using the fundamental infrastructure of 2G, 2.5 G systems offer wireless data services at approximately 100 kbps, which still does not meet the requirements of today\u2019s multimedia applications and the expectations of business users. 3G technology offers data services at speeds ranging from 300 kbps to 2 Mbps, which are sufficient for market needs, while retaining the wide area coverage and high mobility as well as the established user subscriber base of 2G systems. 3G mobile networks are under continuous standardization efforts of the relevant forums, in such a way that their architecture",
