            "Abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the general problem of a continuous curve partition into equal length segments, defined by any smooth distance metric, like the Euclidean distance. The goal is to locate N\u2212 1 consecutive curve points, so that the curve can be divided into N equal length segments. First, it is proved that for any curve C and any number N there always exists at least one N-equipartition (EP) of C. The approach adopted for the proof can be used to compute at least one solution of the problem or all the solutions using a greedy version of this method. These methods have only theoretical value, as there appear algebraic expressions exponentially with increasing degree N. This can be explained by our proof that a version of the EP problem is NP-hard. So, the EP is possibly complete for the NP class. However, an O (N) approximate proof based algorithm can solve the problem with high accuracy. Moreover, we propose two algorithms, an algorithm that computes approximately all the solutions and a steepest descent based method that converges to one of them. Some possible applications are also discussed.",

To answer this question, we develop a method for computing similarities between empirical, statistical distributions of high-dimensional, low-sample datasets, and apply it on hundreds of-omics studies. The similarities lead to dataset-to-dataset networks visualizing the landscape of a large portion of biological data. Potentially interesting similarities connecting studies of different diseases are assembled in a disease-to-disease network. Exploring it, we discover numerous non-trivial connections between Alzheimer\u2019s disease and schizophrenia, asthma and psoriasis, or liver cancer and obesity, to name a few.
