The Seebeck coefficient has been enhanced while the thermal conductivity has been decreased presenting, thus, interesting behavior. The behavior of the materials under heat treatment conditions is now of interest, as the application of sintering process is necessary for the development of thermoelectric modules. In this work, the crystallization of the K2Bi8Se13-based nano-composites is studied using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The results show that crystallization follows a multiple-step process with different activation energies. The thermoelectric properties are also discussed in the range that crystallization occurs.",

The complex electronic structure that arises from a large and low symmetry unit cell and the weakly bound K+ ions, lead to high Seebeck coefficient, highly anisotropic electrical properties and very low thermal conductivity. Reflectivity spectra in the FIR region are presented for several members in the Sb-rich (x\u22656) side. Optical investigations are carried out on crystalline and pelletized samples.

Room temperature infrared reflectivity studies showed that the susceptibility (or conductivity) effective mass m* increases from \u223c 0.06m o to \u223c 0.5m o on increasing Na content from 0.08% to 3%. The Seebeck coefficient scales with doping in the whole temperature range, yielding lower values for higher Na contents, while the Hall coefficient increases on heating from room temperature showing a peak close to 650 K. The room temperature Pisarenko plot is well described by the simple parabolic band model up to \u223c 1\u00b71020 cm\u22123.

            "Publication url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11060",
            "Abstract": "The dynamical electric behavior of a NiTi smart alloy thin filament when driven by time varying current pulses is studied by a structure-based phenomenological model that includes rate-based effects. The simulation model relates the alloy's electrical resistivity to the relative proportions of the three main structural phases namely Martensite, Austenite and R-phase, experimentally known to exist in NiTi alloy lattice structure. The relative proportions of the phases depend on temperature and applied stress. Temperature varies due to the self-heating of the filament by the Joule effect when a current pulse passes and also due to convective/radiative interchange with the ambient. The temperature variation with time causes structural phase transitions, which result in abrupt changes in the sample resistivity as the proportions of each lattice phase vary. The model is described by a system of four 1st-order nonlinear differential-algebraic equations yielding the temporal evolution of resistivity and output voltage across the filament for any given time-varying input current pulse. The model corresponds to a 4th-order extended memristor, described by four state variables, which are the proportions of each of the three NiTi lattice phases and temperature. Simulations are experimentally verified by comparing to measurements obtained for samples self-heated by triangular current input waveforms as well as for passively samples with no current input. Numerical results reproduce very well measurements of resistance vs. temperature at equilibrium as well as the full dynamics of experimentally observed I-V characteristic curves and resistance vs. driving current for \u2026",

            "Abstract": "For years, several researchers and teachers support that involving students in laboratory-based activities in science contributes not only to the construction of conceptual knowledge but also to the development of a scientific way of thinking. However, research studies suggest that during experimentation based on hands-on experiments, students are frequently preoccupied with handling equipment setups and taking measurements, which questions the effectiveness of laboratory based on hands-on experiments as only one of its kind environment for promoting scientific understanding (Psillos and Niedderer 2002; Niedderer et al. 2003). With the advance of ICT technology, virtual laboratories have emerged as powerful environments as well. Virtual laboratories simulate real science laboratories on a computer screen, in a visual and functional manner, by exploiting modern multimedia technology and \u2026",

TEM studies confirmed the presence of nanocrystalline material in an amorphous matrix, suggesting the development of crystalline/amorphous \u03b2-K2Bi8Se13 nanocomposite material via ball milling process.

These measurements included the device's response to triangular current excitation, as well as to pulse driving. In all cases, a study of the noise registered has taken place. According to the theory, since NiTi's memristive behavior is depended on its temperature, it is classified as an extended memristor.",

The sequence was tested with beginning student teachers.

Nanostructuring is one of the efficient ways to reduce thermal conductivity, without much affecting the electrical properties, and is especially applied in thermoelectric materials. Ball milling is a way of producing amorphous alloys as well as nanostructured materials. It is a powder metallurgy processing technique involving cold welding, fracturing, and rewelding of powder particles in ball mill and has now become an established commercial technique to produce oxide dispersion strengthened nickeland iron-based materials. Amorphous materials can be prepared by the ball milling process starting from elements, alloys and/or compounds, and mixture of compounds and/or elements, all in powder form. The ball-milled material shows electron micrographs and diffraction images (ED) patterns with rings of very thin discrete \u2026",

Chromium disilicide (CrSi2) is a narrow-gap semiconductor and a potential p-type thermoelectric material up to 973 K with a band gap of 0.30 eV. In this work, CrSi2 was formed from Si wafers by use of a two-step, pack-cementation, chemical diffusion method. Several deposition conditions were used to investigate the effect of temperature and donor concentration on the structure of the final products. Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis were performed for phase identification, and thermal stability was evaluated by means of thermogravimetric measurements.

The IR reflectivity spectra are dominated by free carriers giving rise to blue-shifted reflectivity minimum in the region > 700cm\u22121. The analysis of the experimental reflectivity spectra showed that the conventional Drude model with a constant carrier relaxation time failed to describe the behaviour in the whole frequency range. It was found that the lineshape of the reflectivity spectra can be better described by a frequency dependent electron damping parameter with resonant-like behaviour similar to the one observed in the case of resonant electron scattering off potential wells. The density of states effective mass was found to increase with increasing carrier concentration supporting the non-parabolicity of the band model for PbSe.",

The focus of the Conference was to discuss the scope, methods, outcomes and perspectives of research in science education in the context of the rapidly developing knowledge-based society. Some 450 researchers, teachers, and postgraduate students attended the conference. They came mainly from European countries, with a substantial proportion-some 20-from countries outside Europe. While ESERA conferences reflect research carried out in Europe, they are increasingly becoming international events attracting researchers from all over the world. A total of 220 works were presented in guest lectures, symposia, poster workshops, individual papers and poster sessions that took place during the conference along with alternative activities and informal meetings.

Thermal diffusivity was determined using the photoacoustic method with a transmission detection configuration. Electron transport was determined by Seebeck coefficient measurements. IR reflectivity measurements showed that reflectivity in the region of plasma resonance was low. Measured reflectivity diagrams were numerically analyzed-enabling calculation of the carrier concentration and mobility-and compared with the values obtained by Hall measurements.",

The highly anisotropic structure in these compounds results in needle-like morphology along the b-crystallographic axis, leaving structural tunnels where K+ ions reside. The complex electronic structure that arises from a large and low symmetry unit cell and the weakly bound K+ ions, lead to high Seebeck coefficient, highly anisotropic electrical properties and very low thermal conductivity. Reflectivity spectra in the FIR region are presented for several members in the Sb-rich (x\u2265 6) side. Optical investigations are carried out on crystalline and pelletized samples. The received spectra are analyzed, examined comparatively and discussed. Results indicate that upon Bi/Sb substitution in the Sb-rich region, phonons develop a mixed-mode behavior in the FIR spectral region.",

Milling parameters, with emphasis on milling time and ball size, and conditions were studied in order to understand the process and investigate its effect on the structural features of the material. Crystallite size evolution during ball milling was followed by powder X-ray diffraction measurements as well as Transmission Electron Microscopy studies. Scanning Electron Microscopy images showed the agglomeration of the crystallites and the formation of particles with minimum mean size of similar to 1.6 mu m. The simultaneous formation of MgO in the material is shown through powder X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction TEM studies. The broadened PXRD peaks were analyzed and crystalline size was estimated based on Scherrer equation. The crystallite size distributions were studied based on the analysis of Dark Field images and were well described based on a Log-Normal equation. The effect of the size of the balls during milling was clear and leads to bi-modal and uni-modal distributions when large and small balls were used, respectively. IR reflectivity spectra showed blue-shifting and broadening of the modes on increasing milling time that may also be assigned to decreasing grain size and particle shape effects.(C) 2011 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",

Upon doping, lattice thermal conductivity was reduced monotonically and, at the same time, MgO content was increased while grain size was decreased. A model has been developed, which takes into account various phonon-scattering mechanisms, the 3-phonon (Umklapp) process, electron-phonon interaction and phonon-scattering by the grain-boundaries or nano-scale MgO inclusions. The model was successfully applied and excellently describes the temperature dependence of lattice thermal conductivity as well as its evolution vs. doping. Application of the model suggests that lattice thermal conductivity is mainly affected by both nano-MgO precipitates and Umklapp processes. Exploring the effect of the grain size and nano-precipitates, our model predicts that the two phonon-scattering \u2026",

The study of their optical and electrical behavior reveal that they are quite sensitive to the Sb content x, and it is found that the substitution of Bi- with Sb-atoms in TlBiTe2 crystals leads initially to a decrease in the plasma frequency. However, for higher Sb contents, the plasma frequency increases. At room temperature, samples with x < 0.8 are n-type semiconductors, becoming p-type ones for x > 0.8.A model suggesting a suppression of the free electron concentration induced by the incorporation of Sb atoms into the crystal lattice of TlBiTe2 is used to explain this transition in the conductivity type.",

The irreversible capacity of synthetic graphite electrodes varies from about 85 to 215 mAh/g depending on the binder material.

The study focuses on three families of samples, namely one undoped compound, as well as two families of doped samples, one at Bi (y = 0.02) and one doped at Sb (y = 0.0125); the latter two materials were chosen because they yielded the highest ZT values.

K2Bi8Se13 was prepared as a single phase using K2Se and Bi2Se3 as starting materials in a furnace or via a reaction using direct flame, followed by remelting or annealing. Seebeck coefficient measurements showed that the doping level in the material is sensitive to the synthetic conditions. Higher synthesis temperatures as well as the flame reaction technique followed by annealing gave more homogenous samples with higher Seebeck coefficient. IR optical spectroscopic measurements showed a wide range of doping level achieved among the different synthetic conditions. These findings suggest that synthetic conditions can act as a useful tool for the optimization of the thermoelectric properties of these materials.",

The Seebeck coefficient shows an evolution from nn- to pp-type character with increasing incorporation of Sb, and at the same time the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity changes from that of a degenerate semiconductor to that of an intrinsic or compensated semiconductor. These changes, however, are not monotonic with composition due to the nonuniform substitution of Sb atoms at the Bi sites of the structure. Three separate composition regions can be assigned depending on xx each with different charge transport characters. Electronic transport in K2Bi8\u2212xSbxSe13K2Bi8\u2212xSbxSe13 was analyzed on the basis of the classical semiconductor theory and discussed in the context of recent band calculations. The results suggest that the K2Bi8\u2212xSbxSe13K2Bi8\u2212xSbxSe13 materials possess coexisting domains with semimetallic and semiconducting characters whose ratio is influenced by the value of xx and by local defects. The extent and relative distribution of these domains control the charge transport properties. Electron diffraction experiments performed on samples of K2Bi8\u2212xSbxSe13K2Bi8\u2212xSbxSe13 with x = 1.6x=1.6 show evidence for such domains by indicating regions with long range ordering of K+/Bi3+K+\u2215Bi3+ atoms and regions with increased disorder. The semiconducting behavior is enhanced with increasing xx (i.e., Sb/BiSb\u2215Bi ratio) in the composition through a decrease of the semimetallic fraction.",

When film thickness is doubled (films-B) material transforms into unstrained cubic phase. Annealing films-B at 300\u00b0C transforms them into the same compressed cubic phase that was observed in films-A.

Basic characteristic is the technique of interaction, the direct manipulation of objects and parameters and the ability of presenting interconnected multiple representations of the phenomena under study. As result, beyond the support of classic laboratorial approaches, new possibilities and prospects are introduced that extend the limits of methods of classic laboratory and create a technologically enriched environment in which the active and exploratory learning is facilitated.

PbSnS2 is a naturally layered material (space group Pnma) comprised of Sn\u2013Pb bilayers approximately 0.6 nm in thickness. High resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals the PbSnS2 segregates into coherent lamellar structures 50\u2013100 nm in thickness that extend 100 nm to 15 \u03bcm in length. Despite the relatively large size of the PbSnS2 precipitates, we find that incorporation of PbSnS2 in PbTe results in significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity to 0.4\u20130.65 W m\u22121 K\u22121 over the temperature range 300\u2013700 K, a reduction of 50\u201370% over bulk PbTe. As a result, a maximum ZT of 1.1 is obtained for ingot samples of the PbTe\u2013PbSnS2 6 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Content analysis of textbooks and of research - based innovative approaches suggests that there is not a widely accepted negotiation of the order in which factors that are expressed in relation Q = m \uf0d7 c \uf0d7 \uf044\uf071 should be examined. The treatment of heating time and final temperature is also important variables that deserve investigation. In this context, we designed visual experiments engaging students in investigating the change of temperature (\uf044\uf071), mass (m), and material (c) together with using bodies acquiring the same final temperature after heating. The simulated visual laboratory used in the present study is a micro-world for the teaching of thermal phenomena. The analysis of the data provided encouraging outcomes. It appears that the use of a dynamic system where the different phases of the experiment evolution can be paused and restarted offered opportunities for innovative negotiation of the relation of calorimetry. Moreover, the facility for changing parameters and seeing the readouts quickly permitted students to experiment with different initial temperatures and promoted a holistic approach to the experimental process, facilitating the linking of theory with experimental results by the students.",

Two valence bands separated by a temperature dependent energy offset are considered. The extremum of the light-hole band has a density of states mass\u223c 0.27 m o at room temperature.

Since the 1970s, it has been proposed as a candidate material for thermoelectric applications [1] and more recently as a topological insulator [2]. A topological insulator is a band insulator which is characterized by a topological number and which has gapless excitations at its boundaries [3]. The mechanism for the topological insulating behavior in these 3D materials is the band inversion at the \u0393 point caused by large spin\u2013orbit coupling. The most striking property of this new class of topological insulators is the superconductivity observed in p-doped TlBiTe2 [4]. TlBiTe2 exhibits a phase transformation from the rhombohedral (D3d, low temperature phase) to the cubic (Oh, high temperature phase) symmetry [5], it has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry [6]. As is known [5], rowing the crystal from the melt (the Bridgman method), a cubic phase of a NaCl-type structure is firstly formed. This means that Tl and Bi atoms occupy arbitrarily the one (of the two) fcc lattice sites. During cooling the material is transformed to a rhombohedral lattice that is achieved by an elongation of the [111] direction of cubic lattice. The strain during the transformation from the high temperature cubic phase to the low temperature rhombohedral phase is relieved by the formation of lenticular dislocations and low angle boundaries. As the starting points of the transformation, within the cubic lattice, are more than one (cubic lattice has four equivalent [111] directions), the orientation relationships under which the transformed crystallites can meet each other are three \u2026",

Besides the plethora of magnesium silicide thermoelectric advantages, it is well known for its high sensitivity to oxidation. Oxidation is one of the primary instability mechanisms of degradation of high-temperature Mg2Si thermoelectric devices, as in the presence of O2, Mg2Si decomposes to form MgO and Si. In this work, commercial magnesium silicide in bulk form was used for thermal stability study from room temperature to 1273 K (1000 \u00b0C).

These materials exhibit a high thermoelectric figure of merit, reaching a maximum of 1.4, which is the best among all reported Mg{sub 2}Si{sub 1\u2212x}Sn{sub x} compounds on the Si-rich side. Within this range of Bi concentrations, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy characterization provided strong evidence for the presence of a number of secondary phases with different stoichiometries, including Si-rich, Sn-rich and Ge-rich phases. Moreover, the existence of micro- and nanofeatures is evident and their correlation with the thermoelectric properties and the high figure of merit is discussed. The influence of the amount of Bi doping on the thermoelectric properties of the specific compounds was investigated. A single effective mass was not proven efficient to fit the Seebeck coefficient and carrier concentration data, especially for carrier densities larger than 10{sup 20} cm{sup \u22123}.

Therefore, thermoelectric materials can play a role in both primary power generation and energy conservation (ie waste-heat harvesting).Thermoelectric (TE) generators make use of the Seebeck effect in semiconductors for the direct conversion of heat into electrical energy, which is of particular interest for waste heat recovery [1]. A thermoelectric generator (TEG) usually consists of several pairs of alternating p-and n-type semiconductor blocks, which are arranged thermally in parallel and connected electrically in a series circuit. Heating one side of the arrangement while the opposite side is cooled induces the heat flow, which is partly converted into electrical power.",

An inquiry-based teaching intervention with a degree of guidance from cookbook lab to challenge lab was applied to 14-15 years old high school students. A post-instructional assessment scheme with two extra tasks was used to evaluate the students\u2019 experiment design and execution skills. The students\u2019 skills were rated in ten dimensions and scored according to a 3-level ranking scheme. Results show that after instruction most students demonstrate a moderate ability in designing and performing simple experiments in the field of electric circuits.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the effect of investigative activities with virtual manipulations in a simulated Physics laboratory, in students\u2019 ability to design experiments, while trying to answer everyday life problems in the area of thermal phenomena. A pre-post comparison methodology was applied concerning written tests and personal interviews of 14 students in a lower secondary compulsory school in Greece, attending an innovative teaching sequence in thermal phenomena as part of their typical physics course. The teaching sequence had two main characteristics: the active engagement of students in laboratory activities, and the use of ICT, mostly involving investigations and virtual object manipulations using \u201cThermolab\u201d-an Open Learning Environment suitable for the study of thermal phenomena. For the evaluation of students\u2019 designs, their answers were rated in various dimensions. Our findings support the statement that there was improvement observed in our students\u2019 skills to design experiments. Students after the course mostly use scientific criteria to articulate their hypotheses, make better choices about the variables involved and the settings, can more clearly describe the process and phenomena involved, and decide the criteria of their hypothesis verification more successfully. This is a new interesting aspect of the educational value of simulations, among the others reported, but not very widely investigated.",

The system was found macroscopically homogeneous for x=0.03 and x=0.06 and phase separated for x=0.11 and x=0.33. The analyzed ~150cm-1 PbS impurity mode demonstrated a composition close to the PbTe0.98S0.02 for the major phase. The incorporation of PbSnS2 causes a reduction in plasma frequency (decrease in carrier frequency concentration) and an increase in carrier mobility.",

The possible use of a device consisting of numerous TEG modules for waste heat recovery from an internal combustion (IC) engine could considerably help worldwide efforts towards energy saving. However, commercially available TEGs operate at temperatures much lower than the actual operating temperature range in the exhaust pipe of an automobile, which could cause structural failure of the thermoelectric elements. Furthermore, continuous thermal cycling could lead to reduced efficiency and lifetime of the TEG. In this work we investigate the long-term performance and stability of a commercially available TEG under temperature and power cycling.

K {sub 2} Bi {sub 8} Se {sub 13} was prepared as a single phase using K {sub 2} Se and Bi {sub 2} Se {sub 3} as starting materials in a furnace or via a reaction using direct flame, followed by remelting or annealing. Seebeck coefficient measurements showed that the doping level in the material is sensitive to the synthetic conditions. Higher synthesis temperatures as well as the flame reaction technique followed by annealing gave more homogenous samples with higher Seebeck coefficient. IR optical spectroscopic measurements showed a wide range of doping level achieved among the different synthetic conditions. These findings suggest that synthetic conditions can act as a useful tool for the optimization of the thermoelectric properties of these materials.",

Within this range of Bi concentrations, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy characterization provided strong evidence for the presence of a number of secondary phases with different stoichiometries, including Si-rich, Sn-rich and Ge-rich phases. Moreover, the existence of micro- and nanofeatures is evident and their correlation with the thermoelectric properties and the high figure of merit is discussed. The \u2026",
