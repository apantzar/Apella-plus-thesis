            "Abstract": "Insurance of digital assets is becoming an important aspect nowadays, in order to reduce the investment risks in modern businesses. GDPR and other legal initiatives makes this necessity even more demanding as an organization is now accountable for the usage of its client data. In this paper, we present a cyber insurance framework, called CyberSure. The main contribution is the runtime integration of certification, risk management, and cyber insurance of cyber systems. Thus, the framework determines the current level of compliance with the acquired policies and provide early notifications for potential violations of them. CyberSure develops CUMULUS certification models for this purpose and, based on automated (or semi-automated) certification carried out using them, it develops ways of dynamically adjusting risk estimates, insurance policies and premiums. In particular, it considers the case of dynamic certification, based on continuous monitoring, dynamic testing and hybrid combinations of them, to adapt cyber insurance policies as the conditions of cyber system operation evolve and new data become available for adjusting to the associated risk. The applicability of the whole approach is demonstrated in the healthcare sector, for insuring an e-health software suite that is provided by an IT company to public and private hospitals in Greece. The overall approach can reduce the potential security incidents and the related economic loss, as the beneficiary deploys adequate protection mechanisms, whose proper operation is continually assessed, benefiting both the insured and the insurer.",

To guarantee that the data is being dealt in a secure manner we investigate the applicability of Assurance methodologies. In a typical Cloud environment the setup of multiple layers and different stakeholders determines security properties of individual components that are used to compose Cloud applications. We present a methodology adapted from Common Criteria for aggregating information reflecting the security properties of individual constituent components of Cloud applications. This aggregated information is used to categorise overall application security in terms of Assurance Levels and to provide a continuous assurance level evaluation. It gives the service owner an overview of the security of his service, without requiring detailed manual analyses of log files.",

            "Abstract": "In terms of cloud security, service level agreements and certificates share some strong similarities at their core: they both represent a form of assurance given to a customer about the security level provided by a service. Service level agreements represent the contractual commitments made by cloud providers to their customers, while certificates represent an assertion that has been verified to be true by a trusted authority. In this deliverable we mainly examine this core similarity between SLAs and certificates, in order to set the foundation for some of the work that will be done in the CUMULUS project, notably with the specification of a security property vocabulary.The implementation a certification process is a more complex process than creation of SLAs. Nevertheless, gaps in current SLAs specifications approaches and languages can inform us on issues that are likely to exist in the type of automated certification tools CUMULUS aims to provide. In section 1, we therefore start by highlight a key issue in current SLAs: the lack of standardized definition and measurement of security properties. For example, we show how competing cloud offerings can claim to offer similar \u201cuptime\u201d claims, which represent diverging performances in practice, simply by using a different definition for \u201cuptime\u201d.

            "Abstract": "Security and privacy (SP)-related challenges constitute a significant barrier to the wider adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)/Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices and the associated novel applications and services. In this context, patterns, which are constructs encoding re-usable solutions to common problems and building blocks to architectures, can be an asset in alleviating said barrier. More specifically, patterns can be used to encode dependencies between SP properties of individual smart objects and corresponding properties of orchestrations (compositions) involving them, facilitating the design of IoT solutions that are secure and privacy-aware by design. Motivated by the above, this work presents a survey and taxonomy of SP patterns towards the creation of a usable pattern collection. The aim is to enable decomposition of higher-level properties to more specific ones, matching them to relevant patterns, while also creating a comprehensive overview of security-and privacy-related properties and sub-properties that are of interest in IoT/IIoT environments. To this end, the identified patterns are organized using a hierarchical taxonomy that allows their classification based on provided property, context, and generality, while also showing the relationships between them. The two high-level properties, Security and Privacy, are decomposed to a first layer of lower-level sub-properties such as confidentiality and anonymity. The lower layers of the taxonomy, then, include implementation-level enablers. The coverage that these patterns offer in terms of the considered properties, data states (data in transit, at rest, and in process), and platform connectivity \u2026",

As intelligence is imported in embedded equipment, the system becomes able to provide smart services (e.g. control lights, airconditioning, provide energy management services etc.). IoT is the main enabler of such environments. However, the interconnection of these cyber-physical systems and the processing of personal data raise serious security and privacy issues.

Cyber security, privacy, and dependability (SPD) are also important, as the railway operation relies on cyber-physical systems (CPS) systems. This work presents SPD-Safe\u2014an administration framework for railway CPS, leveraging artificial intelligence for monitoring and managing the system in real-time. The network layer protections integrated provide the core security properties of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, along with energy-aware secure routing and authorization. The effectiveness in mitigating attacks and the efficiency under normal operation are assessed through simulations with the average delay in real equipment being 0.2\u20130.6 s. SPD metrics are incorporated together with safety semantics for the application environment. Considering an intelligent transportation scenario, SPD-Safe is deployed on railway critical infrastructure, safeguarding one outdoor setting on the railway\u2019s tracks and one in-carriage setting on a freight train that contains dangerous cargo. As demonstrated, SPD-Safe provides higher security and scalability, while enhancing safety response procedures. Nonetheless, emergence response operations require a seamless interoperation of the railway system with emergency authorities\u2019 equipment (eg, drones).

Runtime monitoring is required in SERENITY in order to check for violations of security and dependability properties which are necessary for the correct operation of the security and dependability solutions that are available from the SERENITY framework. This chapter discusses how such properties are specified and monitored. The chapter focuses on the activation and execution of monitoring activities using S&D Patterns and the actions that may be undertaken following the detection of property violations. The approach is demonstrated in reference to one of the industrial case studies of the SERENITY project.",

The framework uses the former components to detect violations of requirements at run-time and uses the specifications of the violated requirements to generate queries for discovering services that could substitute for malfunctioning services. It also uses queries derived from the process specification for service discovery. These queries incorporate both structural and behavioural aspects of the required services.",

Despite the original intent of the paradigm, its current instantiations are limited to a single trust domain (e.g., a single organization) One of the main reasons for this is the trust gap that normally arises when software services, offered by previously unknown providers, are to be selected at run-time, without any human intervention. The idea of machine-readable security certificates (called asserts) paves the way to automated reasoning about security properties of services. Similarly to current security certification schemes, the assessment of the security properties of a service is delegated to an independent third party (certification authority), who issues a corresponding assert, bound to the service. Building on the assert concept, this paper describes our proposal \u2026",

At present middleware platforms, however, do not provide enough support for both the configuration and reconfiguration of quality of service (QoS) management aspects of real-time applications such as distributed multimedia systems. That is, current middleware only provides support for the low-level specification of QoS properties. This paper presents an architecture description language (ADL) called Xelha for the high-level specification of QoS management in multimedia middleware whereas lower-level aspects can be tuned by using an aspect-oriented suite of languages referred to as resource configuration description language (RCDL). Tool support is also provided for the interpretation of the Xelha and RCDL languages.",

            "Abstract": "Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are becoming not only increasingly complex but also increasingly important. Traditionally, CPSs were self-contained monolithic systems operating in a well-defined environment. CPSs today have evolved to large-scale systems including multiple interacting components. Due to the inherent complexity of the physical environments where CPSs operate and the ever changing operational and context conditions of these environments, CPSs need to be able to adapt in a semi-or fully autonomic manner. At the same time, in the course of adapting themselves, they need to satisfy key quality, security and privacy (QSP) requirements and be resilient to threats even if those were unknown at the time the CPS was designed. Engineering CPSs with such capabilities is a challenging problem that requires expert knowledge. Our approach to addressing this problem is based on the use of QSP-preserving patterns, ie, patterns that encode proven design and engineering solutions providing particular QSP properties. We argue that existing pattern formats miss some essential features of CPSs. As a step towards the realization of approach, in this paper we present a new pattern format that enables the representation of most important characteristics of QSP preserving patterns for CPS. Our format provides an initial basis for defining a full pattern language for engineering QSP preserving CPS.",

In this paper we describe a framework for dynamic service discovery that supports the identification of service during the execution time of service-based systems. In the framework, services are identified based on structural, behavioural, quality, and contextual characteristics of a system represented in query languages. The framework supports both pull and push modes of query execution. In the approach, a service is identified based on the computation of distances between a query and a candidate service. A prototype tool has been implemented in order to illustrate and evaluate the framework. The paper also describes the results of a set of experiments that we have conducted to evaluate the work.",

Although it is quite easy to accomplish this within the products of the same brand, it is not facile to provide compatibility for the whole spectrum of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and the Linked Data (LD) world. Currently, the different applications and devices operate in their own cloud/platform, without supporting sufficient interaction with different vendor-products. As it concerns the meaning of data, which is the main focus of this paper, semantics can settle commonly agreed information models and ontologies for the used terms. However, as there are several ontologies for describing each distinct 'Thing', we need Semantic Mediators (SMs) in order to perform common data mapping across the various utilized formats (i.e. XML or JSON) and ontology alignment (e.g. resolve conflicts).

Typically, SLAs define the properties that need to be preserved during the provision of a service (e.g., quality of service properties) and actions that will be applied if the service provision violates the defined properties (e.g., penalties or re-negotiation).

            "Abstract": "Approximately one-third of people over 65 years of age, and 5% of the world\u2019s population, is affected by hearing loss (HL)(World Health Organization, 2017). Disabling HL is associated with early cognitive decline in adults (Olusanya et al., 2014), and when unaddressed, HL restricts social integration and reduces employment and educational opportunities, hampers emotional well-being and, thus, poses an economic challenge at both the individual and national level (Wilson et al., 2017). Moreover, more and more individuals suffer from HL, which is primarily due to increases in everyday noise exposure and an increase of the aging population (World Health Organization, 2017). Despite the fact that age-related HL is the third leading cause of years lived with disability (Vos et al., 2017), the population of individuals with hearing loss is underserved because few public health policies focus on prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation for age-related HL (Reavis et al., 2016). This inadequate focus has been attributed to a lack of evidence supporting policies that actively promote hearing healthcare (Moyer, 2012; Barker et al., 2016). However, this specific issue is targeted in the EU-funded H2020 project EVOTION (www. h2020evotion. eu), which collects a large volume of heterogenous data from almost 1,000 hearing aid (HA) users with varying degrees of hearing loss to support the development of evidence-based policy making within the hearing healthcare field (Spanoudakis et al., 2017; Gutenberg et al., 2018).

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, more-and-more cyber-security training is emerging as an essential process for the lifelong personnel education in organizations, especially for those which operate critical infrastructures. This is due to security breaches on popular services that become publicly known and raise people\u2019s security awareness. Except from large organizations, small-to-medium enterprises and individuals need to keep their knowledge on the related topics up-to-date as a means to protect their business operation or to obtain professional skills. Therefore, the potential target-group may range from simple users, who require basic knowledge on the current threat landscape and how to operate the related defense mechanisms, to security experts, who require hands-on experience in responding to security incidents. This high diversity makes training and certification quite a challenging task. This study combines pedagogical practices and cyber-security modelling in an attempt to support dynamically adaptive training procedures. The training programme is initially tailored to the trainee\u2019s needs, promoting the continuous adaptation to his/her performance afterwards. As the trainee accomplishes the basic evaluation tasks, the assessment starts involving more advanced features that demand a higher level of understanding. The overall method is integrated in a modern cyber-ranges platform, and a pilot training programme for smart shipping employees is presented. View Full-Text",

In this paper, we address this issue using a novel approach that guarantees service composition security by virtue of the generation of compositions. Our approach generates service compositions that are guaranteed to satisfy security properties based on secure service orchestration (SESO) patterns. These patterns express primitive (e.g., sequential, parallel) service orchestrations, which are proven to have certain global security properties if the individual services participating in them have themselves other security properties. The paper shows how SESO patterns can be constructed and gives examples of proofs for such patterns. It also presents the process of using SESO patterns to generate secure service \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Service level agreements (SLAs) are typically used to specify rules regarding the consumption of services that are agreed between the providers of the service-based applications (SBAs) and their consumers. An SLA includes a list of terms that contain the guarantees that must be fulfilled during the provisioning and consumption of the services. Since the violation of such guarantees may lead to the application of potential penalties, it is important to assure that the SBA behaves as expected. In this paper, we propose a proactive approach to test SLA-aware SBAs by means of identifying test requirements, which represent situations that are relevant to be tested. To address this issue, we define a four-valued logic that allows evaluating both the individual guarantee terms and their logical relationships. Grounded in this logic, we devise a test criterion based on the modified condition decision coverage (MCDC) in order \u2026",

The method detects overlaps between object interaction diagrams by using a probabilistic message matching algorithm that has been developed for this purpose. The guidance to software designers on when to check for inconsistencies and how to deal with them is delivered by enacting a built-in process model that specifies the consistency rules that can be checked against overlapping models and different ways of handling violations of these rules. Reconciliation+ is supported by a toolkit \u2026",

New challenges have occurred because of the nature and the complexity of such systems in supporting heterogeneous physical and cyber components simultaneously. Failures or attacks on system components decrease system reliability creating severe consequences to CPS and the attached applications. The construction of complex CPS with respect to security and dependability (S&D) properties is necessary to avoid system vulnerabilities at design level. Design patterns are solutions for reusable designs and interactions of objects. In this work we present a pattern-based language for designing CPS able to guarantee S&D properties. The first set of S&D patterns includes the Reliability Component Composition (RCC) Patterns for designing reliable CPS. RCC patterns are encoded in \u2026",

Furthermore, the environmental and behavioural measurements of physical activity and body mass index, alcohol consumption and smoking have been included. So far, only electrodermal activity and heart rate variability are physiological signals simultaneously associated with hearing loss or hearing performance.

The objective of SERENITY is to enhance the security and dependability of ambient intelligence systems by providing a framework supporting the automated integration, configuration, monitoring and adaptation of security and dependability mechanisms. Security and Dependability for Ambient Intelligence, an edited volume contributed by world leaders in this field, covers the foundations of ambient systems, the problems that their highly dynamic and heterogeneous nature poses to security and dependability and solutions. These solutions include the language that has developed for specifying S&D patterns. This volume is designed for researchers and practitioners focusing on the dynamic integration, deployment and verification of security solutions in highly distributed systems incorporating ambient intelligence features.

            "Abstract": "Composite services commonly expose the choreography of message exchanges realized by their constituent services through appropriate descriptions and interfaces. Such information is very useful in deciding whether a composite service fully meets the behavioral requirements of a specific application or not. However, expressing behavioral requirements towards a service is currently a challenging task, often requiring the use of complex semantic annotations and the employment of related supporting technologies. Moreover, choreography descriptions and interfaces may be expressed in various formats and they are published in various types of registries, repositories, or networks. These issues hinder the applicability and effectiveness of behavior-aware service discovery. To overcome the aforementioned obstacles and to promote interoperability at the service discovery level, we propose in this paper a novel, unified solution towards expressing and evaluating behavioral requirements towards services. In our approach, queries are conveniently created in a visual manner with the use of UML; they are translated into a generic XML-based query language, namely USQL; they are uniformly executed in a wide variety of target registries, repositories, and networks, by means of a powerful service search engine; and they can be matched against different types of service choreography descriptions.",

These rules match syntactically related terms in the textual parts of the requirements artefacts with related elements in an object model (eg classes, attributes, operations) and create traceability relations of different types when a match is found. The extension described in this paper measures beliefs in:(1) the ability of specific traceability rules to generate correct traceability relations,(2) the satisfiability of traceability rules by particular types of artefacts, and (3) the correctness of individual traceability relations. It also provides a mechanism with well-founded semantics for revising these beliefs on the basis of partial (and even conflicting) assessments of the relations that these rules generate provided by different users.",

Our approach has been evaluated using real mobile device traffic captured from Android mobile devices, running normal apps and mobile botnets. In the evaluation, we investigated the use of 5 machine learning classifier algorithms and a group of machine learning box algorithms with different validation schemes. We have also evaluated the effect of our approach with respect to its effect on the overall performance and battery consumption of mobile devices.",

In pull mode, it executes queries when a need for finding a replacement service arises. In push mode, queries are subscribed to the framework to be executed proactively and, in parallel with the operation of the application, to identify adequate services that could be used if the need for replacing a service arises. Hence, the proactive (push) mode of query execution makes it more likely to avoid interruptions in the operation of service-based applications when a service in them needs to be replaced at runtime.

Yet, their use is affected by concerns about the security of the data and applications provisioned through them. Security certification provides a means of increasing confidence in such systems, by establishing that they fulfil certain security properties of interest. Certification processes involve security property assessments against specific threat models. These processes may be based on self-assessment, testing, inspection or runtime monitoring of security properties, and/or combinations of such methods (hybrid certification). One important question for all such processes is whether they actually deliver what they promise. This question is open at the moment and is the focus of our work.

Thus, diagnostic information is necessary for preserving the properties due to the support that can provide for deciding on the appropriate countermeasure against a violation. In this paper, we describe a process for diagnosing runtime violations of properties that we have developed as part of a runtime monitoring framework.

To address these gaps, we propose a model of runtime trust assessment of software services and introduce a framework for realizing the model.

Such policies are important for several aspects of healthcare provision, including:(a) screening for prevention of disease;(b) early diagnosis and treatment;(c) long-term management of chronic diseases and disabilities; and (d) setting-up standards. Although it is widely recognised that the PHP life cycle (ie, the analysis, action plan design, execution, monitoring and evaluation of public health policies) should be evidenced based, current support for it is mainly in the form of guidelines, and is not supported by data analytics and decision making tools tailored to it. In this paper, we present a novel model driven approach to PHP life cycle management and an integrated platform for realising this life cycle. Our approach is based on PHP decision making models. Such models steer the PHP decision making process by defining the data that need to be collected and the ways in which these data should be analysed in order to produce the evidence required for PHP making.

Industrial practice indicates that more than 80 percent of the data mining work concentrates on data preparation. Indeed, once the data is well prepared, the mined results are more accurate and reliable. This means that data preparation is also a critical step for other data processing applications. Among others, data preparation mainly involves data cleaning, data transformation, and data selection [1]. The principal aim of data preparation is to provide quality data for other steps of data processing applications, which are often accomplished in tandem with data mining and knowledge discovery. Indeed, the boundary can sometimes be blurry, but the general principle of data preparation can still be singled out from other data processing techniques. However, there has been relatively little focused work done for data preparation.Recognizing the unique importance of data preparation, we have organized a series of workshops and special issues in top-quality journals to facilitate the development of data preparation techniques. Our first activity was the organization of the First International Workshop on Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) in 2002, which was known as the DCAP workshop (ie, data cleaning and preparation). High-quality papers from the workshop was also selected and published in a special issue on data preparation for data mining in the Applied Artificial \u2026",

Like all computing paradigms based on outsourcing, the use of cloud computing is largely a matter of trust. There is an increasing pressure by cloud customers for solutions that would increase their confidence that a cloud service/application is behaving in a secure and correct manner. Cloud assurance techniques, developed to assess the trustworthiness of cloud services, can play a major role in building trust. In this paper, we start from the assumption that an opaque cloud does not fit security, and present a reliable evidence collection process and infrastructure extending existing assurance techniques towards the definition of a trustworthy cloud. The proposed process and infrastructure are applied to a case study on cloud \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The development of dependable mobile P2P systems is an inherently challenging task since such systems may operate in largely uncontrolled environments and may engage new peers or lose existing ones without any form of centralised control. In these circumstances, dependability and security can be enhanced through the runtime monitoring (a.k.a. dynamic verification) of the compliance of the system behaviour against specific dependability and security properties and the execution of control in cases where properties are violated. In this paper we present a framework for the dynamic verification and control of mobile P2P systems, which uses peer-specific monitoring policies to specify application-level properties. The deployment of this framework for monitoring system behaviour adds an extra layer of security and dependability checking, which is independent from checks performed directly by the P2P system \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cloud is becoming fast a critical infrastructure. However, several recent incidents regarding the security of cloud services clearly demonstrate that security rightly remains one of the major concerns of enterprises and the general public regarding the use of the cloud. Despite advancements of research related to cloud security, we are still not in a position to provide a systematic assessment of cloud security based on real operational evidence. As a step towards addressing this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for certifying the security of cloud services. Our approach is based on the incremental certification of security properties for different types of cloud services, including IaaS, PaaS and SaaS services, based on operational evidence from the provision of such services gathered through continuous monitoring. An initial implementation of this approach is presented.",

The framework uses a query language to represent structural, behavioral, and quality characteristics of services to be identified, and a query processor to match the queries against service registries.

Furthermore, depending on their purpose and contents, different parts of the documentation may be produced and owned by different stakeholders (eg marketing experts, developers).

ESD and ASD are iterative activities that help the revision of system requirements, and architecture and design models, respectively. RTD ensures the resilience and re-configurability of SCS when services fail or start malfunctioning.

In this interconnected world, smart objects have an important role in giving users the chance for life-logging in smart environments. However, smart devices have several limitations with regards to memory, resources and computation power, hindering the opportunity to apply well-established security algorithms and techniques for secure life-logging on the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The need for secure and trustworthy life-logging in smart environments is vital, thus, a lightweight approach has to be considered to overcome the constraints of Smart Objects.

The approach is based on the use of secure service composition patterns, which are proven to preserve composition level security properties if the services that are composed according to the pattern satisfy other properties individually. The secure service composition patterns are used for two purposes: (a) to analyse whether a given workflow fragment satisfies a given security property, and (b) to generate compositions of services that could substitute for individual services within the workflow that cause the violation of the security properties. Our approach has been implemented in a tool that is based on Eclipse BPEL Designer.",

A data-driven aspect is prominent, involving the Internet of Things (IoT) as the main enabler of a Circular Economy (CE).

Transparency is vital as the beneficiaries must track the assets\u2019 history. This article proposes a framework where blockchaining administrates the cooperative vision of CE-IoT. For the core operation, the blockchain ledger records the changes in the assets\u2019 states via smart contracts that implement the CE business logic and are lightweight, complying with the IoT requirements. Moreover, a federated learning approach is proposed, where computationally intensive ML tasks are distributed via a second contract type.

Runtime verification checks properties against runtime events generated during the operation of a system. Current approaches to runtime verification assume that runtime events are time-stamped by a single clock and, thus, can be totally ordered. They also assume that events are received by the reasoning engine in the same order as they have been produced. These assumptions are apparently true only in systems with a single clock. In this paper, we present the extension of a framework for runtime verification which can monitor distributed systems, in which events are produced by different components, each having its own clock.",

Despite the significant debate on the technical specifications and the technological maturity of 5G, which are under discussion in various fora3, 5G is expected to affect positively and significantly several industry sectors ranging from ICT to industry sectors such as car and other manufacturing, health and agriculture in the period up to and beyond 2020. 5G will be driven by the influence of software on network functions, known as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). The key concept that underpins SDN is the logical centralization of network control functions by decoupling the control and packet forwarding functionality of the network. NFV complements this vision through the virtualization of these functionalities based on recent advances in general server and enterprise IT virtualization. Considering the technological maturity of the technologies that 5G can leverage on, SDN is the one that is moving faster from development to production. To realize the business potential of SDN/5G, a number of technical issues related to the design and operation of Software Defined Networks need to be addressed. Amongst them, SDN/5G security is one of the key issues, that needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to avoid missing the business opportunities arising from SDN/5G.

For monitoring functional and non-functional aspects of services, the EU project SLA@ SOI has developed a model and language set to describe such SLAs aligning with a service monitoring system architecture for run-time monitoring. In this work we show how these models are formally and mechanically decomposed into terms and primitive events, whilst monitoring component selection for these terms and events is used to generate a complete monitoring system configuration for run-time.",

The platform supports service discovery based on structural and behavioural service models as well as complex context related service discovery conditions which are specified in a newly introduced query language. During discovery, context information is obtained through a uniform scheme of calling \"context operations\" and is subsequently used in the evaluation of service discovery queries.",

It provides an overview of the CUMULUS certification models, which are at the basis of the certification processes implemented and managed by the CUMULUS certification framework. Certification models drive the collection of evidence used by the framework to assess whether the system under certification supports required security properties, and generate and manage certificates proving compliance to such properties (certification process). Collected evidence can be of different types (i.e., test-based, monitoring-based, and trusted computing-based evidence) and addresses the peculiarities of cloud environments. The framework also supports continuous and incremental evaluation of services in the production cloud.",

Nevertheless, SDN expands the attack surface of the communication infrastructure, thus necessitating the introduction of additional security mechanisms. These major changes could not leave the industrial environment unaffected, with smart industrial deployments gradually becoming a reality, a trend that is often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0. A wind park is a good example of an industrial application relying on a network with strict performance, security, and reliability requirements and was chosen as a representative example of industrial systems. This work highlights the benefit of leveraging the flexibility of SDN/network function virtualization\u2013enabled networks to \u2026",

To develop such systems, it is necessary to identify services that can be combined in order to fulfill the functionality and achieve quality criteria of the system being developed. In this paper, we present a framework supporting architecture-driven service discovery (ASD)\u2014that is the discovery of services that can provide functionalities and satisfy properties and constraints of systems as specified during the design phase of the development lifecycle based on detailed system design models. Our framework assumes an iterative design process and allows for the (re-) formulation of design models of service-centric systems based on the discovered services. The framework is composed of a query extractor, which derives queries from behavioral and structural UML \u2026",

An initial experimental evaluation of the model is presented in the paper.",

Addressing these challenges requires a shift from traditional data analysis systems and techniques to big data management and processing platforms as well as big data analytics centric architectures. In this paper, we introduce such an architecture. The architecture has been developed to support the acquisition and analysis of big data sets regarding hearing loss and the provision of related healthcare services for the purpose of informing public health policy making. The paper provides an overview of the system and presents the outcomes of an initial evaluation of its performance.",

            "Abstract": "In service based applications, it is often necessary to construct compositions of services in order to provide required functionality in cases where this is not possible through the use of a single service. Whilst creating service compositions, it is necessary to ensure not only that the functionality required of the composition is achieved but also that certain security properties are preserved. In this paper, we describe an approach to constructing secure service compositions. Our approach is based on the use of composition patterns and rules that determine the security properties that should be preserved by the individual services that constitute a composition in order to ensure that security properties of the overall composition are also satisfied. Our approach extends a framework developed to support the runtime service discovery.",
