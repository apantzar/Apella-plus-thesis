After a short review of previous work in the field, we discuss two examples in which the presence of the PZ field is either beneficial or unwelcome. First, we present a wavelength-tunable laser diode whose tuning mechanism is based on the quantum confined Stark effect and we show that the tuning range of the device can be significantly enhanced if the active quantum well contains a PZ field. Next, we discuss the case of nitride heterostructures where unwanted polarization-induced electric fields limit seriously their performance in optoelectronic applications.

The combination of both scattering geometries, together with variable excitation wavelengths, enabled the possibility to check independently strain-vs-depth distribution and selective-resonance effects from In-rich regions. Several Raman modes have been detected and were attributed to either the GaN or the InGaN films. Particular modes, which are not permitted in the bulk materials, are activated in the InGaN layers. Shifts of the frequencies relative to the ones expected in the bulk materials are explained as due to the elastic strains present in the hetero-structures. The results are evaluated in combination with compositional RBS analysis and the strain values obtained are compared with high resolution x-ray diffraction results including reciprocal space mapping, leading to very good consistency between Raman and XRD. Consequent relaxation values are obtained and the underlying mechanisms are discussed.",

The higher resistivity and lower carrier concentration of the ITON films, as compared to the respective properties of the ITO films, were attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen, instead of oxygen, in the ITON structure.",

The process illustrated here starts by evaporating first a 4-pair SiO2/Ta2O5 DBR centered around 400 nm on a lithographically patterned GaAs substrate. The GaAs substrate is subsequently removed by wet-etching, and the released DBR membranes are transferred onto other templates for their use as top mirrors in microcavities. By transferring a 4-pair top DBR on an 8-pair bottom SiO2/Ta2O5 DBR, a distinct cavity mode appears due to the formed \u03bb/2 oxide cavity with a Q-factor of 110. If the 4 \u2026",

It is demonstrated that a top DBR consisting of four alternating pairs of SiO2/Ta2O5 is sufficient to obtain robust polariton features from these membranes at room temperature, with a Rabi splitting of 36 and 71\u2009meV for the 10 and 38 quantum well microcavities, respectively.",

A nonlinear increase of the emission and line narrowing marks the onset of polariton lasing regime with significantly reduced threshold compared with previous reports for bulk GaN microcavity. This combination of low lasing thresholds and ease of fabrication allows incorporation of quantum wells and electrical contacts into the active region, paving the way for electrically driven room temperature (RT) polariton laser devices.",

In this view, we show that the presence of foreign species acting as surfactants profoundly modifies the kinetics of the adatoms, eventually leading to an improvement in both structural and optical properties of the material. Next, we discuss the interplay between the growth mode and the strain relaxation in nitride heterostructures. In particular, we show that GaN and InGaN can experience a Stranski-Krastanov growth mode leading to the formation of quantum dots. A mechanism of quantum dot nucleation is proposed in the case of GaN on AIN.",

Upon boiling aqua regia treatment, the surface of the MBE p-GaN material appeared to be more stable, as opposed to the increased sensitivity of the MOCVD one. As a result of the different behavior of the two samples surfaces was the fact that surface Fermi energy levels of MOCVD and MBE p-GaN moved towards opposite directions, which improved the contacts formed on the MOCVD sample in contrast to the MBE one, as confirmed by electrical characterization.

Several Raman modes have been detected and were attributed to either the GaN or the InGaN films. Particular modes, which are not permitted in the bulk materials, are activated in the InGaN layers. Shifts of the frequencies relative to the ones expected in the bulk materials are explained as due to the elastic strains present in the hetero-structures. The results are evaluated in combination with compositional RBS analysis and the strain values obtained are compared with high resolution x \u2026",

We calculate the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic for an InAs nanowire, which has a radius of 200\u2002\u00c5 and two 50\u2002\u00c5 InP, built-in barriers, which define a 150\u2002\u00c5 long InAs quantum disk and find that a peak in the current occurs at an applied voltage of 72 mV, corresponding to resonant tunneling of carriers through the double barriers. This is in good agreement with the I-V curve measured in a similar nanowire at a temperature of 4.2 K, where resonant tunneling occurs at 80 mV. It is deduced that the Fermi level is \u224826\u2002meV above the conduction band edge at \u2026",

This process gives rise to a systematic shift of the neutral exciton peak towards lower energies, indicating reduction of the crystal's electron density. The capability to progressively tune the carrier density upon variation of the exposure time is demonstrated; this indicates that the Fermi level shift is directly correlated to the respective electron density modulation due to the chlorine species. Notably, this electron withdrawing process enabled the determination of the trion binding energy of the intrinsic crystal, found to be as low as 20 meV, in accordance to theoretical predictions. At the same time, it is found that the effect can be reversed upon continuous wave laser scanning of the monolayer in air. Scanning auger \u2026",

They can be considered as artificial atoms, with discrete energy levels and reduced density of states (DOS). Their unusual electronic properties, mostly due to the nanometer scale of the confinement potential, have attracted increasing interests and a recent review of their physical studies and device applications can be found in ref [1]. In this paper, we present a brief summary of GaN/AlN QDs which are much less well known than their II-VI (CdTe/ZnTe, CdSe/ZnSe) or III-V (InAs/GaAs) counterparts. It will be shown, in Section II, that nitride QDs are a model system to investigate the various energetic and kinetic processes governing the growth of QDs by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In Sections III and IV, we discuss some new physical situations and device applications deriving from the unique properties of nitride semiconductors. Finally in section V, the main conclusions are summarized.",

The model incorporates strain and piezoelectric effects on the quantum well states, free carrier screening, overlap integral computation, and optical gain calculation.

As an example, the hole tunneling time through thick Al x Ga 1\u2212 x As potential barriers has been measured over six orders of magnitude in In Ga As\u2215 Al Ga As structures. For x= 0.6, ultralong hole tunneling times are demonstrated in fair agreement with a semiclassical tunneling model. This model however turns out to be inapplicable for x\u2a7d 0.4, overestimating the tunneling times by several orders of magnitude. This suggests the formation of intrinsic leakage current paths through the AlGaAs barriers at these concentrations.",

Their structural properties were studied by atomic force microscopy. For the (111)B grown nanostructures, the formation of self-aligned InAs quantum dashes was revealed, which in some cases took the form of nanowires. In the (211)B case, the shape and size of nanostructures is drastically affected by growth temperature. At lower growth temperatures, fabrication of quantum dots has been achieved by deposition of 2MLs of InAs. However, when the same amount of InAs was deposited at higher growth temperatures, a drastic change of nanostructure from dots to dashes occurred. Towards a better understanding of nanostructure properties, systematic photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on the (211) sample series. No PL emission \u2026",

The nucleation of GaAs NWs is very sensitive to the properties of the native oxide such as chemical composition, roughness and porosity. Consequently, samples grown under the same conditions on Si (111) substrates from different manufacturing batches often produce dramatically different growth results. In order to remove the dependence on wafer batch, a controlled chemical oxidation process is developed to replace the native oxide on Si (111) substrate with a reproducible chemical oxide.

There are currently several technologically interesting solutions to achieve tunability based on temperature, external cavity laser, or a multi-section DBR laser. In this work we explore an alternative approach, where the LD tuning mechanism is based on the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE). To achieve this, the LD active region is designed such that the injection current generates during lasing a space-charge field that tunes the lasing wavelength /spl lambda//sub L/. We show a schematic band diagram of the LD active region we propose. It consists of three quantum wells (QWs) separated by two tunneling barriers. The central QW is the active QW (AQW), whose lowest transition is the ground state of the whole structure. The outer QWs are the collection QWs (CQWs \u2026",
