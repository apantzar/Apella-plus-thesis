            "Abstract": "The present article presents a methodological advance which contributes to the area of nonparametric survival analysis under random right censoring. The central idea is to develop pointwise confidence intervals for the survival function by means of a central limit theorem for an, already existing in the literature, kernel smooth survival estimate. Numerical simulations reveal the progress in coverage accuracy offered by the suggested confidence intervals over the proposals already existing in the literature.",

The first benefit, in comparison to classical convolution kernel smoothing, is the development of boundary aware estimates of the distribution function, its derivatives and integrated derivative products of any arbitrary order. The advancements proceed by developing asymptotic mean integrated square error optimal solve-the-equation plug-in bandwidth selectors for the estimates of the distribution function and its derivatives, and as a byproduct, a mean square error optimal bandwidth rule for integrated derivative products. The asymptotic properties of all methodological contributions are quantified analytically and discussed in detail. Three real data analyses illustrate the benefits of the proposed methodology in practice. Finally, numerical evidence is provided on the finite sample performance of the proposed \u2026",

However, in a lot of situations, the variables are not measured directly but through their proxies {\\bf X} = {\\bf X}^{o} + \\bivarepsilon and Y = Y^{o} + \\eta where l and m are the measurements errors.

Quality assessment is usually performed by experts and it is a time-consuming and expensive process. This paper proposes an alternative assessment using machine learning methods, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest to predict wine quality. Our data analysis is based on a real wine dataset provided by a well-known wine firm in Greece. For this purpose, we employ the LASSO method, which is particularly effective in selecting the best possible number of variables required. Additionally, the random forest method is used and its findings are contrasted to those derived by four different M.L. methods, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and support vector \u2026",
