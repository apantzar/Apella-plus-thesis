Researchers use the available keywords-based online search, which often fall short of meeting the desired search results given the known issues of content heterogeneity, volume of data and terminological obsolescence. This leads to a number of problems including insufficient content exposure, unsatisfied researchers and above all dwindling confidence in such repositories of invaluable knowledge. In this paper, we explore the appropriateness of alternative searching based on Linked Open Data (LoD)-based semantic annotation and indexing in online repositories such as the ReStore repository (ReStore repository is an online service hosting and maintaining web resources containing data about multidisciplinary research in Social \u2026",

Often, those resources are hosted on portals that are related to dedicated topics (eg online social network analytics) or dedicated communities (eg Web Science researchers). A Web Observatory portal brings together communities to contribute or engage with datasets and analytic (or visualisation) applications. In addition, it provides links to dataset and analytic resources that are potentially hosted in remote locations. This paper presents the architecture of a Web Observatory at the University of Southampton, which aims to foster engagement with analytics and applications and, at the same time, support linking to remote resources in other locations, potentially hosted in other Web Observatories.

            "Abstract": "In order to support educators when selecting ICT tools, several educational organizations provide ICT tool registries whose functionality is limited by the data they contain. These registries could reduce the cost of creating and updating their datasets obtaining ICT tool descriptions from the Web of Data. However, some problems hinder the educational consumption of these descriptions: they are not described using an appropriate vocabulary for this specific domain and registries do not discriminate which tools are useful for education. SEEK-AT-WD is proposed as an infrastructure that overcomes these problems and consumes ICT tool descriptions from the Web of Data, publishing them back once they are related to educational concepts. This paper discusses the challenges found when developing SEEK-AT-WD, and how they were solved to take advantage of data from the Web in the educational applications.",

The diffusion of content through the network, and the resulting information cascades, are phenomena that have been widely investigated on various platforms, which facilitate information diffusion using diverse technical mechanisms, user interfaces and incentives. This paper focuses on Tumblr, an online microblogging social network with a core'reblogging'functionality that allows information to diffuse across its network by appearing on multiple user blogs. The formation of any cascade network is visible as a list of reblogging events attached as notes to each appearance of the post in the cascade. In this paper, we examine cascade networks on Tumblr, recreated from the series of diffusion events, and analyse them from structural and temporal perspectives.

This paper proposes an architecture that enables the operation of OHS over a P2P overlay network of OHS servers based on semantic annotation of (a) peer OHS servers and of (b) multimedia resources that can be obtained through the link services of the OHS. The architecture provides efficient resource discovery. Semantic query-based subscriptions over this P2P network can enable access to up-to-date content, while caching at certain peers enables prompt delivery of multimedia content.

            "Abstract": "The strengths of semantic technologies for learning and teaching and their benefits in the areas of digital libraries, virtual communities and e-learning have been identified and well established. The case for semantic technologies in education has been on the expressive power of metadata to describe learning content, people, and services, and on how these could be intelligently matched for added value services and an advanced learning experience. However, certain concerns on the feasibility of ontology consensus and of the annotation of the enormous amount of content currently available on the Web have arisen making globally available and interoperable semantic-rich metadata for learning resources a long term vision. At the same time, progress towards a more modest machine-readable Web has been made, and pragmatic solutions to interoperability based around REST and XML have emerged in the last few years along with prototypes of SPARQL server implementations and new RDF/OWL annotation tools. Web 2.0 systems have enabled a lightweight knowledge modelling approach (sometimes called folksonomies) based around techniques such as community tagging, clustering, and community authoring. These are strong indications that consensus on ontologies can be achieved within a virtual community and that content can be efficiently annotated by community members provided adequate tools become available. Seen in this broader context it can be argued that Semantic Technologies are already impacting on the way in which we learn and teach, and will have an increasing impact as the sophistication of the tools \u2026",

In this paper we explore the use of Wikipedia for identifying the flow of information and trends across the world. We start with the hypothesis that, given that Wikipedia is a resource that is globally available in different languages across countries, access to its articles could be a reflection human activity. To explore this hypothesis we try to establish metrics on the use of Wikipedia in order to identify potential trends and to establish whether or how those trends flow from one county to another.

Due to the widespread adoption of these sites, there is the potential for this type of marketing to reach a large audience. The emergence of social media as a new marketing platform leads to fresh challenges in that the online nature of it creates difficulties in attributing actions of intent on social media to real, meaningful action that can help NPOs. This paper provides an interdisciplinary approach to discovering the relationship between actions on social media and the performance of NPOs\u2019 social media marketing campaign. A framework is proposed which distinguishes, tracks and measures different stages of social media marketing activity in order to determine its success. The framework provides a number of metrics - taking into account the disciplines of computer science and management - that can be used to assess performance of NPO campaigns, and is tested on two sample charities.

These stakeholders exploit multiple device capabilities, re-purpose and re-contextualize data collected by the devices for a number of applications. Such IoT ecosystem(s) mandate data sharing at both small and large scale. However, sensitive nature of IoT data, lack of prior knowledge of purpose of data-use, regulations and standards make data sharing a non-trivial problem. It also raises concerns of data trust, ownership, and accountability. In this paper, we scope the \u201cIoT Observatory\u201d infrastructure to enable various stakeholders to observe and analyse the data and methodologies in IoT enabled ecosystems.

The SemTech Project website summarises information about semantic technologies in education and contains an analysis of the technologies and applications thus far identified. Following a brief overview of our investigation of semantic technologies in education the workshop will consist of structured group discussions from a selected perspective (educational, technical and organisational). The workshop structure will be fine-tuned to match the participants, who will work in groups of eight using flip charts to produce a poster for a two-minute poster pitch. A second peer review group activity will comment on each poster. A plenary session will identify next steps. Each participant in the workshop will receive a copy of the SemTech report, plus detailed activity guidance notes which they can also take away and use in their own institution.",

As citizens and organisations adopt Web technologies, so governments are beginning to respond by themselves utilising the electronic space. Much of this has been reactive, and there is very little understanding of the impact that Web technologies are having on government systems and processes, let alone a proactive approach to designing systems that can ensure a positive and beneficial societal impact. The ecosystem which encompasses governments, citizens and communities is both evolving and adaptive, and the only way to examine and understand the development of Web-enabled government, and its possible implications, is to consider government itself as a\" social machine\" within a social machine ecosystem. In this light, there are significant opportunities and challenges for government that this paper identifies.",

Any business, organization, group, cause or individual that seeks to reach beyond its own immediate locality recognizes the value of a Web presence. Undeniably, the Web has radically reshaped the way we communicate with the world. Among the many astonishing things about the Web is the fact that it has been achieved with the aid of what are essentially basic technologies: a client, a server, and a network, together with a simple text-based mark-up language and a basic addressing scheme to locate resources. What we have done with these basic elements is truly amazing. This achievement does not stop us, however, from designing, developing and testing new technologies in order to add value to the Web, to enhance the way we use it or to move the Web in new directions. Our experience of the Web is still far from perfect in many ways, and our expectations of the Web have changed radically\u2013simply as a result of its presence in our lives. In addition, the basic technology that we use to access and describe resources has changed dramatically. For example, mobile and embedded Internet-ready devices are growing in use.The aim of this special issue is to present research that aims to investigate how ways in which our experience, usage and understanding of the Web can be enhanced. One of our primary goals has been to look at how changes in the underlying network layer can affect what features can be added to the Web: for example, a better way to find and tag Web pages.

By incorporating numerous disciplinary perspectives and relying heavily on domain knowledge and expertise, data science has emerged as an important new area that integrates statistics with computational knowledge, data collection, cleaning and processing, analysis methods, and visualization to produce actionable insights from big data. As a discipline to use within Web science research, data science offers significant opportunities for uncovering trends in large Web-based datasets. A Web science observatory exemplifies this relationship by offering an online platform of tools for carrying out Web science research, allowing users to carry out data science techniques to produce insights into Web science issues such as community development, online behavior, and information \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Adaptive Educational Hypermedia (AEH) systems require massive and complex knowledge spaces in order to provide adaptation and personalisation in learning. Hence, it is difficult for a single person or a small group of people to develop them effectively. Former studies addressed the problem by developing collaborative authoring systems. However, the systems tended to support object reusability rather than enabling authors to collaboratively work in the same workspace. Potential ways to address these issues come from recent developments in social semantic web technologies that have successfully shifted authoring to a community based development. The application of such technologies together with Computer Support Collaborative Work (CSCW) could enhance collaborative authoring on documents and ontologies. This paper presents a Computer Support Collaborative Adaptation Authoring (CSCAA) model for AEH systems. The novelty of the model lies in the use of Semantic Mediawiki and the application of CSCW principles. The model aims at improving authoring for AEH systems by allowing more people to participate and enhancing authors\u2019 interaction. We have established requirements for the model and evaluated it by drawing a comparison with other existing collaborative authoring models made for developing documents, simple knowledge, and ontology. The result shows that such tools can be complementary for CSCAA, and CSCAA has a novelty by applying the CSCW aspects for authoring adaptation.",

The high data traffic cost and response time significantly affect the performance of distributed SPARQL queries as the number of SPARQL end point and the volume of data at each endpoint increase. In this context, parallelisation is promising to fully exploit the potential of connections to SPARQL endpoints and thus improve the efficiency of querying Linked Data.

Research in this area typically assumes that sentiment will always have a consistent relationship to price, both in terms of the sign of the relationship and the lag time between sentiment occurring and price reacting. We argue that factors latent to the text, such as investors trust in a particular author, make such a relationship unlikely. To test this theory we study the largest sample of online content assembled for an academic paper on this topic (10.2 million messages over a 15 month period). We show, using cross correlation analysis, that there is a variable, long run relationship between sentiment and price for the stocks in the S&P 100 index. We present a simple trading strategy based on the sentiment signal that produces significant excess returns over the sample period.",

In Web 2.0 users are producers as well as consumers of content and metadata, which makes guaranteeing the authenticity and integrity of information critical. The scale of the Web requires that any proposals in this direction require minimal (if any) infrastructural or administrative changes. This paper proposes the use of ID-based cryptography (IBC) to address requirements for integrity and authenticity of Web resources using either the URL/URI of a resource or the DNS name part of if. This approach presents certain challenges, which are discussed along with the pros and cons of different designs and implementations.",

The actual mechanisms of these affordances vary in different platforms but their main purposes are similar: allowing users to create content and connect with each other. In this paper, we study user activity on Tumblr, we analyse user activity around the most popular posts in one year, reflecting on the effects of Tumblr\u2019s affordances, communication style, and content discovery mechanisms on its users\u2019 behaviour. Our findings show that the majority of user activity on Tumblr is non-verbal, users reblog and like posts but they rarely engage in conversations with others.",

            "Abstract": "The South Australian Government has played a leading role in the digital government trend, and Adelaide has led the move towards becoming a\u201d smart city\u201d ever since the\u201d multi-function polis\u201d in the early 1990s. As a part of the move towards Open Government many jurisdictions have created platforms upon which to publish open public data, and South Australia\u2019s data. sa. gov. au is where its public government data are made available as csv files for use by business and the community. However, there is much more to opening up data than just publishing it, because when it comes to data that contains sensitive and private information, the current data publishing and sharing solutions hit barriers due to the lack of data provenance and security mechanisms, as well as limited use/usability for applications. Further, building analytic applications that make use of those datasets in line with their sharing policies is another challenge as many users have little digital literacy. These issues can be addressed by a new data sharing platform called the Web Observatory which allows both data and analytics to be published, shared and consumed in a secure and transparent manner. This paper describes the joint effort of building a Web Observatory for the South Australian Government through the collaboration of the University of South Australia and the University of Southampton.",

            "Abstract": "In an effort to mitigate the effects of human-induced climate change, agreements have been made by numerous governments (International Energy Agency, 2011) to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The current global target is to reduce CO2 emissions by 50%, compared with 1990 levels, by the year 2050 (Department of Energy and Climate Change, 2009b). To help achieve this global target, the UK has committed to transition to a low carbon economy via an 80% reduction in emissions by the year 2050. Therefore, over the coming years there will be an increasing demand for the electrification of heating and transport (Department of Energy and Climate Change, 2009a), coupled with greater low carbon electricity generation, instead of increasing high CO2 emitting coal or gas based electricity production, in order to meet this target. However, as a result, electricity networks will have to evolve to incorporate increased generation. Consequently, the integration of renewable generation will be needed to ensure the 2050 target is met. Owing to the intermittent nature of the resources the generators harness, the complexity of integrating these technologies will be increased.Electricity networks around the world are outdated and inefficient at transporting electricity (US Department of Energy, 2003) and (Department of Energy and Climate Change, 2009a); this is because the electricity networks were originally built to transport power from a small amount of large power stations to end consumers. However, more and more generators, end consumers and electrical devices are being added to electricity networks daily. Therefore, without a \u2026",

Moreover, it is increasingly advertised as a key enabling technology in a growing number of application domains. In the past ten years, we at Polytechnic University of Turin have been considering the possible benefits of applying semantic technologies to the field of education. For instance, in two recently closed research initiatives, cofunded by the European Commission under the Lifelong Learning Programme, we studied how to exploit semantics to find common or missing learning units across transnational qualifications (TAMTAM project) and to fill the competency gap between learners and job-seekers (MATCH project).",

This problem is particularly acute inside archives and repositories containing large collections of web resources or, more precisely, web pages and other web objects. Using the existing search capabilities in web archives, results can be compromised because of the size of data, content heterogeneity and changes in scientific terminologies and meanings. During the course of this research, we will explore whether semantic web technologies, particularly ontology-based annotation and retrieval, could improve precision in search results in multi-disciplinary web archives.",

            "Abstract": "In computational science and in computer science, research software is a central asset for research. Computational science is the application of computer science and software engineering principles to solving scientific problems, whereas computer science is the study of computer hardware and software design. The Open Science agenda holds that science advances faster when we can build on existing results. Therefore, research software has to be reusable for advancing science. Thus, we need proper research software engineering for obtaining reusable and sustainable research software. This way, software engineering methods may improve research in other disciplines. However, research in software engineering and computer science itself will also benefit from reuse when research software is involved. For good scientific practice, the resulting research software should be open and adhere to the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and repeatable) to allow repeatability, reproducibility, and reuse. Compared to research data, research software should be both archived for reproducibility and actively maintained for reusability. The FAIR data principles do not require openness, but research software should be open source software. Established open source software licenses provide sufficient licensing options, such that it should be the rare exception to keep research software closed. We review and analyze the current state in this area in order to give recommendations for making computer science research software FAIR and open.

            "Abstract": "Individuals are typically members of a variety of web-based social networks (both explicit and implied), but existing trust inference mechanisms typically draw only on a single network in order to calculate trust between any two individuals. This both reduces the likelihood that a trust value can be calculated (as both people have to be members of the same network), and reduces the quality of any trust inference that can be drawn (as it will be based on only a single network, typically representing a single type of relationship). To make trust calculations on multiple distributed (MuDi) social networks those networks must be first consolidated into a single network. This is challenging as simple consolidation strategies such as summing or averaging trust values tend to distort trust values. In this paper we present an analysis of different consolidation approaches for MuDi trust networks, and propose a Weighted Ordered Weighted Averaging (WOWA) approach, that avoids these problems by including the value added (by a given tie in a given network) as a factor during consolidation. We evaluate the consolidation strategies using a numerical simulation, where we generate a range of networks that simulate the characteristics of real-world networks, and analyse what happens to trust factors such as average strength of trust ties (TS), and average length of trust path (TL), as they are consolidated with different node and tie overlap. We discover that while simple strategies such as summing or averaging distort the trust values in the consolidated network by amplifying or dampening trust metrics, the WOWA approach maintains the integrity of the trust metrics \u2026",

Due to the volume and heterogeneity of these data, it is a challenging task to find and consume them. To reduce the barrier of data sharing and reuse on the Web, we propose a data cataloguing framework called WDFed that combines the strength of both Linked Data and REST. WDFed adopts the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) to harmonise database metadata, and develops a two-way mapping between DCAT and a RESTful API. This framework provides an interoperable middle layer that enables humans as well as applications to discover and consume Big Data on the Web in a semi-automatic manner. The framework is implemented in a data portal called Web Observatory and we present several use cases to evaluate the framework.",

SUMI is intended to form a service to allow users to share their user models from social e-networking and e-commerce providers to educational systems. The model is scrutable, meaning users can inspect and correct the data that is held about them, and implements privacy policies so that users can control how their models are accessed by other users. This evaluation was conducted with 107 users, which were exposed to a prototype service, for determining whether the proposed scrutability and privacy privileges were acceptable to the users, whether the users were able to achieve the desired outcome, and whether they understood the consequences of their interactions with the system. The conclusions show that the users expressed their general approval of the proposed privileges while making useful suggestions \u2026",

            "Abstract": "There is a long history of evolution of e-learning systems which has been ongoing for the last few decades. A combination of technological and pedagogical innovation as well as new patterns of social interaction are leading to a paradigm shift in all forms of learning. People use technology and in particular the Web to learn and interact with each other. Increasingly, however, they are starting to interact more frequently and in novel ways (eg instant messaging, blogs, etc) and, at the same time, they start to produce and classify content (social tagging, content management services, etc). Therefore, people are members of a learning society in which each member can be both a producer and a user of knowledge.Both pedagogical and technological innovation is behind this evolution. In terms of technology, it appears that this new e-learning paradigm (for which the term e-learning 2.0 was coined) is largely supported by technological innovation enabling more interactive rich-media applications over the Web to empower user communities. This set of technologies is often referred to as Web 2.0. Infrastructure for deploying software as a service and broadband networking for high quality communication and efficient access to content repositories are also important enablers of this paradigm shift.",

The Web Observatory provides an active decentralised ecosystem for datasets and applications based on a number Web Observatory sites, each of which can run in a different administrative domain. On a Web Observatory site users can publish and securely access datasets across domains via a harmonised API and reverse proxies for access control. However, that API provides a different interface to that of the databases on which datasets are stored and, consequently, existing applications that consume data from specific databases require major modification to be added to the Web Observatory ecosystem. In this paper we propose a lightweight architecture called Porter Proxy to address this concern. Porter Proxy exposes the same interfaces as databases as requested by the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "One issue regarding adaptive learning systems is the provision of learning resources that consist of domain knowledge, pedagogical knowledge with adaptation rules, and learning content. Challenges emerge concerning the lack of usability, interoperability, efficiency and collaboration. This paper critically discusses an enhanced collaborative authoring approach to developing adaptive learning resources. The main motivation behind the proposed approach is the evidence that creating adaptive learning resources is a complex, time-consuming process. Therefore, teachers must work together to reduce individual efforts. Until recently, collaborative work has not been strongly supported by existing authoring tools for adaptive learning. The contribution of this paper is twofold: the analysis of current authoring tools for learning and the proposed approach, which addresses the importance of collaboration and reuse in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Open data involves a paradigm shift in the way organisations manage their information and data: moving from a default of charities keeping data resources locked up in underused internal systems, to building a shared \u2018Web of Data\u2019. The emergence of the open data movement has supported powerful new models of creativity, innovation and public engagement. Although most of the recent stories of progress and success in the open data field come from government and research where open data is more established, this report sets out to explain the ways in which open data is increasingly coming to play a role in the charitable sector. Existing open government data can be used by charities to add value to their work, to target services better, to improve advocacy and fundraising, and to support knowledge sharing and collaboration between different charities and agencies. Crowdsourcing of open data also offers a new way for charities to gather intelligence, and a wide range of freely available online tools can support charities to analyse open data resources. Realising the potential of open data will require charities to meet a number of technical and organisational challenges. Indeed many charities will need to address key issues relating to open data, whether they choose to pursue benefits from open data or not (as regulatory, funding and performance indication is published online by researchers, by government and by others in the sector). This report reviews open data as it relates to the charitable sector, drawing on long experience of developing open data in research and government, as well as early work exploring open data with charities \u2026",

Our results suggest that AT\u2019s effect on funds is via the trading channel rather than funds\u2019 stock selection abilities. AT\u2019s positive effects of enhanced market quality on fund performance dominates its negative predatory trading influence. Using exchange automation as an instrument, we find evidence suggesting the effect of AT on the return gap is causal.",

Emphasis is placed on eliciting the motivations and aims of both the charity and their supporters, along with observing the actual behaviour that then occurs from each side. By comparing these phenomena, and appreciating how they all interact with each other, it is argued that greater understanding around how valuable a particular organisation will find social media can be obtained.",

The major issues with survey-based study are the potentially low response rates, time consuming and costly. Nevertheless, a large number of datasets that could inform the questions that students are explicitly asked in surveys is commonly available in the external open datasets. This paper describes a new student predictive model that uses commonly available external open data instead of traditional questionnaires/surveys to spot `at-risk' students. Considering the promising behavior of neural networks led us to develop student predictive models to predict `at-risk' students. The results of empirical study for undergraduate students in their first year of study shows that this model can perform as well as or even out-perform traditional survey \u2026",

The results of empirical study for undergraduate students\u2019 first year mark prediction show that prediction models based on institutional internal and external data sources provide better performance with more accurate models compared to the models based on only institutional internal data sources. Moreover, this study explores the external data sources (such as National Student Survey result) as one of the best predictors in students\u2019 mark prediction. Also, we found that students\u2019 first semester performance is the most informative for their first year performance.

The project will integrate satellite communication technologies with various terrestrial network infrastructures. An integrated end-to-end system will be implemented in order to provide tele-education services to remote, distributed and isolated rural areas and maritime users where satellite communication technologies have a potential edge over terrestrial infrastructures. Both of these user groups are typical examples of economic sectors and activities that can benefit greatly by a wider deployment and use of satellite communications essentially due to the usually large distances which separate them from broadband terrestrial telecom infrastructures.",

            "Abstract": "Sharing data and observations has been at the centre of academic discourse for centuries. The Internet has enabled new promising methods of sharing, introducing a number of challenges. This paper discusses the concept of data observatories as decentralised platforms for sharing data and observations, and outlines a reference architecture for their deployment. It argues that decentralisation has been a necessity for interdisciplinary research and that it will benefit data-driven innovation beyond academia. It concludes with discussion on the necessary conditions of decentralisation and literacy for innovation and wider engagement in academic discourse.",

Results presented in this paper have been used in the past in mechanical engineering to analyze reviews on products as well as in robotics for developing user communication interfaces. The paper shows the steps of calculation of the sentiment of messages on a certain topic in online social networks. The proposed method is deployed with a view of developing analytic tools and visualizations that make use of more than one such datasets in Web Observatories.",

To date, methods and techniques to extract useful and relevant information from online repositories of research data have largely been based on static full text indexing which entails a'produce once and use forever'kind of strategy. That strategy is fast becoming insufficient due to increasing data volume, concept obsolescence, and complexity and heterogeneity of content types in web repositories. We propose that by automatic semantic annotation of content in web repositories (using Linked Open Data or LoD sources) without using domain-specific ontologies, we can sustain the performance of searching by retrieving highly relevant search results. Secondly, we claim that by expert crowd-annotation of content on top of automatic semantic annotation \u2026",

It then discusses the notion of decentralised, peer-to-peer social networks and how this has been largely motivated by ideals that include giving users greater control over the data that they share in order to protect their privacy. At the same time it discusses the motivation for opportunistic contact that takes place when people are in geographical proximity (e.g. in the same office or attending the same event) and how those opportunities seem to establish the right context in which one can share and interpret ideas. Based on the hypothesis that the value of opportunistic contact in decentralised, peer-to-peer networks is more than the sum of its parts, we describe the deployment and evaluation of an application that lets users build \u2026",

Over the last decade, Higher Education around the world is facing a number of challenges and potential threats to effective learning and teaching support. In recent years considerable interest has focused on identifying those challenges, identifying opportunities and threats and proposing ways to address them. However, the relevant literature on higher education challenges is scattered over many textbooks, conferences and journals. This paper provides a comprehensive presentation of all those challenges found in the literature in a structured way. Also this study will identify how technology and data infrastructures could provide responses to address those challenges in a world where students are changing, their learning styles are changing, and the technologies to accommodate their needs are changing.

            "Abstract": "In query optimisation accurate cardinality estimation is essential for finding optimal query plans. It is especially challenging for RDF due to the lack of explicit schema and the excessive occurrence of joins in RDF queries. Existing approaches typically collect statistics based on the counts of triples and estimate the cardinality of a query as the product of its join components, where errors can accumulate even when the estimation of each component is accurate. As opposed to existing methods, we propose PRESTO, a cardinality estimation method that is based on the counts of subgraphs instead of triples and uses a probabilistic method to estimate cardinalities of RDF queries as a whole. PRESTO avoids some major issues of existing approaches and is able to accurately estimate arbitrary queries under a bound memory constraint. We evaluate PRESTO with YAGO and show that PRESTO is more accurate for both simple and complex queries.",

Drawing on economic and management literature relating to the typical trends of technological innovation, we examine the long-term development of Web technology in a theoretically informed and empirical manner. An original longitudinal dataset of 20,493 Web-related US patents is used to trace the growth curve of Web technology between the years of 1990 through 2013. We find that the accumulation of corporate Web inventions followed an S-shaped curve which shifted to linear growth after year 2004. This transition is unusual in relation to the traditional S-curve model of technological development that typically approaches a limit. The point of inflection on the S-curve coincided reasonably closely with the timing of the dot-com crash in year 2000 \u2026",

The advances in grid-based distributed infrastructures have further significantly contributed to this fact providing optimized and real-time system performance and support for virtual communities even under synchronous distributed multi-user usage contexts executing complex simulations in virtual lab applications. This paper focuses on realizing fundamental rich-media e-learning services for synchronous shared and interactive virtual labs offerings and asynchronous personalized learning paradigms towards enabling virtual campuses in a real-life context. The paper further presents evaluation results of the developed e-learning services on both learning and usability aspects in real-life learning contexts involving participation of student communities from remote collaborating Universities. The evaluation results showcase the interest of learning communities in such systems as they evolve to be more advanced and user-friendly and their impact in realizing virtual campuses.",

Ontologies provide the vocabulary for describing resources and their relationships (Gruber 1993; Musen 1992). Based on the meaning of resources, semantic technologies can draw conclusions and enable better resource discovery and matching. In a learning context, the potential of semantic technologies translates to a number of affordances. Thetypes of resources involved in formal or informal learning environments could include learners, teachers, software, services and content. Given the description (or annotation) of these resources with the help of ontologies, it is possible to support more efficient discovery of learning resources, sequencing of relevant learning material, adaptation of learning experiences to match learner profiles, formation of groups for teaching learning activities, collaborative construction of knowledge, recommendation of learning resources and activities, and assessment. A number of ontologies are developed in the learning domain in order to support these applications with the help of reasoning software.",

Certain providers such as Datasift9 provide access to curated cloudbased versions of datasets; however, those datasets will still have to be copied on local big data installations before analytics can be run on them.When we consider these issues, it becomes clear that there is a gap that potentially inhibits the vision of big data, and especially broad web data, to reach its full potential; this gap lies in the ability to have distributed infrastructures for big data analytics that will (1) enable the query of common datasets where they are, without the need for replication unless desired;(2) provide opportunities for more people to engage with those datasets\u2019 and (3) enable the reuse of analytic tools that can be applied for analysis on different datasets. This gap calls for a different kind of global, more weblike infrastructure that will bridge the potential of sharing datasets \u2026",

These physical entities generate a large amount of data in operation, and as the IoT gains momentum in terms of deployment, the combined scale of those data seems destined to continue to grow. Increasingly, applications for the IoT involve analytics. Data analytics is the process of deriving knowledge from data, generating value like actionable insights from them. This article reviews work in the IoT and big data analytics from the perspective of their utility in creating efficient, effective, and innovative applications and services for a wide spectrum of domains. We review the broad vision for the IoT as it is shaped in various communities, examine the application of data analytics across IoT domains, provide a categorisation of analytic approaches, and propose a layered taxonomy from IoT data to analytics.

However, often these users fail to understand various transformations and consequences of complex data processing involved in a data analytic application. Therefore, there is a need to enable these users develop and re-use analytic applications on web observatory. In this study, we propose formal design patterns called\" Observlets\" for analytic applications to\" observe\" various web phenomena. The observlets provide abstract definitions for intermediate analysis required for a data analytic application. The users can share observlets across distributed web observatory nodes.

After a decade of reforms, most of the required instruments are already in place, so the next years are key to complete the implementation and consolidation of the EHEA. However, data challenges pose a threat to pivotal EHEA processes such as credit recognition that require institutions to cooperate and integrate their datasets scattered across diverse repositories in multiple data formats. Linked Data principles and practices have the potential to address such difficulties, as demonstrated with the emergence of a global data space \u2013the Web of Data. This paper first discusses the benefits of Linked Data for the emergent EHEA, devising a new set of Linked Data-driven scenarios that leverage current EHEA processes. Further, a set of preliminary Linked Data deployments is examined to assess the advantages and identify the challenges ahead in the EHEA landscape.

However, defining an agreed, shared understanding of what constitutes Web Science requires complex negotiation and translations of understandings across component disciplines, national cultures and educational traditions. Some individual institutions have already established particular curricula, and discussions in the Web Science Curriculum Workshop series have marked the territory to some extent. This paper reports on a process being adopted across a consortium of partners to systematically create a shared understanding of what constitutes Web Science. It records and critiques the processes instantiated to agree a common curriculum, and presents a framework for future discussion and development.",

The population number in these areas is decreasing year by year as the inhabitants are facing serious problems in terms of their living conditions. The provision of adequate infrastructure for mainly education, health care and other vital sectors, is a challenging issue of key importance for addressing the demographic recession.As regards the educational system in remote areas in Greece and more specifically primary education most of the schools in these areas are multigrade schools1. According to the data of the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs (2001-2002), 44% of the primary schools in Greece are multigrade and 15% of the primary school teachers serve in multigrade schools. Teachers serving in multigrade schools are usually recently appointed. Although the function of the multigrade schools in the Greek educational system represents an institutional reality there are no relevant undergraduate courses in the curricula of the Greek Departments of Primary Education and the efforts for the teachers\u2019 professional enhancement in the field are occasional (seminars, workshops etc organised now and then by various organisations/institutions).",

            "Abstract": "In today\u2019s Internet, a web user becomes members of multiple social networks due to different types of services provided by each of these networks. This creates an opportunity to make trust decisions that go beyond individual social networks, since these networks provide single perspective of trust. To make trust inference over multiple social networks, these networks need to be consolidated. It is nontrivial as these networks are of heterogeneous nature due to different naming conventions used in these networks. Furthermore, trust metrics extracted from these networks are also varied in nature due to different trust evaluation algorithms used in each of these networks. Heterogeneity of these social networks can be overcome by using semantic technologies as it allows us to represent knowledge using ontologies. Trust data can be consolidated by using such data fusion techniques which not only provide but also preserve trust data integrity from each of the individual social network profiles. The proposed semantic framework is evaluated using two sets of experiments. Through simulations in this work, we analysed various techniques for data fusion. For identifying suitable technique that preserves the integrity of trust consolidated from each of the individual networks, analysis revealed that Weighted Ordered Weighted Averaging parameter best aggregated trust data, and, unlike other techniques, it preserved the integrity of trust from each individual network for varying participant overlap and tie overlap (). Similarly, for experimental analysis, we used findings of the simulation study about the best trust aggregation technique and applied the proposed \u2026",

SUMI allows users to gather their various (lifelong) models which they hold with several providers from the social e-networking and e-commerce domains, passes the control to the owners of the user models by providing scrutability and user-controlled privacy privileges, and enables exporting of these user models, or parts of them, towards educational personalization systems, after direct consent of the users-owners. Up-to-date results highlight users\u2019 approval of six proposed scrutability and user-controlled privacy privileges which were presented during SUMI\u2019s first evaluation, while data portability initiatives from providers of the two examined domains, combined with Semantic Web technologies, constitute the backbone of the proposed solution.",

Developing learning spaces for AEH, however, requires a lot of effort due to the complexity of the learning resources, consisting of learning content, domain knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, which are completed with adaptation rules. Current authoring tools for adaptive learning present drawbacks in terms of the reusability of their output and their collaborative work features. In this paper, a proposed collaborative authoring approach for developing adaptive learning resources is presented. The advantages of the proposed approach lie in the application of a collaborative method; the use of a learning standard, IMS Learning Design, for reusability and extensibility reasons; and the repurposing of learning materials available \u2026",

Such technologies pose important ethical issues, ranging from privacy, to their potential to undermine individual autonomy, to the difficulty of apportioning accountability for their realworld effects.Furthermore, the domains of greatest potential for such technologies are extremely heterogeneous in their own ethical status, ranging from areas such as healthcare where the public good is obvious, to those like marketing where the benefits are rather more equivocal, and also include use by governments, which might themselves be benign democracies or authoritarian regimes.",

Internet engineers therefore analyse data transfers on the Internet, typically by collecting data from devices of large groups of individuals as well as organisations. The designs of Internet engineering and research projects reflect human decisions and therefore may create new moral systems. This interplay of technology and society creates new practices that can impact the lives of individuals in many ways. These actions can raise new ethical dilemmas, or challenge existing ethics methodologies within the new and complex information environment presented by the Internet.",

            "Abstract": "Over the last decade, Higher Education around the world is facing a number of challenges. Challenges such as adopting new technologies, improving the quality of learning and teaching, widening participation, student retention, curriculum design/alignment, student employability, funding and the necessity to improve governance are considered particularly in many literature. To effectively operate and to survive in this globalization era, Higher Education institutions need to respond those challenges in an efficient way. This paper proposes ways in which institutional data repositories can be utilized to address the challenges found in different literature. Also we discuss which repositories can be shared across the institutions and which need not to be shared in order to address those challenges. Finally the paper discusses the barriers to sharing Higher Education repositories and how those barriers can be addressed.",

In the case of lightweight SWS approaches, such as SAWSDL, service description is achieved by semantically annotating existing web service interfaces. Other approaches such as OWL-S and WSMO describe services in a separate ontology. So, existing approaches separate service description from domain description, therefore increasing design efforts. We propose EXPRESS a lightweight approach to SWS that requires the domain ontology definition only. Its simplicity stems from the similarities between REST and the Semantic Web such as resource realization, self describing representations, and uniform interfaces. The semantics of a service is elicited from a resource\u2019s semantic description in the domain ontology and the semantics of the uniform interface, hence eliminating the \u2026",

This limited consideration could play a role in blending both learning approaches as they assist the mobile learners. Moreover, the essential requirements for mobile learners may be overlooked by this consideration and consequently, mobile learners may be affected negatively. In this paper, mobile and ubiquitous learning are compared from the view of the nature of interaction between learners and computers. This comparison will provide a close picture of the potential of these learning approaches and the differences between their environments. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in achieving a level where the different design requirements to facilitate the learning for learners in m-learning and u-learning environments are realised and \u2026",

According to the web service paradigm it is envisaged that services will be provided to customers based on dynamic web service composition. This places additional requirements to SLA negotiation in comparison to the traditional service provision paradigm where negotiation for service was performed with a single service provider system. This paper addresses the research challenges with regard to SLA negotiation for web service based provision and outlines business roles and a negotiation model for establishing SLAs with multiple web service providers in order to offer combined web service functionality to match user needs.",

            "Publication url": "https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423226/",
            "Abstract": "Depression detection is a significant issue for human well-being. In previous studies, online detection has proven effective in Twitter, enabling proactive care for depressed users. Owing to cultural differences, replicating the method to other social media platforms, such as Chinese Weibo, however, might lead to poor performance because of insufficient available labeled (self-reported depression) data for model training. In this paper, we study an interesting but challenging problem of enhancing detection in a certain target domain (e.g. Weibo) with ample Twitter data as the source domain. We first systematically analyze the depression-related feature patterns across domains and summarize two major detection challenges, namely isomerism and divergency. We further propose a cross-domain Deep Neural Network model with Feature Adaptive Transformation & Combination strategy (DNN-FATC) that transfers the relevant information across heterogeneous domains. Experiments demonstrate improved performance compared to existing heterogeneous transfer methods or training directly in the target domain (over 3.4% improvement in F1), indicating the potential of our model to enable depression detection via social media for more countries with different cultural settings.",

New collaborative platforms are forming which are providing individuals with new communities and knowledge bases and, at the same time, offering insights into human activity for researchers, policy-makers and engineers. On a global scale, the role of cultural and language barriers when studying such phenomena becomes particularly relevant and presents significant challenges: due to insufficient information, it is often hard to establish the cultural or language groups in which individuals belong, while there are technical difficulties in establishing the relevance and in analysing resources in different languages.

These issues are keenly felt in an international network like the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN) as it seeks to address major global challenges. In this paper we outline the WUN Web Observatory project\u2019s plan to overcome these obstacles and, given that these obstacles are not unique to WUN, we also propose an ambitious, longer-term route to their solution at Web-scale by applying lessons from the Web itself. c 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.

            "Publication url": "http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/49833/",
            "Abstract": "In this extended abstract we discuss the infrastructure of the Internet as two distinct layers that are increasingly interdependent : the network layer, below, and the Web, above. The network layer is responsible for the structural properties of the Internet, while the top layer is where the Web content is consumed through Web applications and communications. We argue that the principle of independence between the layers, which guided the early design of the Internet, has enabled an environment conducive to innovation pursued by different communities: networking technologists primarily below, and business, application developers, and humanists/artists above. The innovations in each layer, however, are increasingly influencing design criteria and choices in the other, suggesting that the Internet architecture is evolving towards greater interdependence between the layers. For example, this is explicitly sought in some cases for wireless networks for efficiency optimization. Tight coupling between structural and functional properties is one of the fundamental \u201carchitectural\u201d principles of biological organism s, which have evolved to optimize energy efficiency as a requirement for survival and procreation. This view, which mixes strictly functionalist concerns with creative and opportunistic behaviour, suggests that the Internet may be evolving towards an increasingly complex structure and dynamic. The paper argues that an environment in which the two layers are increasingly interdependent can still sustain a high level of innovation as long as no entity has full control of both , and as long as the design principles on each layer, which can be argued to \u2026",

Despite the rapid growth of e-commerce, the online grocery shopping market has taken until now to gain traction, currently constituting 6.9% of the UK\u2019s grocery market, but projected to increase 68.3% to \u00a317.6 bn by 2021. There is little work accounting for new and contingent behaviours in the online grocery market, not least because of historically poor access to retailers\u2019 data. This paper leverages access to the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket, WM Morrisons Plc (Morrisons) to investigate consumer behaviour in this market, augmenting the Office for National Statistics\u2019 Living Costs and Food Survey, the UK\u2019s only substantial publicly available resource to date.

Statistically significant results presented here are: Students making heavy use of the system achieved higher marks on their project dissertation, while no such correlation was found with marks for other parts of their MSc. Likewise, student's monitor activity is significantly correlated with their own activity and dissertation mark. These results suggest that educational information and project management systems positively affect student achievement and academic staff involvement is crucial for these systems to be successful.

Students in the School of Electronics and Computer Science were asked to take an online survey about devices, calendaring applications and features, and study time management strategies. All respondents own a mobile device and about 76% carry a web-enabled device on campus. The most used calendaring applications for study planning are mobile phone calendaring software, Google Calendar, and MS Outlook. Feature-wise, appointments and reminders are preferred over tasks. Students\u2019 time management practices are diverse, and a range of different technologies is used. Those reporting poor time management use more software features and think that existing software lacks features for study planning. Also, those using software make less use of guessing for time on task estimation. It is hoped that the \u2026",

For charities, this provides a unique opportunity to reach an audience for a relatively low cost, yet some remain hesitant to fully embrace these services without knowing exactly what they will receive in return. This paper reports on a study that seeks to determine the extent to which these conversations occur, and compares this phenomenon on Facebook and Twitter for a sample of UK-based charities. Focus was placed on analysing conversations as signs of developing relationships, which have previously been shown to be a key target for charities on social media. The results of this study find that while there is an expected proportion of the audience who prefer to listen rather than engage, there is strong evidence of a core \u2026",

            "Abstract": "There is little conclusive evidence as to whether OD provides value to social innovation ideation scenarios. Furthermore, OD as a resource is severely contested as to its openness, availability, quality, importance, and usefulness within innovation ideation. Therefore, understanding how Open Data (OD) can be leveraged for innovation ideation practices has become a topic at the mainstream of management literature. However much of the effort thus far has been focused on ideation and innovation for-profit, specifically when in papers examining Open Innovation (OI), even though OD has been depicted as a resource for providing social, economical and entrepreneurial benefit. Therefore this paper presents an initial study of the perceived value of OD, in research phase Open Social Innovation (OSI), amongst academic and professional experts in OI, Innovation Networking and OD. Consequently, a Modified Delphi Study (MDS) is conducted, aimed at forming a convergence of opinion amongst academic and professional experts. From converging expert opinions from both academic and professional perspectives, optimal managerial practices within this field can be shaped. Furthermore, management processes and practices can be justified in collecting and targeting particular datasets that are opportune for a social innovation context. In addition to the primary objectives, and with respect to the paper\u2019s findings, barriers of utilizing and leveraging OD for this purpose are duly noted with proposed methods of overcoming such challenges",

However, notwithstanding recent advances in e-Learning, from both technological and pedagogical perspectives, there are very few, if any, recognised methodologies for user-led design of satellite-based e-learning infrastructures. In this paper, we present a methodology for designing a satellite and wireless based network infrastructure and learning services to support distance learning for such isolated communities. This methodology entails (a) the involvement of community members in the development of targeted learning services from an early stage, and (b) a service-oriented approach to learning solution deployment. Results show, that, while the technological premises of distance learning can be accommodated by \u2026",

From our home we can send and receive not only analogue voice, but also growing volumes of digital information and even intelligence in the form of agents. We are becoming increasingly mobile and are expecting the same level of connectivity in the home, in the office, and on the road. The regulatory and commercial environment in which we communicate is changing. The telecommunications market is becoming increasingly competitive. The Internet is erasing the borders between information technology and telecommunications. And the way we do business is ever more dominated by electronic exchanges of information. Is our technology ready for the open market of networks and services? Can we manage the growing complexity of computing and telecommunications technology and place it at the service of the people? The challenge for the research community is to develop the tools and techniques that will ultimately bring the full power of communications and information to everyone, in a way that everyone can easily use. The Sixth International Conference on Intelligence in Services and Networks (IS&N\u201999) is all about technology for paving the way to the open services market. Since the first IS&N conference in 1992 the focus of the IS&N program has continually shifted. We see existing technologies maturing while new ones emerge, but the bottom line has always been putting technology at the service of the people.",

The major issues with survey-based study are the potentially low response rates and cost. Nevertheless, a large number of datasets that could inform the questions that students are explicitly asked in surveys is commonly available in the external open datasets. This paper describes a new student predictive model for student progression that relies on the data available in institutional internal databases and external open data, without the need for surveys. The results of empirical study for undergraduate students in their first year of study shows that this model can perform as well as or even out-perform traditional survey-based ones.",

While SPARQL 1.1 provides basic constructs, further development on optimising OLAP queries lacks benchmarks that mimic the data distributions found in Link Data. Existing work on OLAP benchmarking for SPARQL has usually adopted queries and data from relational databases, which may not well represent Linked Data. We propose an approach that maps typical OLAP operations to SPARQL and a tool named ASPG to automatically generate OLAP queries from real-world Linked Data. We evaluate ASPG by constructing a benchmark called DBOBfrom the online DBpedia endpoint, and use DBOB to measure the performance of the Virtuoso engine.",

            "Abstract": "Due to the distributed nature of Linked Data, many resources are referred to by more than one URI. This phenomenon, known as co-reference, increases the probability of leaving out implicit semantically related results when querying Linked Data. The probability of co-reference increases further when considering distributed SPARQL queries over a larger set of distributed datasets. Addressing co-reference in Linked Data queries, on one hand, increases complexity of query processing. On the other hand, it requires changes in how statistics of datasets are taken into consideration. We investigate these two challenges of addressing co-reference in distributed SPARQL queries, and propose two methods to improve query efficiency: 1) a model named Virtual Graph, that transforms a query with co-reference into a normal query with pre-existing bindings; 2) an algorithm named \u03a8, that intensively exploits \u2026",

While there have been many significant innovations and successes over the last decade there have also been many unrealised aims. Beliefs in technology-driven change for education have been countered by shortcomings in technological understanding by educationalists and in turn by shortcomings in the understanding of educational theories and learning concepts by technologists. The use of the Web in education has revealed issues such as the distinction between formal and informal learning; the packaging and formatting of learning materials for online distribution and use; the management of learning materials and processes in virtual and managed learning environments; solutions offered by the semantic Web; and how the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The popularity of Resource Oriented and RESTful Web Services is increasing rapidly. In these, resources are key actors in the interfaces, in contrast to other approaches where services, messages or objects are. This distinctive feature necessitates a new approach for modelling RESTful interfaces providing a more intuitive mapping from model to implementation than could be achieved with non-resource methods. With this objective we propose an approach to describe Resource Oriented and RESTful Web Services based on UML collaboration diagrams. Then use it to model scenarios from several problem domains, arguing that Resource Oriented and RESTful Web Services can be used in systems which go beyond ad-hoc integration. Using the scenarios we demonstrate how the approach is useful for: eliciting domain ontologies; identifying recurring patterns; and capturing static and dynamic aspects of the \u2026",

This phenomenon has been extensively studied in the literature from different perspectives, one of which is cascades: the traces of the spreading content. These traces form structures that link users to each other, where these links represent the direction of information flow between the users. In fact, cascades have served as an artefact to study the information diffusion processes on online social networks. In \u2026",

For this purpose, SEEK-AT-WD is proposed as an infrastructure that automatically retrieves ICT tool descriptions from the Web and publishes them back once they are related to an educational vocabulary. A working prototype containing 3556 descriptions of ICT tools is presented. These descriptions can be accessed either from a web interface or through a search client that has also been developed.

These technologies can provide a support for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) by enabling new learning environments based on collaboration, real direct experience, personalization, ubiquity, accessibility and contextualization. Nevertheless, to be effectively used in TEL, Grid must be complemented with other elements like semantics and educational modelling; leading to the concept of \u2018Learning Grid\u2019as defined in the homonymous Special Interest Group (SIG) of the European Network of Excellence \u2018Kaleidoscope: Shaping the Scientific Evolution of Technology Enhanced Learning\u2019.

In this context, the Learning Grid SIG aims at contributing to the achievement of an improvement in TEL practices through the definition of open, distributed and pervasive environments for effective human learning taking into account that effective learning requires an active attitude of learners and that learning is a social and collaborative activity so requiring a technology that allows for active and realistic experiments, personalization, knowledge creation and evolution, as well as autonomous and dynamic creation of communities.

All too often governments and non-profit groups lack these capabilities, and are driven by very different mandates.

SemTech addressed the following questions: \u2022 What are semantic technologies? \u2022 Which tools that make use of semantic technologies are, or could be, relevant to education? \u2022 What is the actual use of semantic tools and services in UK HE and FE? \u2022 What is the value of such tools in the context of learning, teaching and support? \u2022 How do we envisage the adoption of semantic tools in higher education in the future? Although a definition of semantic technologies was not in the scope of the project it was considered necessary for the survey of semantic tools and services and their adoption. SemTech distinguishes between (i) soft semantic technologies like topic maps and Web 2.0 applications, which provide lightweight knowledge modelling in formats understood by humans and (ii) hard semantic technologies like RDF, which provide knowledge modelling in formats processable by computers. The outcomes of an extensive survey of semantic technologies relevant to learning and teaching are documented online (http://semtech-survey.ecs.soton.ac.uk). A total of thirty-six relevant tools and services have been identified by SemTech and the community at the moment of writing. Most of the surveyed tools were not purpose-built for education and they find value in semantic technologies for well-formed metadata or data interoperability and integration. The surveyed tools can be classified to (i) collaborative authoring and annotation, (ii) searching and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Two requirements to utilise the large source of time-series sensor data from the Internet of Things are interoperability and efficient access. We present a Linked Data solution that increases interoperability through the use and referencing of common identifiers and ontologies for integration. From our study of the shape of Internet of Things data, we show how we can improve access within the resource constraints of Lightweight Computers, compact machines deployed in close proximity to sensors, by storing time-series data succinctly as rows and producing Linked Data \u2018just-in-time\u2019. We examine our approach within two scenarios: a distributed meteorological analytics system and a smart home hub. We show with established benchmarks that in comparison to storing the data in a traditional Linked Data store, our approach provides gains in both storage efficiency and query performance from over 3 times to \u2026",

This conference brought together researchers from across the world to help further develop the emerging discipline of Internet Science. Internet Science is an interdisciplinary field that explores the sociotechnical nature of the Internet through the lenses of Computer Science, Sociology, Art, Mathematics, Physics, Complex Systems Analysis, Psychology, Economics, Law, Political Sciences, and more. Internet Science aims to bridge these different views and theories, in order to create a more holistic understanding of the Internet and its impact on society. In particular, Internet Science asks crucial questions like: How do people behave in the Internet? Are they changing their lifestyle and how? Can the Internet promote sustainability, cooperation, and collective \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Today, distance learning classes are commonly offered from many leading universities around the world. A major challenge in such distributed classrooms is the formation of active virtual communities among the participating students. Shared virtual laboratories offer such a possibility as students form lab teams to run the same interactive simulation and in the course of such experiments learn to interact and understand each other better. A virtual scientific experiment architectural framework on top of a grid infrastructure for running interactive virtual laboratory experiments for such distributed student communities with visualisation capabilities was designed and implemented, using web services standard protocols such as WSDL and WS-notification as implemented in the WSRF specification. This paper reports on results from running such simulations on a local grid infrastructure. System evaluation results from a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Ever since the first communication systems were deployed, requirements for mobility have been one of the most important causes of architectural changes. For instance, it has taken a long period of research and standardisation to arrive at the deployment of mobile telephony, the architecture of which is very different from that of the traditional/fixed telephony. Similarly, in the Internet, the proposed architecture of Mobile-IP adopts different methods of IP address allocation and routing, among other changes. On the other hand, the mobile system architectures introduced by the different communities, eg telephony, Internet, data management, nomadic computing, and wireless communications, all differ significantly. They provide different kinds of mobility, they adopt different approaches to managing mobility and each of them has certain architectural problems. For example, the problem of triangular routing in Mobile IP is \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Distance education is in a position to offer additional educational solutions and to constitute a platform for the dissemination of knowledge beyond geographical limitations. The success of distance education activities depends on the proper pedagogical and technological support. For its provision and management, thus, adapted pedagogical procedures as well as innovative technological applications are needed. A synopsis of the different types of distance education is presented below, together with support offered nowadays by learning management systems. Moreover, the provision is presented of a learning content management system within the framework of ZEUS, a Greek research project focusing on the provision of distance in- service training to teachers at remote schools.",

            "Abstract": "The efficient management of data is an important prerequisite for realising the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT). Two issues given the large volume of structured time-series IoT data are, addressing the difficulties of data integration between heterogeneous Things and improving ingestion and query performance across databases on both resource-constrained Things and in the cloud. In this paper, we examine the structure of public IoT data and discover that the majority exhibit unique flat, wide and numerical characteristics with a mix of evenly and unevenly-spaced time-series. We investigate the advances in time-series databases for telemetry data and combine these findings with microbenchmarks to determine the best compression techniques and storage data structures to inform the design of a novel solution optimised for IoT data. A query translation method with low overhead even on resource-constrained Things allows us to utilise rich data models like the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for interoperability and data integration on top of the optimised storage. Our solution, TritanDB, shows an order of magnitude performance improvement across both Things and cloud hardware on many state-of-the-art databases within IoT scenarios. Finally, we describe how TritanDB supports various analyses of IoT time-series data like forecasting.",

Students are required to learn independently, many learning activities take place outside the formal teaching timetable, and students may require additional motivation. We present the design of a time management system prototype addressing these requirements. Our system contains social networking features, enhanced social presence, and motivational techniques. Individual learning task progress data is disclosed to other students, enabling them to assess their own progress and seek help from their peers. Also, their current geographical position and that of their peers is shown on a virtual map. We use this prototype in an experiment with 55 first-year students studying on an undergraduate degree in our department.
