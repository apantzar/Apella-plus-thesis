But the complexity and diversity of scientific data mean that discovering accessing and interpreting data remains a large challenge to researchers, decision-makers and other users. Different sources of useful information on data, algorithms, instruments and publications are scattered around the Web. How can we link all these things together to help users to better understand and exploit earth science data? How can we combine scientific data with other relevant data sources, when standards for describing and sharing data vary so widely between communities?\" Linked Data\" is a term that describes a set of standards and\" best practices\" for sharing data on the Web (http://www. w3. org/standards/semanticweb/data).

A parallel process with the above was that RDF frameworks evolved in an interesting way by presenting a more mature set of geospatial features, such as GeoSPARQL support and including the latest indexing technologies. As a logical consequence, a shift in the use of RDF frameworks is to be expected, from base platforms that users extend to create more complete geospatial RDF stores, to attractive finished RDF solutions for many geospatial applications. Alongside with the ever-increasing size of linked geospatial data that semantic stores need to handle, all the above provided our group the motivation to improve our single-node systems \u2026",

One means may be through the concept of an information ecosystem. An information ecosystem is analo gous to a natural ecosystem in which there are flo ws of materials and energy analo gous to information flow between many interacting individuals. This paper describes a multi-agent platform, DIET (Decentralised Information Ecosystem Technologies) that can be used to implement open, robust, adaptive and scalable ecosystem-inspired systems. We describe the design principles of the DIET software architecture, and present a simple example application based upon it. We go on to consider how the DIET system can be used to develop information brokering agents, and how these can contribute to the implementation of economic interactions between agents, as well as identifying some open questions relating to research in these areas. In this way we show the capacity of the DIET system to support applications using information agents.",

The data and information processed and disseminated puts Copernicus at the forefront of the big data paradigm and gives rise to all relevant challenges: volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value. In this paper we discuss the challenges of big Copernicus data and how the Copernicus programme is attempting to deal with them. We also present lessons learned from our project Copernicus App Lab, which takes Copernicus services information and makes it available on the Web using semantic technologies to aid its take up by mobile developers.

P2P systems are application level virtual or overlay networks that have emerged as a natural way to share data and resources. The main application scenario considered in recent P2P data sharing systems is that of one-time querying: a user poses a query (e.g., \u201cI want music by Moby\u201d) and the system returns a list of pointers to matching files owned by various peers in the network. Then, the user can go ahead and download files of interest. The complementary scenario of selective dissemination of information (SDI) or selective information push is also very interesting. In an SDI scenario, a user posts a continuous query to the system to receive notifications whenever certain resources of interest appear in the system (e.g., when a song of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We are interested in the problem of distributed resource sharing in future digital libraries (DLs). We adopt a pure P2P architecture (illustrated in Figure 1), but our ideas can be easily modified to work in the case of hierarchical P2P networks, as in [3]. Information providers (DLs) and information consumers (users) are both represented by peers participating in a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network. There are two kinds of basic functionality that we expect this architecture to offer: information retrieval (IR) and publish/subscribe (pub/sub). In an IR scenario a user poses a query (eg,\u201cI am interested in papers on bio-informatics\u201d) and the system returns information about matching resources. In a pub/sub scenario (also known as information filtering (IF) or selective dissemination of information (SDI)) a user posts a subscription (or profile or continuous query) to the system to receive notifications whenever certain events of interest take place (eg, when a paper on bio-informatics becomes available). In this extended abstract we concentrate on the latter kind of functionality (pub/sub) and sketch how to provide it by extending the distributed hash table Chord [4]. Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are the second generation structured P2P overlay networks devised as a remedy for the known limitations of earlier P2P networks such as Napster and Gnutella. We present a set of protocols, collectively called DHTrie, that extend the Chord protocols with pub/sub functionality. We assume that resources are annotated using a well-understood attributevalue model called AWPS in [2]. Thus publications and subscriptions will also be expressed in AWPS. AWPS is based on \u2026",

The work presented here puts forward MAPS, a novel approach to support approximate information filtering in a peer-to-peer environment. In MAPS a user subscribes to and monitors only carefully selected data sources, and receives notifications about interesting events from these sources only. This way scalability is enhanced by trading recall for lower message traffic. We define the protocols of a peer-to-peer architecture especially designed for approximate information filtering, and introduce new node selection strategies based on time series analysis techniques to improve data source selection.

We introduce extensions to an existing SPARQL-to-SQL translation method to support GeoSPARQL features. We describe the implementation of our approach in the system ontop-spatial, an extension of the OBDA system Ontop for creating virtual geospatial RDF graphs on top of geospatial relational databases. We present an experimental evaluation of our system using and extending a state-of-the-art benchmark. To measure the performance of our system, we compare it to a state-of-the-art geospatial RDF store and confirm its efficiency.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we investigate methods that allow us to identify the publishing behavior of individual nodes in large-scale distributed information filtering systems. The work presented here is based on our system MAPS (Minerva Approximate Publish/Subscribe), a novel approach to support approximate information filtering functionality in a peer-to-peer environment. In MAPS, a user subscribes to and monitors only carefully selected publisher nodes, and receives notifications from these information sources only. In this way, document-granularity dissemination is known from exact information filtering approaches is avoided, and the system is able to support very high publication rates. However this scalability benefits come at the cost of lower recall. To improve node selection and thus recall, in previous work we have proposed a ranking method that predicts nodes\u2019 publishing behavior based on time-series analysis techniques. In this work, we focus on the prediction parameters used by these techniques and show how their choice can affect the overall recall achieved. Additionally, we demonstrate how these parameters can be computed in a per node fashion, using only local information available at each node. Our method incurs no extra message traffic in the network and experiments show improvements in both prediction error and recall. When compared to an oracle opponent and an opponent with global information, our method performs almost as good, by resorting only to local node computations.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, more and more resources are semantically annotated, thus generating huge amounts of RDF metadata. Current centralized RDF repositories lack the required scalability and fault tolerance to deal with this emerging situation. Therefore, the need for a scalable system that will be able to scale to millions of RDF triples is becoming prevalent. Distributed hash tables (DHTs) is a recent P2P technology that has been proposed for the scalable and faulttolerant storage and querying of RDF data [2, 1]. Since annotation is by itself a distributed process it ties very well with the model of work imposed by P2P systems.In this demo paper, we present Atlas, a P2P system for the distributed storage and retrieval of RDF data. Atlas is built on top of the distributed hash table Bamboo1 and supports pull and push querying scenarios. It inherits all the nice features of Bamboo (openness, scalability, fault-tolerance, resistance to high churn rates)[10] and extends Bamboo\u2019s protocols for storing and querying RDF data. In the OntoGrid project, Atlas is used to implement the metadata service of S-OGSA, a new architecture for the Semantic Grid [3].",

This extensibility is accomplished through powerful metamodeling features, which proved very useful for interrelating heterogeneous models from requirements, model-driven software engineering, data integration, cultural informatics and eLearning. We trace the evolution of ideas and research results in the Telos project from its origins in the late eighties.

Similarly, the five ESA Sentinel satellites that would soon go into orbit have already adopted a fully open and free data access policy.Linked data is a new data paradigm which studies how one can make RDF data available on the Web, and interconnect it with other data with the aim of increasing its value. In the last few years, linked geospatial data has received attention as researchers and practitioners have started tapping the wealth of geospatial information available on the Web. As a result, the linked open data (LOD) cloud has been rapidly populated with geospatial data some of it describing EO products (eg, CORINE Land Cover and Urban Atlas published by project TELEIOS). The abundance of this data can prove useful to the new missions (eg, Sentinels) as a means to increase the usability of the millions of images and EO products that are expected to be produced by these missions. However, open EO data that are currently made available by space agencies such as ESA and NASA are not following the linked data paradigm.

In our extension to RDF, we follow the main ideas of constraint databases and represent spatial and temporal objects as quantifier-free formulas in a first-order logic of linear constraints. Thus an important contribution of stRDF is to bring to the RDF world the benefits of constraint databases and constraint-based reasoning so that spatial and temporal data can be represented in RDF using constraints.",

To make our claim more persuasive, we survey previous works on querying temporal constraint networks and show that they can be viewed as an instance of the scheme of indefinite constraint databases. Then we study the computational complexity of the proposed scheme when constraints are temporal, and carefully outline the boundary between tractable and intractable query answering problems.",

            "Abstract": "In an earlier work [SK04], we have presented a composition method for cardinal direction relations [Goy00, SGS+ 05, SK05, SK04]. Given two relations R1 and R2, the aforementioned method outputs the composition R1\u25e6 R2 in a form of a disjunction that contains all possible relations. The proposed method was applied to (a) the relations of set D that are realizable for the connected regions of set REG and (b) the relations of set D\u2217 that are realizable for the (connected and disconnected) regions of set REG\u2217. Since REG\u2282 REG\u2217 holds, we also have D\u2282 D\u2217.Later on, Zhang et al.[ZLLY08, ZLLY09] while studying a related operator, they discovered a case where the composition method presented in [SK04](when restricted to the relations of set D) does not compute the strictest disjunction. In other words, the composition method of [SK04] always returns a disjunction that contains all the sound results but there are some (rare, as we will later see) cases that the returned disjunction also contains disjuncts (ie, relations) that might not belong to the composition. Notice that these cases arise only for the relations of the more restricted set D (defined exclusively for the connected regions of REG); for the more general set of relations D\u2217(that is defined for the connected and disconnected regions of REG\u2217) the composition method always returns the strictest disjunction. In the rest of this work, unless specifically stated, we will consider relations from set D.",

Nomothesia offers advanced services for retrieving and querying Greek legislation and is intended for citizens through intuitive presentational views and search interfaces, but also for application developers that would like to consume content through two web services: a SPARQL endpoint and a RESTful API. Opening up legislation in this way is a great leap towards making governments accountable to citizens and increasing transparency.",

To perform this task in an efficient way, servers employ indexing schemes that support fast matches of the incoming information with the query database. Such indexing schemes involve (i) main-memory trie-based data structures that cluster similar queries by capturing common elements between them and (ii) efficient filtering mechanisms that exploit this clustering to achieve high throughput and low filtering times. However, state-of-the-art indexing schemes are sensitive to the query insertion order and cannot adopt to an evolving query workload, degrading the filtering performance over time.

Given the current interest in publishing geospatial datasets as linked data (e.g., by Ordnance Survey in the UK), RDF i  is an excellent framework for encoding, possibly incomplete, qualitative and quantitative geospatial information which is found in these published datasets.

Almost every summer massive forest fires break out, causing severe destruction and even human life losses. Thus, European initiatives in the area of Earth Observation (EO), such as GMES SAFER4, have supported the development of relevant operational infrastructures. In the context of the European project TELEIOS5, we aim at developing a fire monitoring service, that goes beyond operational systems currently deployed in various EO data centers, by building on Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies. In this demonstration we present the fire monitoring service that we have implemented using TELEIOS technologies focusing on its Semantic Web related functionality. The service implements a processing chain where raw satellite images are analyzed and hotspots (pixels of the image corresponding to geographic regions possibly on fire) are detected. The products of this analysis are encoded in RDF, so they can be combined with auxiliary linked geospatial data (eg, GeoNames, OpenStreetMap). By comparing detected hotspots with auxiliary data their accuracy can be determined. For example, hotspots lying in the sea are retrieved and marked as invalid. Additionally, we can combine diverse information sources and generate added-value thematic maps which are very useful to civil protection agencies and firefighting teams during emergency situations. In the rest of this demo paper we first describe in short the contributions of project TELEIOS. Then, we present the developed fire monitoring service and its advances compared to \u2026",

P2P-DIET offers a simple data model for the description of network resources based on attributes with values of type text. It also utilizes very efficient query processing algorithms based on indexing of resource metadata and queries. The capability of location-independent addressing is supported, which enables P2P-DIET clients to connect from anywhere in the network and use dynamic IP addresses. The features of stored notifications and rendezvous guarantee that all important information is delivered to interested clients even if they have been disconnected for some time. P2P-DIET has been developed on top of the Open Source mobile agent system DIET Agents and is currently been demonstrated as a file sharing application.",

In this paper, we focus on the Polar case which requires the selection of validation areas, the generation of a training dataset, the development and testing of deep learning algorithms, and the demonstration of regional results. During the development of deep learning algorithms, a key activity is to establish a large amount of referenced Earth Observation data. They need to be sufficiently diverse to cover the major target areas of satellite images under varying imaging conditions and across all seasons. For doing this, we propose to select overlapping target areas from Synthetic Aperture Radar and multispectral images acquired with rapid succession. Such a combination approach already demonstrated its applicability for monitoring seasonal snow cover. By applying an already established active learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine with relevance feedback, we can limit ourselves to a limited number of typical satellite images to extract their information content, and to generate semantic annotations for them. This approach is also a simple way to generate benchmarking datasets that can be used for testing and validating different algorithms, and for creating additional bigger datasets for large-scale demonstrations. The proposed methodology uses new paradigms from Recurrent Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks, supported by \u2026",

We focus on the management of content and resources in such systems. Our goal is to harness all available resources in the P2P network so that the users can access all available content efficiently. Efficiency is taken both from (i) the point of view of the system, in that we strive to ensure fair load distribution among all peer nodes, and (ii) from the point of view of the users, in that we strive to ensure low user-request response times.We propose a novel architecture for this new class of applications, which differs drastically from what is either found currently in existing products or proposed in academia. We contribute and study novel solutions that achieve our goals, while at the same time addressing the formidable challenges due to the autonomy of peers, their heterogeneous processing and storage capacities, their different content contributions, the huge system scale, and the highly dynamic system environment.",

In addition to democratizing ER techniques, JedAI goes beyond the other ER tools by offering a series of unique characteristics: (i) It allows for building and benchmarking millions of ER pipelines.

The combination of the publish/subscribe scenario with the peerto-peer (P2P) approach of autonomous peers makes high demands on the scalability and the efficiency of such a given highly distributed network. However, we are sure that a peer is not interested in getting notified about all published documents or events but rather in the most interesting ones. In this paper, we present our approach of an approximate publish/subscribe search system for continuous queries that is high scalable, efficient, and notifies the subscribers about the most interesting publications. Our work builds up a distributed global directory containing information about the peer behavior. The directory is leveraged to combine the current peer state and the predict of the future publishing behavior of a peer to send a subscription to the most promising peers in the network. We show experiments that confirm our idea that current and predicted peer behavior play a critical role in achieving a satisfying notification level.",

            "Abstract": "Much information of interest to humans is today available on the Web. People can easily gain access to information but at the same time, they have to cope with the problem of information overload. Consequently they rely on specialised tools and systems designed for searching, querying and retrieving information from the Web. It is however extremely difficult to stay informed without sifting through enormous amounts of incoming information, and without utilising tools and techniques that would capture the dynamic nature of the Web. The selective dissemination of information is a mechanism that can help users cope with this problem. In a selective information dissemination scenario, users post profiles or long-standing queries, which describe their information needs to some dedicated middleware. This middleware receives incoming information, decides whether it matches stored user profiles and delivers it to the interested subscribers. In this work we deal with the problem of textual information dissemination in the context of distributed peer-to-peer systems. We put our main focus on data models and query languages especially designed for information dissemination, when information is in the form of text. We incrementally develop three such models and query languages moving from very simple ones to ones with more expressive power. We also identify problems that frequently arise in such a scenario and study their computational complexity. Finally we design, implement and experimentally evaluate two algorithms for the problem of filtering as it arises in textual information dissemination.",

Our goal is to develop algorithms that scale to large amounts of RDF data, distribute the query processing load evenly and incur little network traffic. We present and evaluate two novel query processing algorithms with these possibly conflicting goals in mind. We discuss the various tradeoffs that occur in our setting through a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms.",

The wealth of business opportunities promised by P2P networks has gene-ted much industrial interest recently, and has resulted in the creation of various industrial projects, startup companies, and special interest groups. Researchers from distributed computing, networks, agents and databases have also become excited about the P2P vision, and papers tackling open problems in this area have started appearing in high-quality conferences and workshops. Much of the recent research on P2P systems seems to be carried out by-search groups with a primary interest in distributed computation and networks. This workshop concentrated on the impact that current database research can have on P2P computing and vice versa. Although researchers in distributed data structures and databases have been working on related issues for a long time, the developed techniques are simply not adequate for the new paradigm.",

They involve such a large volume of user-generated content that their users suffer from an information deluge. To address it, numerous recommendation methods have been proposed to organize the posts a user receives according to her interests. The content-based methods typically build a text-based model for every individual user to capture her tastes and then rank the posts in her timeline according to their similarity with that model. Even though content-based methods have attracted lots of interest in the data management community, there is no comprehensive evaluation of the main factors that affect their performance.

One class of application for which sensor data is pertinent is environmental decision support systems, e.g. flood emergency response. However, in order to interpret the readings from the sensors, the data needs to be put in context through correlation with other sensor readings, sensor data histories, and stored data, as well as juxtaposing with maps and forecast models. In this paper we use a flood emergency response planning application to identify requirements for a semantic sensor web. We propose a generic service architecture to satisfy the requirements that uses semantic annotations to support well-informed interactions between the services. We present the SemSor-Grid4Env realisation of the architecture and illustrate its capabilities in the context of the example application.",

For example, the multi-mission data archive of the TELEIOS partner German Aerospace Center (DLR) is expected to reach 2PB next year, while ESA estimates that it will be archiving 20PB of data before the year 2020. As the volume of data in satellite archives has been increasing, so have the scientific and commercial applications of EO data. Nevertheless, it is estimated that up to 95% of the data present in existing archives has never been accessed, so the potential for increasing exploitation is very big.",

In this work, we introduce a batch algorithm that simultaneously computes all topological relations and define the task of Progressive Geospatial Interlinking, which produces results in a pay-as-you-go manner when the available computational or temporal resources are limited.

To verify our approach, we evaluate the proposed protocols experimentally using thousands of nodes, millions of user subscriptions, and two different real-life corpora. We also study three important facets of the load-balancing problem in such a scenario and present a novel algorithm that manages to distribute the load evenly among the nodes.

Based on blocking and Meta-blocking, JedAI Toolkit implements an end-to-end ER workflow for both relational and RDF data. However, its bottleneck is the time-consuming procedure of Meta-blocking, which iterates over all comparisons in each block. To accelerate it, we present a suite of parallelization techniques that are suitable for multi-core processors.

Semantically-enabled search engines, generally accessible through Web portals, have been developed.

The resulting blocks can be restructured by Meta-blocking to raise precision at a limited cost in recall. At the core of this procedure lies the blocking graph, where the nodes correspond to entities and the edges connect the comparable pairs. There are several configurations for Meta-blocking, but no hints on best practices. In general, the node-centric approaches are more robust and suitable for a series of applications, but suffer from low precision, due to the large number of unnecessary comparisons they retain.In this work, we present three novel methods for node-centric Meta-blocking that significantly improve precision. We also introduce a pre-processing method that restricts the size of the blocking graph by removing a large number of noisy edges. As a result, it reduces the overhead time of Meta \u2026",

Each time a new tuple is inserted, the network nodes have to cooperate to check if this tuple can contribute to the satisfaction of a query when combined with previously inserted tuples. We propose a series of algorithms that initially index queries at network nodes using hashing. Then, they exploit the values of join attributes in incoming tuples to rewrite the given queries into simpler ones, and reindex them in the network where they might be satisfied by existing or future tuples.

            "Abstract": "Sensing devices are increasingly being deployed to monitor the physical world around us. One class of application for which sensor data is pertinent is environmental decision support systems, eg, flood emergency response. For these applications, the sensor readings need to be put in context by integrating them with other sources of data about the surrounding environment. Traditional systems for predicting and detecting floods rely on methods that need significant human resources. In this paper we describe a semantic sensor web architecture for integrating multiple heterogeneous datasets, including live and historic sensor data, databases, and map layers. The architecture provides mechanisms for discovering datasets, defining integrated views over them, continuously receiving data in real-time, and visualising on screen and interacting with the data. Our approach makes extensive use of web service standards for querying and accessing data, and semantic technologies to discover and integrate datasets. We demonstrate the use of our semantic sensor web architecture in the context of a flood response planning web application that uses data from sensor networks monitoring the sea-state around the coast of England.

            "Abstract": "Redundant processing is a key problem in the translation of initial queries posed over an ontology into SQL queries, through mappings, as it is performed by ontology-based data access systems. Examples of such processing are duplicate answers obtained during query evaluation, which must finally be discarded, or common expressions evaluated multiple times from different parts of the same complex query. Many optimizations that aim to minimize this problem have been proposed and implemented, mostly based on semantic query optimization techniques, by exploiting ontological axioms and constraints defined in the database schema. However, data operations that introduce redundant processing are still generated in many practical settings, and this is a factor that impacts query execution. In this work we propose a cost-based method for query translation, which starts from an initial result and uses information \u2026",

The first application is a re-engineering of Diavgeia, the Greek government portal for open and transparent public administration. The second application is Nomothesia, a new portal that we have built, which makes Greek legislation available on the Web as linked data to enable its effective use by citizens, legal professionals and software developers who would like to build new applications that utilize Greek legislation. The presented applications have been implemented without funding from any source and are available for free to any part of the Greek public sector that may want to use them. An important goal of this paper is to present the lessons learned from this effort.",

            "Abstract": "Much information of interest to humans is today available on the Web. People can easily gain access to information but at the same time, they have to cope with the problem of information overload. Consequently they rely on specialised tools and systems designed for searching, querying and retrieving information from the Web. It is however extremely difficult to stay informed without sifting through enormous amounts of incoming information, and without utilising tools and techniques that would capture the dynamic nature of the Web. The selective dissemination of information is a mechanism that can help users cope with this problem. In a selective information dissemination scenario, users post profiles or long-standing queries, which describe their information needs to some dedicated middleware. This middleware receives incoming information, decides whether it matches stored user profiles and delivers it to the interested subscribers. In this work we deal with the problem of textual information dissemination in the context of distributed peer-to-peer systems. We put our main focus on data models and query languages especially designed for information dissemination, when information is in the form of text. We incrementally develop three such models and query languages moving from very simple ones to ones with more expressive power. We also identify problems that frequently arise in such a scenario and study their computational complexity. Finally we design, implement and experimentally evaluate two algorithms for the problem of filtering as it arises in textual information dissemination.",

Our language, called RUL, ensures that the execution of the update primitives on nodes and arcs neither violates the semantics of the RDF model nor the semantics of the given RDFS schema. In addition, RUL supports fine-grained updates at the class and property instance level, set-oriented updates with a deterministic semantics and takes benefit of the full expressive power of RQL for restricting the range of variables to nodes and arcs of RDF graphs.",

The main objective of OntoGrid is to work towards the realization of a Semantic Grid. 2 In the context of OntoGrid, the work of the Technical University of Crete concentrates on the implementation of Atlas, a P2P system for the distributed storage and querying of RDF (S) metadata describing OntoGrid resources eg, services. We use state of the art DHT technology [1] to design and implement a distributed system that will be able to scale to hundreds of thousands of nodes and to large amounts of RDF (S) data and queries. Nodes in an Atlas network are organized under the Bamboo DHT protocol [5]. Nodes can enter RDF (S) data into the network and pose RQL queries. Two kinds of querying functionality are supported by Atlas: one-time querying and publish/subscribe. Each time a node poses a one-time query, the network nodes cooperate to find RDF (S) data that form the answer to the query. In the publish/subscribe scenario, a node can subscribe with a continuous query. A continuous query is indexed somewhere in the network and each time matching RDF (S) data is published, nodes cooperate to notify the subscriber. A high level view of the Atlas architecture is shown in Figure 1. A simple scenario in which Atlas can be used for service discovery in OntoGrid is as follows. When an OntoGrid node has a service that it wishes to make available to the rest of the network, it creates and publishes RDF metadata about this service using a service description \u2026",

Our basic assumption in this paper is that Semantic Grid resources (eg, machines, services or ontologies) will be annotated by RDF (S) metadata. Metadata pervades the Semantic Grid and is used to describe Grid resources, the environment, provenance and trust information etc.[13]. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) and RDF Schema (RDFS) are frameworks for representing information about Web resources. RDF (S) consists of W3C recommendations that enable the encoding, exchange and reuse of structured metadata, providing the means for publishing both human-readable and machine-processable information and vocabularies for semantically describing things on the Web.

Together with legacy data sources, specialized software modules (eg, modules performing mathematical modeling and simulation) and current Web 2.0 technologies such as mashups, deployed sensor networks give us the opportunity to develop unique applications in a variety of sectors (environment, agriculture, health, transportation, surveillance, public security etc.). The terms Sensor Internet, Sensor Web and Sensor Grid have recently been used to refer to the combination of sensor networks and other technologies (Web, service-oriented, Grid and database) with the view of addressing this opportunity.Previous Sensor Internet, Sensor Web and Sensor Grid proposals make very little use of semantics (eg, they do not use semantic annotations, metadata, ontologies etc.) and, in fact, whenever these proposals do refer to semantic concepts, they do so in an unprincipled and non-systematic way. On the contrary, the use of explicit semantics for Web and Grid resources as pioneered by many Semantic Web and Semantic Grid projects enables us to overcome the heterogeneity of data and resources, and to improve tasks like data sharing, service discovery and composition etc.",

            "Abstract": "Microblogging platforms constitute a popular means of real-time communication and information sharing. They involve such a large volume of user-generated content that their users suffer from an information deluge. To address it, numerous recommendation methods have been proposed to organize the posts a user receives according to her interests. The content-based methods typically build a text-based model for every individual user to capture her tastes and then rank the posts in her timeline according to their similarity with that model. Even though content-based methods have attracted lots of interest in the data management community, there is no comprehensive evaluation of the main factors that affect their performance. These are: (i) the representation model that converts an unstructured text into a structured representation that elucidates its characteristics, (ii) the source of the microblog posts that compose the user models, and (iii) the type of user's posting activity. To cover this gap, we systematically examine the performance of 9 state-of-the-art representation models in combination with 13 representation sources and 3 user types over a large, real dataset from Twitter comprising 60 users. We also consider a wide range of 223 plausible configurations for the representation models in order to assess their robustness with respect to their internal parameters. To facilitate the interpretation of our experimental results, we introduce a novel taxonomy of representation models. Our analysis provides novel insights into the performance and functionality of the main factors determining the performance of content-based recommendation in \u2026",

Geospatial data that is currently made available by government agencies usually do not follow the linked data paradigm.

In this paper we present the open source tool GeoTriples which generates and processes extended R2RML and RML mappings that transform geospatial data from many input formats into RDF. GeoTriples allows the transformation of geospatial data stored in raw files (shapefiles, CSV, KML, XML, GML and GeoJSON) and spatially-enabled RDBMS (PostGIS and MonetDB) into RDF graphs using well-known vocabularies like GeoSPARQL and stSPARQL, but without being tightly coupled to a specific \u2026",

However, apart from structural matching, it is considered equally important to deal with value-based predicates.

Structural matching is performed using automata, while we study different methods for evaluating value-based predicates. As a result, our algorithms scale in both the size of the query set and the number of the predicates per query. We perform an experimental evaluation and demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods in both a controlled environment of a cluster and on a real testbed provided by the PlanetLab network.",

Following ideas from incomplete information literature, we develop a semantics for this extension of RDF, called RDFi, and study query evaluation for SPARQL. We transfer the concept of representation systems from incomplete information in relational databases to the case of RDFi and identify two very important fragments of SPARQL that can be used to define a representation system for RDFi.

As the real-world entities represented in linked geospatial datasets evolve over time, the datasets themselves get updated and both the spatial and the temporal dimension of data become significant for users. For example, in the Earth Observation and Environment domains, data is constantly produced by satellite sensors and is associated with metadata containing, among others, temporal attributes, such as the time that an image was acquired.

At the moment, though, these data sources are not effectively supported by Semantic Web tools. To address variety and velocity, we propose Ontop4theWeb, a system that maps Web data of various formats into virtual RDF triples, thus allowing for querying them on-the-fly without materializing them as RDF. We demonstrate how Ontop4theWeb can use SPARQL to uniformly query popular, but heterogeneous Web data sources, like HTML tables and Web APIs. We showcase our approach in a number of use cases, such as Twitter, Foursquare, Yelp and HTML tables.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we present the system Ontop-spatial that is able to answer GeoSPARQL queries on top of geospatial relational databases, performing on-the-fly GeoSPARQL-to-SQL translation using ontologies and mappings. GeoSPARQL is a geospatial extension of the query language SPARQL standardized by OGC for querying geospatial RDF data. Our approach goes beyond relational databases and covers all data that can have a relational structure even at the logical level. Our purpose is to enable GeoSPARQL querying on-the-fly integrating multiple geospatial sources, without converting and materializing original data as RDF and then storing them in a triple store. This approach is more suitable in the cases where original datasets are stored in large relational databases (or generally in files with relational structure) and/or get frequently updated.",

In a continuous query scenario network nodes subscribe with long-standing queries and receive answers whenever RDF triples satisfying their queries are published. We present two novel query processing algorithms for this scenario and analyze their properties formally. Our performance goal is to have algorithms that scale to large amounts of RDF data, distribute the storage and query processing load evenly and incur as little network traffic as possible. We discuss the various performance tradeoffs that occur through a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms.",

Previous research has come up with models to capture cardinal direction relations for typical GIS data. In this paper, we target the problem of efficiently computing the cardinal direction relations between regions that are composed of sets of polygons and present two algorithms for this task. The first of the proposed algorithms is purely qualitative and computes, in linear time, the cardinal direction relations between the input regions. The second has a quantitative aspect and computes, also in linear time, the cardinal direction relations with percentages between the input regions. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methodologies. The algorithms have been implemented and embedded in an actual system \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The RDF data model has emerged as the most prominent way to interlink and exchange data on the Web due to its simplicity in the form of subject predicate object statements, but this simplicity comes with the cost of having to execute a large number of joins in order to get the desirable query results. Numerous approaches exist that aim to treat this problem, mainly focusing on disk based storage. In this work we consider a main memory setting and present a physical design and query method aiming to exploit spatial locality for efficient in-memory processing. Our design is also amenable to straightforward parallelization, something crucial for main memory database systems. Specifically, we present a join implementation that allows to achieve any desired degree of parallelism on arbitrary join queries and RDF graphs stored in memory using compact vertical partitioning. We use an adaptive join processing approach, such that we take advantage of complete or even partial ordering of RDF data, which is compactly stored in order to increase spatial locality and keep memory consumption low, coupled with an ID-to-Position vector index used when ordering does not allow for efficient scanning of the input relation. We have implemented an in-memory prototype that experimentally shows the efficiency and scalability of our proposal, taking advantage of continuously growing sizes of main memory and multi-core environments of modern hardware. Specifically, we show that for a machine with 128 GB of main memory and 16 cores, which is a reasonable amount for an average modern server, our prototype can store and query RDF graphs with up to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The paradigm of data sharing peer-to-peer systems has recently become a hot area of research due to the popularity of file sharing applications such as Napster, Gnutella and KazaA that adopt the \u201cinformation pull\u201d model. Peerto-peer systems exhibit many interesting features like adaptivity, load balancing, self-organization, fault-tolerance and the ability to pool together large amounts of resources and put them at the disposal of a large community of users. In the last few years, the publish-subscribe paradigm has also emerged as a very promising one for the development of Internet applications concentrating on the \u201cinformation push\u201d model.This dissertation presents the design and development of P2P-DIET, a peerto-peer service that unifies the above two paradigms. The service has been implemented using the mobile agent system DIET Core developed in project DIET. Our service supports queries, subscriptions and notifications in a single unifying framework, and can be used for building various peer-to-peer applications like file sharing, e-commerce, and information dissemination over the Web. P2P-DIET contains a fault-tolerance mechanism that guarantees connectivity, when nodes of the network fail or leave silently. The capability of locationindependent addressing is supported, which enables the use of dynamic IP addresses. Because of this capability, nodes can disconnect and reconnect with a different address and at different parts of the network. To demonstrate P2P-DIET, a file sharing application was implemented on top of it.",

We experiment with this dataset and evaluate a battery of advanced methods and classifiers, ranging from traditional machine learning and RNN-based methods to state-of-the-art Transformer-based methods. We show that recurrent architectures with domain-specific word embeddings offer improved overall performance while being competitive even to transformer-based models. Finally, we show that cutting-edge multilingual and monolingual transformer-based models brawl on the top of the classifiers' ranking, making us question the necessity of training monolingual transfer learning models as a rule of thumb. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the task of Greek legal text classification is considered in an open research project, while also Greek is a language with very limited NLP resources in general.",

Temporal constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) have been proved to be a robust framework. Specific results about temporal CSPs have often provided the motivation for deriving general results about CSPs. Temporal CSPs have been studied in depth, not only because of intellectual curiosity, but mostly because of their importance for applications such as planning, scheduling, temporal databases and others mentioned above. In many cases, the problems studied come straight from the application front and developed solutions are immediately put into practical use. The chapter also introduces the most influential temporal reasoning formalisms based on constraint networks that have been proposed in the literature and relevant algorithmic problems \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A plethora of Earth Observation data that is becoming available at no charge in Europe and the US recently reflects the strong push for more open Earth Observation data. Linked data is a paradigm which studies how one can make data available on the Web, and interconnect it with other data with the aim of making the value of the resulting \u201cWeb of data\u201d greater than the sum of its parts. Open Earth Observation data that are currently made available by space agencies such as ESA and NASA are not following the linked data paradigm. Therefore, Earth Observation data and other kinds of geospatial data that are necessary for a user to satisfy her information needs can only be found in different data silos, where each silo may contain only part of the needed data. Publishing the content of these silos as RDF graphs, enables the development of data analytics applications with great environmental and financial value. In this paper we present the tool GeoTriples that allows for the transformation of Earth Observation data and geospatial data into RDF graphs. GeoTriples goes beyond the state of the art by extending the R2RML mapping language to be able to deal with the specificities of geospatial data. GeoTriples is a semi-automated tool that allows the publication of geospatial information into an RDF graph using the state of the art vocabularies like GeoSPARQL and stSPARQL, but at the same time it is not tightly coupled to a specific vocabulary.",

The architecture enables the publication and querying of both stored (e.g. database) and streaming (e.g. sensor) data to support the rapid development of applications for environmental monitoring. Significant benefits are provided by the use of semantic technology for service discovery and data integration. The infrastructural backbone of the architecture is provided by four service-oriented services: Stored Data Service for the publication of databases, Streaming Data Service for the publication of sensor data, Registration and Discovery Service to enable resources to found, and Integration and Querying Service to enable multiple data sources to be accessed through a single model. These services will be supplemented with application domain specific services which may offer RESTful interfaces.",

In this paper we built on the experience gained with P2P-DIET and the Edutella P2P infrastructure and present the first implementation of a P2P publish/subscribe system supporting metadata and a query language based on RDF. We define formally the basic concepts of our system and present detailed protocols for its operation.

Such indexing schemes involve (i) main-memory trie-based data structures that cluster similar queries by capturing common elements between them and (ii) efficient filtering mechanisms that exploit this clustering to achieve high throughput and low filtering times. However, state-of-the-art indexing schemes are sensitive to the query insertion order and cannot adopt to an evolving query workload, degrading the filtering performance over time.

The use of partial path consistency has important practical consequences that we demonstrate with the implementation of the new reasoner PyRCC\u2207, which is developed by extending the state of the art reasoner PyRCC8. Given an RCC-8 network with only tractable RCC-8 relations, we show that it can be solved very efficiently with PyRCC\u2207 by making its underlying constraint graph chordal and running path consistency on this sparse graph instead of the completion of the given network. In the same way, partial path consistency can be used as the consistency checking step in backtracking algorithms for \u2026",

Then, the user can go ahead and download files of interest. The complementary publish/subscribe (pub/sub) scenario has started receiving attention only recently [1, 7, 8, 10]. In a pub/sub, a user posts a continuous query or profile to the system to receive notifications whenever certain resources of interest are published (eg, when a song of Moby becomes available). Pub/sub can be as useful as ad-hoc querying in many target applications of P2P networks ranging from file sharing, to more advanced applications such as alert systems for digital libraries, e-commerce networks etc.In this demo paper we present the system P2P-DIET, a service that unifies \u2026",

Therefore, from the perspective of a user, the EO data and other kinds of geospatial data necessary to satisfy his or her information need can only be found in different data silos, where each silo may contain only part of the needed data.

            "Abstract": "A lot of geospatial data has become available at no charge in many countries recently. Geospatial data that is currently made available by government agencies usually do not follow the linked data paradigm. In the few cases where government agencies do follow the linked data paradigm (eg, Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom), specialized scripts have been used for transforming geospatial data into RDF. In this paper we present the open source tool GeoTriples which generates and processes extended R2RML and RML mappings that transform geospatial data from many input formats into RDF. GeoTriples allows the transformation of geospatial data stored in raw files (shapefiles, CSV, KML, XML, GML and GeoJSON) and spatially-enabled RDBMS (PostGIS and MonetDB) into RDF graphs using well-known vocabularies like GeoSPARQL and stSPARQL, but without being tightly coupled to a specific vocabulary. GeoTriples has been developed in European projects LEO and Melodies and has been used to transform many geospatial data sources into linked data. We study the performance of GeoTriples experimentally using large publicly available geospatial datasets, and show that GeoTriples is very efficient and scalable especially when its mapping processor is implemented using Apache Hadoop.\u00a9 2018 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",

Multi-agent systems can be created that support decentralisation, scalability and adaptability.

In our case, we are mainly interested in cartographic ice maps generated from selected single images as well as time series of overlapping ice cover images of the Arctic region that can be derived either from polarized synthetic aperture radar images (in case of Sentinel-1) or from multispectral optical images (in case of Sentinel-2 that includes infrared bands). Therefore, in the following, we will concentrate on the selection of appropriate classification algorithms, where the goal of our ice cover analysis is the routine generation of multi-class thematic maps that can be used for the analysis of snow and ice cover phenomena, and for the monitoring of shipping routes. In both cases, we have to interpret large-scale target areas with discernible brightness levels and neighborhood contrast for cold (fresh) or melting (old) ice, snow cover, seawater and local water leads, ships, coastlines, and icebergs.",

            "Abstract": "Recent digitization efforts made archival content more available and even searchable through the Web. History researchers use this content for studying past events in relation to general historiographical issues, which may involve politics, society, ethics, and others. However, for locating relevant content the researchers need to know the terminology used for the topic of interest in the past. This problem is crucial for history researchers, because it affects the time and quality of their work. Another problem of great importance when dealing with the archival content is multilingualism. Simple translation is not enough to identify a relevant term in other language, because a term may undergo different changes in different social or cultural contexts. In order to address these challenges, the EU-funded project Papyrus aims to develop tool support for cross-disciplinary information retrieval of news content for historical research. To model both disciplines, ie history and news, we developed two ontologies. The News ontology reflects the perspective of news professionals on digital archives using the NewsML-G2 standard. Whereas the History ontology models the history perspective on the events and topics covered by the news. The History ontology is based on the CIDOC Concept Reference Model that embraces several standards of modeling information in the cultural heritage domain. To provide a means of communication between these two disciplines, we use mappings that establish correspondences between the News and History ontologies.

The resulting blocks can be restructured by Meta-blocking in order to significantly increase precision at a limited cost in recall. Yet, its processing can be time-consuming, while its precision remains poor for configurations with high recall. In this work, we propose new meta-blocking methods that improve precision by up to an order of magnitude at a negligible cost to recall. We also introduce two efficiency techniques that, when combined, reduce the overhead time of Metablocking by more than an order of magnitude. We evaluate our approaches through an extensive experimental study over 6 realworld, heterogeneous datasets. The outcomes indicate that our new algorithms outperform all meta-blocking techniques as well as the state-of-the-art methods for block processing in all respects.",

In addition to material produced by professionals (eg, maps), the public has also been encouraged to make geospatial content, including their geographical location, available online. The volume of such user-generated geospatial content is constantly growing. Similarly, the Linked Open Data cloud includes an increasing number of data sources with geospatial properties.The geo-referencing of Web resources and users has given rise to various services and applications that exploit it. With the location of users being made available widely, new issues such as those pertaining to security and privacy arise. Likewise, emergency response, context sensitive user applications, and complex GIS tasks all lend themselves toward Geospatial Semantic Web solutions.",

To address this, we developed the Prod-Trees platform 1 [2], a semantically enabled search engine for EO products. Users guide their search through a number of ontologies related to EO domain. To facilitate users in finding terms that fit better to their needs, we created mappings between these ontologies. In this paper, we present Pythia, an ontology matching system that utilizes and combines various matching techniques [1, 3, 4] to create mappings between two ontologies. Pythia is a combination of a string-based technique utilizing Apache Lucene\u2019s features, a language-based technique based on WordNet, and a graph-based technique that uses the structure of the ontology and the mappings produced by the two previous techniques. The system supports SKOS ontologies. Therefore, the mappings are also expressed in SKOS using the defined properties for matching concepts: skos: exactMatch, skos: relatedMatch, skos: broadMatch, and skos: narrowMatch. Based on these, we create four different types of mappings. A terminological matcher is responsible for implementing the string-and language-based techniques, both applied on the concepts labels (skos: prefLabel, skos: altLabel and skos: hiddenLabel). The mappings created by this component can either be skos: exactMatch or skos: relatedMatch. The string-based technique uses Lucene for indexing and searching. With Lucene, one can create documents and add fields of a specific type to these documents. When searching the documents, the user can specify which field he wants to search.

            "Abstract": "Link Discovery is a new research area of the Semantic Web which studies the problem of finding semantically related entities lying in different knowledge bases. This area has become more crucial recently, as the volume of the available Linked Data on the web has been increasing considerably. Although many link discovery tools have been developed, none of them takes into consideration the discovery of spatial or temporal relations, leaving datasets with such characteristics weakly interlinked and therefore disallowing the exploitation of the rich information they provide. In this paper, we propose new methods for Spatial and Temporal Link Discovery and provide the first implementation of our techniques based on the well-known framework Silk. Silk, enhanced with the new features, allows data publishers to generate a wide variety of spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal relations between their data and other Linked Open Data, dealing effectively with the common heterogeneity issues of such data. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate our implementation by using it in a real-world scenario and demonstrate that it discovers accurately all the existing links in a time efficient and scalable way.",

At first, we study three measures of fairness for resource allocation (the fairness index, majorization and max-min fairness) and analyze their relationship. Then, we consider a very simple model of resource allocation where we have a single resource that comes in indivisible quantities represented by integers, and needs to be allocated fairly among n agents. We adopt the fairness index as our measure of fairness for this problem, and study centralized algorithms for its solution. It turns out that our problem is very close to number partitioning, one of the six basic NP-complete problems in the standard book by Garey and Johnson. We discuss the relationship of these two problems and devise a greedy algorithm that runs in polynomial time and a complete anytime algorithm that runs in exponential time. We study the phase transition behaviour of these algorithms and demonstrate that the greedy one actually performs very well and returns almost perfectly fair allocations. Finally, we consider the hierarchical P2P content-sharing system CLUSTER and revisit its resource allocation algorithms in the light of the above results. We show how to devise a centralized complete anytime algorithm for a more complicated resource allocation problem in CLUSTER: fair allocation of load. We study the phase transition behaviour of this algorithm and compare it with the greedy algorithm MaxFair, proposed by the inventors of CLUSTER.",

Then we consider progressively more expressive classes of cardinal direction relations and give composition algorithms for these classes. Our theoretical framework allows us to prove formally that our algorithms are correct.

We present a novel algorithm, called recursive join (RJoin), that takes into account various parameters crucial in a distributed setting ie, network traffic, query processing load distribution, storage load distribution etc. The key idea of RJoin is incremental evaluation: as relevant tuples arrive continuously, a given multi-way join is rewritten continuously into a join with fewer join operators, and is assigned continuously to different nodes of the network. In this way, RJoin distributes the responsibility of evaluating a continuous multi-way join to many network nodes by assigning parts of the evaluation of each binary join to a different node depending on the values of the join attributes. The actual nodes to be involved are decided by RJoin dynamically after taking into account the rate of incoming tuples with \u2026",

The EDBT series of conferences is an established and prestigious forum for the exchange of the latest research results in data management. Held every two years in an attractive European location, the conference provides unique opp-tunities for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore new ideas, techniques, and tools, and to exchange experiences. The previous events were held in Venice, Vienna, Cambridge, Avignon, Valencia, Konstanz, and Prague. EDBT 2004 had the theme \u201cnew challenges for database technology,\u201d with the goal of encouraging researchers to take a greater interest in the current exciting technological and application advancements and to devise and address new research and development directions for database technology. From its early days, database technology has been challenged and advanced by new uses and applications, and it continues to evolve along with application requirements and hardware advances. Today\u2019s DBMS technology faces yet several new challenges. Technological trends and new computation paradigms, and applications such as pervasive and ubiquitous computing, grid computing, bioinformatics, trust management, virtual communities, and digital asset management, to name just a few, require database technology to be deployed in a variety of environments and for a number of di? erent purposes. Such an extensive deployment will also require trustworthy, resilient database systems, as well as easy-to \u2026",
