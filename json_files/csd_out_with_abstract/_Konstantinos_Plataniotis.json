The framework uses robust vector median filtering to generate a root sigLnal which is an image obtained from the input by repeatedly filtering it until no more changes occur. During the convergence to the root signal, the framework classifies the cDNA image data as either microarray spots or image background, and ideally separates the regular spots from the background. Thus, the obtained root signal represents the segmented microarray image. In addition, the framework excellently removes noise present in the cDNA microarray images and normalizes spots\u2019 intensities.",

            "Abstract": "An improved widely linear (WL) receiver is proposed for direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems that employ aperiodic spreading sequences with offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation. The modulation scheme generates improper complex multiple-access interference (MAI) and necessitates the use of WL receivers. Focus is on bandlimited pulse shapes and inherent cyclostationarity (CS) of the uncoded received signal. The enhanced WL receiver replaces the conventional chip-matched filter (CMF) with new filters that exploit the CS of the received signal through frequency-shifting. The proposed WL receiver is shown to outperform the classical strictly linear (SL) receiver when the interfering users are high-powered, which may exist to support high data rate services. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of the WL receiver over the SL \u2026",

However, it is not known how such representation might help animals to manage uncertainty in their decision making.

While application tasks serve as suitable benchmarks for real world problems, RL is seldomly used in practical scenarios consisting of abrupt dynamics. This allows one to rethink the problem setup in light of practical challenges. We present Trade Execution using Reinforcement Learning (TradeR) which aims to address two such practical challenges of catastrophy and surprise minimization by formulating trading as a real-world hierarchical RL problem. Through this lens, TradeR makes use of hierarchical RL to execute trade bids on high frequency real market experiences comprising of abrupt price variations during the 2019 fiscal year COVID19 stock market crash. The framework utilizes an energy-based scheme in conjunction with surprise value function for estimating and minimizing surprise. In a large-scale study of 35 stock symbols from the S&P500 index, TradeR demonstrates robustness to abrupt price changes and catastrophic losses while maintaining profitable outcomes. We hope that our work serves as a motivating example for application of RL to practical problems.",

This new scheme offers one more way to control the learner weakness while being very computationally efficient. Furthermore, the LDA learners are modified through regularization for protection against overfitting on the gallery set.

A typical example of an image resizing operation is image halving when M2 and N2 are halves of M1 and N1, respectively. Likewise, for image doubling, M2= 2M1 and N2= 2N1. The image resizing operation is required for various purposes such as display, storage, and transmission of images. While displaying an image, the resolution of the display devices imposes constraint on the maximum size of the display screen. Sometimes, the display interface provides for the scrolling of images in the display window. However, in many cases, it is preferred to get the image displayed as a whole. The resizing of images is essential in such cases. Similarly, insufficient bandwidth of a communication channel may demand smaller sizes of images for faster transmission of data.

In this paper a novel approach to the problem of edge preserving smoothing, which allows to break an image into a set of homogeneous regions, is proposed and evaluated. The new algorithm is based on the combined forward and backward anisotropic diffusion with incorporated time dependent cooling process. This method is able to efficiently remove image noise while preserving and enhancing image edges.

For example, one of the most common biometric questions is that of uniqueness\u2014for example, to what extent are fingerprints unique? From the point of view of identifiability, one may be interested in how much identifying information is available from a given technology, such as video surveillance. In the context of biometric fusion [1], one would like to be able to quantify (a) the biometric information in each system individually and (b) the potential gain from fusing the systems. Additionally, such a measure is relevant to biometric cryptosystems and privacy measures. Several authors have presented approaches relevant to this question. For example, Wayman [2] introduced a set of statistical approaches to measure the separability of Gaussian feature distributions using a \u201ccotton ball model.\u201d Another approach was developed by Daugman [3] to measure the information content of iris images based on the discrimination entropy [4], calculated directly from the match score distributions. Also, Golfarelli et al.[5] showed that the most commonly used feature representations of handgeometry and face biometrics have a limited number of distinguishable patterns, on the order of 105 and 103, respectively, as measured by a theoretical estimate of the equal error rate. Other authors have used informationtheoretic approaches, such as the approach of Ross and Jain [1] to biometric fusion. However, none of these methods approach measurement of information content of biometric data from an information-theoretic point of view.",

It is well-known that the distribution of face images, under a perceivable variation in viewpoint, illumination or facial expression, is highly non convex and complex. In addition, the number of available training samples is usually much smaller than the dimensionality of the sample space, resulting in the well documented \u201csmall sample size\u201d(SSS) problem. It is therefore not surprising that traditional linear feature extraction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis, often fail to provide reliable and robust solutions to FR problems under realistic application scenarios.In this research, pattern recognition methods are integrated with emerging machine learning approaches, such as kernel and boosting methods, in an attempt to overcome the technical limitations of existing FR methods.

For extracting face feature, we compute color vector differences between color pixels so that they can effectively capture change of face appearance (e.g., skin texture). Through comparative and extensive experiment using two public FER databases (DBs), we validate that our color texture features are suited to the sparse representation for improving FER accuracy. Specifically, our color texture features can considerably improve the recognition accuracy obtained by sparse representation compared with other features (e.g., Local Binary Pattern (LBP)) under realistic recognition conditions (e.g., low-resolution faces). It is also shown that the use of our features can yield high discrimination capability and sparsity, justifying the high recognition accuracies obtained. Further, the \u2026",

Since these positioning systems rely on radio features to locate a mobile, they are susceptible to non-cryptographic attacks resulting from malicious alteration of the propagation environment. This paper proposes a sensor selection scheme for increasing the resilience of fingerprinting-based positioning systems to RSS-based attacks in the context of wireless local area networks (WLAN). A distributed positioning scheme is proposed whereby an estimate is obtained from each WLAN access point (AP). Sensor selection is performed based on a nonparametric estimate of the Fisher information. Experimental results indicate superior performance compared to existing methods and graceful performance degradation in presence of RSS attacks.",

Since the number of defective nodes in a wireless sensor network is assumed to be small compared to the total number of nodes, the compressed sensing algorithm is used to detect the defective nodes also in the fusion center with a low communication cost.

Hence, its performance in EEG classification deteriorates if the number of training samples is small. To address this concern, a regularized CSP (R-CSP) algorithm is proposed, where the covariance-matrix estimation is regularized by two parameters to lower the estimation variance while reducing the estimation bias. To tackle the problem of regularization parameter determination, R-CSP with aggregation (R-CSP-A) is further proposed, where a number of R-CSPs are aggregated to give an ensemble-based solution.

The letter proposes a structure-induced complex Kalman filter framework with reduced communication overhead. In order to further reduce the local computations, the letter proposes a non-circularity criterion which allows each node to examine the non-circularity of its local observations. A local sensor node disregards its extra second-order statistical information when the non-circularity coefficient is small. In cases where the local observations are highly non \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative face recognition (FR) framework, improving the accuracy of face annotation by effectively making use of multiple FR engines available in an OSN. Our collaborative FR framework consists of two major parts: selection of FR engines and merging (or fusion) of multiple FR results. The selection of FR engines aims at determining a set of personalized FR engines that are suitable for recognizing query face images belonging to a particular member of the OSN. For this purpose, we exploit both social network context in an OSN and social context in personal photo collections. In addition, to take advantage of the availability of multiple FR results retrieved from the selected FR engines, we devise two effective solutions for merging \u2026",

This paper studies the complex-valued spectrum of the EEG signal recorded during mental imagery tasks, and provides a statistical model for the EEG spectral components. Motivated by the results of a recent work by the authors, this paper proposes a time-varying noncircularly-symmetric Gaussian model for complex-valued EEG spectrum during a mental imagery trial. It will be shown that the mean of this Gaussian model is constant over time, whereas its variance and pseudo-variance follow an autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) model \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Inverse Vandermonde matrix calculation is a long-standing problem to solve nonsingular linear system  where the rows of a square matrix  are constructed by progression of the power polynomials. It has many applications in scientific computing including interpolation, super-resolution, and construction of special matrices applied in cryptography. Despite its numerous applications, the matrix is highly ill-conditioned where specialized treatments are considered for approximation such as conversion to Cauchy matrix, spectral decomposition, and algorithmic tailoring of the numerical solutions. In this paper, we propose a generalized algorithm that takes arbitrary pairwise (non-repetitive) sample nodes for solving inverse Vandermonde matrix. This is done in two steps: first, a highly balanced recursive algorithm is introduced with  complexity to solve the combinatorics summation of the elementary symmetric polynomials; and second, a closed-form solution is tailored for inverse Vandermonde where the matrix' elements utilize this recursive summation for the inverse calculations. The numerical stability and accuracy of the proposed inverse method is analyzed through the spectral decomposition of the Frobenius companion matrix that associates with the corresponding Vandermonde matrix. The results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art solutions using specific nodes such as th roots of unity defined on the complex plane. A basic application in one dimensional interpolation problem is considered to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method for super-resolved signals.",

            "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality from cancer worldwide and has various histologic types, among which Lung Adenocarcinoma (LAUC) has recently been the most prevalent. Lung adenocarcinomas are classified as pre-invasive, minimally invasive, and invasive adenocarcinomas. Timely and accurate knowledge of the invasiveness of lung nodules leads to a proper treatment plan and reduces the risk of unnecessary or late surgeries. Currently, the primary imaging modality to assess and predict the invasiveness of LAUCs is the chest CT. The results based on CT images, however, are subjective and suffer from a low accuracy compared to the ground truth pathological reviews provided after surgical resections. In this paper, a predictive transformer-based framework, referred to as the \"CAE-Transformer\", is developed to classify LAUCs. The CAE-Transformer utilizes a Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE) to automatically extract informative features from CT slices, which are then fed to a modified transformer model to capture global inter-slice relations. Experimental results on our in-house dataset of 114 pathologically proven Sub-Solid Nodules (SSNs) demonstrate the superiority of the CAE-Transformer over the histogram/radiomics-based models and its deep learning-based counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 87.73%, sensitivity of 88.67%, specificity of 86.33%, and AUC of 0.913, using a 10-fold cross-validation.",

Until now, the available solutions have utilized a single remote sensor with long time periods to augment human perception. The use of multiple, possibly heterogeneous, networks of sensors distributed over large areas presents an interesting challenge for researchers specializing in this field. The question is the extent to which one can design multisensor processing tools that allow us to monitor larger areas for long time intervals, utilizing signals that can provide us with information at multiple resolution levels depending on the importance of events as defined by current assignments of mined historical data. This question is the subject of this special section on video and signal processing for surveillance networks and services, which highlights solutions based on techniques for multisensor data acquisition and processing. Surveillance systems are based on the strong interaction of these techniques, and their development requires multidisciplinary expertise (signal and image processing, computer vision, communications and networking, pattern recognition, and sensor development).",

            "Abstract": "Most consumer digital cameras use a single light sensor which captures color information using a color filter array (CFA). This produces a mosaic image, where each pixel location contains a sample of only one of three colors, either red, green or blue. The two missing colors at each pixel location must be interpolated from the surrounding samples in a process called demosaicking. The conventional approach to compressing video captured with these devices is to first perform demosaicking and then compress the resulting full-color video using standard methods. In this paper two methods for compressing CFA video prior to demosaicking are proposed. In our first method, the CFA video is directly compressed with the H.264 video coding standard in 4:2:2 sampling mode. Our second method uses a modified version of H.264, where motion compensation is altered to take advantage of the properties of CFA data \u2026",

Modifying the spatial arrangements of the binary components, the method produces color shares with varied both the spectral characteristics among the RGB components and the spatial correlation between the neighboring color vectors. Since encryption is done in the decomposed binary domain, there is no obvious relationship in the RGB color domain between any two color shares or between the original color image and any of the n shares.

Separable transforms such as separable 2DDCT are widely used for image compression in the JPEG standard; therefore, a similar framework for 2DLDA provides the corresponding parallel foundation for separable image feature extraction. There are existing 2DLDA methods providing a separable transformation, however they are not directly related to the 1DLDA solution. We will derive a 2DLDA method as a matrix-variate representation of a separable 1DLDA operator. Furthermore, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of 1DLDA.

For denoising 3D US volumes, sparse representation was employed, which has showed an excellent performance in reducing Gaussian noise. It has been well known that US images contain severe multiplicative speckle noise, which has different characteristics compared to the additive Gaussian noise.

Capsule networks (CapsNets), on the other hand, are capable of leveraging such information through their routing by agreement process, making them powerful architectures for small datasets, such as medical imaging ones. Within the domain of medical imaging problems, brain tumor classification is of paramount importance, due to the deadly nature of this cancer and the consequences of the tumor misclassification. In our recent works, we showed potentials of developing CapsNet architecture for the task of brain tumor type classification. Similar to other deep learning models, however, CapsNets do not capture prediction uncertainty (coming from the uncertainty in the model weights, which is significantly important in keeping the \u2026",

In addition, to facilitate the complementary effect of the selected color-component features for the purpose of color FR, they are combined using the proposed weighted feature fusion scheme. The effectiveness of our color FR method has been successfully evaluated on the following five public face databases (DBs): CMU-PIE, Color FERET, XM2VTSDB, SCface, and FRGC 2.0.

While many methods explore NAS from a global search-space perspective, the employed optimization schemes typically require heavy computational resources. This work introduces a method that is efficient in computationally constrained environments by examining the micro-search space of channel size. In tackling channel-size optimization, we design an automated algorithm to extract the dependencies within different connected layers of the network. In addition, we introduce the idea of knowledge distillation, which enables preservation of trained weights, admist trials where the channel sizes are changing. Further, since the standard performance indicators (accuracy, loss) fail to capture the performance of individual network components (providing an overall network evaluation), we introduce a novel metric that highly correlates with test accuracy and enables analysis of individual network layers. Combining dependency extraction, metrics, and knowledge distillation, we introduce an efficient searching algorithm, with simulated annealing inspired stochasticity, and demonstrate its effectiveness in finding optimal architectures that outperform baselines by a large margin.",

Therefore, our method can be considered as a spatio-spectral generalization of the conventional common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. In comparison to the similar solutions in the literature, such as filter-bank CSP (FBCSP) method, the proposed method benefits from joint processing of both spatial and spectral features, which improves the overall performance of the BCI while reducing its computational cost. Furthermore, our algorithm provides a simple measure that allows for ranking the discriminant power of extracted spatio-spectral features, which is not possible in FBCSP method \u2026",

In this paper, an atlas-based method to automatically segment an organ of interest in abdominal 3D ultrasound images is proposed. The atlas model contains texture information and shape knowledge of the organ, which facilitates an accurate discrimination of organ from non-organ voxels in input 3D ultrasound images.

In MIMO systems, space-time block code (STBC) utilizes the diversity of multiple antenna to mitigate deep fading [2]. Various coherent and differential STBC have been developed to optimize performance in terms of error probability or capacity [3\u201313]. However, perfect channel state information (CSI) is generally not available at the receiver, and differential demodulation substantially reduces the capacity and degrades detection performance [14]. Therefore, a joint channel estimation and data detection (CE/DD) scheme is often needed [3, 15\u201319].Due to the importance of estimation-assisted MIMO detection, a novel CE/DD procedure is proposed and analyzed in this report. Other MIMO CE/DD schemes have been discussed in [3, 17\u201319]. The schemes in [3, 18] estimate the channel using pilot training. They assume that the fading coefficients remain constant from one pilot matrix to the next. This assumption is even more restrictive than the quasi-static fading model where",

Building on the computed edge-sensing map and a refined color difference model, a new correlation-correction algorithm is introduced. Due to edge-sensing interpolation mechanism and correction steps performed for each color channel, the proposed interpolation scheme is able to overcome the limitations of existing CFA based image acquisition solutions and restore color images without introducing false colors, edge blurring or visual artifacts. Moreover, the proposed method is described in a novel vector notation, which readily unifies previously developed schemes. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed method is computationally efficient and yields excellent performance, in terms of subjective and objective image quality measures, while outperforming well-known and widely used CFA interpolation \u2026",

Using both the objective and subjective quality measures we aimed to compare the efficiency of the wavelet based lossy codecs DJVU and LWF with the DCT based standard JPEG compression method. For the experiments a set of 3 gray-scale and 3 color test images was used. The images were encoded at the same compression levels and standard objective quality measures were calculated for all images. For the visual assessment of the quality of the compressed images, a group of 100 male students evaluated them using a linear rating scale. The results have shown that there is no significant correlation between the objective and subjective quality measures. Although the wavelet based LWF codec outperformed significantly DJVU in terms of MSE and SNR, no significant differences in human visual perception of those images were observed. It was also observed that the histogram of the viewers preferences regarding the image compression ratio is bimodal and no optimal compression level could be established.",

Unlike existing LBP variants designed for linear data, the proposed descriptor, namely Hue-LBP, addresses the angular and periodic nature of hue and shows that color variation in the hue channel can be quantified by an angular variable in the range of [0,180]. By introducing the concept of color similarity as a metric to measure color variation, we obtain a histogram to describe local color texture patterns.

This paper presents a method for reducing the error in mobile terminal location estimation. A model-based dynamic filter is presented which uses an accurate model of mobile terminal motion to combine information from location measurements made at different time instances to create an improved location estimate. The model of mobile terminal motion has a kinematic state space model describing the physical rules governing terminal motion and a control model that describes the human control input into the motion process. The dependency between the terminal location and the control decisions is used to derive a new dynamic filter. This filter provides better accuracy than previously known location techniques and is robust to variations in the mobile terminal motion.",

In this paper, we propose a new approach for the semantic annotation of personal video content, taking advantage of user-contributed tags available in an image folksonomy. Video shots and folksonomy images are first represented by a semantic vector. Next, the semantic vectors are used to measure the semantic similarity between each video shot and the folksonomy images. Tags assigned to semantically similar folksonomy images are then used to annotate the video shots. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed annotation method, experiments were performed with video sequences retrieved from YouTube and images downloaded from Flickr. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to successfully annotate personal \u2026",

To that regard, inserting multiple frames between consecutive video frames are of paramount importance for the consumer electronics industry. State-of-the-art methods are iterative solutions interpolating one frame at the time. They introduce temporal inconsistencies and clearly noticeable visual artifacts.Departing from the state-of-the-art, this work introduces a true multi-frame interpolator. It utilizes a pyramidal style network in the temporal domain to complete the multi-frame interpolation task in one-shot. A novel flow estimation procedure using a relaxed loss function, and an advanced, cubic-based, motion model is also used to further boost interpolation accuracy when complex motion segments \u2026",

The scheme, which can be viewed as a cost-effective, private-key cryptosystem, encrypts the secret color image into two color shares with dimensions identical to those of the original secret input. Cryptographic operations performed at the bit levels are used to alter both the spectral correlation among the RGB color components and the spatial correlation of the neighboring color vectors in the secret image. The original image is decrypted with perfect reconstruction using inverse logical operations which are applied to the noise-like color shares. The scheme can be used in secure transmission of digital imaging material over untrusted networks or it can serve as stand-alone image encryption solution.",

This enhances structural content preservation and results in excellent color fidelity of the enlarged image. The proposed edge-sensing zooming algorithm preserves the structural content of the Bayer data and produces a sharp, enlarged output.

In H&E stained images, Hemaxotylin stains nuclei in cells blue/purple, and Eosin stains cytoplasm and connective tissues pink.

We showed that while our proposed model is trained on a relatively small dataset acquired from only one imaging center using a specific scanning protocol, the model performs well on heterogeneous test sets obtained by multiple scanners using different technical parameters. We also showed that the model can be updated via an unsupervised approach to cope with the data shift between the train and test sets and enhance the robustness of the model upon receiving a new external dataset from a different center. We adopted an ensemble architecture to aggregate the predictions from multiple versions of the model. For initial training and development purposes, an in-house dataset of 171 COVID-19, 60 CAP, and 76 Normal cases was used, which contained volumetric CT scans acquired from one imaging center using a constant standard radiation dose scanning protocol. To evaluate the model, we collected four different test sets retrospectively to investigate the effects of the shifts in the data characteristics on the model's performance. Among the test cases, there were CT scans with similar characteristics as the train set as well as noisy low-dose and ultra-low dose CT scans. In addition, some test CT scans were obtained from patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases or surgeries.

The present analysis also includes the effect of bandwidth and active mode duration on energy efficiency of popular modulation designs in the pass-band and Ultra-WideBand (UWB) categories. Experimental results show that among various pass-band and UWB modulation schemes, Non-Coherent M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (NC-MFSK) with small order of  and On-Off Keying (OOK) have significant energy saving compared to other schemes for short range scenarios, and could be considered as realistic candidates in WSNs.

            "Abstract": "Hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) is critical in training high performing Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Current methodologies fail to define an analytical response surface and remain a training bottleneck due to their use of additional internal hyper-parameters and lengthy evaluation cycles. We demonstrate that the low-rank factorization of the convolution weights of intermediate layers of a CNN can define an analytical response surface. We quantify how this surface acts as an auxiliary to optimizing training metrics. We introduce a dynamic tracking algorithm--autoHyper--that performs HPO on the order of hours for various datasets including ImageNet and requires no manual tuning. Our method--using a single RTX2080Ti--is able to select a learning rate within 59 hours for AdaM on ResNet34 applied to ImageNet and improves in testing accuracy by 4.93% over the default learning rate. In contrast to previous methods, we empirically prove that our algorithm and response surface generalize well across model, optimizer, and dataset selection removing the need for extensive domain knowledge to achieve high levels of performance.",

Many BLAST detectors require more receiver antennas than transmitter antennas. We propose two novel turbo-processing BLAST detectors that can operate in systems with fewer receiver antennas than transmitter antennas. Both detectors are based on the group-detection strategy. The first proposed detector, the reduced-dimension maximum a posteriori (RDMAP) detector uses a dynamically formed group for each bit decision, while the second proposed detector, the group maximum a posteriori (GMAP) uses a static grouping. For both detectors, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision is made using a group of transmitted symbols, and the remaining signal contribution is treated as interference.

We propose a new idea by combining 3D-Snake and Level-Set approaches to overcome ultrasound difficulties and maintain high accuracy to segment bleeding regions. The proposed approach starts with a denosing step. The 3D-Snake is resistive to boundaries' discontinuities, and therefore is applied to robustly extract the approximation of the volume of interest.

In this paper, we propose a new classification method by cascading a dictionary learning and the neural network to take the advantages of both methods. We use dictionary learning with efficient number of elements (DLENE) to extract discriminative features. We also use the proposed binomial classifier to detect kidneys in 3D ultrasound images.

            "Abstract": "Advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) have demonstrated data efficiency and optimal control over large state spaces at the cost of scalable performance. Genetic methods, on the other hand, provide scalability but depict hyperparameter sensitivity towards evolutionary operations. However, a combination of the two methods has recently demonstrated success in scaling RL agents to high-dimensional action spaces. Parallel to recent developments, we present the Evolution-based Soft Actor-Critic (ESAC), a scalable RL algorithm. We abstract exploration from exploitation by combining Evolution Strategies (ES) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). Through this lens, we enable dominant skill transfer between offsprings by making use of soft winner selections and genetic crossovers in hindsight and simultaneously improve hyperparameter sensitivity in evolutions using the novel Automatic Mutation Tuning (AMT). AMT gradually replaces the entropy framework of SAC allowing the population to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible, without making use of backpropagation updates. In a study of challenging locomotion tasks consisting of high-dimensional action spaces and sparse rewards, ESAC demonstrates improved performance and sample efficiency in comparison to the Maximum Entropy framework. Additionally, ESAC presents efficacious use of hardware resources and algorithm overhead. A complete implementation of ESAC can be found at karush17.github.io/esac-web/.",

            "Abstract": "This paper solves the gait recognition problem in a multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) framework. Gait sequences are naturally described as tensor objects and feature extraction for tensor objects is important in computer vision and pattern recognition applications. Classical principal component analysis (PCA) operates on vectors and it is not directly applicable to gait sequences. This work introduces an MPCA framework for feature extraction from gait sequences by seeking a multilinear projection onto a tensor subspace of lower dimensionality which captures most of the variance of the original gait samples. A subset of the extracted eigen-tensors are selected and the classical LDA is then applied. In experiments, gait recognition results are reported on the Gait Challenge data sets using the proposed solution. The results indicate that with a simple design, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state \u2026",

Local Binary Patterns feature extraction has low computation complexity and is thus used to reduce the overall processing speed.

Using the database, for the quantitative investigation, the facial expressions associated with visual discomfort were compared with basic emotional expressions that were well defined and universal.

HFSWR systems are characterized by the severely limited number of data samples available to train the adaptive filter. In this paper we report on investigations in applying low-complexity STAP algorithms to HFSWR systems. In particular we focus on applying such algorithms on HFSWR data cube measurements heavily corrupted by ionospheric clutter. We then reflect on the implications of the results.",

To combat isometry, one can employ extra knowledge of the channel, which is not readily available, or pilot symbols, which reduces the effective transmission rate. This paper analyses the problem of isometry, discusses the design of asymmetric signal constellations, and illustrates analytically and experimentally how the use of asymmetric signal constellations for initial symbols improve the system performance without incurring significant complexity.",

With the increase of devices and the need for the network to extend via fog computing, we have fog-based IoT networks. However, with more endpoints introduced to it, the network becomes open to malicious attackers. This work attempts to protect fog-based IoT networks by creating a platform that secures the endpoints through public-key encryption. The servers are allowed to mask the data packets shared within the network. To be able to track all of the encryption processes, we incorporated the use of permissioned blockchains. This technology completes the security layer by providing an immutable and automated data structure to function as a hyper ledger for the network. Each data transaction \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Recent advancements in signal processing (SP) and machine learning, coupled with electronic medical record keeping in hospitals and the availability of extensive sets of medical images through internal/external communication systems, have resulted in a recent surge of interest in radiomics. Radiomics, an emerging and relatively new research field, refers to extracting semiquantitative and/or quantitative features from medical images with the goal of developing predictive and/or prognostic models. In the near future, it is expected to be a critical component for integrating image-derived information used for personalized treatment. The conventional radiomics workflow is typically based on extracting predesigned features (also referred to as handcrafted or engineered features) from a segmented region of interest (ROI). Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have inspired trends toward deep-learning \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Hand-crafted radiomics has been used for developing models in order to predict time-to-event clinical outcomes in patients with lung cancer. Hand-crafted features, however, are pre-defined and extracted without taking the desired target into account. Furthermore, accurate segmentation of the tumor is required for development of a reliable predictive model, which may be objective and a time-consuming task. To address these drawbacks, we propose a deep learning-based radiomics model for the time-to-event outcome prediction, referred to as DRTOP that takes raw images as inputs, and calculates the image-based risk of death or recurrence, for each patient. Our experiments on an in-house dataset of 132 lung cancer patients show that the obtained image-based risks are significant predictors of the time-to-event outcomes. Computed Tomography (CT)-based features are predictors of the overall survival (OS), with the hazard ratio (HR \u2026",
