            "Abstract": "After administration of gadolinium, infarcted myocardium exhibits delayed hyperenhancement and can be imaged using an inversion recovery (IR) sequence. The performance of such a method when using magnitude\u2010reconstructed images is highly sensitive to the inversion recovery time (TI) selected. Using phase\u2010sensitive reconstruction, it is possible to use a nominal value of TI, eliminate several breath\u2010holds otherwise needed to find the precise null time for normal myocardium, and achieve a consistent contrast. Phase\u2010sensitive detection is used to remove the background phase while preserving the sign of the desired magnetization during IR. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the benefits of both phase\u2010sensitive IR image reconstruction and surface coil intensity normalization for detecting myocardial infarction (MI). The phase\u2010sensitive reconstruction method reduces the variation in \u2026",

A dose\u2013response curve was measured using T1 weighted images in 11 dogs. MnCl2 (36, 113, 360, and 3600 \u03bcmol) was infused over a period of 3 min.

No significant physiologic effects due to the infused MnCl2 were detected except at the highest dose where there was a cardiac depressive effect. Ischemia was induced by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery in 5 dogs. At an infused dose of 113 \u03bcmol, MnCl2 clearly demarcated the ischemic zone during coronary occlusion. Contrast enhancement in the ischemic zone was less than 30% compared with normal tissue (P < 0.03). In conclusion, the intracellular contrast agent MnCl2 enhances the canine heart \u2026",

Here, MRI physics is dealt with mostly in a descriptive manner, and simple mathematics are introduced only if necessary. The simple vector-based model for representing the magnetization is presented because it can deal with most aspects of MRI without the additional complexity of quantum mechanics. In this chapter, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal generation and its properties are discussed first. Subsequently, image formation in terms of localizing the NMR signal in three dimensions is presented.",

We used MRI to study the relation between intramural cardiac function and the extent of fibrosis in HCM. The aim of this study was to determine whether excess collagen or myocardial scarring, as determined by LGE MRI, are the primary mechanisms leading to heterogeneous regional contractile function in patients with HCM.Intramural left ventricular strain, transmural left ventricular function, and regions of myocardial fibrosis/scarring were imaged in 22 patients with HCM, using displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE), cine MRI, and LGE.

            "Abstract": "ObjectivesWe hypothesized that pre-gadolinium T1 CMR delineates the AAR in a similar manner to T2 imaging in acute myocardial infarction.MethodsImaging was performed 3 days after LAD occlusion-reperfusion in13 dogs. T2 and T1 maps were computed from pre-gadolinium CMR with T2-prepared SSFP (14 TE's of 16\u2013280 ms) and with IR-GRE (10 TIs of 71\u2013900 ms) respectively. The infarcted territory was defined by post-gadolinium delayed enhancement. Two observers evaluated the images for the involvement of a single coronary distribution, for graininess and border definition of different areas.ResultsA delayed contrast enhanced image (depicting the non-transmural infarct) and corresponding pre-gadolinium T2 and T1 maps (depicting the AAR) are shown in Figure 1. In the T2 map, the AAR is red whereas normal myocardium is green. The areas on the T1 map agree with those in the T2 map in terms of circumferential and transmural extent. The average T2 value of the infarct, the peri-infarct zone and remote myocardium were 72\u00b12, 57\u00b12 and 46\u00b13 ms respectively. The corresponding average T1 values were 1020\u00b118, 972\u00b118 and 879\u00b113. In all 13 cases the T1 maps exhibited better image quality than the T2 maps.",

Here, we show how a spatial gradient of myosin light chain phosphorylation across the heart facilitates torsion by inversely altering tension production and the stretch activation response.

However, dynamic fetal CMR is difficult due to the lack of direct in-utero cardiac gating. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a newly developed Doppler ultrasound (DUS) device in humans for fetal CMR gating. Fifteen fetuses (gestational age 30\u201339 weeks) were examined using 1.5 T CMR scanners at three different imaging sites. A newly developed CMR-compatible DUS device was used to generate gating signals from fetal cardiac motion. Gated dynamic balanced steady-state free precession images were acquired in 4-chamber and short-axis cardiac views. Gating signals during data acquisition were analyzed with respect to trigger variability and sensitivity. Image quality was assessed by measuring endocardial blurring (EB) and by image evaluation using a 4-point scale. Left ventricular (LV) volumetry was performed using the single-plane ellipsoid model.

The entire left ventricle was imaged at 1.5 T (Siemens) in contiguous short-axis slices with a Modified Look-Locker Inversion-recovery sequence for T1 mapping (Messroghli, JMRI, 2007), and a T2-prepared SSFP sequence for T2 mapping (Giri, JCMR, 2009). Myocardium at risk was defined as regions in the left ventricle which had a T1 or T2 value greater than 2SD from remote. In four dogs, hearts were excised and blood flow (ml/min/g) was determined by microsphere analysis in 16 sectors per short-axis slice for all short-axis slices in the left ventricle. Myocardium at risk was defined as regions in the left ventricle with a blood flow at occlusion less than 2SD from remote.ResultsGlobal myocardium at risk, expressed as percent of left ventricular mass (% LVM), showed similar results for T1 mapping compared to T2 mapping (n= 12, mean+/-SD difference 1.5+/-4.0% LVM, R2= 0.86, p< 0.001). On a slice-by-slice basis (n= 4 dogs, 34 slices), myocardium at risk was also similar for T1 and T2 mapping (difference 0.4+/-7.6% of slice, R2= 0.96, p< 0.001), T1 mapping corresponded to microsphere analysis (mean difference 2.0+/-12.8% of slice, R2= 0.90, p< 0.001), and T2 mapping corresponded to microsphere analysis (mean difference 1.6+/-13.8% of slice, R2= 0.86, p< 0.001).

The purpose of this study was the extraction of accurate T1 data through the utilization of comprehensive, parallel Simulations for QUAntifying RElaxation Magnetic Resonance constants (SQUAREMR) of the MOLLI pulse sequence on a large population of spins with physiologically relevant tissue relaxation constants. A CMR protocol consisting of different MOLLI schemes was performed on phantoms and healthy human volunteers. For every MOLLI experiment, the identical pulse sequence was simulated for a large range of physiological combinations of relaxation constants, resulting in a database of all possible outcomes. The unknown relaxation constants were then determined by finding the simulated signals in the database that produced the least squared difference to the measured signal intensities. SQUAREMR demonstrated improvement of accuracy in phantom studies and consistent mean T1 values and consistent variance across the different MOLLI schemes in humans. This was true even for tissues with long T1s and MOLLI schemes with no pause between modified-Look-Locker experiments. SQUAREMR enables quantification of T1 data obtained by existing clinical pulse sequences. SQUAREMR allows for correction of quantitative CMR data that have already been acquired whereas it is expected that SQUAREMR may improve data consistency and advance quantitative MR across imaging centers, vendors and experimental configurations.

A T1-weighted 3D gradient echo sequence was used: TR/TE= 20/3.0 ms, flip angle 30 degree, FOV 1.3 x1. 0x1. 0 cm, matrix 256x192x192, resolution 50x52x52 microns, 3 averages, 36 minutes of acquisition time per dataset. Histological slices were stained by Masson\u2019s trichrome to indicate the regions of myocardial infarction. Corresponding MR images were resliced in 3D to match the histological slices for qualitative comparison. Low resolution images were reconstructed post-hoc by using only 32 k-space lines and averaging 16 image slices to produce a voxel 2048 times larger than the original high resolution images (which is still> 100 times better than current clinical resolution). Quantification of infarct volume was performed by an automated program using a 50% intensity threshold between dark normal and bright enhanced voxels [4]. Additional volume measurements of contrast enhancement were performed by using a two standard deviations (2xSD) threshold above the normal voxel intensity. The peri-infarct border zone was defined as the voxel space between 2xSD and 50% threshold regions.

In experimental infarct validation studies the left ventricle is often sliced into thin slices and subsequently stained with TTC as a gold standard for infarct quantification. There is no single imaging slice in a 3D-MR data stack that exactly represents the photographed TTC-stained slice or whole slice microscopy as the photograph is of a surface. Therefore, we developed a method for post-processing 3D-MR data to depict the exact same surface as seen on a traditionally photographed myocardial slice.MethodsThe image analysis software Segment [1] v1. 9 (http://segment. heiberg. se) was used as a platform for implementing a script enabling MR-photography. The post-processing method was validated on ex-vivo contrast enhanced images rendered from an experimental chronic occlusion-reperfusion pig model (n= 8). In this model the hearts were explanted after seven days of reperfusion and the left ventricle sliced into 5 mm thin slices. The slices were then stained with TTC and subsequently imaged on 1.5 T Philips Achieva scanner using a high resolution T1 weighed MRI sequence (TE= 3.2 ms, TE= 2 ms, \u03b1= 70, isotropic resolution 0.5 mm). Using a manually defined threshold air was nulled for every pixel in the output image and the intensity one pixel below the detected tissue surface was taken.

            "Abstract": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can be used to calculate myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV) by relating the longitudinal relaxation rate in blood and myocardium before and after contrast-injection to hematocrit (Hct) in blood. Hematocrit is known to vary with body posture, which could affect the calculations of ECV. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that there is a significant increase in calculated ECV values if the Hct is sampled after the CMR examination in supine position compared to when the patient arrives at the MR department. Forty-three consecutive patients including various pathologies as well as normal findings were included in the study. Venous blood samples were drawn upon arrival to the MR department and directly after the examination with the patient remaining in supine position. A Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MOLLI) protocol was used to acquire mid-ventricular short-axis images before and after contrast injection from which motion-corrected T1 maps were derived and ECV was calculated. Hematocrit decreased from 44.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7% before to 40.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0% after the CMR examination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This resulted in a change in calculated ECV from 24.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8% before to 26.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2% after the CMR examination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). All patients decreased in Hct after the CMR examination compared to before except for two patients whose Hct remained the same. Variability in CMR-derived myocardial ECV can be reduced by standardizing the timing of Hct measurement relative to the CMR examination. Thus, a standardized acquisition of blood sample for Hct after the CMR examination \u2026",

Since mounting evidence suggests causal relationship between myocardial ischemia and major adverse cardiac events, we sought to investigate whether (1) regional myocardial perfusion is decreased in young HCM patients and in individuals at risk of HCM, and (2) hypoperfused areas are larger than areas with fibrosis. HCM patients (n = 12), HCM-risk subjects (n = 15) and controls (n = 9) were imaged on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Myocardial hypertrophy was assessed on cine images. Perfusion images were acquired during adenosine hyperemia and at rest. Maximum upslope ratios of perfusion (stress/rest) were used for semiquantitative analysis. Fibrosis was assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Results are presented as median and range \u2026",

A particularly useful class of methods for assessing the contractile function of the myocardial wall is displacement imaging. Magnetic resonance (MR) displacement imaging measures the change of position of tissue elements over a period of time starting from a reference time-point. In concept, it is similar to tracking the three-dimensional (3D) movement of implanted radio-opaque markers in cine fluoroscopy, but instead of using extraneous markers, controlled modulations of various aspects of tissue proton magnetization are utilized as noninvasive markers.

The aim was to develop the first advanced MR simulation platform delivered as a web service through an on-demand, scalable cloud-based and GPU-based infrastructure. We hypothesized that such an online MR simulation platform could be utilized as a virtual MRI scanner but also as a cloud-based, high-performance engine for advanced MR simulations in simulation-based quantitative MR (qMR) methods.   Methods and results The simulation framework of coreMRI was based on the solution of the Bloch equations and utilized a ground-up-approach design based on the principles already published in the literature. The development of a front-end environment allowed the connection of the end-users to the GPU-equipped instances on the cloud. The coreMRI simulation platform was based on a modular design where individual modules (such as the Gadgetron reconstruction framework and a newly developed Pulse Sequence Designer) could be inserted in the main simulation framework. Different types and sources of pulse sequences and anatomical models were utilized in this study revealing the flexibility that the coreMRI simulation platform offers to the users. The performance and scalability of coreMRI were also examined on multi-GPU configurations on the cloud, showing that a multi-GPU computer on the cloud equipped with a newer generation of GPU cards could significantly mitigate the prolonged execution times that accompany more realistic MRI and qMR simulations.

Contrast-enhanced steady-state free precession (CE-SSFP) is a recently developed cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) method for assessment of MaR up to 1 week after AMI. Our aim was to validate CE-SSFP for determination of MaR in an experimental porcine model using myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (MPS) as a reference standard and to test the stability of MaR-quantification over time after injecting gadolinium-based contrast. Eleven pigs were subjected to either 35 or 40 min occlusion of the left anterior descending artery followed by six hours of reperfusion. A technetium-based perfusion tracer was administered intravenously ten minutes before reperfusion. In-vivo and ex-vivo CE-SSFP CMR was performed followed by ex-vivo MPS imaging. MaR was expressed as % of left ventricular mass (LVM). There was good agreement between MaR by ex-vivo CMR and MaR by MPS (bias: 1\u2009\u00b1\u20093% LVM, r                            2\u2009=\u20090.92, p\u2009<\u20090.001), between ex-vivo and in-vivo CMR (bias 0\u2009\u00b1\u20092% LVM, r                            2\u2009=\u20090.94, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and between in-vivo CMR and MPS (bias -2\u2009\u00b1\u20093% LVM, r                            2\u2009=\u20090.87, p\u2009<\u20090.001. No change in MaR was seen over the first 30 min after contrast injection (p\u2009=\u20090.95). Contrast-enhanced SSFP cine CMR can be used to measure MaR, both in vivo and ex vivo, in a porcine model with good accuracy and precision over the first 30 min after contrast injection.

DeltaR1 maps (R1after-R1before contrast) were divided by the DeltaR1 value of the LV blood pool and multiplied by [1-hematocrit], yielding a quantitative pixel map of the ECV ranging from 0-100%.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can be used to assess MI by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and MaR by either T2-weighted imaging or contrast enhanced SSFP (CE-SSFP). Automatic segmentation algorithms have been developed and validated for MI by LGE as well as for MaR by T2-weighted imaging. There are, however, no algorithms available for CE-SSFP. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate automatic segmentation of MaR in CE-SSFP. The automatic algorithm applies surface coil intensity correction and classifies myocardial intensities by Expectation Maximization to define a MaR region based on a priori regional criteria, and infarct region from LGE. Automatic segmentation was validated against manual delineation by expert readers in 183 patients with reperfused acute MI from two multi-center randomized clinical trials (RCT) (CHILL-MI and MITOCARE) and against myocardial perfusion SPECT in an additional set (n\u2009=\u200916).

Quantitative MBF estimates were compared to microsphere reference using both AIF measurements.MethodsBoth the dual-sequence CMR perfusion technique [1] and the dual-bolus protocol [2] were performed in five canines and 35 clinical subjects using a 1.5 Tesla scanner. Gd-DTPA at 0.005 mmol/kg and 0.05 mmol/kg were administered during separate breath holds. Typical imaging parameters: 1 RR, 90 saturation pulse, 50 read out angle, saturation recovery 90 ms, TR 2.4 ms, TE 1.2 ms, matrix size 128x80. A low TE, low resolution FLASH image (TE 0.6 ms, matrix size 64x48) was acquired during each RR interval. AIF measured from the low-dose high-resolution (ie dual-bolus) image series and high-dose low-resolution (ie dual-sequence) image series were compared. Reference MBF measurements were obtained from the canine experiments with intracoronary adenosine infusion and microspheres injection. CMR derived MBF estimates were calculated separately using both AIF by a model-constrained deconvolution. Clinical CMR perfusion studies (35 rest and 35 stress) were also analyzed to compare the AIF from both techniques.ResultsMBF estimates from dual-bolus and dual-sequence CMR techniques matched well with the microspheres measurements (r= 0.89 and 0.88, figure-1). There was an excellent agreement between dual-bolus and dual-sequence MBF estimates (r= 0.98, figure-1).

T2-weighted CMR delineates the area at risk early after acute injury as well as two days post-infarction.

The area at risk was measured during the occlusion (within one hour from the onset of ischemia) by first-pass contrast perfusion (Gd-DTPA, 0.10 mmol/kg) performed on a Siemens Avanto 1.5 T scanner with a phased-array surface coil. Six hours post-reperfusion, 3\u20135 stacks of short-axis breath-held T2-weighted (DIR-TSE, TE= 56 or 66 ms) images were obtained covering the left ventricle. For each image position, 3\u20135 T2-weighted images were registered for motion, averaged and were surface coil intensity corrected.

Three different motion models were introduced in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging SIMULator (MRISIMUL) of this study: cardiac motion, respiratory motion and flow. Simulation of a simple Gradient Echo pulse sequence and a CINE pulse sequence on the corresponding anatomical model was performed. Myocardial tagging was also investigated. In pulse sequence design, software crushers were introduced to accommodate the long execution times in order to avoid spurious echoes formation. The displacement of the anatomical model isochromats was calculated within the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) kernel for every timestep of the pulse sequence. Experiments that would allow simulation of custom anatomical and motion models were also performed. Last, simulations of motion with MRISIMUL on single-node and multi-node multi-GPU systems were examined. Gradient Echo and CINE images of the three motion models were produced and motion-related artifacts were demonstrated.

We hypothesized that CMR would detect more UMI than ECG and that UMI by CMR would have prognostic significance.Methods and Results: The ICELAND MI substudy of the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) Study randomly recruited 675 participants; an additional 275 subjects with diabetes were also recruited. Of 936 subjects (age 67-94 yrs) receiving ECG and CMR scans, 49% were male, and 37% were diabetic.

            "Abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance is often used to provide detailed information on structures such as the myocardium, pericardium, pulmonary veins, and emanating great vessels. While blood travels throughout the heart and blood vessels, its signal may obscure the assessment of these structures depending on the clinical questions being addressed. Black blood imaging techniques seek to suppress the signal from blood and thereby improve delineation of cardiovascular anatomy. Fast spin echo-based sequences are in routine use for the suppression of blood flowing into the imaging plane. Such approaches have known limitations that may result in inadequate image quality or artifacts in the image. More recent advances have overcome some of these limitations, but it is incumbent upon the reader to recognize them as they occur. For instance, cardiac motion may lead to signal loss, and may be overcome by \u2026",

The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate chemical exchange site that could be developed for use as an exogenous chemical exchange dependent saturation transfer (CEST) contrast agent under physiological conditions. These agents would function by reducing the water proton signal through a chemical exchange site on the agent via saturation transfer. The ideal chemical exchange site would have a large chemical shift from water. This permits a high exchange rate without approaching the fast exchange limit at physiological pH (6.5\u20137.6) and temperature (37\u00b0C), as well as minimizing problems associated with magnetic field susceptibility.

Each perfusion study was acquired in a breath-hold and with single RR imaging interval. A segmented GRE-EPI sequence was used by the following parameters: 90 prep, 25 readout, TR 7.5 ms, TE 1.48 ms, 8 mm slice thickness, echo train length 4, acquisition matrix 128\u00d7 80\u201396, FOV 360\u00d7 270 mm. Time-signal intensity curves of the perfusion images were analyzed by dividing the myocardium into 6 sectors. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was estimated from LV input and myocardial output time-signal intensity curves by a Fermi model constrained deconvolution. Using MBF quantified from LV and myocardial curves at 1RR temporal resolution as a reference standard, we compared MBF estimated from 2RR and 3RR under-sampled time-signal intensity curves.ResultsFigure 1 shows an example of the LV input curve at 1RR that was under-sampled to 2RR and 3RR temporal resolutions. The shape of the curve was distorted noticeably at contrast arrival and peak contrast enhancement time points. At 3RR under-sampling, the LV curve only has 2 points above half height and clearly underestimates the peak. Figure 2 shows under-sampling has less severe effects in the myocardial curves.

Then, the setup was used for determining the magnetic field characteristics of a high-pass birdcage coil used for neonatal MR imaging with a vertical static field. The scattering parameter S21, converted into power ratio, was used for mapping the B1 magnetic field. The experimental measurements from the loop coil were close to the theoretical results (R = 0.924). A high degree of homogeneity was measured for the neonatal birdcage RF coil.
