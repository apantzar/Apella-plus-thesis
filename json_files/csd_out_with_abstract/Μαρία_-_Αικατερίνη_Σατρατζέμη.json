Although various tools, including Recommender Systems, have been developed to implement the notion of reusing Learning Designs, their adoption by teachers falls short of expectations. This paper investigates the results of providing explanations for Learning Design recommendations to teachers. To this end, we designed and implemented an explanatory mechanism incorporated into a Recommender System, which propose pre-existing Learning Designs to teachers. We then conducted a user-centric evaluation experiment. Overall, this study provides evidence that explanations should be incorporated into Recommender Systems that propose Learning Designs, as a way of improving the teacher \u2026",

However, despite the occurring changes and the current progress in the domain, computer programming is still a vital chapter within computer science, and its teaching remains a difficult endeavour. On the other hand, students have changed the way with which they learn, interact with and search for knowledge. They spend significant amounts of their everyday lives from a very young age interacting with the computers by playing games. Thus, they are used to environments with impressive special effects and graphical interfaces where they have full control of the situation and interact with the environment\u2019s elements. Therefore, today\u2019s teachers are trying to connect computer programming learning with students\u2019 everyday usage of the computer, which does not include simple textual editors for programming lines of code with no other interaction functionalities. Hence, teachers face the challenge of incorporating environments that are similar to students\u2019 existing mentality and of creating tasks and assignments that can be executed within these environments and can provide students with the necessary programming knowledge and skills. A number of software solutions were developed towards facing the aforementioned difficulties. They can be classified into three main categories, namely educational programming environments, microworlds and educational games.

The most important changes were:(i) the features of BlueJ were used more carefully, while the main method was taught much earlier in the course (4th lesson), so as to avoid specific difficulties related to object instantiation and the dynamic aspects of OOP;(ii) students started by making small changes to existing code, but soon enough they started creating small projects from scratch in order to apply the principles of good class design and Java presented to them and develop problem solving skills;(iii) two lessons were devoted to ArrayLists and arrays.",

Based on the above novel metric, the algorithm explicitly focuses on addressing the two goals of source selection; high recall which is important for source recommendation applications and high precision aiming to produce a high precision final merged list. For the latter goal in particular, the new approach steps away from the usual practice of DIR systems of explicitly declaring the number of collections that must be queried and instead receives as input only the number of retrieved documents in the final \u2026",

In this paper, we share some experiences on using the DPP system of SCEPPSys for carrying out assignments in an undergraduate Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Specifically, we focus on the information recorded during problem solving and the statistics reported by the system and how this information can be utilized for monitoring both the course regarding the fulfillment of its goals and the programming habits and progress of students. Some proposals are made towards extending the possibilities of SCEPPSys for generating automatically more sophisticated reports that would support instructors in more successfully  monitoring a course and students.

The main purpose of using learning styles is to adapt the content presentation to the learner, either within Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems or Learning Management Systems. More recently several approaches to the automatic detection of learning styles have been proposed, in contrast to the traditional way which has been through students\u2019 completion of a specific questionnaire. These approaches are based on the analysis of behaviour data that are gathered from the students\u2019 interaction with the system, such as his/her actions and their duration. Automatic detection approaches have a greater potential to be error-free as real data is used in order to detect students\u2019 learning styles. Automatic detection techniques can be divided into two subcategories: data-driven and literature-based. Computer science researchers are more familiar with data-driven approaches, because they require the use of an artificial intelligence classification algorithm to automatically detect learning style preferences. This article investigates the precision attained by different data mining algorithms in an online Moodle course after the second and fourth weeks, and at the end of the course, to compare the detection results and check how fast each approach is. An evaluation study of a Moodle course was conducted in the context of an introductory programming course. The study was conducted over the first six weeks of the course, up to the mid-term exam.

            "Abstract": "Programming is considered by many a core skill of the 21st century. Learning the fundamentals of coding or programming encourages children to acquire new skills, such as problem solving, logical thinking, critical thinking, and Computational Thinking (CT), and moreover to be active creators of tomorrow. There are various platforms for learning coding and programming, and in particular game-based ones, which, through the gamification process, focus on increasing learners\u2019 motivation and engagement. Most existing games are nowadays distributed through web platforms or mobile applications. Most suffer from major drawbacks, which make them difficult to use in a classroom environment, and there lack of an administrative platform does not allow the educator to assign tasks to students when at home. This paper proposes the design of an educational platform for teaching programming to primary school children. It has been designed and is to be developed on the CMX framework. The educational platform includes a web-based game for in classroom teaching, a mobile application game for outside of the classroom, and an administrative module for the teacher to organize the educational process and monitor pupils\u2019 performance. Through specific learning analytics the instructor will be able to draw conclusions on whether the students achieved the specific learning objectives, as well as understanding the educational impact that these types of games actually have on students.",

This article presents how a course can differ among learners with different learning styles regarding the position of the learning objects in the particular course. The proposed technique was implemented in Moodle so as to be used either for an e-learning course or for blended learning. Although this technique is implemented in Moodle it can be easily integrated in any other Learning Management System as long as it is able to provide the same types of learning objects. Two evaluation studies of a Moodle course were conducted in the context of an introductory programming course in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed technique and students\u2019 feedback on it. In both studies, two groups were formed, namely the experimental and the control group. The adaptation technique described in this paper was applied for the experimental group, while the control group had access to the standard version of Moodle. The studies were conducted during the winter semester of the 2015/16 and the 2016/2017 academic year, respectively. Both studies were conducted over the first six weeks of the course, up to the mid-term exam. On completion of the respective course sections but prior to the mid-term exam, all students had to answer a questionnaire evaluating the attended course. The questionnaire consisted of five-point Likert type questions evaluating the proposed adaptation technique, system usability and motivational appeal.

Novice students have to simultaneously learn the syntax of a programming language, understand the algorithmic logic that each program is based on as well as comprehend the basic concepts of the programming principles. The problems students are faced with become even greater when teachers employ complex environments with minimum graphical facilities instead of user\u2010friendly educational programming environments. At the same time, constant technological developments indicate that the global market will continue to require highly skilled computer programmers; thus, the usage of advanced educational environments to properly train future professionals is essential.

            "Abstract": "In traditional classroom education instructors can detect the learning difficulties of their students and take all the necessary actions in order for the problem to be overcome. In asynchronous online education, however, it is system functionality that plays a vital role in locating potential problems that may be related to either or both the students and the courses. In addition, students expect the online course to provide them with personalized instruction and useful feedback. This paper presents how ProPer, an adaptive SCORM compliant Learning Management System, monitors and visualizes user progress through instruction in order to help teachers and students alike to locate possible weaknesses.  Moreover, ProPer, through immediate feedback and comparative techniques aims to motivate students to continue with their study. Evaluation findings indicate that ProPer can help both instructors and students with their \u2026",

            "Abstract": "One of the most common difficulties an instructor faces during an introductory course in computer programming, is the lack of appropriate pedagogically efficient \u201ctools\u201d that will help his/her students understand fundamental notions of programming. Especially, complicated notions are, most of the times, only partially taught or left uncovered for a more advanced course. However, the use of modern technology and computers in education, programming included, is not confined only in computer science courses, but finds applications also in sciences like Math, Biology and Sociology. As a result, there has been also a demand for simpler and friendlier software environments that will provide the vehicle of knowledge dissemination for these sciences and, more generally, for education. Starlogo-introduced by Mitchell Resnick at MIT Media Laboratory\u2013is an programming environment that simulates decentralized systems and provides an intuitive interface that can be used even by elementary school students to explore systems and worlds in which thousands of objects participate and interact with each other. Of course this same environment can be used for an introduction to programming and especially to massively parallel programming. In this paper we initially present a number of different approaches that have been used so far by instructors to improve the didactic experience of their students with the power of the Starlogo environment. Using the Starlogo environment, we also organized a series of experimental Starlogo courses. In this paper we present the way these courses were organized and some preliminary results of our experimental approach.",

            "Abstract": "The problem of results merging in distributed information retrieval environments has gained significant attention the last years. Two generic approaches have been introduced in research. The first approach aims at estimating the relevance of the documents returned from the remote collections through ad hoc methodologies (such as weighted score merging, regression etc.) while the other is based on downloading all the documents locally, completely or partially, in order to calculate their relevance. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Download methodologies are more effective but they pose a significant overhead on the process in terms of time and bandwidth. Approaches that rely solely on estimation on the other hand, usually depend on document relevance scores being reported by the remote collections in order to achieve maximum performance. In addition to that, regression algorithms \u2026",

However, we strongly believe that algorithms and programming constitute an important intellectual tool and should be included in basic education. In any case, both the research literature findings, as well as, our own experience confirm the fact that novice programmers come up against many mental obstacles in their attempts to understand the functioning of programs or the construction of algorithms.

            "Abstract": "Pair Programming (PP), as an element of Extreme Programming, has a long history in the software industry. The many benefits of PP are also considered important in the teaching of programming. Collaboration, sharing of knowledge and skills, as well as easier error detection and correction, are some of the factors that assist pairs of students in implementing programs. More recently, specially designed educational programming environments have given rise to Distributed Pair Programming (DPP), where pairs of students apply PP remotely anywhere and at anytime. A number of plugins for Eclipse IDE were built to support DPP in Computer Science Education. Although they cover the basic requirements of DPP, they could not address drawbacks of PP, such as unequal contributions from each member of the student pair.Most of the research findings concern PP and a few studies investigated DPP. Studies in the field of DPP aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of DPP in student performance, DPP versus solo programming or DPP versus co-located PP (Duque and Bravo 2008; Hanks 2008) and other studies tested productivity and code quality between DPP and PP and concluded that virtual and co-located teams can produce comparable software. Researches on pair formation and pair compatibility in DPP are few.",

In this paper we study some simple adaptations to traditional data fusion algorithms for the task of source selection in uncooperative distributed information retrieval environments. The experiments demonstrate that the performance of data fusion techniques at source selection tasks is comparable with that of state-of-the-art source selection algorithms and they are often able to surpass them.",

In the context of the course 11 two-hour lectures and 11 two-hour labs were given.The 2nd time of teaching the course in 2006-07 some changes were made in order to face difficulties that were attributed to the underlying teaching approach and might not be characterized as intrinsic to OOP. The most important changes were:(i) the features of BlueJ were used more carefully, while the main method was taught much earlier in the course (4th lesson), so as to avoid specific difficulties related to object instantiation and the dynamic aspects of OOP;(ii) students started by making small \u2026",

In an attempt to confront these difficulties and support the objects-first strategy we developed a novel programming environment, objectKarel, which uses the language Karel++. The design of objectKarel was based on the results of the extended research that has been carried out about novice programmers. What differentiates it from analogous environments is the fact that it combines features that have been used solely in them: incorporated e-lessons and hands-on activities; an easy to use structure editor for developing/editing programs; program animation; explanatory visualization; highly informative and friendly error messages; recordability.

The proposed technique was embedded in Moodle so as to enhance its motivational appeal by depicting students\u2019 progress in a course. However, it can be easily integrated into any other learning system as long as it is able to track a learner\u2019s actions within it. In order to calculate knowledge progress, the use of two different measures is proposed: the Time-based Progress Calculation (TPC) and the Grade-based Progress Calculation (GPC). An evaluation study of a Moodle course was conducted in the context of an introductory programming course in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed technique and students\u2019 feedback on it. Three groups were randomly formed. The first two groups had access to a different version of the course in Moodle, while the third had access only to the course\u2019s webpage. The study was conducted over the first six weeks of the course, up to the mid-term exam. On completion of the respective course sections but prior to the mid-term exam, the students of the first two groups had to answer a questionnaire evaluating the attended course. The questionnaire consisted of five-point Likert type questions and was divided into two subcategories: system usability and motivational appeal.

The aim of the present paper is to combine well-known frameworks and extract the conceptual factors that need to be considered when designing an SG.

Orientation: what programming is; the types of problems that can be solved; the positive effects of learning programming. 2. Notional machine: difficulties in understanding the general properties of the \u201cmachine\u201d which the student learns to control and its relation to the physical machine. 3. Rules of the programming language (notation): syntax and semantics as an extension of the properties and behaviour of the notional machine. 4. Learning the established structures. 5.

The extensive research that has been carried out in the last decades regarding novice programmers has shown that an important factor of these difficulties is the teaching approach used. This approach, know as the classic approach, is based on a general purpose programming language, a professional programming environment and a set of problems from the area of number and symbol processing. In this paper, we present the difficulties encountered by students when they are taught programming with the classic approach. The difficulties presented are general and are not related to the programming paradigm (procedural or object-oriented). Next we review the various approaches to teaching programming to novices and the educational tools that have been developed in their context.",

This has also brought forth new knowledge that should be incorporated and new learning strategies must be adopted for the successful teaching of all sub-domains. For example, computer programming is a vital knowledge area within computer science with constantly changing curriculum and its teaching remains a difficult endeavour.

Therefore, they seem to be keen on environments with impressive special effects and graphical interfaces where they interact with the environment\u2019s elements. In response, teachers are trying to connect computer programming learning with computer operations that students are familiar with, which does not include textual editors for programming lines of code with no other interaction. Educational games used in computer programming courses are considered to benefit learning, because they motivate students towards actively participating and interacting with the game\u2019s activities. Thus, we have developed an educational multiplayer game that aims to further enhance computer programming education by addressing occurring problems.

ID can be observed in a very early stage in their lives, while every person with ID has individual characteristics. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a mental disorder that causes issues in social, communicational and emotional behaviour. Many people with ASD have high intellectual abilities, whereas there are others with cognitive disabilities. Therapists have identified several intervention methods to provide aid and teach people with ID and ASD several skills. The traditional methods include special educational programmes, individual or team sessions with therapists and team bonding activities. However, the technological advancements have allowed therapists, organizations and researchers invent new intervention methods. Such methods include software solutions and Serious Games (SGs). In this study, the state-of-the-art in SGs that have already been developed is explored. The findings are categorized based on the limitations they try toaddress that fall into two categories, namely intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour. SGs falling in the adaptive behavior category are classified according to the categories of skills they aim to promote, namely conceptual, socialand practical skills. Finally, the SGs presented are classified according to the specific  skills (i.e. language and literacy, daily living) they aim to improve.

We present the features of such systems including their advantages and weaknesses, and we examine if these systems eliminate known issues of pair programming, such as unequal participation.

Furthermore, students are not\u2013usually-motivated through the use of concepts before they are asked to consider their implementation. What is needed, in order to alleviate the problem, is to design hands-on activities for motivating students with OOP concepts before they are asked to use these concepts for implementing programs.

            "Abstract": "Pair programming (PP) has become popular in the research and software industry as well as being studied for a number of years in computer science courses with positive findings on student performance and attitudes. Advantages of PP reported in the literature are satisfaction, design quality, code productivity, team building, and communication. More recently, distributed pair programming (DPP), which enables two programmers to work remotely, has also attracted the interest of researchers and instructors. The difference between DPP and PP is that the former allows geographically distributed teams to collaborate and share program code. Such collaboration is, thus, only feasible if an underlying infrastructure supports all necessary interactions. The integrated development environments (IDEs) for DPP should cover the basic requirements for remote software development as well as address common PP problems, such as unequal contributions from each member of a pair, feedback during DPP sessions, and communication problems. This paper presents the findings of a study on student performance and attitudes towards DPP in an object-oriented programming (OOP) course. The factors examined were student performance, in terms of assignment grade, exam grade and implementation time in relation to students\u2019 programming experience, and confidence, as well as student attitudes towards DPP, i.e., the feelgood factor, working alone or with a partner, and the perception of their partner\u2019s technical competence. The results suggest that a students\u2019 performance is associated with their programming experience and confidence in programming \u2026",

Seventy-four students participated in the study and used the DPP model to solve programming assignments in pairs, rather than individually. Students were divided into two cohorts in order to examine how best to distribute programming tasks to students, to maximize learning outcomes. The results suggest that while the use of DPP improves pass rates and gets positive feedback from students, the use of collaboration scripts yields equal task contributions from each of the student pair.

The environment is based on the microworld approach to teaching programming and the programming language of Karel++. Its main features are: a series of e-lessons, a special kind of structure editor, run-time error detection, program animation and recordability of students\u2019 actions. In this paper we present the programming environment, the results and our own experiences in using the integrated programming environment to teach object-oriented programming to undergraduate students.",

            "Abstract": "Object oriented programming (OOP) is a complex domain in the education field and requires proper technological underpinning for the facilitation of the process. However, the vast variety of available programming environments makes the selection of the most efficient technology that will cover students\u2019 needs and will lead to the teachers\u2019 desired learning outcomes a significant challenge. These technologies, such as Educational Programming Environments and Programming Microworlds, are often applied on OOP courses in order to underpin the process and help students develop internal incentives, thus foster the feeling of challenge, curiosity, active control and imagination. However, students of the 21st century are growing up in a fully digital world and therefore learn and react accordingly. Alongside the growth of the Internet, high speed access and virtual communities have contributed to a new trend development called online gaming. Therefore, computer games can be considered an appropriate means to deliver knowledge to students of most courses and increase their motivation to learn. A term that is often used when referring to computer games incorporated in the learning experience is \u201cserious games\u201d, and they can involve one or multiple players. Serious games have a higher learning value when they are used in courses that consider critical thinking, group work and decision making as essential to be developed. Therefore, it is the paper\u2019s initial intent to examine representative examples of commonly used technologies in OOP education and to derive their most prominent features that support students\u2019 successful learning \u2026",

This is a major quest for the field researchers due to the fact that it can affect the broader adoption of the Learning Design practices by teachers, with resulting improvements on the quality of teaching and learning outcomes. In this context, this paper investigates teacher-perceived experience and acceptance of a Recommender System (RS) that supports teachers in the designing process, by providing them with Learning Design recommendations. To this end, we conducted a user-centric evaluation experiment, which involved 50 teachers and was based on the ResQue model. According to the results, an RS which proposes existing Learning Designs is a highly accepted technology by teachers. Additionally, teachers \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Learning Management Systems (LMS) are widely used by educational institutions all over the world to fulfil educational objectives and to achieve better learning results. LMS offer various sets of tools to support teachers in creating, administering and managing online courses. Although in the literature there are many references to the significance of learning styles and their impact on the learning process, a major drawback of LMS is that they do not consider a student\u2019s learning style and deliver the same set of educational resources to all students. Recently, there has been growing interest in enhancing adaptivity in LMS. This article investigates students\u2019 navigational behaviour in an online Moodle course to reveal whether students with different learning styles act differently in such a course. An evaluation study of a Moodle course was conducted in the context of an introductory programming course in order to investigate students\u2019 behaviour with respect to the Felder-Silverman learning style model. Students were asked to answer ILS questionnaire right after their first login to the course in order to obtain information regarding their learning style preferences. Seven different types of learning objects were used, namely outlines, content objects, videos, solved exercises, quizzes, open-ended questions, and conclusions. For each one of the aforementioned types the total time that a student studies it and the number of visits to it were calculated and analysed. The study was conducted over the first six weeks of the course. On completion of the respective course sections, students had to answer seven five-point Likert type questions evaluating the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A new generation of computer games has taken over during the last few years,    called Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG). In parallel,    the usage of games in education has increased, exploiting the fact that young    people are familiarized with them and would be more motivated to learn while    entertained. However, MMORPG require significant amounts of resources, such    as bandwidth, RAM and CPU capacity to support learning. In this paper, we    propose a new methodology to achieve monitoring and optimization of the load    balancing, so that the essential resources for the proper execution of an    educational MMORPG for computer programming can be foreseen and bestowed    without overloading the system. Moreover, we present an educational MMORPG    called CMX, which aims to teach computer programming through interactive    activities and role-playing. We finally apply the proposed model to CMX by    conducting an experiment and conclude that the server\u2019s performance is indeed    increased.",

            "Abstract": "Web courses and hypermedia systems deliver knowledge to a wide number of users with different characteristics, preferences and knowledge of the domain, irrespective of where they live, their age or their study credentials. However, these systems do appear to have some quite major problems which have been identified and documented through research studies and have differentiated into three distinct categories. The first deals with problems related to disorientation, cognitive overload, discontinuous flow (Murray et al., 2000), content readiness and distraction. The main solution that research proposes is the use of adaptive and/or interactive systems. The second category of problems is those that arise from the absence of a common development framework for course construction. Course content, thus, lacks reusability, durability and interoperability. A suggested solution is the adoption of common educational standards for course construction and delivery. The third category involves instructors who come up against difficulties during course construction as most of the time course development requires not only specific programming capabilities but also deep knowledge of adaptive strategies and educational standard specifications. Easy authoring tools for non programmer instructors may reduce these difficulties and allow more people to create easy and fast web and/or adaptive courses. The present work deals with three aspects of web learning systems: adaptivity, adoption of educational standards, and authoring tools. Initially it discusses the problems of web based courses at both the construction and delivery stages, and the possible \u2026",
