            "Abstract": "During the last years, several types of network control and restoration techniques have been proposed and discussed. However it was evaluated that a single restoration technique in high-speed networks cannot cover the needs for control, survivability and economical spare channel assignment. This is due to the fact that each technique has its own feature and properties in terms of restoration time, flexibility, applied network elements and restoration cost. Three proposed Alternative Shared Self-healing Ring Algorithms (ASSRA) are placed as substitution in a phase of an algorithm, which use an integrated self-healing technique based in the principal of evolving more than one restoration techniques such as Route Diversity (RD), Shared Self-healing Rings (SSR) and Dynamic Self-Healing algorithms. The main scope of this paper is to examine the effects of the different proposed SSR designing algorithms in the \u2026",

The paper provides the implementation details of the proposed web capture recapture model along with its initial assessment. The anticipated outcome was to examine whether we can conduct capture\u2013recapture experiments on the web (or a web sub-universe such as an Internet search engine directory), in order to further estimate evolution rates in web page populations.",

State-of-the-art LSTM classifier require a large number of training examples to avoid biases and successfully generalise. Labelled data greatly improves classification results, but not all modern datasets include large numbers of labelled examples. Labelling is a complex task that can be expensive, time-consuming, and potentially introduces biases. Data augmentation methods create synthetic data based on existing labelled examples, with the goal of improving classification results. These methods have been successfully used in image classification tasks and recent research has extended them to text classification. We propose a method that uses sentence permutations to augment an initial dataset, while retaining key statistical properties of the dataset. We \u2026",

The algorithm was tested with 1334 natural-scene gray-level vehicle images of different backgrounds and ambient illumination. The camera focused in the plate, while the angle of view and the distance from the vehicle varied according to the experimental setup. The license plates properly segmented were 1287 over 1334 input images (96.5%). The optical character recognition system is a two-layer probabilistic neural network (PNN) with topology 108-180-36, whose performance for entire plate recognition reached 89.1%.

In this paper, we propose a platform that enables the custom creation of a decentralized network configuration, along with all necessary modules for simulating the traffic of real-world online social networks and measuring in parallel the performance of several DOSN architectures across artificial data. The goal of our work is two fold since it i) verifies the benefits of the decentralized paradigm based on several conclusions drawn and ii) provides a platform that enables the provision of custom experimentation for researchers in the related field.",

Accuracy of the method has been justified by transfer-function measurements of sample channels in the 2-30MHz band, whereas applicability stands wherever cabling meets the two-conductor transmission-line model.

Yet, only recently have the two areas started to really come together, giving us social networks that incorporate technologies for semantifying the information associated with them, as well as their diffused content. These semantic social networks can be seen as tools to model knowledge from multidisciplinary social media and scattered online communities. Today, the exponential growth of social networking data, combined with developments in the area of semantic technologies, is giving rise to numerous new interesting research topics. Several challenges arise with respect to identification and modeling of complex and evolutionary patterns using computational intelligence and data mining techniques, discovery and analysis of online communities, personalization \u2026",

            "Abstract": "With the ever increasing production of data from various heterogeneous sources in modern information societies, the need for scalable data-intensive processing is increasing. MapReduce quickly became the de facto framework for large scale data analysis, due to its simple and abstract programming model and its efficient underlying execution system. However, this simplicity comes with a price: its unidirectional communication model and the lack of support for iterations, makes repeated querying of datasets difficult and imposes limitations in many fields including Machine Learning. In this paper we describe the implementation of a classification rule induction algorithm based on MapReduce, with the aim of building a classification model within as few iterations as possible. After a thorough description of the algorithm, we evaluate its performance from three perspectives: its accuracy, its parallel performance and \u2026",

Due to the fact that it grows exponentially, it is a difficult task to efficiently locate specific information. This paper presents a User-defined Meta-Search Engine (UMSE), adaptable to user preferences. UMSE utilises tip to 9 known search engines according to a user-defined ranking, submits its queries in parallel and finally presents the merging results back to the user. The anticipated outcome of using UMSE is that the user gets enhanced amount of information, recording in parallel his search preferences. UMSE also supports history features in order to personalise user queries and facilitate information retrieval.",

            "Abstract": "The appearance of images in social messages is continuously increasing, along with user engagement with that type of content. Analysis of social images can provide valuable latent information, often not present in the social posts. In that direction, a framework is proposed exploiting latent information from Twitter images, by leveraging the Google Cloud Vision API platform, aiming at enriching social analytics with semantics and hidden textual information. As validated by our experiments, social analytics can be further enriched by considering the combination of user-generated content, latent concepts, and textual data extracted from social images, along with linked data. Moreover, we employed word embedding techniques for investigating the usage of latent semantic information towards the identification of similar Twitter images, thereby showcasing that hidden textual information can improve such information retrieval tasks. Finally, we offer an open enhanced version of the annotated dataset described in this study with the aim of further adoption by the research community. View Full-Text",

In this research effort, we briefly review the state of art in fairness mechanisms in multi-hop networks and we propose an algorithm that tries to differentiate the traffic among the connections in a wireless multi-hop ad-hoc sensor network, so that the fairness is enhanced. This is achieved by an adaptive scheme, which tries to assign a higher priority to the traffic connections that experience delay greatly larger than the average, so that their delay is reduced, and the fairness of the system is improved.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, web search services are considered as a valuable tool for information exploration. However, due to the extremely rapid growth of the web, search engines cannot index the new information at the same time or with the same priority and thus their performance is hampered in some extend. Besides, web search services index the disseminated information with different algorithms, having as result different response time in updating their directories. In this paper, we propose a meta-search algorithm, which is capable of self-adapting over the continuous changes that occur on the indexed web, using a web evolution adaptation mechanism. This mechanism is put in the context of real capture\u2013recapture experiments conducted in wildlife biological studies. The meta-search algorithm also supports a monitor mechanism, which records the user's browsing behavior during his search sessions. The paper provides \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Video compression is arguably one of the most time consuming tasks, especially at high resolutions. For this reason parallelization has been used at various levels: from coarse grained schemes that consider groups of blocks or frames as granules to fine grained approaches that parallelize the compression within a block of pels, e.g., at motion estimation. Given that the decade old H.264/AVC is showing its age in the 4K era, AV1 was recently launched by AOMedia as a royalty free standard promising significant compression gains (for the same quality) over the older H.264/AVC and VP9 protocols. Since AV1 is currently at its infancy, most initial research efforts concentrated on identifying possible strengths and shortcomings of the standard at various settings, focusing on video quality and compression efficiency. However, time performance and parallelism potential are equally important, particularly for media \u2026",

The increasing volume and diversity of these data pose the challenge of finding relations between them in a most efficient and accurate way, by taking into advantage their overlapping schemes. In this paper we define two types of relationships between multidimensional RDF data, and we propose algorithms for efficient and scalable computation of these relationships. Specifically, we define the notions of containment and complementarity between points in multidimensional dataspaces, as different aspects of relatedness, and we propose a baseline method for computing them, as well as two alternative methods that target speed and scalability. We provide an experimental evaluation over real-world and synthetic datasets and we compare our approach to a SPARQL-based and a rule-based alternative, which prove to be inefficient for increasing input sizes.",

            "Abstract": "Scientific projects that require human computation often resort to crowdsourcing. Interested individuals can contribute to a crowdsourcing task, essentially contributing towards the project\u2019s goals. To motivate participation and engagement, scientists use a variety of reward mechanisms. The most common motivation, and the one that yields the fastest results, is monetary rewards. By using monetary, scientists address a wider audience to participate in the task. As the payment is below minimum wage for developed economies, users from developing countries are more eager to participate. In subjective tasks, or tasks that cannot be validated through a right or wrong type of validation, monetary incentives could contrast with the much needed quality of submissions. We perform a subjective crowdsourcing task, emotion annotation, and compare the quality of the answers from contributors of varying income levels, based on the Gross Domestic Product. The results indicate a different contribution process between contributors from varying GDP regions. Low income contributors, possibly driven by the monetary incentive, submit low quality answers at a higher pace, while high income contributors provide diverse answers at a slower pace.",

This task is quite challenging due to the diversity of plate formats and the nonuniform outdoor illumination conditions during image acquisition. Therefore, most approaches work only under restricted conditions such as fixed illumination, limited vehicle speed, designated routes, and stationary backgrounds. Numerous techniques have been developed for LPR in still images or video sequences, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and assess them. Issues such as processing time, computational power, and recognition rate are also addressed, when available.

The purpose of an efficient classification method is considered essential in modern diagnostic medicine in order to increase the number of diagnosed patients and decrease the analysis time. The significant storage capabilities of electronic media have enabled research centers to accumulate repositories of classified (labeled) images and mostly of a large number of unclassified (unlabeled) images. Semi-supervised learning algorithms have become a hot topic of research as an alternative to traditional classification methods, seeing as they exploit the explicit classification information of labeled data with the knowledge hidden in the unlabeled data resulting in the creation of powerful and effective classifiers. In this work, we propose a new ensemble self-labeled algorithm \u2026",

The purpose of such an application is to assist visually impaired, technologically uneducated, and underprivileged people in accessing information originally intended to be accessed visually via a personal computer (PC). Users may access wiki content via fixed or mobile phones, or via a PC using a Web Browser or a Voice over IP service. This feature promotes pervasiveness to collaboratively created content to an extremely large population, i.e., those who simply own a telephone line.",

            "Abstract": "HEVC has emerged as the new video coding standard promising improved compression ratios (for the same quality) by up to 50% compared to H. 264/AVC. To achieve this performance HEVC requires increased computational overhead compared to its predecessor. For this reason parallelism is used, usually at a coarse grained level, eg, per slice or tile. In this paper we turn our attention towards further speeding up the HEVC encoding process by combining coarse grained parallelism with fine grained, in the form of AVX2 instructions implementing SIMD parallelism at SAD (Sum of Absolute Difference) and SSE (Sum of Squared Error) calculations. Experimental evaluation with common test video sequences illustrates that an additional reduction (in encoding time) of roughly 11% on average, compared to standalone coarse grained parallelism is achievable, leading in many cases to superlinear speedup.",

The proposal is based on the capture-recapture method used in wildlife biological studies and it is modified according to the necessary assumptions and amendments for applying the experiments on the web, where web pages are considered as animals and the specific types of e-commerce pages as particular species of animals whose abundance, birth and survival rates is estimated. An artificial classifier capable of categorizing web pages, plays the role of the biologist who recognizes the species under study. Finally, a virtual experiment in the e-commerce field was simulated and the derived results were quite promising especially as far as the estimations of the survival probability values are concerned.",

            "Abstract": "Continuous monitoring of patients with chronic diseases can enable early detection of deterioration and initiation of appropriate measures. This may be particularly important for patients who live in remotes areas as emergency medical services may take a long time to reach them. However continuously sending monitored biosignals to a healthcare centre is not practical as it places a high data load on a network. It is also not feasible for a healthcare professional to continuously monitor the data of several patients with chronic illnesses. In this paper we propose a context sensitive platform that sends data only when the biosignals move outside a specified range and which optimises data transmission by taking into account the network environment and the patient status. The framework architecture is open and does not depend on the monitoring applications used, the underlying networks, or the telemedicine system used. The system also incorporates additional functionalities such as obtaining second opinions through peer to peer communication. This paper describes the architecture together with a prototype evaluation.",

In order to be accessed, the information must be clustered and classified in appropriate knowledge models. These models will provide and form the initial conditions of a knowledge structure. A confusing situation exists in the Digital Economy or in the so-called E-Commerce Arena. The way in which economic values and business strategies are created is changing fundamentally and this transforms the general structure of the Economy. A simple survey shows that there is no single, comprehensive and cogent taxonomy of web business models, due to the fact that every classification approach is depending on the importance appointed to the various aspects of the emerging \u201cnew economy\u201d. This paper, takes under consideration a web business model taxonomy, proposed by M. Rappa. This taxonomy classifies a web site into a business model according its position in the value chain [1]. Based in the above taxonomy the paper suggests a system, which through information filtering, text retrieval and knowledge techniques, will extract the site content, analyse it and finally classify the e-commerce site. The system uses retrieval techniques, which are emphasised in statistical correlations of words in site content, and scoring content collections with model profiles under the Vector Space Model (VSM)[2],[3]. The anticipated outcome of the proposed system is to identify whether a site is actually offers commerce services through the web. In case of an E-commerce identification, the system proceeds in a business model classification based \u2026",

In an effort to reduce the exposure of online users\u2019 information, we propose a privacy-preserving text labelling method for varying applications, based in crowdsourcing. We transform text with different levels of privacy and analyse the effectiveness of the transformation with regards to label correlation.

Apart from entertainment and informational purposes, social networks have penetrated many fields of educational practices and processes. This review tries to highlight the use of social networks in higher education, as well as points out some factors involved. Moreover, through a literature review of related articles, we aim at providing insights into social network influences with regard to (a) the learning processes (support, educational processes, communication and collaboration enhancement, academic performance) from the side of students and educators;(b) the users\u2019 personality profile and learning style;(c) the social networks as online learning platforms (LMS\u2014learning management system); and (d) their use in higher education. The conclusions reveal positive impacts in all of the above dimensions, thus indicating that the wider future use of online social networks (OSNs) in higher education is quite promising.

However, this performance improvement comes at the expense of increased coding time. In order to ameliorate the situation, HEVC provides three coarse grained parallelization primitives namely: slices, tiles and wave front. Due to the higher overhead incurred by slice parallelism, most related studies in the literature focused on exploring tile and wave front parallelism as standalone mechanisms, or in combination with other finer grained approaches such as SIMD instructions. Nevertheless, the possibility of combining wave front and tile parallelism in order to speed up the encoding process was typically overlooked. In this paper we propose and evaluate a multi-threaded approach for coarse grained parallel \u2026",

Data that reflects user preferences and likings, comprising therefore a user profile, are gathered to an adaptive web site in a non transparent manner. This situation however raises serious privacy concerns to the end user. When browsing aweb site, users are not aware of several important privacy parameters i.e., which behavior will be monitored and logged, how it will be processed, how long it will be kept, and with whom it will be shared in the long run. In this paper we propose an abstract architecture that enhances user privacy during interaction with adaptive web sites. This architecture enables users to create and update their personal privacy preferences for the adaptive web sites they visit by holding their (user) profiles in the client side instead of the server side.

Up until internet penetration in the late 90s, these studies were based over traditional offline social networks. Several observations in offline information flows studies, such as two-step flow of communication and the importance of weak ties, were verified in several online studies, showing that the diffused information flows from one Online Social Network (OSN) to several others. Within that flow, information is shared to and reproduced by the users of each network. Furthermore, the original content is enhanced or weakened according to its topic, the dynamic and exposure of each OSNs. In such a concept, each OSN is considered a layer of information flows that interacts with each other. In this paper, we examine such flows in several social networks, as well as their diffusion and lifespan across multiple OSNs, in terms of user-generated content.

Unlike in face recognition, where the classes to be discriminated are different faces, in face detection, the two classes to be discriminated are \"face area\" and \"non-face area\". A novel approach to face detection is presented, which is based on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) specially trained for the identification of faces from skin areas within the image plane, which were previously located using fuzzy logic rules. The performance of the whole system was tested using 137 color image scenes with various illumination conditions containing human faces. The images were taken with a common digital camera, at a resolution of 1280/spl times/960 pixels. The PNN coupled with the fuzzy logic rules become the basis for developing a computer-based face detection system, whose overall identification performance was 85.2%. One limitation of \u2026",

In this research effort, we briefly review the state of art in fairness mechanisms in multi-hop networks and we propose an algorithm that tries to differentiate the traffic among the connections in a wireless multi-hop ad-hoc sensor network, so that the fairness is enhanced. This is achieved by an adaptive scheme, which tries to assign a higher priority to the traffic connections that experience delay greatly larger than the average, so that their delay is reduced, and the fairness of the system is improved.",

However, this information is served massively and heterogeneously-mostly due to different bureaucratic procedures and paperwork formats, while its diffusion does not occur at regular or at least generally predictable time intervals. Thus, even though the information is available by the involved public sectors, enterprises and citizens are overwhelmed from the size/inconsistency of the information they deal with. The scope of our publicly accessible Web point is two-fold. Firstly, it aims to promote clarity and enhance citizen awareness regarding public spending in Greece through easily consumed visualization diagrams. Information provision is based on semantic processing of real-time open data provided by Greek government ('Diavgia') and the Greek Taxation Information System. Secondly, a proposed ontology for public spending in Greece functions in two distinct levels. It checks the validity of the publicly available data accessed by the system, cleaning and reconstructing in parallel false entries, while it will interconnect the data to existing ontological and data schemes derived from other similar initiatives worldwide and core vocabularies.",

As more scientists analyse the data created in these platforms, privacy concerns have extended to data usage within the academia. Although text analysis is a well documented topic in academic literature with a multitude of applications, ensuring privacy of user-generated content has been overlooked. In an effort to reduce the exposure of online users\u2019 information, we propose a privacy-preserving text labelling method for varying applications, based in crowdsourcing. We transform text with different levels of privacy and analyse the effectiveness of the transformation with regards to label correlation. To demonstrate the adaptive nature of our approach we also employ a TF/IDF filtering transformation. Our results suggest that total privacy can be implemented in labelling, retaining the annotational diversity and subjectivity of traditional labelling. The privacy-preserving labelling, with the use of NRC lexicon, demonstrates an average 0.11 Mean Spearman\u2019s Rho correlation, boosted to 0.124 with TF/IDF filtering.",

Thus, the user has to resubmit his queries to more search engines, adding in this way, to a process that is already time-consuming [11]. Using a meta-search engine, additional information is provided, without the need to know the query language for the search services that contribute to the search.

Affective computing deals with the exact emotions conveyed through information. Emotional information most frequently cannot be accurately described by a single emotion class. Multilabel classifiers can categorize human-generated content in multiple emotional classes. Ensemble learning can improve the statistical, computational and representation aspects of such classifiers. We present a baseline stacked ensemble and propose a weighted ensemble. Our proposed weighted ensemble can use multiple classifiers to improve classification results without hyperparameter tuning or data overfitting. We evaluate our ensemble models with two datasets. The first dataset is from Semeval2018-Task 1 and contains almost 7000 Tweets, labeled with 11 sentiment classes. The second dataset is the Toxic Comment Dataset with more than 150,000 comments, labeled with six different levels of abuse or harassment.

            "Abstract": "In the present paper the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm is introduced for best routing identification applied in urban solid waste collection. The proposed solid waste management system is based on a geo-referenced Spatial Database supported by a Geographic Information System (GIS). The GIS takes into account all the required parameters for solid waste collection. These parameters involve static and dynamic data, such as positions of trash-cans, road network, related traffic and population density. In addition, time schedules of trash-collection workers, track capacities and technical characteristics are considered. The ACO spatiotemporal statistical analysis model is used to estimate interrelations between dynamic factors, like network traffic changes in residential and commercial areas in a 24 hour schedule, and to produce optimized solutions. The user, in the proposed system, is able to define or modify all of the required dynamic factors for the creation of an initial scenario. By modifying these particular parameters, alternative scenarios can be generated leading to several solutions. The objective of the proposed system is to identify the most cost-effective alternative scenario for waste collection and transport, to estimate its running cost and to simulate its application.",

The paper proposes a system, aiming to classify e-commerce sites according their Web content. This system can be implemented for automatic knowledge segmentation in a portal or in a search engine repository. The system performance reached 96% in the first test sets, after the learning phase.

One prominent example in the Web of Data is the RDF Data Cube vocabulary, which has recently attracted great attention from the industrial, government and academic sectors as the de facto representational model for publishing open multidimensional data. As a result, different datasets share terms from common code lists and hierarchies, this way creating an implicit relatedness between independent sources. Identifying and analyzing relationships between disparate data sources is a major prerequisite for enabling traditional business analytics at the web scale. However, discovery of instance-level relationships between datasets becomes a computationally costly procedure, as typically all \u2026",

Health management consists of specific cooperation intensive activities, while medical knowledge and systems are spatially and functionally distributed. Also, medical data flows are inefficient for dynamic data delivery to stakeholders while the manifold of medical care derives from their diversity and autonomy. In such an environment we propose the implementation of vhMentor based on a solid ontological schema. The aim of the proposed system is to suggest an agent-based solution to overcome the automation deficiencies of medical data monitoring.

            "Abstract": "The discovery of influential entities in all kinds of networks (e.g., social, digital, or computer) has always been an important field of study. In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been established as a basic means of communication and often influencers and opinion makers promote politics, events, brands, or products through viral content. In this work, we present a systematic review across (i) online social influence metrics, properties, and applications and (ii) the role of semantic in modeling OSNs information. We found that both areas can jointly provide useful insights towards the qualitative assessment of viral user-generated content, as well as for modeling the dynamic properties of influential content and its flow dynamics.",

For effective market analysis and contract validation, various commercial tracker systems are employed. However, these systems mostly rely on heuristics and, since commercial broadcasting varies significantly, are often inaccurate. This paper proposes a commercial tracker system based on the Block Operator Context Scanning (Block - OCS) algorithm, which is both accurate and fast. The proposed method, similar to coarse-to-fine strategies, skips a large portion of the image sequences by focusing only on Regions of Interest. In this paper, a video matching algorithm is also proposed, which compares image sequences using time sliding windows of frames. Experimental results showed 100% accuracy and 50% speed increase compared to traditional block-based processing methods.",

In this paper, we propose the concept of multilayer information flow, by considering every On-line Social Network (OSN) as a separate layer and the information as links connecting these layers. Under such formalization, information is spread from a source layer, while it is diffused in multiple other layers. In order to validate our proposal, experimentations are focused on Reddit and its content, by observing the diffusion of its posts and related content in ImgUr and YouTube.",

Maximizing access to this information promotes justice and the rule of law\u201d. In accordance with the aforementioned declaration on free access to law by legal information institutes of the world, a plethora of legal information is available through the Internet, while the provision of legal information has never before been easier. Given that law is accessed by a much wider group of people, the majority of whom are not legally trained or qualified, diversification techniques should be employed in the context of legal information retrieval, as to increase user satisfaction. We address the diversification of results in legal search by adopting several state of the art methods from the web search, network analysis and text summarization domains. We provide an exhaustive evaluation of the methods, using a standard dataset from the common law domain that we objectively annotated with relevance judgments for this purpose. Our results:(i) reveal that users receive broader insights across the results they get from a legal information retrieval system;(ii) demonstrate that web search diversification techniques outperform other approaches (eg, summarization-based, graph-based methods) in the context of legal diversification; and (iii) offer balance boundaries between reinforcing relevant documents or sampling the information space around the legal query.

            "Abstract": "During the last decade the academic world is continuously capitalizing on the use of Internet and web-based learning solutions, because of the simplicity and immediacy in creating, organizing and managing educational material and student data. However, the delivery of educational content to the end-user is characterized by visual presentation and the requirement of some sort of access either wired or wireless to the Internet, which blocks visually impaired individuals or people who don\u2019t have access to the Internet in one way or another from accessing educational content. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of the Internet Telephony Learning System (TELS). Besides all other, TELS exploits mature Internet/web standards and the most popular communication mean in the world, the telephone, to provide audio interactivity between an otherwise traditional web application and the end-user. Unlike other similar applications, TELS does not need any special software or hardware to be accessed and since it is an open source traditional web application it can be custom-tailored to the individual needs of each institution. Since it is accessible to almost every communication device, we argue that it is useful for visually impaired, technologically uneducated, and underprivileged people for accessing information originally intended to be accessed visually via a Personal Computer.",

The two-fold objective of this work is to:(i) identify and review state-of-the-art HITs that facilitate the aims of evidence-based medicine and (ii) propose a methodology for HIT assessment. Methods: The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Furthermore, we consolidated existing knowledge in the field and proposed a Synthesis Framework for the Assessment of Health Information Technology (SF/HIT) in order to evaluate the joint use of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) along with HITs in the field of evidence-based medicine. Results: 55 articles met the inclusion criteria and refer to 51 (RCTs) published between 2008 and 2016. Significant improvements in healthcare through the use of HITs were observed in the findings of 31 out of 51 trials\u201460.8%. We also confirmed that RCTs are valuable tools for assessing the effectiveness, acceptability, safety, privacy, appropriateness, satisfaction, performance, usefulness and adherence. Conclusions: To improve health service delivery, RCTs apply and exhibit formalization by providing measurable outputs. Towards this direction, we propose the SF/HIT as a framework which may help researchers to carry out appropriate evaluations and extend their studies. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "The vigorous impact of the Web in time and space arises from the fact that it motivates massive creation, editing and distribution of information by Users with little knowledge. This unprecedented continuum provides novel opportunities for innovation but also puts under jeopardy its survival as a stable construct that nurtures a complex system of connections. We examine the Web as an ethics determined space by demonstrating Hayek\u2019s theory of freedom in a three-leveled Web: technological, contextualized and economic. Our approach accounts for the co-dependence of code and values, and assumes that the Web is a self-contained system that exists in and by itself. This view of internal Web ethics directly connects the concept of freedom with issues like centralization of traffic and data control, rights on visiting log file, custom User profiles and the interplay among function, structure and morality of the Web. It is also demonstrated, in the case of Net Neutrality, that generic freedom-coercion trade-offs are incomplete in treating specific cases at work.",

The camera focused on the plate, while the angle of view and the distance from the vehicle varied according to the experimental setup. The license plates properly segmented were 2719 over 2820 input images (96.4%). The optical character recognition (OCR) system is a two layer probabilistic neural network with topology 108-180-36, whose performance reached 97.4%.

The proposed classifier is a four-layer Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN) that aims to perform the information segmentation according to web page features. Many types of web pages were used in order to evaluate the robustness of the method, since no restrictions were imposed except for the language of the content, which is English. The system can be used as an assistant and consultative tool in order to help the work of human editors.",

The proposal is based on the capture-recapture method used in wildlife biological studies in an animal, bird or fish populations, and it is modified according to the necessary assumptions and amendments for applying the experiments in a search engine directory. During these experiments, Web pages are considered as animals and the specific types of Web pages as particular species of animals whose abundance, birth, death and survival rates are estimated. The population is open, meaning that new Web pages are submitted to the search engine directory, while others are removed from the directory indexes, resembling to emigration/immigration processes in nature. The role of the biologist who recognizes the species under study and records their history is assigned to a Web page classifier, which is trained under \u2026",

Towards this direction, we introduce a methodology for discovering and suggesting similar Twitter accounts, based entirely on their disseminated content in terms of Twitter entities used. The methodology is based exclusively on semantic representation protocols and related technologies. An ontological schema is also described towards the semantification of the Twitter accounts and their entities.",

Of particular interest are apps aiding planning and collaboration among family members, or between co-workers. The architecture of such apps usually involves some Cloud storage medium, through which group members post and retrieve data. Naturally, all participants must have the same app installed in their devices for collaboration to be possible. In this paper we investigate an alternative option instead of app collaboration which is based on remote application calling (RAC). Under the RAC framework, a trusted source is able to invoke application actions at other people's devices, without necessarily owning himself the application it handles. We discuss RAC design and implementation related issues, focusing on Android devices. The usability of our approach is demonstrated through two widely used apps \u2026",

Gradually, public budgets and tenders are becoming openly available and global initiatives promote fiscal transparency and open product and price data. But, the poor quality of economic open data undermines their potential to answer interesting questions (eg efficiency of public funds and market processes). Linked Open Economy (LOE) has been developed as a top-level conceptualization that interlinks the publicly available economic open data by modelling the flows incorporated in public procurement together with the market process to address complex policy issues. LOE approach is extensively used to enrich open economic data ranging from budgets and spending to prices. Developers, professionals, public administrations and any other interested party use and customize LOE model to develop new systems, to enable information exchange between systems, to integrate data from heterogeneous sources and to publish open data related to economic activities.",

However, their competence is hindered, due to the vast amount of information added, the poor organization, as well as the lack of effective crawling techniques that fail to follow the exponential growth of the web. In this paper we propose an algorithm, which uses five third party web search services and it is capable of self-adapting over the incessant changes that occur on the indexed web. The algorithm works in conjunction with a user browsing behavior model that monitors and records the users\u2019 interactions with the third-party services, using XML search session instances. From the assessment made, it was concluded that the proposed algorithm not only adapts to the users\u2019 web search profiles but also adapts to the evolutionary nature of the web.",

Citizens can easily access a lot of information about regulations, court orders, statutes, opinions and analytical documents. Such openness brings undeniable benefits in terms of transparency, participation and availability of new services. However, legal information overload poses new challenges, especially in the field of Legal Information Retrieval. Search result diversification has gained attention as a way to increase user satisfaction in web search. We hypothesize that such a strategy will also be beneficial for search on legal data sets. We address diversification of results in legal search by introducing legal domain specific diversification criteria and adopting several state of the art methods from the web search, network analysis and text summarization domains. We evaluate our diversification framework using a real data set from \u2026",

In this paper an intelligent/enhanced daltonization method for individuals suffering from protanopia is proposed. The algorithm implements logical image masking in order to modify the colors that are confused and to preserve those colors that are perceived correctly. The proposed method modifies iteratively the parameters for image daltonization after the provision of the initial conditions. The distinctive characteristic of the proposed approach is that when it is combined with a color-checking module, optimum daltonization parameters are effectively identified. Examples are provided in details, as well as screenshots from the algorithm when it is applied in digitized paintings/artworks.",

Although the new standard is able to achieve significantly higher compression ratios compared to the older one, it entails high computational demands. To alleviate the problem, parallelism opportunities are offered by the standard at different levels namely, slice, tile and wave front. In this paper we evaluate the performance of slice level parallelism in HEVC encoding. Although significant previous work exists on slice parallelization, particularly for H. 264/AVC, usually the experimental evaluation was limited to characterizing the performance when encoding one sequence at a time. Our focus is to evaluate slice parallelism when a batch of encoding jobs is submitted to the system, with CPU core requirements potentially exceeding the available resources.",

Despite giant leaps in communication, storage and computing power in recent years, crawlers have always struggled to keep up with Web content generation and modification. Focused crawlers attempt to i) accelerate the crawling process, ii) maximize the harvest of high quality pages, iii) assign appropriate credit to different documents along a crawling path, such that short-term gains are not pursued at the expense of less obvious paths that ultimately yield larger sets of valuable pages. Beyond the review and comparison of the focused crawling strategies, we additionally propose additions to the corresponding architectures for further research.",

Prominent examples in this category include the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and AV1 which both nominally target at least 50% better compression rate compared to H.264/AVC. However, with a plethora of videos already existing in H.264/AVC format and the majority of cameras in use supporting the older standard, the need for efficient transcoding of H.264/AVC videos into newer standards, cannot be overlooked. Although a significant amount of research exists on fast transcoding of H.264/AVC sequences, most of the works have focused on speeding up block level encoding, usually by taking advantage of mode and motion information that is already contained in the compressed input stream. Nevertheless, equally important to reducing per block \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a rule induction approach to automatically construct a set of rules by searching the most promising subspace of all possible rules with a brute-force method and information theoretic criteria. To specify the features for the rules, we initially make a descriptive analysis of Yahoo L11, a specialized dataset containing complex interfaces, which to the best of our knowledge has not been used in previous works.

The interactions and interdependences between these factors and their correlation with the selected load balancing algorithms are studied in the current paper. Vital issues are considered and extensively examined through the systematic introspection and the comparison of two load balancing algorithms, a static and a dynamic one. The former is the well-known deterministic Round-Robin, whereas the latter has been developed for the needs of our research. In addition, a flexible simulation framework is implemented where the experiments take place. Appropriate metrics are formulated so that their joint examination reveals the behaviour of the system in terms of performance. Performance degradation might result when high information policy complexity is combined with important communication overheads. However, system efficiency can be improved when intense workload is adequately combined with increased delay. Precision of the system\u2019s state information is always compensated by the simplicity of the negotiation protocol. Moreover, the grid\u2019s topology is examined. Equations, which reveal the dependency of performance and topology, are derived, through the methodical analysis of potential load balancing scenarios and they are confirmed by the experimental results.",
