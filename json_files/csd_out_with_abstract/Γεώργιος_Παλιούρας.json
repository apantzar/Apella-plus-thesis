            "Abstract": "The buzz over the so-called \"fake news\" has created concerns about a degenerated media environment and led to the need for technological solutions. As the detection of fake news is increasingly considered a technological problem, it has attracted considerable research. Most of these studies primarily focus on utilizing information extracted from textual news content. In contrast, we focus on detecting fake news solely based on structural information of social networks. We suggest that the underlying network connections of users that share fake news are discriminative enough to support the detection of fake news. Thereupon, we model each post as a network of friendship interactions and represent a collection of posts as a multidimensional tensor. Taking into account the available labeled data, we propose a tensor factorization method which associates the class labels of data samples with their latent representations. Specifically, we combine a classification error term with the standard factorization in a unified optimization process. Results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive against state-of-the-art methods by implementing an arguably simpler approach.",

            "Abstract": "Complex Event Recognition (CER) systems have become popular in the past two decades due to their ability to \"instantly\" detect patterns on real-time streams of events. However, there is a lack of methods for forecasting when a pattern might occur before such an occurrence is actually detected by a CER engine. We present a formal framework that attempts to address the issue of Complex Event Forecasting (CEF). Our framework combines two formalisms: a) symbolic automata which are used to encode complex event patterns; and b) prediction suffix trees which can provide a succinct probabilistic description of an automaton's behavior. We compare our proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods and show its advantage in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In particular, prediction suffix trees, being variable-order Markov models, have the ability to capture long-term dependencies in a stream by remembering only those past sequences that are informative enough. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefits, in terms of accuracy, of being able to capture such long-term dependencies. This is achieved by increasing the order of our model beyond what is possible with full-order Markov models that need to perform an exhaustive enumeration of all possible past sequences of a given order. We also discuss extensively how CEF solutions should be best evaluated on the quality of their forecasts.",

            "Abstract": "This article investigates the effectiveness of voting and stacked generalization-also known as stacking-in the context of information extraction (IE). A new stacking framework is proposed that accommodates well-known approaches for IE. The key idea is to perform cross-validation on the base-level data set, which consists of text documents annotated with relevant information, in order to create a meta-level data set that consists of feature vectors. A classifier is then trained using the new vectors. Therefore, base-level IE systems are combined with a common classifier at the metalevel. Various voting schemes are presented for comparing against stacking in various IE domains. Well known IE systems are employed at the base-level, together with a variety of classifiers at the meta-level. Results show that both voting and stacking work better when relying on probabilistic estimates by the base-level systems. Voting proved to be effective in most domains in the experiments. Stacking, on the other hand, proved to be consistently effective over all domains, doing comparably or better than voting and always better than the best base-level systems. Particular emphasis is also given to explaining the results obtained by voting and stacking at the meta-level, with respect to the varying degree of similarity in the output of the base-level systems.",

This way, we aim to achieve a high-level human action understanding, combining the opaque effectiveness of deep learning and the transparent reasoning of computational logic. Our experimental results on a benchmark activity recognition dataset encourage further research towards this direction.",

The experimental results showed that the method does indeed facilitate the modeling of web navigation, which was not possible with the existing web usage mining methods. However, a content-based recommendation model is shown to still outperform the proposed method, which suggests that the knowledge of the navigation sequence does not contribute to the recommendation process.

RTEC deals with delayed arrival and retraction of events by computing at each query time composite event intervals from scratch. This often results to redundant computations. Instead, RTECinc deals with delays and retractions in a more efficient way, by updating only the affected events.

A NERC system assigns semantic tags to phrases that correspond to named entities, eg persons, locations and organisations. Typically, such a system makes use of two language resources: a recognition grammar and a lexicon of known names, classified by the corresponding named-entity types. NERC systems have been shown to achieve good results when the domain of application is very specific. However, the construction of the grammar and the lexicon for a new domain is a hard and time-consuming process. We propose the use of decision trees as NERC \u201cgrammars\u201d and the construction of these trees using machine learning. In order to validate our approach, we tested C4. 5 on the identification of person and organisation names involved in management succession events, using data from the sixth Message Understanding Conference. The results of the evaluation are very encouraging showing that the induced tree can outperform a grammar that was constructed manually.",

This new algorithm uses simplicity as a criterion for directing inference, and the search process of the new algorithm has been optimised by utilising the results of a theoretical analysis regarding the behaviour and complexity of the search operators. Evaluation results are presented on artificially generated data, while the scalability of the algorithm is tested on a large textual corpus. These results show that the new algorithm performs well and can infer grammars from large data sets in a reasonable amount of time.",

            "Abstract": "We introduce ELS, a new method for entity-level sentiment classification using sequence modeling by Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The CRF is trained to identify the sentiment of each word in a document, which is then used to determine the sentiment for the entity, based on where it appears in the text. Due to its sequential nature, the CRF classifier performs better than the common bag-of-words approaches, especially when we target the local sentiment in small parts of a larger document. Identifying the sentiment about a specific entity, mentioned in a blog post or a larger product review, is a special case of such local sentiment classification. Furthermore, the proposed approach performs well even in short pieces of text, where bag-of-words approaches usually fail, due to the sparseness of the resulting feature vector. We have implemented and tested the proposed method on a publicly available benchmark \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the recent years research on dynamic social network has increased, which is also due to the availability of data sets from streaming media. Modeling a network's dynamic behaviour can be performed at the level of communities, which represent their mesoscale structure. Communities arise as a result of user to user interaction. In the current work we aim to predict the evolution of communities, ie to predict their future form. While this problem has been studied in the past as a supervised learning problem with a variety of classifiers, the problem is that the\" knowledge\" of a classifier is opaque and consequently incomprehensible to a human. Thus we have employed first order logic, and in particular the event calculus to represent the communities and their evolution. We addressed the problem of predicting the evolution as an online Inductive Logic Programming problem (ILP), where the issue is to learn first order logical clauses that associate evolutionary events, and particular Growth, Shrinkage, Continuation and Dissolution to lower level events. The lower level events are features that represent the structural and temporal characteristics of communities. Experiments have been performed on a real life data set form the Mathematics StackExchange forum, with the OLED framework for ILP. In doing so we have produced clauses that model both short term and long term correlations.",

In this work, we propose two transfer learning approaches for the splice site recognition problem, which take into account the knowledge we have from the well-studied organisms. We use different representations for the sequences such as the n-gram graph representation and a representation based on biological motifs. Furthermore, we study the case where more than one organisms are available for training and we incorporate information from the phylogenetic analysis between organisms. An extensive evaluation has taken place. The results indicate that the proposed representations and approaches are very promising.",

RTEC can deal with applications where event data arrive with a (variable) delay from, and are revised by, the underlying sources. RTEC can update already recognised events and recognise new events when data arrive with a delay or following data revision.

Though it is not a heavy requirement to rely on some existing PN dictionary (often these resources are available on the web), its coverage of a domain corpus may be rather low, in absence of manual updating. In this paper we propose a technique for the automatic updating of an PN Dictionary through the cooperation of an inductive and a probabilistic classifier.

We then propose a linear-time algorithm for computing all probabilistic temporal intervals of a given dataset.

The goals of the workshop were to present the results of the fourth BioASQ challenge and further the interaction with the wider community of biomedical semantic indexing and question answering. The presenters represented research teams from different parts of the globe and with different viewpoints to the problem. This contributed to a very lively and interesting discussion among the participants of the workshop. Six papers were presented during the workshop. All were selected by peer review for presentation. This volume includes 7 papers and one abstract: The first paper gives an overview of the challenge, including especially the datasets that were used throughout the challenges and the overall results achieved by the participants.The remaining six papers are those presented at the workshop. The first of these papers is a new extension of the MTI system. In particular, Learning to Rank methodology is used as a boosting component of the MTI system. The second paper present a system which includes several multi-label classifiers (MLC) that are combined in ensembles.

This hypothesis is based on the general event based characteristics of the domain as well as former research approaches. Resource management represents a complex task for decision makers; therefore it is taken as a basic use case for this work. It builds up on foundations of resource management (use case and demand side) and event processing (technology and supply side). Methods and results are presented for the identification, definition and validation of events that happen in reality and corresponding event objects which are processed by information systems.",

We here present a novel methodology that takes into account both word representation and relative positioning at various lengths scales in the form of n-gram graphs (NGG). We implemented the NGG approach on short vertebrate and invertebrate constrained genomic sequences of various origins and predicted functionalities and were able to efficiently distinguish DNA sequences belonging to the same species (intra-species classification). As an alternative method, we also applied the Genomic Signatures (GS) approach to the same sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first time that GS are applied on short sequences, rather than whole genomes. Together, the presented \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Background: Biomedical curators are often required to semantically index large numbers of biomedical articles, using hierarchically related labels (eg, MeSH headings). Large scale hierarchical classification, a branch of machine learning, can facilitate this procedure, but the resulting automatic classifiers are often inefficient because of the very large dimensionality of the dominant bag-of-words representation of texts. Feature selection quickly harms the accuracy of the classifiers in this particular task, and dimensionality reduction transformations (eg, PCA-based) usually cannot be efficiently applied to very large corpora. Methods:We examine the use of dense word vectors, also known as word embeddings, as an efficient method of dimensionality reduction that makes hierarchical text classification algorithms more scalable in biomedical semantic indexing, without being less effective than the usual bag-of-words representation. We consider several approaches for the transition from dense word vectors to dense vectors that represent entire texts, proposing the approach that we believe fits better this domain. We experiment with flat and hierarchically expanded K-nearest neighbor classifiers that employ dense vector representations of article abstracts, examining the effect of various parameters. We also present a high precision system that can be combined with the Medical Text Indexer (MTI) system of the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) to improve its performance. Results:",

Furthermore, it shows the advantages of using the proposed method in identifying nodes that play a special role in multi-relational networks, e.g. spammers. Most complex systems involve multiple types of relationships and interactions among entities. Combining information from different relationships may be crucial for various prediction tasks. Instead of creating distinct prediction models for each type of relationship, in this paper we present a tensor factorization approach based on RESCAL, which collectively exploits all existing relations. We extend RESCAL to produce a semi-supervised factorization method that combines a classification error term with the standard factor optimization process. The coupled optimization approach, models the tensorial data assimilating observed information from all the relations, while also taking into account classification performance. Our evaluation on real-world social network data shows that incorporating supervision, when available, leads to models that are more accurate.",

            "Abstract": "Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with algorithms and techniques that allow computer systems to \u201clearn from experience\u201d to successfully solve artificial intelligence problems. Experience is usually provided in the form of problem-specific \u201cexamples\u201d(organized in \u201cdatasets\u201d) that allow the learning system to discover new knowledge and improve its performance on a particular task. If the training examples are not available at the beginning of the learning process, but they are collected during training we have the case of \u201con-line\u201d or incremental learning. If the system is already provided some knowledge about the domain and/or the task, we have the case of knowledge refinement or analytical learning.Machine Learning problems are generally distinguished into three main categories depending on the nature of the datasets: In supervised learning, we are given a set of labeled examples and the aim is to discover the knowledge required for labeling new examples. Typical tasks that fall within the paradigm of supervised learning are classification where a class label is predicted for each input example and regression, where a numerical value is predicted for each input example. In unsupervised learning we are given a set of unlabeled examples and the aim is to identify the underlying structure of the data and extract it in the form of actionable knowledge. Typical unsupervised learning tasks are clustering, where the goal is to identify commonalities among the examples and form interesting clusters, and model estimation, where the knowledge model that generated the data is being sought, eg in the form of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Organisations require techniques for automated transformation of the Big Data they collect into operational knowledge. This requirement may be addressed by employing event processing systems that detect activities/events of special significance within an organisation, given streams of low-level information that are difficult to be utilised by humans [4]. Systems for event processing and in particular event recognition (\u2018event pattern matching\u2019) accept as input a stream of time-stamped, simple or low-level events. A low-level event is the result of applying a computational derivation process to some other event, such as an event coming from a sensor. Using low-level events as input, event processing systems identify composite or high-level events of interest\u2014collections of events that satisfy some pattern. Consider, for example, the recognition of attacks on nodes of a computer network given the TCP/IP messages, the recognition of suspicious trader behaviour given the transactions in a financial market, and the recognition of whale songs given a symbolic representation of whale sounds. Numerous event processing systems have been proposed in the literature [3]. Systems with a logic-based representation of event structures, for example, have been attracting considerable attention. They exhibit a formal, declarative semantics, allowing for verification and a code maintenance, they have proven to be efficient and scalable, and they are supported by machine learning tools, minimising human effort in the system development. In this tutorial, we review formal event processing systems. High-level event \u2018definitions\u2019 impose temporal and, possibly \u2026",

We employ a decoupling scheme of the Event Calculus axioms during the learning process, that allows to learn each clause in isolation.

We discuss five different versions of Naive Bayes, and compare them on six new, non-encoded datasets, that contain ham messages of particular Enron users and fresh spam messages. The new datasets, which we make publicly available, are more realistic than previous comparable benchmarks, because they maintain the temporal order of the messages in the two categories, and they emulate the varying proportion of spam and ham messages that users receive over time. We adopt an experimental procedure that emulates the incremental training of personalized spam filters, and we plot roc curves that allow us to compare the different versions of nb over the entire tradeoff between true positives and true negatives.",

SPEEDD implements event recognition methods (also known as event pattern matching or event pattern detection systems), in order to extract useful information, in the form of events, by processing time-evolving data that comes from various sources (eg, various types of sensor, network activity logs, ATMs, transactions, etc.). The extracted information\u2014recognized and/or forecasted events\u2014can be exploited by other systems or human experts, in order to monitor an environment and respond to the occurrence of significant events. Event recognition methods employ rich representation that can naturally and compactly \u2026",

BioASQ assesses the ability of systems to semantically index very large numbers of biomedical scientific articles, and to return concise and user-understandable answers to given natural language questions by combining information from biomedical articles and ontologies. The 2013 BioASQ competition comprised two tasks, Task 1a and Task 1b. In Task 1a participants were asked to automatically annotate new PubMed documents with MeSH headings. Twelve teams participated in Task 1a, with a total of 46 system runs submitted, and one of the teams performing consistently better than the MTI indexer used by NLM to suggest MeSH headings to curators. Task 1b used benchmark datasets containing 29 development and 282 test English questions, along with gold standard (reference) answers, prepared by a team of biomedical experts from around Europe and participants had to automatically produce answers. Three teams participated in Task 1b, with 11 system runs. The BioASQ infrastructure, including benchmark datasets, evaluation mechanisms, and the results of the participants and baseline methods, is publicly available. A publicly available evaluation infrastructure for biomedical semantic indexing and QA has been developed, which includes benchmark datasets, and can be used to evaluate systems that: assign MeSH headings to published articles or to English questions; retrieve relevant RDF triples from ontologies, relevant \u2026",

Learning MLNs from data is challenging, as their relational structure increases the complexity of the learning process. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of many real-world applications, it is desirable to incrementally learn or revise the model\u2019s structure and parameters.

As information flows, in the form of simple, source events, it becomes more and more difficult to quickly analyze the collected data in an automated way and transform them into operational knowledge. Event recognition (ER) addresses this problem. Several tools exist for defining ER rules, but only a few of them offer graphical design environments. Each such tool supports a single ER language, either query-based or rule-based. Also, many of these systems do not support the addition of user-defined operators, thus limiting the flexibility in rule design. This paper presents the Event Recognition Designer Toolkit (ERDT), a graphical authoring tool, with which a domain expert can design event recognition rules and produce standalone ER.

We present an extension of an interval-based activity recognition system which operates on top of a probabilistic Event Calculus implementation. Our proposed system performs online recognition, as opposed to batch processing, thus supporting data streams. The empirical analysis demonstrates the efficacy of our system, comparing it to interval-based batch recognition, point-based recognition, as well as structure and weight learning models.",

In particular, we propose a method for mining topic hierarchies that may reveal either the collective or the user-specific conceptualization of those domains, as these are reflected by users\u2019 tags. We then propose two alternatives for identifying users\u2019 interests in the domains: The first exploits users\u2019 tags directly, and the second exploits users\u2019 specific conceptualizations of each domain. Both approaches use the collective domain conceptualizations as \u201creference\u201d, to which users\u2019 tags and conceptualizations are compared. The proposed statistical method is parametric-less and does not require any prior knowledge or external resources. We apply the proposed method on the Del. icio. us online bookmarking system and we provide experimental results.",

We aim to promote systems and approaches that are able to deal with the whole diversity of the Web, especially for, but not restricted to, the context of biomedicine. This goal is pursued by the organization of challenges. The fourth challenge, as the previous challenges, consisted of two tasks: semantic indexing and question answering. 16 systems participated by 7 different participating teams for the semantic indexing task. The question answering task was tackled by 37 different systems, developed by 11 different teams. 25 of the systems participated in the phase A of the task, while 12 participated in phase B. 3 of the teams participated in both phases of the question answering task. Overall, as in previous years, the best systems were able to outperform the strong baselines. This suggests that advances over the state of the art were achieved through the BIOASQ challenge but also that the benchmark in itself is very challenging. In this paper, we present the data used during the challenge as well as the technologies which were at the core of the participants\u2019 frameworks.",

            "Abstract": "Background: Dementia occurs through declining of cognitive abilities, and its early detection stands essential for effective preventive measures. However, mainstream diagnostic tests and screening tools, such as Cambridge Cognition Examination (CAMCOG) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), often fail to detect dementia accurately. Various graph-based or feature-dependent prediction and progression models have been proposed. Whenever these models exploit information in the patients\u2019 electronic medical records, they represent promising options to identify the presence and severity of dementia more precisely. Methods: The methods presented in this paper aim to address two problems related to dementia:(a) Basic diagnosis: identifying the presence of dementia in individuals, and (b) Severity diagnosis: predicting the presence of dementia, as well as the severity of the disease. We formulate these two tasks as classification problems and address them using machine learning models based on random forests, analysing structured clinical data from an elderly population cohort. We perform a hybrid data curation method where a dementia expert is in the loop to ensure meaningful curation decisions. We then employ the machine learning algorithms that classify individual episodes into a specific dementia class. Decision trees are also used for enhancing the explainability of decisions made by prediction models, allowing medical experts to identify the most crucial patient features and their threshold values for the detection of dementia. Results: Our experiment results prove that clinical record features (such as age or comorbidities \u2026",

The investigation includes different attribute and distance-weighting schemes, and studies on the effect of the neighborhood size, the size of the attribute set, and the size of the training corpus. Three different cost scenarios are identified, and suitable cost-sensitive evaluation functions are employed.

            "Abstract": "Computational systems and methods are being applied to solve biological problems for many years. Incorporating methods of this kind in the research for cancer treatment and related drug discovery in particular, is shown to be challenging due to the complexity and the dynamic nature of the related factors. Usually, there are two objectives in such settings; first to calibrate the simulators so as to reproduce real-world cases, and second, to search for specific values of the parameter space concerning effective drug treatments. We combine a multi-scale simulator for tumor cell growth and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as a heuristic search method for finding good parameter configurations in reasonable time. The two modules are integrated into a single workflow that can be executed in a parallel manner on high performance computing infrastructures, since large-scale computational and storage capabilities are necessary in this domain. After using the GA for calibration, our goal is to explore different drug delivery schemes. Among these schemes, we aim to find those that minimize tumor cell size and the probability of emergence of drug resistant cells in the future. Results from experiments on high performance computing infrastructure illustrate the effectiveness and timeliness of the approach.",

In this way we are able to support efficient query processing over large spatial ontologies, maintaining the benefits of ontological reasoning. We present a case study for emergency teams during Search and Rescue (SaR) operations showing how an Ontology Data Service (SHARE-ODS) can benefit from a spatial index.

BioASQ aims to push towards systems that will allow biomedical workers to express their information needs in natural language and that will return concise and user-understandable answers by combining information from multiple sources of different kinds, including biomedical articles, databases, and ontologies. BioASQ encourages participants to adopt semantic indexing as a means to combine multiple information sources and to facilitate the matching of questions to answers. It also adopts a broad semantic indexing and QA architecture that subsumes current relevant approaches, even though no current system instantiates all of its components. Hence, the architecture can also be seen as our view of how relevant work from fields such as information retrieval, hierarchical classification, question answering, ontologies, and linked data can be combined, extended, and applied to biomedical question answering. BioASQ will develop publicly available benchmarks and it will adopt and possibly refine existing evaluation measures. The evaluation infrastructure of the competition will remain publicly available beyond the end of BioASQ.",

In this paper, we present an approach discovering probable drug-to-drug interactions, through the generation of a Knowledge Graph from disease-specific literature. The Graph is generated using natural language processing and semantic indexing of biomedical publications and open resources. The semantic paths connecting different drugs in the Graph are extracted and aggregated into feature vectors representing drug pairs. A classifier is trained on known interactions, extracted from a manually curated drug database used as a golden standard, and discovers new possible interacting pairs. We evaluate this approach on two use cases, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Lung Cancer. Our system is shown to outperform competing graph embedding approaches, while also identifying new drug-drug interactions that are validated retrospectively.",

By extension, improving the treatment of patients indirectly enhances the quality of life for families, friends, and careers. Moreover, personalizing effective therapeutic approaches reduces treatment duration, cutting down healthcare monetary costs, which can be redirected to other health and social services. Given that three out of four U.S. families will at some point experience a family member suffering from cancer (http://natamcancer.org/NAP_Native_American_Priorities.pdf), the potential impact of improved cancer treatment is of considerable socio-economic and organizational significance.",

This task is known as word sense disambiguation (WSD) and is one of the hardest and most interesting issues in language engineering. Research on the use of machine learning techniques for WSD has so far focused almost exclusively on English words, due to the scarcity of the required linguistic resources for other languages. The work presented here is the first attempt to apply machine learning methods to Greek words. We have constructed a semantically tagged corpus for two Greek words: a noun with clearly distinguishable senses and a verb with overlapping senses. This corpus is used to evaluate four different machine learning methods and three different representations of the context of the ambiguous word. Our results show that the simple na\u00efve Bayesian classifier and a method using Support Vector Machines outperform decision tree induction, even with the use of boosting. Furthermore, the use of a distance-based weighting function for the context of the ambiguous word does not seem to have a substantial effect on the performance of the methods.",

            "Abstract": "The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary widely used in biomedical knowledge systems, particularly for semantic indexing of scientific literature. As the MeSH hierarchy evolves through annual version updates, some new descriptors are introduced that were not previously available. This paper explores the conceptual provenance of these new descriptors. In particular, we investigate whether such new descriptors have been previously covered by older descriptors and what is their current relation to them. To this end, we propose a framework to categorize new descriptors based on their current relation to older descriptors. Based on the proposed classification scheme, we quantify, analyse and present the different types of new descriptors introduced in MeSH during the last fifteen years. The results show that only about 25% of new MeSH descriptors correspond to new emerging concepts, whereas the rest were previously covered by one or more existing descriptors, either implicitly or explicitly. Most of them were covered by a single existing descriptor and they usually end up as descendants of it in the current hierarchy, gradually leading towards a more fine-grained MeSH vocabulary. These insights about the dynamics of the thesaurus are useful for the retrospective study of scientific articles annotated with MeSH, but could also be used to inform the policy of updating the thesaurus in the future.",

We experimentally verify our claim, quantifying the main factors that affect the performance of text classification. We also argue that the established bag-of-words representation models are inadequate for handling all document types, as they merely extract frequent, yet distinguishing terms from the textual content of the training set.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been shown to achieve good performance when applied to information extraction tasks in both semistructured and free text. The main contribution of this work is the analysis of whether and how linguistic processing of textual data can improve the extraction performance of HMMs. The emphasis is on the minimal use of computationally expensive linguistic analysis. The overall conclusion is that the performance of HMMs is still worse than an equivalent manually constructed system. However, clear paths for improvement of the method are shown, aiming at a method, which is easily adaptable to new domains.",

RTEC supports the expression of rather complex events, such as `two people are fighting', using simple primitives. It can operate in the absence of filtering modules, as it is only slightly affected by data that are irrelevant to the events we want to recognise. Furthermore, RTEC can deal with applications where event data arrive with a (variable) delay from, and are revised by, the underlying sources. RTEC can update already recognised events and recognise new events when data arrive with a delay or following data revision \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this article we compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms on the task of constructing word-sense disambiguation rules from data. The distinguishing characteristic of our work from most of the related work in the field is that we aim at the disambiguation of all content words in the text, rather than focussing on a small number of words. In an earlier study we have shown that a decision tree induction algorithm performs well on this task. This study compares decision tree induction with other popular learning methods and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Our results confirm the good performance of decision tree induction, which outperforms the other algorithms, due to its ability to order the features used for disambiguation, according to their contribution in assigning the correct sense.",

One of the main challenges of precision medicine is the integration and analysis of clinical data. Electronic Health Records (EHR) are comprised of clinical notes and medical reports written in free text containing information from each patient that remains stored in the EHR system unused. Our aim is to exploit and integrate this information to improve lung cancer management using Big Data technologies. Methods: Clinical data from 706 patients diagnosed with lung cancer from 2012 to 2017 and treated at the Medical Oncology Department at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital was obtained. A total of 7,146 clinical reports and 171,878 clinical notes were analyzed, post-anonymization. Our method is based on the execution of a framework built on top of Apache \u2026",

The paper introduces a two-dimensional mapping of Allen's relations, based on orthogonal characteristics of interval relations, namely relative position and relative size. The hourglass-shaped mapping also represents limit cases that correspond to durationless intervals. Based on this mapping, we define two sets of primitive interval relations in terms of the relative positioning and relative size of intervals. These primitives are then used to derive a probabilistic set of Allen's relations. A number of example cases are presented to illustrate how the proposed approach can improve the robustness of interval relations.",

In Task 2a 18 teams participated using 61 registered systems. The systems were evaluated in several performance measures and compared against two baseline systems. Most of them were able to cope with the large scale of the problem while three of them achieved to systematically outperform the state-of-the-art baseline (Medical Text Indexer). A variety of methods have been used like machine learning approaches or search-based ones and hierarchical or flat ones. Specifically, the best systems achieved to enlarge the margin of performance with the MTI system which also this year improved its performance. In Task 2b 8 teams participated in both phases of the task with a total of 15 systems. In both phases the systems were able to achieve good performances and in most cases to achieve better results than the baselines.",

A multiplicative model that is based on the product of those two probabilities is also considered for post-processing.

However, GWAS are not good at capturing the synergistic effects among multiple genetic variants and lack good specificity.    METHODS    We applied tree-based machine learning algorithms (MLs) to discriminate LOAD (> 700 individuals) and age-matched unaffected subjects using single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from AD studies, obtaining specific genomic profiles with the prioritized SNVs.   RESULTS   The MLs prioritized a set of SNVs located in close proximity genes PVRL2, TOMM40, APOE and APOC1. The captured genomic profiles in this region showed a clear interaction between rs405509 and rs1160985. Additionally, rs405509 located in APOE promoter interacts with rs429358 among others, seemingly neutralizing their predisposing effect. Interactions are characterized by their association with specific comorbidities and the presence of eQTL and sQTLs.  DISCUSSION  Our approach efficiently discriminates LOAD from controls, capturing genomic profiles defined by interactions among SNVs in a hot-spot region.",

We show how SRA can be used in Complex Event Recognition in order to detect patterns upon streams of events, using our framework that provides declarative and compositional semantics, and that allows for a systematic treatment of such automata.

The proposed method transforms the ontology concepts and their properties into a vector space representation to avoid the common string matching of concepts and properties at the lexical layer. The proposed evaluation measures exploit the vector space representation and calculate the similarity of the two ontologies (learned and gold) at the lexical and relational levels. Extensive evaluation experiments are provided, which show that these measures capture accurately the deviations from the gold ontology. The proposed method is tested using the Genia and the Lonely Planet gold ontologies, as well as the ontologies in the benchmark series of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative.",

In contrast, personal filters are trained on posts received by a particular user and the reactions of the particular user. Personal filters can provide recommendations tailored to a particular user's interests, which may not coincide with the interests of the majority of users that global filters are trained to predict.

In order to adapt graph-cut minimisation to first order logic, we employ a suitable structural distance for measuring the distance between sets of logical atoms.

We test different variants of the algorithm on a number of different datasets and show that it achieves very good results with only 2% of all email messages labelled by the user.",

In such cases, the guidance of an expert could help the active user. In this paper we provide a definition of expert users that can be reduced into two components the expertise and the contribution. The former is related to the content of items evaluated by an expert and the latter refers to the influence of the expert to the users of a RS.

The templates filled by the base-level IE systems are stacked, forming a set of feature vectors for training a metalevel classifier. Thus, base-level IE systems are combined with a common classifier at meta-level. The proposed framework was evaluated on three Web domains, using well known IE approaches at base-level and a variety of classifiers at meta-level.

However, these examinations are often inaccurate and unreliable either due to human error or due to patients\u2019 physical disability to correctly interpret the questions as well as motor deficit. Erroneous data may lead to a wrong assessment of a specific patient. Therefore, other clinical factors (e.g., gender and comorbidities) existing in electronic health records, can also play a significant role, while reporting her examination results. This work considers various clinical attributes of dementia patients to accurately determine their cognitive status in terms of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score. We employ machine learning models to calibrate MMSE score and classify the correctness of diagnosis among patients, in order to assist clinicians in a better understanding of the progression of cognitive impairment and subsequent treatment. For this purpose, we utilize a curated real-world ageing study data. A random forest prediction model is employed to estimate the Mini-Mental State Examination score, related to the diagnostic classification of patients.This model uses various clinical attributes to provide accurate MMSE predictions, succeeding in correcting an important percentage of cases that contain previously identified miscalculated scores in our dataset. Furthermore, we provide an effective classification mechanism for automatically identifying patient episodes with inaccurate MMSE values with high confidence.

The extracted information\u2014recognized and/or forecasted events\u2014can be exploited by other systems or human experts, in order to monitor an environment and respond to the occurrence of significant events. Event recognition methods employ rich representation that can naturally and compactly represent events with complex relational structure, eg, events that are related to other input/derived events with spatio-temporal constraints. Unfortunately, uncertainty is an unavoidable aspect of real-world event recognition applications and it appears to be a consequence of several factors. Consider for example, noisy or incomplete observations from road sensors, as well as imperfect definitions fraudulent activity. Under situations of uncertainty, the performance of an event recognition system may be seriously compromised. Another important characteristic of the SPEEDD project, is that machine learning algorithms must deal with large amounts of data that continuously evolves. As a result, the current base of event definitions may need to be refined or new events may appear \u2026",

BioASQ is a series of challenges aiming at the promotion of systems and methodologies for large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering. MESINESP represents the first attempt to generate resources for the development and evaluation semantic indexing strategies specialized on health-related content in Spanish. We have generate several publicly accessible Gold Standard collections of manually indexed content covering medical literature, clinical trials and health project descriptions associated to controlled terminologies in the form of the hierarchical DeCS vocabulary. Manual indexing of MESINESP documents was carried out by professional medical literature indexers. They used an indexing web interface particularly adapted for this task. The results obtained by participating teams was promising, showing that training data of semantically indexed medical literature can also serve to implement automatic indexing systems that assist manual indexing of other types of documents like clinical trials.

Using a logical framework for representing and reasoning about events offers direct connections to machine learning, via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), thus allowing to avoid the tedious and error-prone task of manual knowledge construction. However, learning temporal logical formalisms, which are typically utilized by logic-based event recognition systems is a challenging task, which most ILP systems cannot fully undertake. In addition, event-based data is usually massive and collected at different times and under various circumstances. Ideally, systems that learn from temporal data should be able to operate in an incremental mode, that is, revise prior constructed knowledge in the face of new evidence. In this work we present an incremental method for learning and revising event-based \u2026",

The said knowledge is encoded in the form of an owl ontology, the origin of which is attributed to fashion experts. Moreover, in commercial fashion sites, customers purchase garments of various types. Because of that, interesting patterns in their purchase behaviour can be sought, and thus groups of garments that tend to be purchased together can be discovered. This forms the second pillar, that can be used to enhance the first pillar with community based garment recommendations.

Given a hierarchy of classes, two main approaches are used, to automatically classify new instances: flat classification and cascade classification. Flat classification ignores the hierarchy, while cascade classification greedily traverses the hierarchy from the root to the predicted leaf. In this paper we propose a new approach, which extends cascade classification to predict the right leaf by estimating the probability of each root-to-leaf path. We provide experimental results which indicate that, using the same classification algorithm, one can achieve better results with our approach, compared to the traditional flat and cascade classifications.",

The proposed approach learns to select the best classifier for ordering the URLs. This formulation reduces the size of the search space for the RL method and makes the problem tractable. We evaluate the proposed approach on-line on a number of topics, which offers a realistic view of its performance, comparing it also with a RL method and a simple but effective classifier-based crawler.

The increasing volume of unsolicited bulk e-mail (spam) has generated a need for reliable anti-spam filters.

The Naive Bayesian classifier has recently been suggested as an effective method to construct automatically anti-spam filters with superior performance. We investigate thoroughly the performance of the Naive Bayesian filter on a publicly available corpus, contributing towards standard benchmarks. At the same time, we compare the performance of the Naive Bayesian filter to an alternative memory-based learning approach, after introducing suitable cost-sensitive evaluation measures. Both methods achieve very accurate spam filtering, outperforming clearly the keyword-based filter of a widely used e-mail reader.",

The disagreement of the two systems acts as a signal for updating the rule-based system. The generality of the approach is illustrated by applying it to large corpora in two different languages: Greek and French. The results are very encouraging, showing that this alternative use of machine learning can assist significantly in the maintenance of rulebased systems.",

            "Abstract": "Grammars are a powerful representation of sequential patterns of various types, ranging from speech and other audio signals, to biological sequences and user navigation on the Web. The long study of grammars, especially in natural languages, has resulted in a rich repertoire of grammar variants and flavors that provide different representation power and consequently different complexity of analysis. Beyond the issues of representation complexity, most of the work on grammars has focused on their use by parsing programs that analyze strings of a given \u201clanguage\u201d, in order to prove their grammaticalness and/or identify interesting elements of the language.The use of grammars by parsers, especially the more expressive and complex grammars, remains a challenging and interesting research issue on its own. However, grammatical inference goes a step further to study methods that learn grammars from data. Grammatical inference is an established research field in Artificial Intelligence, dating back to the 60s and has been extensively addressed by researchers in automata theory, language acquisition, computational linguistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational learning theory and neural networks. From a theoretical perspective, the main aim of this work is to study the learnability of different types of grammars from different types of data and propose efficient algorithms for learning. In parallel, a significant amount of work focuses on innovative applications of grammatical inference algorithms to various knowledge discovery tasks. The main forum for presenting this type of work in the past 15 years has been the International \u2026",

The proposed framework relies on learning a meta-level classifier, based on the output of base-level information extraction systems. Such systems are typically trained to recognize relevant information within documents, ie, streams of lexical units, which differs significantly from the task of classifying feature vectors that is commonly assumed for metalearning. The proposed framework was evaluated experimentally on the challenging task of training an information extraction system for multiple Web sites. Three well-known methods for training extraction systems were employed at the base level. A variety of classifiers were comparatively evaluated at the meta level. The extraction accuracy that was obtained demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework of collaboration between base-level extraction systems and common classifiers at meta-level.",

Community models represent patterns of usage of the Web site, which can be associated with different types of user. Knowledge of this type is clearly valuable for commercial sites, where each user is a potential customer. We argue that it is equally valuable for non-commercial sites, because it can assist greatly in the improvement of the site. We evaluate three clustering methods on usage data from a large site that covers on-line resources in Chemistry. The size of the site and its high hit rate impose a serious constraint on the scalability of the methods. We also examine two ways of encoding usage data, which give complementary information about the behavior of the users. Finally, the emphasis is on the construction of meaningful community models, by identifying the descriptive characteristics of communities, at a post-processing stage.",

Numerous event recognition systems have been proposed in the literature. Recognition systems with a logic-based representation of event structures, in particular, have been attracting considerable attention because, among others, they exhibit a formal, declarative semantics, they haven proven to be efficient and scalable, and they are supported by machine learning tools automating the construction and refinement of event structures.

The most basic way of hierarchical classification is that of cascade classification, which greedily traverses the hierarchy from root to the predicted leaf. In order to perform cascade classification, a classifier must be trained for each node of the hierarchy. In large scale problems, the number of features can be prohibitively large for the classifiers in the upper levels of the hierarchy. It is therefore desirable to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space at these levels. In this paper we examine the computational feasibility of the most common dimensionality reduction method (Principal Component Analysis) for this problem, as well as the computational benefits that it provides for cascade classification and its effect on classification accuracy.

This is particularly true for the field of biomedicine and clinical research, where medical experts and scientists need to carry out complex search queries against a variety of document collections, including literature, patents, clinical trials or other kind of content like EHRs. Indexing documents with structured controlled vocabularies used for semantic search engines and query expansion purposes is a critical task for enabling sophisticated user queries and even cross-language retrieval. Due to the complexity of the medical domain and the use of very large hierarchical indexing terminologies, implementing efficient automatic systems to aid manual indexing is extremely difficult. This paper provides a summary of the MESINESP task results on medical semantic indexing in Spanish (BioASQ/ CLEF 2021 Challenge). MESINESP was carried out in direct collaboration with literature content databases and medical indexing experts using the DeCS vocabulary, a similar resource as MeSH terms. Seven participating teams used advanced technologies including extreme multilabel classification and deep language models to solve this challenge which can be viewed as a multi-label classification problem. MESINESP resources, we have released a Gold Standard collection of 243,000 documents with a total of 2179 manual annotations divided in train \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The recognition of Proper Nouns (PNs) is considered an important task in the area of Information Retrieval and Extraction. However the high performance of most existing PN classifiers heavily depends upon the avail-ability of large dictionaries of domain-specific Proper Nouns, and a certain amount of manual work for rule writing or manual tagging. Though it is not a heavy requirement to rely on some existing PN dictionary (of-ten these resources are available on the web), its coverage of a domain corpus may be rather low, in absence of manual updating. In this paper we propose a technique for the automatic updating of a PN Diction-ary through the cooperation of an inductive and a probabilistic classifier. In our experiments we show that, whenever an existing PN Dictionary allows the identification of 50% of the proper nouns within a corpus, our technique allows, without additional manual effort, the successful recognition of about 90% of the remaining 50%1 Proper Noun Classification Information Extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting information of interest from unconstrained text and creating a structured representation of this information. In IE we are mainly interested in extracting events. Every event involves a number of named entities, which belong in different semantic classes (eg persons, organisations, locations, dates), and some relationships that hold among these named entities (eg per-sonnel joining and leaving companies in management succes-sion events). As a result, an IE task involves two main subtasks: the recognition of the named entities involved in an event and the recognition of the relationships holding \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The fast emergence and the great success of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has marked a new era in genetics, giving the scientific community the ability to sequence complete genomes in just a few hours. However, it has also brought challenges in ab initio genome annotation, considering the disproportion of the huge amount of data generated and the already annotated data, rendering new computational methods, that can facilitate the annotation process crucial. An essential task in gene annotation is splice site definition, that is the identification of the boundaries (splice donor and acceptor) between the exons and the introns of a gene. Herein, we face the problem of acceptor splice site recognition using transfer learning methods. More specifically, we use transfer learning in order to benefit from the knowledge obtained from the annotation of Caenorhabditis Elegans, which is a model organism \u2026",

We present a novel ontology data service, combining prior domain knowledge about large-scale rescue operations with dynamic information about a developing operation. We also discuss the integration of such a data service into a service-oriented application framework to reach high performance and accessibility, and offer examples of SHARE applications to demonstrate the practical benefits of the approach chosen.",

To support them, we present an intelligent platform for traffic management which includes a new ramp metering coordination scheme in the decision making module, an efficient dashboard for interacting with human operators, machine learning tools for learning event definitions and Complex Event Processing tools able to deal with uncertainties inherent to the traffic use case. Unlike the usual approach, the devised event-driven platform is able to predict a congestion up to 4 minutes before it really happens. Proactive decision making can then be established leading to significant improvement of traffic conditions.",
