            "Abstract": "In cellular and wireless local area networks, wireless communication only occurs on the last link between a base station and the wireless end system. In multihop wireless networks, there are one or more intermediate nodes along the path that receive and forward packets via wireless links. Multihop wireless networks have several benefits: Compared with networks with single wireless links, multihop wireless networks can extend the coverage of a network and improve connectivity. Moreover, transmission over multiple \u2018\u2018short\u2019\u2019links might require less transmission power and energy than that required over \u2018\u2018long\u2019\u2019links. Moreover, they enable higher data rates resulting in higher throughput and more efficient use of the wireless medium. Multihop wireless networks avoid wide deployment of cables and can be deployed in a costefficient way. In case of dense multihop networks, several paths might become available that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We investigate the problem of efficient resource control for elastic traffic in IEEE 802.11 e\u2019s Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism. Our approach considers an economic modelling framework based on congestion pricing that captures how various factors, such as the probability of attempting to transmit a frame, the use of the basic CSMA/CA or the RTS/CTS procedure, and the physical layer transmission rate, contribute to the congestion in an IEEE 802.11 e network using the EDCA mechanism. We discuss the application of the framework for achieving class-based proportional throughput differentiation, for performing explicit congestion notification (ECN) marking based on the level of congestion in the wireless channel, and for modelling the performance of TCP congestion control over EDCA. In the aforementioned application scenarios we discuss how to estimate the optimal minimum contention window and the congestion prices based on the 802.11 e parameters and actual measurements, in order to efficiently utilize the wireless channel. Experiments demonstrate the application of the proposed framework, compare simulation and analytical results, and identify the gains in using the optimal minimum contention window.",

We have implemented and evaluated the proposed channel assignment procedure in an actual metropolitan mesh network with link distances from 1.6 to 5 Km.

In this paper, we propose new deterministic packet marking models in order to characterize DDoS attack streams. Such a common characterization can be used to make filtering near the victim more effective. In this direction we propose a rate control scheme that protects destination domains by limiting the amount of traffic during an attack, while leaving a large percentage of legitimate traffic unaffected. The above features enable providers to offer enhanced security protection against such attacks as a value-added service to their customers, and hence offer positive incentives for them to deploy the proposed models.

In particular, we consider the case of Internet of Things (IoT) actuation and we argue that it is hard to secure such a process. To this end, we propose a \u201cdamage control\u201d approach, where service time is divided into slots and users perform microservice transactions, paying essentially in advance for each one, corresponding to one service slot. Under these circumstances, in the case of service disruption, a user, in the worst case, may lose the amount of money that corresponds to a single micro-service transaction in a single time slot. We implement our solution by leveraging blockchain-based smart contracts, off-chain payments, and one-time Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) passwords. Our solution supports IoT devices with limited processing capabilities and which are not necessarily connected to the Internet. Moreover, with our solution, IoT devices do not interact directly with the blockchain. In fact, they are oblivious to the use of blockchain technology. They do not store any usersensitive information, neither are payments made to or is value stored on the devices.",

Our focus is on the incentives for supporting handovers due solely to the improved performance for all wireless networks. Such incentives arise due to a well-known property of 802.11 networks, where low rate users that send traffic significantly degrade the performance of high rate users that are associated with the same access point. A key difference of this paper compared to other works is that WLANs are self-interested, seeking to improve the performance of their own clients.

            "Abstract": "Since their conception, satellite communications have been regarded as a promising tool for all environments where the terrestrial infrastructure is limited in capacity or to take advantage of the multicasting/broadcasting capabilities inherent in satellite technology. Recent advances have seen satellite technology mature to a more prominent role in the telecommunications domain. In particular, the design of novel satellite payload concepts for Geostationary (GEO) satellite platforms, as well as renewed interest in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have made the integration of satellite and terrestrial networks almost compulsory to ensure new services meet the requirements for high user-rate and quality of experience that could not be achieved using either of the two technologies independently. From this viewpoint, convergence of satellite and terrestrial technologies also requires considering the most recent trends in networking, with special attention being paid to the potential new architectures that have been recently proposed in the framework of Future Internet.This monograph explores the main components of the scenarios above, putting particular emphasis on the networking aspects. To this end, novel protocols such as Multi Path TCP (MPTCP) and networking trends such as Information Centric Networking (ICN) are explored by demonstrating their applicability in some scenarios that deploy both satellite and terrestrial segments. Particular attention is given to smart gateway diversity schemes which advocate the use of sophisticated multi-path transmission schemes to exploit the multi-homing features offered by present day devices \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In IPFS content identifiers are constructed based on the item's data therefore the binding between an item's identifier and its data can be deterministically verified. Nevertheless, once an item is modified, its identifier also changes. Therefore when it comes to mutable content there is a need for keeping track of the \"latest\" IPFS identifier. This is achieved using naming protocols on top of IPFS, such as IPNS and DNSlink, that map a constant name to an IPFS identifier, allowing at the same time content owners to update these mappings. Nevertheless, IPNS relies on a cryptographic key pair that cannot be rotated, and DNSlink does not provide content authenticity protection. In this paper, we propose a naming protocol that combines DNSlink and decentralized identifiers to enable self-verifiable content items. Our protocol provides content authenticity without imposing any security requirement to DNSlink. Furthermore, our protocol prevent fake content even if attackers have access to the DNS server of the content owner or have access to the content owner secret keys. Our proof of concept implementation shows that our protocol is feasible and can be used with existing IPFS tools.",

We consider a different approach, which assumes that only the maximum amount of premium traffic that can be carried across each access link is known. Based on this information, we present three algorithms for determining the bandwidth required for premium traffic in the core network. The first algorithm intermediately estimates the traffic matrix based on the \u201cgravity model\u201d. The other two algorithms compute the worst-case requirements for premium traffic when there are no link failures and fixed routing is used (second algorithm), and when there are link failures and alternative routing paths are available (third algorithm). An important feature of the two worst-case algorithms is that they allow admission control decisions to be based solely on the availability of bandwidth for premium traffic at the access links. We apply and compare the three algorithms for the Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET), which currently uses the third algorithm for its premium IP service. I.",

In this chapter, we focus on the potential of enhancing QoE management mechanisms by exploiting valuable context information. To get a good grip on the basics we first discuss a general framework for context monitoring and define context information, including technical, usage, social, economic, temporal, and physical factors. We then iterate the opportunities and challenges in involving context in QoE monitoring solutions, as context may be, eg, hard to ascertain or very situational. c The Author (s) 2018",

            "Abstract": "The goal of this report is to investigate the optimization of dense WLANs under various control mechanisms that include MAC layer parameter control, Access Point (AP) coverage control through beacon power control (also referred to as cell breathing), AP assignment, and channel assignment. This is important for projects, such as BT\u2019s Wireless Cities, whose goal is to achieve a blanket WiFi coverage across a whole city. To achieve such coverage, APs need to be deployed in a dense manner, hence there will be areas of overlapping coverage from more than one APs. If the APs are operated in an ad hoc manner, with no planning of the channel assigned to each AP or of the area covered by each AP, then there can be significant interference in the overlapping areas. This will result in reduced performance not only for wireless clients located in the overlapping areas, but for all wireless clients. The mechanisms mentioned above exist, in some basic form, in current generation wireless AP devices. However, the vendors and subsequently managers of dense AP networks either disregard them or use them in a suboptimal manner. Until today, there is no systematic investigation of the joint optimization of all the aforementioned mechanisms. There are only a few works that look at the combined optimization of at most two mechanisms, and most focus on physical layer performance metrics, such as the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) or the aggregate throughput, which does not account for how resources are shared among different clients.

Two additional novel aspects of the approach are that ECN marking for a wireless link, due to the way resources are shared, is performed for both the uplink and the downlink based on measurements of the aggregate traffic in both directions, and the marking mechanism dynamically adapts to varying traffic and load conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves higher fairness compared to drop-tail queueing, and can effectively control the average packet delay over the wireless link.",

            "Abstract": "Internet Protocol (IP)-based networks and TCP/IP-applications are steadily getting more popular. Many applications require more than best-effort service, ie they need Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Studies of customer expectations [Alt00] indicate that users would like service differentiation. Today\u2019s networks cannot support different requirements coming from different applications, since the methodology, mechanisms and their implementations are not yet mature. Some mechanisms assuring service differentiation and QoS support in IP-based networks are available, like the Integrated Services (IntServ) and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) standardised by IETF, but it is not clear how to use these in order to deliver the service end-to-end with the quality agreed with a user. Nor is it clear which parameters to use to express quality at the application service level, ie the quality the user can directly perceive. Moreover, mapping these parameters to network performance parameter is not a trivial task. In addition, no services are charged for the quality they are provided with.The EURESCOM project P906-GI QUASIMODO (Quality of Service Methodologies and solutions within the service framework: Measuring, Managing and Charging QoS) tried to answer some of these issues. The main idea of offering a reasonable set of quality classes to users according to their needs and possibilities (eg to pay) was investigated by developing and implementing the QUASI-model.",

            "Abstract": "OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. It facilitates secure service provisioning, as well as secure interoperability among diverse stakeholders. All OAuth 2.0 protocol flows result in the creation of an access token, which is then used by a user to request access to a protected resource. Nevertheless, the definition of access tokens is transparent to the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which does not specify any particular token format, how tokens are generated, or how they are used. Instead, the OAuth 2.0 specification leaves all these as design choices for integrators. In this paper, we propose a new type of OAuth 2.0 token backed by a distributed ledger. Our construction is secure, and it supports proof-of-possession, auditing, and accountability. Furthermore, we provide added-value token management services, including revocation, delegation, and fair exchange by leveraging smart contracts. We realized a proof-of-concept implementation of our solution using Ethereum smart contracts and the ERC-721 token specification.",

Extensive simulation experiments indicate that adaptive marking can effectively address the unfairness problem, without decreasing network utilization. The proposed approach can be implemented using a Bandwidth Broker architecture, whereby a centralized Bandwidth Broker sets the control parameter of the adaptive markers, based on the current traffic contracts.",

The algorithms are applied locally to measurements collected from three locations of an experimental network and under two attack intensities. The results show that the cumulative sum algorithms are more robust and achieve higher performance under both attack intensities.

VCs are a secure means for expressing claims about a subject. Although VCs are ideal for encoding capabilities, the lack of standards for exchanging and using VCs impedes their adoption and limits their interoperability. We mitigate this problem by integrating VCs into the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. To this end, we propose a new form of OAuth 2.0 access token based on VCs. Our approach leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to encode VCs and takes advantage of JWT-based mechanisms for proving VC possession. Our solution not only requires minimum changes to existing OAuth 2.0 code bases, but it also removes some of the complexity of verifying VC claims by relying on JSON Web Signatures: a simple, standardized, and well supported signature format. Additionally, we fill the gap of VC generation processes by defining a new protocol that leverages the OAuth 2.0 \"client credentials\" grant.",

The framework is based on microeconomics and congestion pricing, and seeks to exploit the joint control of the transmission rate and the signal quality in order to achieve efficient utilization of network resources, in a distributed and decentralized manner. An important feature of the framework is that it incorporates both the congestion for shared resources in wireless and wired networks, and the cost of battery power at mobile hosts. We prove that for elastic traffic, where users value only their average throughput, the user's net utility maximization problem can be decomposed into two simpler problems: one involving the selection of the optimal signal quality, and one involving the selection of the optimal transmission rate.

However, post-handover delay is a problem for delay-sensitive mobile applications, as they need to (re-) submit their subscriptions and wait for them to get resolved and (probably re-) transmitted before receiving the demanded data. To avoid this problem and optimize performance, this paper proposes a Mobility-based Proactive Multicast (MPM) scheme. Unlike reactive or blind multicast solutions proposed in the past, MPM takes autonomous decisions locally at various network access points (cells) prior to the movement of mobile clients, using a semi-Markov mobility prediction model that predicts next-cell transitions, along with anticipating the duration between the transitions for an arbitrary user in a cellular network.

The simulation environment is based on 802.11 Physical and Mac layer. It employs single source unicast traffic and consists of two scenarios with high and low interference respectively. A key contribution of this study is the demonstration of the throughput-delay trade-off for various forwarding schemes, including network-coding based ones, under a more realistic wireless model where link loss rates are determined dynamically by the SINR criterion.",

The Internet of Things (IoT) is progressing at a fast pace, and IoT devices are becoming pervasive in our physical environments, bringing the vision of Intelligent Environments closer to reality. At the same time, the newly-introduced blockchain technology is offering for the first time ever cryptographically proven trust based on a set of mutually untrusted nodes. Blockchain technology thus has the potential to become a key component of many IoT systems, offering them an unprecedented level of accountability, transparency, and reliability. This paper first lays out the principles on which blockchain systems are operating, along with descriptions of the most noteworthy blockchain implementations. It then presents a number of systems through which blockchains may interact with external systems and third-party data sources. Finally, it provides a survey of the state-of-the-art blockchain-based systems targeting IoT applications. View Full-Text",

We present an analytical framework that can identify when the cooperation is expected to be beneficial for both operators, and estimates the expected performance gains in different scenarios, which include single/multi-channel and single/multi-radio cases. Analytical results indicate that there are cases where cooperation can yield significant performance improvements for both WMNs. The analytical results are validated with \u2026",

The main contribution of this paper is a network layer mechanism, capable of differentiating service, while improving fairness and aggregate throughput in the presence of both uplink (TCP) and downlink traffic. We exploit a class based weight fair queuing (CBWFQ) scheme, properly supplemented by two algorithms that perform periodical weight adjustments.

SOFIE is a proposal for applying distributed ledger technology (DLT) to securely and openly federate IoT platforms. SOFIE\u2019s approach is based on the idea of using interconnected distributed ledgers as a cornerstone to build decentralised business platforms that support the interconnection of diverse IoT systems. Among other things, the ledgers are used to provide openly accessible metadata about the individual IoT platforms, to define business and other rules on how to connect to the platforms, and to securely record audit trails that can be used to resolve disputes.",

            "Abstract": "In this work we utilize Signal to Interference-plus-Noise (SINR) criterion for reception, and combine it with the model for partial channel overlap presented in [1] and extended for 802.11 a/g, to quantify the impact of Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) in multi-radio 802.11 a/g based wireless nodes designed for mesh networking. The nodes we consider are equipped with two to four 802.11 a or 802.11 g wireless interfaces and a variety of directional antennas. Our study focuses mainly on 802.11 a, since we expected that the ACI would be almost inexistent in this protocol, due to better frequency allocation. Indeed, adjacent channels in 802.11 a are widely considered to be non-overlapping. However, as we have seen in this work, adjacent 802.11 a channels have in fact an overlap that produces significant interference whose impact will be noticeable when the antennas are closely co-located on a node, even in the case where directional antennas are used. We examine how this close placement affects the cell radius of such a node with respect to the offered data rates for the uplink, and the 802.11 a/g clear channel assessment (CCA) mechanism. Our results are verified by initial short range experiments performed on off-the-shelf 802.11 a cards.Our future work includes both uplink and downlink testing through in-lab experimentation with channel emulation over programmable RF attenuators and through experiments on a metropolitan scale mesh network. We also intend to revisit the model proposed in [1] and refine it, taking into account the partial overlap of the OFMD subcarriers of 802.11 a/g.",

We evaluate the cost and transaction delay of DLTs in a location-based mobile game ecosystem using two types of blockchains (permissioned and permissionless or public), based on defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Our evaluation shows the advantages of using both types of blockchains as well as interledger technologies that combine them. Permissioned blockchains enable high performance, eg, in terms of throughput and delay, and low cost, while permissionless (public) blockchains, through their transparency, immutability, and openness, support trust and facilitate interactions among unrelated parties. Finally, we show that the combination of IoT devices and DLTs in mobile gaming offers new business opportunities and enables innovative business models for both traditional mobile gaming companies and other participants in the ecosystem, eg, game players, cafes, malls, and similar establishments, advertising companies, and independent programmers.

In this paper we propose Edge-ICN: a novel approach for deploying ICN in a single large network, such as the network of an Internet Service Provider. Although Edge-ICN requires nothing beyond an SDN-based network supporting the OpenFlow protocol, with ICN-aware nodes only at the edges of the network, it still offers the same benefits as a clean-slate ICN architecture but without the deployment hassles. Moreover, by proxying legacy traffic and transparently forwarding it through the Edge-ICN nodes, all existing applications can operate smoothly, while offering significant advantages to applications such as native support for scalable anycast, multicast, and multi-source forwarding. In this context, we show how the proposed functionality at the edge of the network can specifically benefit CoAP-based IoT \u2026",

Based on this model, we propose procedures for combined rate and time slot allocation to achieve efficient utilization of wireless resources, while taking into account user requirements. These procedures can be applied using a class-based framework that allows simple implementation and requires simple communication between the network and its users, which select a service class reflecting their valuation for the average throughput and for the percentage of time slots in which they can transmit data.",

In the present work, we propose an adaptive scheme to bound the CWNDmax value in an IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network. Our contributions are the following. First, we conduct simulation experiments to establish the argument that the optimum CWNDmax value depends on the buffer availability, when the network is not saturated, and is irrelevant to it, otherwise. Then, we introduce a time based expression for the network's bandwidth-delay product (BDP), in order to set CWNDmax dynamically. This expression accounts both for spatial reuse and for the packets' queue waiting time. The latter is necessary, since the TCP timer is set according to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Focusing in competitive environments where each party acts in its own self-interest and not towards a common goal, the objective of this paper is to investigate the incentives that can trigger handovers of wireless nodes that operate at low rates to neighboring access points that operate in the same channel but belong to other networks. The handovers address the well-known problem in IEEE 802.11 networks, that the assignment of low-rate and high-rate users to the same access point significantly degrades the performance of the high-rate users. This fact gives rise to incentives for performing handovers, due solely to the improved performance handovers yield for both wireless networks. In order to investigate when such incentives arise for wireless networks operating in the same contention area, and to quantify the corresponding gains, a modeling framework is proposed. The modeling framework estimates the throughput of wireless nodes in IEEE 802.11 WLANs and aims to identify the specific cases that handovers yield performance improvements and advise the wireless network operators whether or not to share their resources. This paper extends our previous work (Fafoutis & Siris 2009) by integrating a revised analytical model which includes the case of uplink traffic and provides more accurate approximations. The analysis indicates that there can be significant performance improvements for both parties in both the case of downlink and uplink traffic. The accuracy of the modeling framework is verified through simulations.",

A node\u2019s received rate can be communicated to neighboring nodes by piggy-backing it on control packets, such as CTS and RTS messages, or data packets. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can improve TCP\u2019s fairness in a multihop wireless network compared to drop tail queueing, while achieving the same aggregate throughput. Moreover, the proposed approach yields smaller average packet delay and delay jitter compared to drop tail queueing.",

The tools consist of stand-alone1 modules that implement advanced statistical analysis procedures and a flexible web-based interface through which a user can create, modify, save, and execute experiments using the statistical analysis modules. The tools do not assume a specific source traffic model, but rather process actual measurements of network traffic. Indeed, the theory that the tools are based on can identify the time-scales that affect a link\u2019s performance, hence suggest the appropriate time granularity of traffic measurements. We present and discuss case studies that demonstrate the application of the tools for answering questions related to network management and dimensioning, such as the maximum link utilization when some quality of service is guaranteed, how this utilization is affected by the link buffer and traffic \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is a realization of the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, where routing is based on content identifiers rather than on network location identifiers. The routing state in NDN can grow exponentially, not only due to the huge number of content identifiers (as opposed to network addresses) but also because it is difficult to detect \"fake\" routing advertisements. For example, in contrast to IP-based routing, a potentially valid routing entry in NDN can be advertised from multiple network locations, making NDN susceptible to Denial-of-Service attacks at the routing layer. In this paper, we leverage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to build self-verifiable \"content advertisements.\" With our solution, any router can verify that a content advertisement originates from an \"authorized\" entity, without requiring any trusted third party.

A goal of this work is to study how purely wireless primitives and design characteristics affect a routing scheme with opportunistic features and thus design a new such scheme. To this end we introduced a simple framework under which, through simulation, we defined the key elements of an adaptive probabilistic forwarding scheme.

Based on this information, we present three algorithms for determining the bandwidth required for premium traffic in the core network. The first algorithm intermediately estimates the traffic matrix based on the \"gravity model\". The other two algorithms compute the worst-case requirements for premium traffic when there are no link failures and fixed routing is used (second algorithm), and when there are link failures and alternative routing paths are available (third algorithm).

While there are several usage scenarios [3] and business opportunities [4] and there exist the so called community based mesh networks that are operated by individuals, the real business potential lies in operator based mesh networks. Such examples include Ozone's mesh network in Paris (www. ozone. net/en/) and The Cloud in the City of London (www. thecloud. net). If such pilot projects turn out to be successful, then mesh networking may become extremely popular and wide-spread.In order to turn the tremendous business potential represented by mesh networking into real profit, one needs to solve a number of technical problems related to the design and operation of mesh networks. In this chapter, we address one of those problems: securing mesh networks in a cross layer manner and ensuring resilient operation. It is evident that security and resilience issues need to be considered seriously and solved appropriately. Unlike the wireline networks, the unique characteristics of wireless networks pose a number of nontrivial challenges to resilience and security design, such as open peer-to-peer network architecture, shared wireless medium, stringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic network topology.",

The fixed spectrum allocation of governmental agencies results in unused portions of spectrum, which are called \"spectrum holes\" or \"white spaces\". CR technology overcomes this issue, allowing devices to sense the spectrum for unused portions and use the most suitable ones, according to some pre-defined criteria. Spectrum assignment is a key mechanism that limits the interference between CR devices and licensed users, enabling a more efficient usage of the wireless spectrum. Interference is a key factor that limits the performance in wireless networks.

Second, we propose a new approach for providing service differentiation, while achieving high wireless network utilization.

A key property of the proposed contention-aware transmission time (CATT) metric is that it is isotonic, hence can be applied to link-state routing protocols. We have implemented the CATT metric in the OLSR routing protocol, and evaluate it in a test-bed with mesh nodes each equipped with four radio interfaces. Our experiments show that the proposed routing metric significantly outperforms other metrics that have appeared in the literature, in a number of scenarios that correspond to different mesh network topologies.",

The analytical framework is generalized for an arbitrary number of paths and hops per path. Another key contribution of the study is the evaluation and extension of the numerical results, drawn from the analysis, through system-level simulations.

We then iterate the opportunities and challenges in involving context in QoE monitoring solutions, as context may be, eg, hard to ascertain or very situational. c The Author (s) 2018 I. https://doi. org/10.1007/978-3-319-90415-3 Ganchev et al.(Eds.): Autonomous Control _2 for a Reliable Internet of Services, LNCS 10768, pp. 23\u201348, 2018.",

The approach takes into account resource usage in the uplink direction, and captures the tradeoff between having a large cell with many users versus having a smaller cell with fewer users, which however are able to transmit at a higher rate. Our numerical investigations demonstrate how cell coverage determined using the above approach is affected by various system parameters, such as the path propagation characteristics, the mobile power limit, and the distribution of mobile hosts within a cell.",

Our test-bed evaluation considers both the long-term throughput achieved by wireless stations and the short-term fairness. When all stations have the same transmission rate, optimality is achieved when a station's throughput is proportional to its weight factor, and the optimal minimum contention windows also maximize the aggregate throughput. When stations have different transmission rates, the optimal minimum contention window for high rate stations is smaller than for low rate stations. Furthermore, we compare proportional fairness \u2026",

Eg, SatCom can effectively support smart FI-enabled transportation systems, smart FI-enabled security and public safety systems, as well as smart FI-enabled healthcare systems.Such FI application domains refer to information collection and dissemination services/applications within the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d communication paradigm, where the real physical world is connected to the digital world through a multitude of sensors and actuators. In particular, satellite M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications, currently a relatively small market compared to that of terrestrial wireless networks, is expanding, led by the growing need to track and monitor difficult-to-reach valuable assets. Satellite M2M networking is gaining popularity in a wide range of governmental and commercial markets owing to the considerable benefits offered by the technology [4]. For certain industries, such as oil and gas, utilities, and transportation and distribution, wherein large numbers of assets are deployed in remote locations with inadequate cellular coverage, M2M becomes an expensive proposition unless satellite networks are used (and deployed, if needed). Satellite M2M is preferred for high-end applications requiring wide coverage, particularly in oceans, deserted, or rural areas, and for performing mission-critical monitoring.",

(2003), according to which a node relays packets for a particular neighbor based on the amount of given help it has received from that neighbor. The second algorithm maintains the difference between the amount of received and the amount of given help within bounds defined by a token bucket, and yields higher throughput in the case of bursty traffic.

We show that this is not the case. ACI does exist in 802.11a, and we can quantify its magnitude and predict its results. For this, we present minor modifications of a simple model originally introduced by that allow us to calculate bounding values of the 802.11a ACI, which can be used in link budget calculations.

At the European Union (EU) level, the Cybersecurity Act establishes a common cybersecurity certification framework supporting the coexistence of different certification schemes across Member States. However, its realization needs to be sustained by technical approaches to enable ICT stakeholders from different sectors or countries to exchange cybersecurity information and evaluate the up-to-date security level of an ICT system throughout their lifecycle. Toward this end, we propose a blockchain-based platform using a novel interledger design, where ledgers associated with ICT artifacts, cybersecurity certificates, and vulnerabilities are interconnected.

For the setup of the testbed and to estimate the induced ACI we utilized a theoretical model, already verified on an in-lab wireless testbed emulator [Angelakis, 2008].

            "Abstract": "In wireless mesh networks, low transmission rate links create bottlenecks that degrade the end-to-end throughput. To make matters worse, low rate links degrade the performance of neighboring links that operate on the same channel, due to the long duration of low rate transmissions and the per-packet fairness of the 802.11 MAC protocol [1].One approach for mitigating the performance degradation due to low rate links is to consider routing protocols with metrics such as ETT [2], WCETT [2] and CATT [3], which take the transmission rate into account. In wireless LANs, another approach is to use relay nodes in order improve performance by having multiple high rate transmissions instead of a single low rate transmission [4][5]. The above works either focus on a single network or assume full cooperation between the nodes. Our work, on the other hand, considers the case of wireless mesh networks which belong to different operators, which act in their own selfinterest. For such a scenario, we investigate the incentives for cooperation due solely to performance improvements that cooperation can yield for all mesh networks.",

A key contribution of the paper is to capture the tradeoff between packet delay and throughput achieved by combining multipath forwarding and network coding, and compare this tradeoff with that of simple multipath routing where different flows follow different paths, the transmission of multiple copies of packets over multiple paths, and single path routing. The analytical framework considers the case of end-to-end retransmission for achieving reliability, and is generalized for an arbitrary number of paths and hops. We also derive the minimum and maximum number of coded packets that are needed at the receiver to retrieve all packets sent by the sender; this can be used to obtain a lower \u2026",

An important feature of the model is that it dynamically adapts caching decisions to the relative importance of the two factors. For DASH adaptation we discuss a procedure that exploits mobility and throughput prediction to select the quality levels of video segments requested by a DASH player in order to achieve improved QoE, in terms of both high video quality and few video quality switches.",

The first follows a well-known approach considering a constant busy station probability at each idle-sensed slot, equal to the load of the envisaged single-server queue. We extend the analysis of this model to calculate more accurately the throughput seen by a station in non-saturation conditions, by considering alternating ON/OFF periods. The second model uses this ON/OFF process structure for calculating attempt and collision probabilities, and subsequently performance measures, based on regenerative process theory.

In this paper, we present a survey of interledger approaches, discussing and comparing their underlying mechanisms. A shared motivation for all of the discussed interledger solutions is to move away from the \u201cone chain rules them all\u201d model to one that allows the interconnection of multiple ledgers, with different features and advantages, while also supporting innovation. The interledger approaches discussed in this survey include (1) atomic cross-chain transactions \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The recent paradigm shift in the Internet's usage, from the host-centric to a content-centric communication model, where users request information irrespectively of its location, is coupled with an increasing need for converged and seamless access over heterogeneous wired and wireless networks. By integrating satellite communication components into a publish-subscribe Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architecture, we jointly exploit the capabilities and advantages of each: transparent use of terrestrial multicasting and satellite broadcasting, content-based traffic engineering, multipath transfer, in-network caching capabilities, and seamless mobility. Experimenting over a realized integrated-terrestrial ICN testbed, we demonstrate and illustrate key functionalities and gains for various services and applications.",
