Efficient solar radiation time series prediction is regarded as a challenging task for researchers both in the past and at present. This paper deals with solar radiation time series prediction. To date an essential research effort has been made and various methods are proposed that have different mathematical backgrounds, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy predictors, evolutionary and genetic algorithms. In the present study the solar radiation time series prediction combines the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. The EMD is an adaptive signal processing technique that decomposes the nonstationary and nonlinear signals into a set of components with a different spatial frequency content. It results in a small set of new time series that are easier to model and predict. The \u2026",

After stressing at the condition of maximum substrate current, the experimental data show that TFTs suffer from substantial on-current reduction. Through numerical simulation, it is shown that the stress-induced degradation increases the density of the band tail traps in a region extending 200 nm from the drain and the series resistance on the drain side. It is found that the origin of the noise is reverted from carrier number fluctuation for the unstressed to the mobility fluctuation for the stressed device.",

In this paper, the authors investigate the effects of vacuum annealing on encapsulated single layer graphene field effect transistors (SLG-FETs). The stability of GFETs is monitored for a period of up to six months, and different annealing times and atmospheres are tested to recover lost electronic performance. Fabricated encapsulated devices based on a parylene-C/aluminum passivation layers offer increased stability over exposed back-gated devices, but still suffer from a significant Dirac point shift over extended air exposure.

At higher gate voltages, Isub increases monotonically with increasing the gate voltage, which is attributed to the temperature rise owing to self-heating.

In this paper, we present a micro-\u2010grain structured silicon deposited by DC sputtering on special copper foil that serves as current collector. It is demonstrated that high-\u2010density silicon anodes are obtained with more than 2000 mAh g-\u20101 and 2.0 mAh cm-\u20102 which can be considered as a commercial value. Finally, it is found that with such anodes the irreversible capacity during the first galvanostatic cycle can be lower than 20%.",

Micro-grain amorphous silicon was deposited on special copper foil and it is shown that after several decades of galvanostatic cycles, it preserves its granular nature with minor degradation. In order to shed light on the lithiation mechanisms of the micro-grain silicon, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on silicon half-cells at various State-of-Charge (SoC) and various discharging current values and the Solid-Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) RSEI and polarization resistance Rpol were determined. Results reveal that Rpol highly increases for cell voltages lower than 0.2 V and it strongly depends on the discharging C-rate. From X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements combined with surface sputtering, the existence of a LixSiyOz interlayer between SEI and silicon is confirmed \u2026",

A set of physical measurements and simulated signals are selected for the time series analysis. The empirical mode decomposition is applied and the adaptive basis of each raw signal is extracted. The decomposed narrow-band amplitude and frequency modulated signals are modelled by using dynamic artificial neural networks (ANNs).

The most commonly used photodetectors in these systems are avalanche photodiodes, pin photodiodes and phototransistors. Because avalanche photodiode has internal gain, it offers the most sensitive receivers at lower frequencies. A pin photodetector is structurally very simple and the speed of this device depends on the intrinsic layer. For high speed operation this layer should be completely depleted [1]. Even though silicon phototransistors show high linearity and sensitivity [2], they present low optical gain and slow response speed, due to the minority carrier storage in the neutral base region. Several types of photodetectors with high sensitivity and quantum efficiency have been developed for optical communications [3-5]. Among these are devices like the a-SiC: H bulk barrier color detector [7], the npn heteroctructure optoelectronic switch [8], the majority\u2013carrier camel diode or the bulk barrier diode [3-15]. Several published models describe the electrical and optoelectronic properties of such structures [3-7, 9, 12]. However, there are only few studies on the optical response speed and the transient behavior of these structures under pulse illumination [7]. In this paper, we present an extensive study of the optical response speed of silicon Bulk\u2013Barrier Diodes (BBDs) using simulation results. Based on the model presented in previous works [6, 12], we have developed an analytical model, which accurately describes the silicon BBD\u2019s cut\u2013off, fc, frequency (optical response speed) when a modulated light is applied, as a function of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The electrical characteristics of Pd Schottky contacts on ZnO films have been investigated by current-voltage (I\u2013V) and capacitance\u2013voltage (C\u2013V) measurements at different temperatures. ZnO films of two thicknesses (400 nm and 1000 nm) were grown by DC-magnetron sputtering on n-Si substrates. The basic structural, optical and electrical properties of these films are also reported. We compared the two Schottky diodes by means of characteristic parameters, such as rectification ratio, ideality factor (\u03b7), barrier height (\u03a6b) and series resistance and obtained better results for the 1000 nm-ZnO Schottky diodes. We also discussed the dependence of I\u2010V characteristics on temperature and the two distinct linear regions observed at low temperatures are attributed to the existence of two different inhomogeneous barrier heights. From I\u2013V plots in a log-log scale we found that the dominant current-transport mechanism at \u2026",

A series of factors affecting the electrical characteristics of the switches are studied here. Three factors, among all others studied here, exerting most significant influence on both first and second breakdown of the switches are amorphous SiC film width and both c-Si (p) region width and doping concentration. The above factors can be easily varied on device manufacture procedure and their combination, also including all other factors studied here, led to improved electrical characteristics of the switches. This means lowering of forward breakover voltage VBF at first breakdown and forward voltage drop VF after first breakdown at the ON state of the switch to 11V and 9.5 V \u2026",

In this paper, we present micro-grain structured silicon deposited by DC sputtering on special copper foil that serves as current collector. It is demonstrated that high-density silicon anodes are obtained with more than 2000 mAh g\u22121 and 2.0 mAh cm\u22122 that can be considered as a commercial value. In addition, irreversible capacity during the first galvanostatic cycle can be lower than 20% for such anodes. Finally, it is found that there exists a clear correlation between the grain-size and the texture of the amorphous silicon to the electrochemical performance of half-cells.",

INTRODUCTION Bulk-Barrier-Diodes (BBD) have recently gained growing interest for the ap-plication as photodiodes with internal gain| 3|, mixers 5 and as high sensitivity temperature sensors| 4|. Previous work| 3| considers only the inter-band transition of Optically excited carriers, since the number of lattice defects is minimized after the diode annealing| 6|. The present work studies the influence of lattice defects produced during ion implantation on the BBD electric and optical properties and investigates whether such an influence can be employed into a useful application. Section 2 gives a brief description of BBD and an explanation of the appearance and distribution of lattice defects during ion implantation. Experimental results are reported in section 3 and discussed in section 4.",

            "Abstract": "Resistive chemical sensors were developed having as sensitive film graphene oxide (GO) spin-coated on glass. Sensor electrical behaviour to room temperature relative humidity was evaluated. High sensitivity characterizes GO sensor. However, it lacks repeatability and long term stability. To this end, we developed spin-coated GO sensors with different active layer thickness, which were subjected to subsequent thermal annealing steps. It was found that the resulting reduced GO (rGO) sensors demonstrate excellent stability compromising, though, the sensitivity which mainly depends on the number of annealing steps and film thickness. Finally, we propose a rapid, transparent, low-power consumption rGO sensor, enabling its use in relevant applications.",

For this purpose, we grew graphene oxide films via spin-coating on glass substrates followed by thermal reduction. The electrical resistance of the planar device was then measured. We observed that resistance is significantly increased after water vapor exposure and remains stable even after 250\u2009days in ambient conditions. Various techniques were applied to desorb the water and decrease (recover) the material's resistance, but it was achieved only with low temperature thermal annealing (180\u2009\u00b0C) under forming gas (H2/N2 mixture). The permanent effect of water absorption was also detected by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",

The presented RNN can offer both daily and hourly prediction concerning solar irradiation forecasting. As a result, the proposed model can be used to predict the Photovoltaic Systems output of the HYRES and provide valuable feedback for PMSs of the understudy autonomous system. To do so a flexible network based design of the HYRES is used and, moreover, applied to a specific system located on Olvio, near Xanthi, Greece, as part of SYSTEMS SUNLIGHT S.A. facilities. As a result, the RNN after training with meteorological data of the aforementioned area is applied to the specific HYRES and successfully manages to enhance and optimize its PMS based on the provided solar radiation prediction.",
