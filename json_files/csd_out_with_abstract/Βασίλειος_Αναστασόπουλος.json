The Cameron coherent target decomposition (CTD) is employed to characterize each pixel, using a set of canonical scattering mechanisms in order to describe the physical properties of the scatterer. The novelty of the proposed classification approach lies on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to uniquely characterize each type of land cover. The motivation to this approach is the investigation of the alternation between scattering mechanisms from SAR pixel to pixel. Depending on the observations-scattering mechanisms and exploiting the transitions between the scattering mechanisms we decide upon the HMM-land cover type. The classification process is based on the likelihood of observation sequences been evaluated by each model. The performance of the classification approach is assessed my means of fully polarimetric SLC SAR data from the broader area of Vancouver, Canada and was found satisfactory, reaching a success from 87% to over 99%.",

For this purpose, a feed-forward neural network is employed, and a successive training procedure is applied in order to incorporate into the network structure knowledge about recovering folded frequencies and, therefore, obtain output colour images with fine resolution. The successive training of the network takes place in three consecutive steps. The training data used in each step are of higher resolution than those used in the previous step. A decimation procedure, based on a generally acceptable super-resolution model, is employed to create from the original multispectral bands all the required down-sampled series of input training data vectors.

The novelty of the proposed nonuniform interpolation approach to SR image reconstruction lies in the employment of Kriging interpolation technique.

            "Abstract": "Sun's luminosity in the visible changes at the 10-3 level, following the 11 years period. This variation increases with energy, and in X-rays, which should not even be there, the amplitude varies up to ~ 105 times stronger, making their mysterious origin since the discovery in 1938 even more puzzling, and inspiring. We suggest that the multifaceted mysterious solar cycle is due to some kind of dark matter streams hitting the Sun. Planetary gravitational lensing enhances (occasionally) slow moving flows of dark constituents toward the Sun, giving rise to the periodic behavior. Jupiter provides the driving oscillatory force, though its 11.8 years orbital period appears slightly decreased, just as 11 years, if the lensing impact of other planets is included. Then, the 11 years solar clock may help to decipher (overlooked) signatures from the dark sector in laboratory experiments or observations in space.",

Of interest are also axion miniclusters, in particular, if the solar system has trapped one during its formation. Wide-band axion antennae fit this concept, but also the proposed fast narrow band scanning. A network of detectors can provide full time coverage and a large axion mass acceptance.

For an intoxicated person, vessels on the forehead become more active so that the intensity of the pixels in this region is modified accordingly. The behavior of the local difference patterns for a drunk person is different than that of a sober one and accordingly drunkenness can be ascertained by only using the thermal infrared image of the intoxicated person.

The approach used is a 3-D FFT based experimental procedure without applying any theoretical concept from velocity filters. Accordingly, each velocity filter is built using the spectral signature of an object moving with specific velocity. Experimentation reveals the capabilities of the constructed filter bank to separate moving objects as far as the amplitude as well as the direction of the velocity are concerned. Accordingly, weak objects can be detected when moving with different velocity close to strong vehicles. Accelerating objects can be detected only on the part of their trajectory they have the specific velocity. Problems which arise due to the discontinuities at the edges of the frame sequences are discussed.",

            "Abstract": "Evidence of dark matter (DM) comes from long-range gravitational observations, where it is understood to not interact with ordinary matter. However, on a much smaller scale, a number of unexpected phenomena contradict this idea of DM. This is because some solar activity and the dynamic Earth atmosphere might arise from DM streams. Gravitational (self-)focusing effects by the Sun or its planets of streaming DM fit as the underlying process, e.g., for the otherwise puzzling 11-year solar cycle, the mysterious heating of the solar corona with its fast temperature inversion, etc. Observationally driven, we arrive to suggest an external impact by as yet overlooked \u201cstreaming invisible matter\u201d, which reconciles some of the investigated mysterious observations. Unexpected planetary relationships exist for the dynamic Sun and Earth atmosphere and are considered as the signature for streaming DM. Then, focusing of DM streams could also occur in exoplanetary systems, suggesting for the first time the carrying out of investigations by searching for the associated stellar activity as a function of the exoplanetary orbital phases.

The classification performance for each cover type is studied separately on each spectral band, while the combined performance of the most promising spectral bands is explored. In addition to GLCM, spectral co\u2010occurrence matrices (SCM) formed by measuring the transition from band\u2010to\u2010band are employed for improving classification results. Conventional classifiers and voting techniques are used for the classification stage.

Single pixels, called Permanent Scatterers (PS), overcome this difficulty since they are coherent over time and over wide look-angle variations. Permanent Scatterers identification using interferographic techniques is unfeasible since they require the use of many acquisitions. Samsonov and Tiampo have presented a technique that selects Permanent Scatterers by analyzing their Polarization Phase Difference (PPD). The PPD approach would work just fine looking for single bounce scatterers because they are invariant to any initial arbitrary rotation between the scatterer and the radar Line of Sight (LOS). We propose to replace the PPD technique with Cameron\u2019s Coherent Target Decomposition (CTD) because it is more accurate in finding the single and double bounce \u2026",

The idea is based on streaming DM axions, whose flux might get temporally enormously enhanced due to gravitational lensing. This can happen if the Sun or some planet (including the Moon) is found along the direction of a DM stream propagating towards the Earth location. The experimental requirements to the axion haloscope are a wide-band performance combined with a fast axion rest mass scanning mode, which are feasible. Once both conditions have been implemented in a haloscope, the axion search can continue parasitically almost as before. Interestingly, some new DM axion detectors are operating wide-band by default. In order not to miss the actually unpredictable timing of a potential short duration signal, a network of co-ordinated axion antennae is required, preferentially distributed world-wide. The reasoning presented here for the axions applies to some degree also to any other DM candidates like the WIMPs.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, a novel ship detection procedure is presented for radar signals whose backscattering power is of the same order while their polarimetric characteristics differ greatly. The stochastic nature of the polarimetric characteristics of the background (clutter) and the target signal (ship) can be adequately described by first-order Markov chains (FMCs). The proposed feature corresponds to the joint probability of sequential states of variable finite sequential segments of the FMCs. The classic Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection theory is adapted to the discrete space of the Markov experimental distributions of the proposed feature while the adaptive thresholding technique is overcome by considering a global model for describing the clutter. Performance assessment of the proposed detection procedure is carried out by means of three sets of FMCs each one corresponding to a clutter-target pair for different \u2026",

The Markov-chain-based CFAR detector extends traditional probability density function (pdf) based CFAR detection to first-order Markov chain model by considering both correlation between neighboring pixels and pdf information in CFAR detection. With the additional correlation information, the proposed approach results in advancing the performance of conventional CFAR detectors. Moreover, to take advantage of full polarizations of polarimetric data, various data fusion methods are considered to improve detection performance, including polarimetric transformation, principal component analysis, and decision fusion. Our experimental results confirm the superiority of the new Markov chain polarimetric CFAR detector over conventional pdf \u2026",

In its final phase of solar axion searches (2013--2015), CAST has returned to evacuated magnet pipes, which is optimal for small axion masses. The absence of a significant signal above background provides a world leading limit of  (95% C.L.) on the axion-photon coupling strength for  eV. Compared with the first vacuum phase (2003--2004), the sensitivity was vastly increased with low-background x-ray detectors and a new x-ray telescope.

The correct extraction of scatterer polarimetric properties will lead to the correct classification of the scatterer predominant scattering mechanism. Huynen used the congruence transformation by a special unitary matrix to diagonalize the Sinclair matrix into a real and nonnegative diagonal matrix. He also expressed the special unitary matrix in terms of the polarization ellipse parameters and associated them with the scatterer orientation, asymmetry, and skip angle. Unfortunately, this association was found misleading. As a result, it makes the scatterer classification ambiguous, for it is based on the scatterer skip angle and the diagonal matrix.

Images of different resolution, originating from scanner, successively train a neural network, which learns to improve resolution from 25 to 50 pixels-per-inch (ppi), then from 100 to 200 ppi and finally, from 50 to 100 ppi. Thus, the network is provided with consistent knowledge regarding the point spread function (PSF) of the scanner, whilst it gains the generalization ability to reconstruct finer resolution images unfamiliar to it. The novelty of the proposed image-resolution-enhancement technique lies in the successive training of the neural structure with images of increasing resolution. Comparisons with the image scanned at 400 ppi demonstrate the superiority of our method to conventional interpolation techniques.",

This model is introduced because the K-polf which has been used in the past\" for this purpose, occasionally fails to do so. Such cases are met when the speckle of the clutter deviates from Rayleigh pdf due to the small area of the resolution cell. The speckle and the modulation components of the new compound polf are described using the generalized gamma polf (GT-pdf). A thermal noise component is incorporated in the statistical model. Although it is not possible to have a closed form expression for the model itself, its moments can be obtained in relatively simple expressions and consequently be used for clutter characterization. Using the equivalence of theoretical and experimental moments, real data show very good agreement with the proposed model. The K-polf is proved to be a special case of the GC-pdf.",

The feature extraction procedure employs directional-vectors, similar to those used in chain codes, which provide a global measure of the signature image. The signature trace is transformed into the feature vector by measuring the directional strength of line segments having a chessboard distance equal to two. A probabilistic neural topology is employed for the design of the classifier. In order to obtain comparable results, the method was applied to a database already used in the literature. The verification procedure provides low classification error for authentic signatures while it eliminates the forgers.",

            "Abstract": "A new search strategy for the detection of the elusive dark matter (DM) axion is proposed. The idea is based on streaming DM axions, whose flux might get temporally enormously enhanced due to gravitational lensing. This can happen if the Sun or some planet (including the Moon) is found along the direction of a DM stream propagating towards the Earth location. The experimental requirements to the axion haloscope are a wide-band performance combined with a fast axion rest mass scanning mode, which are feasible. Once both conditions have been implemented in a haloscope, the axion search can continue parasitically almost as before. Interestingly, some new DM axion detectors are operating wide-band by default. In order not to miss the actually unpredictable timing of a potential short duration signal, a network of co-ordinated axion antennae is required, preferentially distributed world-wide. The reasoning presented here for the axions applies to some degree also to any other DM candidates like the WIMPs.",

Both features are coming from the thermal images of the face of the inspected persons and have been derived using different image analysis techniques. Thus, they convey dissimilar information, which has to be transferred onto the same framework and fused to result into a decision with improved reliability. For this purpose conventional data association techniques are employed to explore the available information. These data association techniques are gating, normalization and weighting. After that, fusion of the information is carried out using Support Vector Machines. The resulting decision is of higher reliability compared to those achieved using the individual features separately. Experimental results are provided based on an existing sober-drunk database. The main advantage of the method is that it is not invasive and all the information is acquired remotely. In practice, an electronic system incorporating the proposed approach will point out to the police to whom an extended inspection for alcohol consumption is due. 1",

This kind of representation incorporates a full description of the underlying pdf as well as any order of statistical correlation. Among the useful and meaningful parameters of the transition matrix are its eigenvalues. In natural signals, transition matrices have only a small number of their elements with significant value. This fact can be used to device relatively simple Markov chain models for clutter representation. The target statistics can also be modeled by means of a Markov chain model.

With the additional correlation information, the proposed approach results in advancing the performance of conventional CFAR detectors. Our both analytical and experimental results both show that the new Markov chain CFAR detector can improve the conventional PDF CFAR detector about 30% in terms of detection probability gain and about 2.84 dB in terms of signal-to-clutter ratio gain.",

            "Abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems are active sensors offering unique high spatial resolution regardless of weather or other conditions, with wide area coverage over swaths up to 500km across. Furthermore, SAR data can be acquired with great reliability to enable precision monitoring of Earth\u2019s surface. These properties make SAR data the first candidate for operational, near-real-time applications like natural crisis monitoring and surveillance of extensive areas. In the field of Earth observation, SAR is a useful tool for operational or pilot services related to security and the environment. For example, ship detection and identification based on SAR data is a key part of any service or system dealing with maritime traffic, illegal fishery, or sea border activity, or with ocean and coastal management issues such as oil spill detection and monitoring. SAR images have high spatial resolution, so they can be used in sea surface ship monitoring. Ships are typically constructed from large flat metal sheets and hence are usually radar bright and detectable in SAR imagery. 1 Oceangoing ships tend to be larger and made of metal, whereas coastal boats are smaller and may be made of wood or fiberglass. Moreover, when oil slicks occur, they are typically associated with ships. A ship detection system generally consists of five stages, shown in Figure 1. After the image is registered, the land is masked, since most ship detectors produce false alarms when applied to land areas. In some cases, a preprocessing step is necessary to provide more accurately calibrated SAR data. The third step is the actual detection process, which uses constant false alarm rate \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this work, facial thermal infrared images are employed for intoxicated person discrimination. Specifically, the region of the forehead of the face of the sober and the corresponding intoxicated person is used to test if the employed Local Difference Patterns (LDPs) constitute discriminative features. For an intoxicated person, vessels on the forehead become more active so that the intensity of the pixels in this region is affected accordingly. The LDPs employed ignore orientation of the pixels distribution and give emphasis on the first and second norms of the differences as well as the ordered values of the pixels in the employed kernels. The statistics of the LDPs for the drunk person are different from those of the sober one and accordingly drunkenness can be ascertained by comparing the thermal infrared image of the corresponding sober and intoxicated person. Six from the eight LDPs examined to be used \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Fusion of hyperspectral data is proposed by means of partitioning the hyperspectral bands into subgroups, prior to principal components transformation (PCT). The first principal component of each subgroup is employed for image visualization. The proposed approach is general, with the number of bands in each subgroup being application dependent. Nevertheless, the paper focuses on partitions with three subgroups suitable for RGB representation. One of them employs matched-filtering based on the spectral characteristics of various materials and is very promising for classification purposes. The information content of the hyperspectral bands as well as the quality of the obtained RGB images are quantitatively assessed using measures such as the correlation coefficient, the entropy, and the maximum energy-minimum correlation index. The classification performance of the proposed partitioning approaches is \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Neural networks were tested on infrared images of faces for discriminating intoxicated persons. The images were acquired during controlled alcohol consumption by forty-one persons. Two different experimental approaches were thoroughly investigated. In the first one, each face was examined, location by location, using each time a different neural network, in order to find out those regions that can be used for discriminating a drunk from a sober person. It was found that it was mainly the face forehead that changed thermal behaviour with alcohol consumption. In the second procedure, a single neural structure was trained on the whole face. The discrimination performance of this neural structure was tested on the same face, as well as on unknown faces. The neural networks presented high discrimination performance even on unknown persons, when trained on the forehead of the sober and the drunk person \u2026",

These quantities are evaluated using the convex deficiency of the shape as well as orientation dependent variations of its convex hull. The proposed topological feature vector is prone to problems or instabilities imposed by the rectangular grid. The computational load is related to the time needed for convex hull and Euler number evaluation. Its classification results are satisfactory when it is used in separating typewritten letters or a small number of binary silhouettes.",

This novel experimental technique, in the field of dark energy research, exploits both the chameleon coupling to matter (\u03b2m) and to photons (\u03b2\u03b3) via the Primakoff effect. By reducing the X-ray detection energy threshold used for axions from 1 keV to 400 eV CAST became sensitive to the converted solar chameleon spectrum which peaks around 600 eV. Even though we have not observed any excess above background, we can provide a 95% C.L. limit for the coupling strength of chameleons to photons of \u03b2\u03b3 1011for 1 <\u03b2m<106.",

The features are coming from the thermal images of the face of the inspected persons and have been derived using different image analysis techniques. Thus, they convey dissimilar information, which has to be transferred onto the same framework and fused to result into a decision with improved reliability. Conventional data association techniques are employed to explore the available information. After that, fusion of the information is carried out using Neural Networks. The resulting decision is of higher reliability compared to those achieved using the individual features separately. Experimental results are provided based on an existing sober-drunk database. The main advantage of the method is that it is not invasive and all the information is \u2026",

The Huber (H) cost function is employed to measure the difference between the projected estimate of the HR image and each LR frame. The bilateral Total Variation (TV) regularization is incorporated as a priori knowledge about the solution. The proposed HTV super-resolution approach that employs the Huber norm in combination with the bilateral TV regularization exhibits superior performance to former SR method. Thus the effect of outliers is significantly reduced and the high-frequency edge structures of the reconstructed HR thermal infrared image are preserved. The proposed technique is also tested on frames that are corrupted by Gaussian noise and proves superior when compared to existing regularized SR method.",

The second part is actually observationally driven.

            "Abstract": "The Sun, a typical middle-aged star, is the most important astronomical body for life on Earth, and since ancient times its phenomena have had a key role in revealing new physics. Answering the question of why the Sun moves across the sky led to the heliocentric planetary model, replacing the ancient geocentric system and foreshadowing the laws of gravity. In 1783 a Sun-like star led the Revd. John Mitchell to the idea of the black hole, and in 1919 the bending of starlight by the Sun was a triumphant demonstration of general relativity. The Sun even provides a laboratory for subatomic physics. The understanding that it shines by nuclear fusion grew out of the nuclear physics of the 1930s; more recently the solution to the solar neutrino \u201cdeficit\u201d problem has implied new physics.This progress in science, triggered by the seemingly pedestrian Sun, seems set to continue, as a variety of solar phenomena still defy theoretical understanding. It may be that one answer lies in astroparticle physics and the curious hypothetical particle known as the axion. Neutral, light, and very weakly interacting, this particle was proposed more than 25 years ago to explain the absence of charge-parity (CP) symmetry violation in the strong interaction. So what are the problems with the Sun? These lie, perhaps surprisingly, with the more visible, outermost layers, which have been observed for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. First, why is the corona-the Suns atmosphere with a density of only a few ngr/m3-so hot, with a temperature of millions of degrees? This question has challenged astronomers since Walter Grotrian, of the Astrophysikalisches Observatorium in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The sub-micron range in the field of short distance interactions has yet to be opened to experimental investigation, and may well hold the key to understanding al least part of the dark matter puzzle. The aKWISP (advanced-KWISP) project introduces the novel Double Membrane Interaction Monitor (DMIM), a combined source-sensing device where interaction distances can be as short as 100 nm or even 10 nm, much below the 1-10 micron distance which is the lower limit encountered by current experimental efforts. aKWISP builds on the technology and the results obtained with the KWISP opto-mechanical force sensor now searching at CAST for the direct coupling to matter of solar chameleons. It will reach the ultimate quantum-limited sensitivity by exploiting an array of technologies, including operation at milli-Kelvin temperatures. Recent suggestions point at short-distance interactions studies as intriguing possibilities for the detection of axions and of new physical phenomena.",
