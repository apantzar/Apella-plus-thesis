            "Abstract": "In this paper, the interior elastic direct and inverse scattering problem of time-harmonic waves for a non-penetrable partially coated obstacle placed in a homogeneous and isotropic medium is studied. The scattering problem is formulated via the Navier equation, considering incident circular waves due to point-source fields, where the corresponding scattered data are measured on a closed curve inside the obstacle. Our model, from the mathematical point of view, is described by a mixed boundary value problem in which the scattered field satisfies mixed Dirichlet-Robin boundary conditions on the Lipschitz boundary of the obstacle. Using a variational equation method in an appropriate Sobolev space setting, uniqueness and existence results as well as stability ones are established. The corresponding inverse problem is also studied, and using some specific auxiliary integral operators an appropriate modified factorisation method is given. In addition, an inversion algorithm for shape recovering of the partially coated obstacle is presented and proved. Last but not least, useful remarks and conclusions concerning the direct scattering problem and its linchpin with the corresponding inverse one are given.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper the problem of scattering of time-harmonic electromagnetic waves by a mixed impedance scatterer in chiral media is considered. Our scatterer is a partially coated chiral screen, for which an impedance boundary condition on one side of its boundary, and a perfectly conducting boundary condition on the other side, is satisfied. The direct scattering problem for the modified Maxwell equations is formulated and the appropriate Sobolev space setting is considered. Issues of solvability due to uniqueness and existence are discussed. The corresponding inverse scattering problem is studied and uniqueness results concerning the mixed impedance screen are proved. Further, the shape reconstruction of the boundary of the partially coated screen is established. In particular, a chiral far-field operator is introduced and new results concerning its properties are proved. A modified linear sampling method based on a factorization of the chiral far-field operator, in order to reconstruct the screen is also presented. We end up with useful conclusions and remarks for screens in chiral media.1. Introduction. In recent years various papers have been written on electromagnetic scattering problems for an isotropic or an anisotropic medium [14]-[16],[19],[22] and [25]. The field of direct and inverse scattering theory in electromagnetics has been applied widely, and many applied mathematicians and in general scientists have been occupied with this active field for the past twenty years. Especially for inverse scattering problems, the aim of research is to determine shapes of unknown obstacles which satisfy different type of boundary conditions. Such \u2026",

A method for solving inverse scattering problems is proposed, and the support of the scattering obstacle is found by noting the unboundedness of the L2-norm of the Herglotz densities as an interior point approaches the boundary of the scattering object from inside the scatterer.

We begin by employing a modified version of the well known factorization method, in which a computationally effective numerical scheme for the reconstruction of the shape of the scatterer is presented. This is possible, due to a mixed reciprocity principle, which renders the computation of the Green function at the background medium unnecessary. Moreover, to further refine our inversion algorithm, an efficient Tikhonov parameter choice technique, called Improved Maximum Product Criterion (IMPC) is exploited. Our regularization parameter is computed via a fast iterative algorithm which requires no a priori knowledge of the noise level in the far-field data. Finally, the effectiveness of IMPC is illustrated with various numerical examples.",

Through the polar solutions integral representation the Navier eigenvectors are expressed in an integral form. Moreover their linear indepedence and completeness over smooth curves in the L2-sense are presented. Two far-field patterns, the longitudinal and the transverse one corresponding to a displacement field, are introduced. It is proved that the elastic Herglotz solution admits a representation as a superposition of plane waves over the unit circle with amplitude distributions the longitudinal and the transverse Herglotz kernels, which coincide with the corresponding far-field patterns.",

We study the direct scattering problem as well as the inverse one. The direct problem for the Navier equation is formulated in a dyadic form and the issues of solvability due to uniqueness, existence and regularity are discussed. Uniqueness results for the corresponding inverse scattering problem are proved. In particular, the unique determination of the non-penetrable partially coated obstacle with its boundary condition as well as of the penetrable interface(s) between the layered media are established via the knowledge of the far-field pattern for elastic waves. The proof of the uniqueness is based on a mixed reciprocity relation and its connection between plane-waves and point-sources. The paper at hand deals with two-dimensional \u2026",

The main purpose of this paper is to establish scattering relations for the elastic point-source excitation of a nested piecewise homogeneous scatterer. To this direction, we establish reciprocity principles and general scattering theorems relating the scattered fields with the corresponding far-field patterns. Furthermore, for a scatterer excited by a point-source and a plane wave, mixed scattering relations are derived.

In particular the improved variant of the linear sampling method (LSM), the so called (F*F)1/4-method is studied for the two dimensional elastic transmission case. For our reconstructions we assume that the far field data are noisy and we employ the L-curve for the selection of the regularization parameter. The location of the vertex of the L-curve yields an appropriate value of the regularization parameter. Furthermore, the L-curve approach does not require a priori knowledge of the noise level, and hence combined with the LSM can be used for real world reconstructions, in which noise in the data is unknown.",

Its main drawback however is that it requires complete far-field data.Recently Kirsch 6 improved the original version of the linear sampling method, leading to the so-called (F* F) 1/4-method.
