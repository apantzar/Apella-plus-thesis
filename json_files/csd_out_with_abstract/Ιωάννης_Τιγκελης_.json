            "Abstract": "For the required upgrades of the Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating system at the stellarator Wendelstein 7-X, the development of a 1.5 MW 140 GHz Continuous Wave (CW) prototype gyrotron has started. KIT has been responsible to deliver the scientific design of the tube (i.e. the electron optics design and the RF design), with contributions from NKUA and IPP. The prototype gyrotron has been ordered at the industrial partner, Thales, France, and is expected to be delivered in 2021. In parallel, a short-pulse pre-prototype gyrotron has been developed at KIT, to provide the means for a first experimental validation of the scientific design in ms pulses, prior to the construction of the CW prototype. This paper reports on the status of the 1.5 MW CW gyrotron development, focusing on the scientific design and its numerical and experimental validation.",

            "Abstract": "In tokamak fusion plasmas, coherent fluctuations in the form of blobs or filaments and incoherent fluctuations due to turbulence are routinely observed in the scrape-off layer. Radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves, excited by antenna structures placed near the wall of a tokamak, have to propagate through the scrape-off layer before reaching the core of the plasma. RF waves in the electron cyclotron and lower hybrid range of frequencies are commonly used to modify the current profile. In the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), electron cyclotron waves are expected to stabilize the neoclassical tearing mode by providing current in the island region. While the effect of fluctuations on RF waves has not been quantified experimentally, there are telltale signs, arising from differences between results from simulations and from experiments, that fluctuations can modify the spectrum of RF waves. Consequently, pioneering theoretical studies and complementary computer simulations have been pursued to elucidate the impact of fluctuations on RF waves. These studies, using the full complement of Maxwell\u2019s equations for a cold, magnetized plasma, show that the Poynting flux in the wake of the filament develops spatial structure due to diffraction and shadowing. The uniformity of power flow into the plasma is affected by side-scattering, modifications to the wave spectrum, and coupling to plasma waves other than the incident RF wave. The Snell\u2019s law and the Fresnel equations have been reformulated within the context of magnetized plasmas. These are distinctly different from their counterparts in scalar dielectric media, and \u2026",

Depressed collector operation with 180s pulses (pulse length limited by the HV power supply at KIT) at the Low Voltage Operating Point (I b ~45 A, V acc ~71 kV) resulted in 0.8 MW RF output power with 37 % total efficiency. Similar results were obtained for the High Voltage Operating Point (I b ~40 A, V acc ~80 kV) also. The experiments on the CW gyrotron with pulse duration of up to 1 hour will be continued in 2017 at SPC, Lausanne. In parallel, further experiments with the almost identical, modular short-pulse (SP) version of the gyrotron 2 , which delivered more than 1.2 MW, are currently ongoing at KIT in order to identify ways to further improve the performance of the CW prototype.",

The Floquet theorem and an appropriate standing waves expansion is employed to express the fields in the vacuum region and inside the grooves, respectively. The application of the boundary conditions leads to an infinite system of equations, which is solved numerically by truncation. The main advantage of the procedure employed is that it gives directly and with a few spatial harmonics the dispersion relation. Furthermore, an adequate procedure (simulation tool) has been introduced in order to distinguish the real roots from spurious solutions and it has been found to work effectively for all cases presented in this work. Numerical results are presented for both shallow and deep grooves and comparison with previously published works is made.",

The development of such parasitic oscillations degrades the beam quality reducing the efficiency of the cyclotron interaction and the overall produced power. Furthermore, it affects the stability of operation1-3. Several design approaches have been implemented in order to suppress the parasitic modes; most of them involve the increase of the dissipation in the beam tunnel by means of lossy ceramic materials. However, despite the increased losses, parasitic oscillations still appear in most new designs, especially when the produced power and/or operating frequency is increased4. In this work, we employ the numerical code FISHBONE5, in order to study the parasitic modes which may appear in a gyrotron beam tunnel. Furthermore, the effect of the geometry of the structure as well as the various design parameters on the parasitic modes is studied, in order to identify the origin and properties of the parasitic oscillations.",

            "Abstract": "Radio frequency waves are routinely used in tokamak fusion plasmas for plasma heating, current control, and as well as in diagnostics. These waves are excited by antenna structures placed near the tokamak's wall and they have to propagate through a turbulent layer known as scrape-off layer, before reaching the core plasma (which is their target). This layer exhibits coherent density fluctuations in the form of blobs and filaments. The scattering processes of RF plane waves by single blob is studied, with the assumption that the blob has cylindrical shape and infinite length. The axis of the blob is not necessarily aligned with the externally applied magnetic field in the case of plane waves. The investigation concerns the case of Electron Cyclotron (EC) waves ($f_0$=170 $GHz$) for ITER-like and Medium Size Tokamak applications (such as TCV, ASDEX-U, DIII-D, etc) as well as the case of Low Hybrid (LH) waves ($f_0$=4.6 $GHz$) for ALCATOR C-MOD Tokamak device. The study covers for a variety of density contrasts between the blobs and the ambient plasma and a wide range of blob radii.",

            "Abstract": "The diffraction phenomenon caused by metal transverse irises placed into an asymmetrical slab waveguide is examined by using the integral equation method. We concentrate on the possibility of controlling the radiation characteristics of the structure by changing the irises positions and the slab waveguide asymmetry. The aperture electric-field distribution is expressed in terms of a finite series of Chebyshev polynomials. The dominant TE guided-mode reflection and transmission coefficients, the near-field distribution and the far-field radiation pattern are calculated, while numerical results are presented for several cases of asymmetrical slab waveguides and different irises\u2019 positions.",

In order to optimize the gyrotron operation, the tube was at first thoroughly tested in the short-pulse regime, with pulses that did not exceed 10 ms, for a wide range of operational parameters. Then, and after proper conditioning of the tube, the operation was extended to longer pulses with duration up to 180 s, which is the maximum pulselength possible at the KIT test facility. In this paper, we present in detail the achievements of the long-pulse experimental campaign.",

In this code, the local transverse structure of the TE mode is adapted to the solution of the complex cold dispersion relation of an infinite, homogeneous, dielectric coated cylindrical waveguide. Before considering the realistic situation, the validity of the TE pure mode (Ez\u2009=\u20090) assumed in TWANGlinspec had to be assessed for SiC or BeOSiC materials. The effect of the dielectric layer on the parasitic starting current is large for parasitic oscillations localized at the end of the beam duct and in the so-called spacer region.

The beam tunnel is studied parametrically with a full-wave code, which calculates the diffraction and dielectric losses of the cold-cavity modes.

In the frame of the EU DEMO reference design, the R&D activities consider the injection of about 50 MW of Electron Cyclotron (EC) power to support and assist different plasma phases. As the project is still in the conceptual phase, a range of options for gyrotrons, transmission lines and antennas is under assessment taking into account the guidelines for the integration of EC system in a nuclear reactor and a maximal achievable reliability and availability of the EC power during operation.",

Inferring boundary conditions leads to a system of two infinite sets of equations, which is solved numerically by truncation. A numerical code has been developed to calculate the dispersion relation and the electromagnetic field components.

In favor of dynamic ACI being a real physical effect, there are some experimental findings that could be attributed to it, as well as some physical rationale indicating the possibility of a mode being resonant with the beam at different frequencies in different regions. However, the interaction codes used in dynamic ACI prediction up to now are based on simplifications that put questions on their capability of correctly simulating this effect.

These formulas can be introduced to interaction codes in a quite straightforward way. Full-wave approaches that account for the azimuthal periodicity of the structure and consider azimuthal spatial harmonics to describe the field distributions have been also employed, increasing though the complexity of the solution and the effort given in numerical calculations.

All nanopillars produced by an etching top-down process conform to this physical model. At first sight, electrons in such structures should have an equal probability of being everywhere, so confinement effects and consequently band-gap changes should not be present. However, experimentally, confinement effects are observed. We show, by a proper effective mass equation analysis of the combined pillars and substrate system, that eigenstates with a high degree of localization exist in the pillars \u2013 irrespective of the height of the pillar.

            "Abstract": "The practical and economic viability of tokamak fusion reactors depends, in a significant way, on the efficiency of radio frequency (RF) waves to deliver energy and momentum to the plasma in the core of the reactor. Among the various attributes of RF waves is their ability to heat magnetically confined plasmas, induce plasma currents in an effort to achieve steady state, and modify the current profile so as to control plasma instabilities like the neoclassical tearing modes. The RF electromagnetic waves, excited by antenna structures placed near the wall of a tokamak, have to propagate through the turbulent plasma in the scrape-off layer (SOL) along their path to the core plasma. While the propagation and damping of RF waves in the core is reasonably well understood, the same is not true for RF propagation through the SOL. In present day fusion devices, the radial width of the SOL is of the order of a few centimeters. In ITER and in future fusion reactors this width will be of the order of tens of centimeters. Any deleterious effects on RF waves due to plasma turbulence in the SOL has to be properly understood in order to optimize the delivery of RF energy and momentum into the core. This paper is on a multi-pronged approach that is being pursued to quantify the effect of SOL plasma on RF waves. The SOL is composed of coherent filamentary, or blob like, structures and incoherent fluctuations. For coherent structures a full-wave theoretical model has been developed. This model is used to benchmark computational codes that are subsequently used to study general distribution of filaments, thereby extending the range of the theoretical formulation \u2026",

In order to optimize heating and current drive by RF waves, it is necessary to understand the effect of turbulence on the propagation characteristics of the waves. A common approach towards quantifying the effects of turbulence on RF waves is the Kirchhoff technique. The wave fields and their normal derivatives are evaluated at a surface, separating two different densities, using physical optics. The fields at any point on this surface are approximated to be the same as the fields on a tangent plane at that point. The results from this theoretical analysis are compared with full-wave numerical simulations. A complementary set of studies is to construct the effective permittivity of turbulent plasmas that are a mix of coherent (blobs and \u2026",

This paper reports on the latest results and plans with regard to the two 2 MW gyrotron prototypes, the industrial prototype at CRPP\u2019s CW test stand and a modular pre-prototype at KIT. The industrial prototype was delivered to CRPP end of September 2011 and reached an output power of 2 MW at an efficiency of 45 % and with good RF beam pattern, in only four days of short pulse RF test. These results validated all design changes made in reaction to the results of the experiments in 2008.

            "Abstract": "Radio Frequency (RF) waves are routinely used in tokamaks for heating, current drive, NTM control, as well as for diagnostics purposes. Frequently, RF waves, aiming towards the plasma core, propagate through a turbulent environment. The latter can exhibit strong coherent density fluctuations as well as filamentary structures mainly (though, not perfectly) aligned along the local magnetic field lines. The scattering process of RF waves by these structures is studied both analytically and numerically. RF waves can be either single plane waves or spatially confined beams. For that purpose, the filaments are considered to have cylindrical shape with infinite length with the cylinder axis not aligned with the local magnetic field and the results are compared to the ones from the study of the aligned case [1, 2]. On the other hand, the interfacial density fluctuations are considered periodic with spatial periods larger, smaller or of the same order of the wavelength of the incident RF waves. The frequency range of the RF waves studied is mainly in the Electron Cyclotron (EC) range of frequencies for ITER-like and Medium Size Tokamak applications. Furthermore, the study covers a variety of density contrasts, filament sizes and fluctuation strengths.(a) Main assumptions and the geometry",

A major target of the upgrade is to increase the installed microwave power. To this end, a prototype Continuous-Wave (CW) 1.5 MW, 140 GHz gyrotron is under development, which is planned to be followed by two additional series tubes.

The design of the ITER gyrotron is based on the EU expertise in the series production of high power and long pulse gyrotrons for the W7-X stellarator, and incorporates key improvements recently validated to enhance the quality of the electron beam at the cavity and the output RF beam at the window. Following a risk-reducing staged approach, the design was first verified in 2015 with tests on a short pulse prototype, showing> 1 MW of output RF power at the right frequency (\u223c 170.1 GHz) in stable and reproducible conditions. The electronic efficiency (\u223c 35%) obtained with the short pulse gyrotron was consistent with an\u223c 50% output efficiency in voltage depression and in a CW electrostatic configuration. No parasitic oscillations were observed and a high quality of the output RF beam was measured (TEM 00\u223c 98%). A CW gyrotron prototype was then produced with the same design of the internal RF and electronic components. The CW prototype was delivered in November 2015 to the KIT gyrotron test facility, where it will be tested in 2016. This paper presents the main experimental results from the main prototyping and qualification activities aiming to demonstrate compliance with the ITER specifications and reduce the technical risks during the series production phase.(author)",

            "Abstract": "The EU programme for the development of the gyrotron for ITER, carried out in cooperation between European laboratories and industrial partners, consists of (i) the manufacturing and testing the 2 MW, CW coaxial cavity gyrotron at 170 GHz meeting both technological constraints and ITER specifications. This goal will be conducted in three different steps: 1 s, 60 s and CW;(ii) in parallel, the development and improvement of critical components for the coaxial concept will continue. While the coaxial concept provides substantial advantages in terms of cost and EC power available for the ITER system with respect to the 1 MW cylindrical cavity gyrotron, the development programme entails additional risks due to both the relatively tight schedule and the developments still required. A fall back option consisting in a more traditional 1 MW gyrotron is foreseen in case of major difficulties in the development of the 2 MW coaxial cavity gyrotron. This alternative development is expected to benefit from the successful development of the 140 GHz gyrotron for W7-X;(iii) a Test Facility for testing at high power, CW the prototype gyrotrons and other EC H&CD system components has been established at the CRPP, in Lausanne. The tests with the first prototype of coaxial gyrotron are currently progressing. A decision point between the coaxial and cylindrical cavity concept is expected by the end of 2009 when the tests with the first and refurbished prototype will be available.",

The experiments are being continued at SPC in 2018 to extend further the pulse duration, taking advantage of the existing CW full-power capabilities of the gyrotron test facility recently upgraded for the FALCON project.

The two most important ones are the stellarator Wendelstein W7-X at Greifswald and the Tokamak ITER at Cadarache. While the series production of the 140 GHz, 1 MW, CW gyrotrons for the 10-MW electron cyclotron resonance heating system of stellarator W7-X is proceeding, the European GYrotron Consortium is presently developing the EU-1 MW, 170 GHz, CW gyrotron for ITER. The initial design had already been initiated in 2007, as a risk mitigation measure during the development of the advanced ITER EU-2-MW coaxial-cavity gyrotron. The target of the ITER EU-1-MW conventional-cavity design is to benefit as much as possible from the experiences made during the development and series production of the W7-X gyrotron and of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Recently megawatt gyrotrons are found to suffer from various parasitic oscillations, particularly RF oscillations in the beam tunnel induced by the electron beam prior to the desired interaction zone (cavity). The paper describes experimental and theoretical investigations on both high and low frequency parasitic oscillations, employing a special measurement system as well as a novel analysis method to determine and characterize these undesired oscillations. The results of extensive experimental investigations on two different beam tunnel setups verify theoretical predictions on the parasitic oscillations being gyro-backward wave interactions excited in the beam tunnel. In addition, other types of parasitic oscillations were observed and explained. An improved beam tunnel designed to suppress the parasitic RF oscillations, was validated by further experiments with a conventional and a coaxial-cavity gyrotron.",

The optimized models have been found using the CST Microwave Studio simulation tool and in all cases the return loss is kept below -20 dB for a wide range of frequency spectrum. Two examples are given, one for Ku band and the other for K and Ka ones.",
