            "Abstract": "It is widely accepted that conceptual design is the most important phase of design process because the decisions made during this phase affect decisively all subsequent phases and determine the quality of the final outcome (product, artifact, system, machine, etc)[Ullman 1992]. Usually, during conceptual design, different functions of the designed artifact are located and, for the implementation of each such function, different concepts are proposed. In detailed design, a phase that follows conceptual design, only one concept\u2013of the multitude of concepts-is further elaborated so that, by the end of this phase, a final detailed and documented artifact description is produced. The choice of the concept that will be further elaborated from the set of all available concepts is a task known as concept evaluation.The majority of the methods and techniques use one or more concept attributes (characteristics) and apply different quantitative and/or qualitative approaches in order to conclude about their values with respect to design specifications. The latter are actually customer requirements that have been transformed to an engineering \u201csyntax\u201d and have been quantified in order to be used\u2013among others-for concept evaluation. For this task, the term \u201ccriterion\u201d is often used alternatively. Then it may be concluded that concept evaluation is a process where multiple concepts are subjected to a systematic evaluation process with respect to one or more criteria and, as a result, a single concept is finally chosen in order to be further elaborated in the following design phases. This concept may be either one of the initial concepts or a new synthesis that combines \u2026",

In the present study, a part classification scheme and a calculation procedure are introduced that enable systematic adaptation and standardization of custom parts during in-enterprise design and manufacturing processes. The level of standardization of the mechanical system under consideration is evaluated via metrics represented by a composite standardization index derived from the combination of two (2) partial indices, namely an index that represents the absolute attribute-based standardization of each part of the system and a second index that represents the degree of commonality for different parts and/or assemblies for the same system. The proposed approach leads to a more reliable evaluation of standardization levels by taking into account all in- and out-of-enterprise available standard resources and provides a framework that promotes design-for standardization processes. Additionally, it contributes towards more efficient and functional products and decreases design and manufacturing costs.",

In reverse engineering and design, the systematic consideration of standards leads to better evaluation and efficient synthesis of parts and assemblies. Taking into account standardization during design leads to systems with better operational characteristics, high quality and low cost. The establishment of metrics for estimating the standardization level of systems can provide valuable tools for analytic and synthetic engineering processes. The present study introduces such a metrics that is based on system analysis and decomposition into hierarchical structures of parts and assemblies. Procedures search exhaustively that structures and perform calculations of standardization indices. A PC-based platform implements the proposed method and provides estimations of standardization levels and multiple graphical outputs that visualize the obtained results. Then the designer may inspect the standardization level of parts, components and assemblies and proceed with necessary modifications. The method is exemplified with a study of a robot base subassembly.",

Then, weighted Euclidean norms and modified heuristic search algorithms are used to find the position of the elevator hoistway that fits the existing architectural plan and is closest to the point of floor\u2019s circulation paths that presents the minimum mean walking distance from the entrances of the areas that host floor\u2019s population.

Throughout the paper the design of robotic grippers for flexible materials is used as a reference design case in both its conceptual and detailed design phases. The system contains three modules. The first module focuses on the conceptual design phase and is used for: a. the generation of a set of feasible solutions (concepts) of grippers for a set of pre-specified requirements which express the handling tasks that the gripper must accomplish and b. for the evaluation of the feasible solutions in order to find the best one according to the designers\u2019 experience and some prespecified criteria. The evaluation process is based on a design index that includes several interacting criteria represented as relationships among fuzzy entities. The concept is then submitted to the second module called Case-DeSC (Case-based Design with Soft Computing). Case-DeSC is dedicated to the development of a detailed parametric design of the gripper concept by utilizing formal design case representation, fuzzy preferences on the design parameters and by searching for optimal solutions by deploying an evolutionary algorithm. The optimal solution passes over to a third module, capable of presenting a 3D visual representation of the parametric gripper concept via Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML).

The approach is applicable for most of the design problems and may be used in the design cases where the design problem under consideration can be formally decomposed and expressed in terms of design entities and associative relationships among them. The design knowledge is represented through different hierarchical tree types corresponding to the physical, computational and performance domains. The representation of the design knowledge in terms of computational relationships instead of terms of functional relationships is more convenient and flexible.

To obtain index value, energy consumption data - that are extracted from a detailed energy analysis of the examined conveyor - are correlated to service performance data derived from the analysis of material handling capability of the conveyor within the context of the set operational requirements and functional conditions. The proposed index is exemplified through a case study of a simple inclined belt conveyor for which a detailed energy consumption model is developed. Different technical specifications and operational conditions are tested. The proposed approach proves that the index depicts adequately the effect of any design solution or operational decision to the overall efficiency of the conveyor.",

The method relies on designer-guided eliminations of redundancies of common design parameters among different alternatives and plausible assumptions about value domains of design parameters that take part in the evaluation process. Eliminations of redundancies of common design parameters lead to unified digraphs for all alternatives and the introduction of Plausible Assumptions\u2019 Matrix systematizes the process of assigning feasible value domains for all types of all design parameters. Linear approximate calculation formulas pertaining to the unified digraphs are also introduced for evaluating alternatives based on comparable values of performance variables.

Binary relationships among the design entities (descriptors) form tree structures that represent the objective associative design knowledge. The distinct roles that the two categories of these descriptors, namely dependent and primary, play in the design process are discussed and additional factors that define realistically the required effort for the instantiation of every primary descriptor are introduced. The binary relationships among the descriptors form a dependency matrix, which is further transformed through a number of operations based on the connectivity among the descriptors and the aforementioned additional factors. From the resulting final matrix, a unique sorted list of primary design descriptors is produced. This list may be used for the sequential instantiation of these descriptors so that production of design information of maximum importance and least effort takes place during the early design stages and under completely realistic design conditions.

The potential use of the artificial neural networks-based model for a real-time condition monitoring system is also discussed. The \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The present paper surveys the application of soft computing (SC) techniques in engineering design. Within this context, fuzzy logic (FL), genetic algorithms (GA) and artificial neural networks (ANN), as well as their fusion are reviewed in order to examine the capability of soft computing methods and techniques to effectively address various hard-to-solve design tasks and issues. Both these tasks and issues are studied in the first part of the paper accompanied by references to some results extracted from a survey performed for in some industrial enterprises. The second part of the paper makes an extensive review of the literature regarding the application of soft computing (SC) techniques in engineering design. Although this review cannot be collectively exhaustive, it may be considered as a valuable guide for researchers who are interested in the domain of engineering design and wish to explore the opportunities \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Standardization of components of assemblies is important in both reverse engineering and design. In design, it leads to cost reduction by minimizing the number of items designed from scratch and the number of new manufacturing processes. The work presented introduces a composite standardization index by combining a commonality index and an absolute standardization index. The index counts the populations of common parts in assemblies and the degree of absolute conformance of those parts with engineering standards. It is a tool that represents reliably the level of standardization of a system.",

            "Abstract": "In the present paper, an approach based on fuzzy logic is presented concerning a fuzzy decision support system for faults\u2019 handling in train driving. A short introduction is given first that contains the problem\u2019s description and its major aspects. A literature review follows that refers to the last advances in the field of man\u2013machine interface, fuzzy logic applications and fault handling procedures in train driving. The paper emphasizes also on the important role of fuzzy logic in capturing, expressing and exploiting the existing experience on faults\u2019 manipulation during train operation.Furthermore, a theoretical approach is proposed for the development of a fuzzy decision support system that advises the train operator on faults\u2019 handling during its operation. Except of the advice that could offer, it is expected that \u2014 after its development \u2014 the system will be able to continuously check on-line the operator\u2019s actions \u2026",
