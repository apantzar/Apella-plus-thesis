Using deep packet inspection at the network operator level, we obtained a geo-tagged dataset with more than 6 million unique devices that launched more than 10,000 unique applications across the city of Shanghai over one week. We develop a technique that leverages transfer learning to predict which applications are most popular and estimate the whole usage distribution based on the Point of Interest (POI) information of that particular location. We demonstrate that our technique has an 83.0% hitrate in successfully identifying the top five popular applications, and a 0.15 RMSE when estimating usage with just 10% sampled sparse data. It outperforms by about 25.7% over the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings pave the way for predicting which apps are relevant to a user given their current \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Social conformity occurs when an individual changes their behaviour in line with the majority's expectations. Although social conformity has been investigated in small group settings, the effect of gender - of both the individual and the majority/minority - is not well understood in online settings. Here we systematically investigate the impact of groups' gender composition on social conformity in online settings. We use an online quiz in which participants submit their answers and confidence scores, both prior to and following the presentation of peer answers that are dynamically fabricated. Our results show an overall conformity rate of 39%, and a significant effect of gender that manifests in a number of ways: gender composition of the majority, the perceived nature of the question, participant gender, visual cues of the system, and final answer correctness. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings \u2026",

However, the change is largely driven by the technical community and many proposed solutions are never integrated into community response efforts, indicating mismatches between designs and real world needs. This paper offers readers with a technical background insight into roles, goals and constraints of humanitarian crisis response. In particular, we present three seemingly conflicting views regarding how citizens can contribute to response activities as spontaneous volunteers. With examples from two field studies and grounded in literature review, we integrate the three viewpoints into a framework explaining how the roles of volunteers and trained professionals shift with increasing severity and scale of a crisis. Based on this framework, we also discuss high-level opportunities for supporting crisis response with new software tools.",

We draw on our ethnographic studies in the waiting area of a busy hospital Emergency department. Despite evidence that lack of information can lead to stress, problem behaviours and poor levels of satisfaction with treatment, little information was made available to patients. We review the types of information needed and propose how the theoretical concepts of public, social and private information spheres relate to public spaces such as the Emergency department waiting area. We argue how the further theoretical concept of interaction spaces may be used in conjunction with these information spheres to inform interaction design for public settings.",

By offloading a computational task, a device can save energy and increase the performance of the mobile applications. Unfortunately, in existing offloading systems, the opportunistic moments to offload a task are often sporadic and short-lived. We overcome this problem by proposing a social-aware hybrid offloading system (HyMobi), which increases the spectrum of offloading opportunities. As a mobile device is always co-located to at least one source of network infrastructure throughout of the day, by merging cloudlet, device-to-device and remote cloud offloading, we increase the availability of offloading support. Integrating these systems is not trivial. In order to keep such coupling, a strong social catalyst is required to foster user\u2019s participation and collaboration. Thus, we equip our system with an incentive mechanism \u2026",

Traditionally, user visitation and check-in have been assumed as the same behavior, yet this fundamental assumption can be questionable and lacks supporting evidence. In this paper, we seek to understand the similarities and differences of visitation and check-in by presenting a large-scale systematic analysis under the specific setting of urban revisitation and re-check-in, which demonstrate people's periodic behaviors and regularities. Leveraging a localization dataset to model urban revisitation and a Foursqaure dataset to delineate re-check-in, we identify features concerning POI visitation patterns, POI background information, user visitation patterns, user preference and users' behavioral characteristics to understand their effects on urban revisitation and re-check-in.

The system is able to handle priorities between groups of cyclists (crowd-cycling) and traffic when approaching traffic lights at road junctions.The system takes into consideration normal probability density function (PDF) and analytics computed for a certain group of cyclists (i.e. crowd-cycling). An inference model is built based on real-time spatiotemporal data of the cyclists. As the system is highly distributed \u2013 both physically (i.e. location of the cyclists) and logically (i.e. different threads), the problem is treated under the umbrella of multi-agent systems (MAS) modeling.

However, little work has examined how local communities can give advice and support to their members by creating context-aware reminders that may include advice, tips and small requests. We developed the Community Reminder environment, a smartphone-based platform that supports community members to design and use context-aware reminders. We have conducted a one-month field study of Community Reminder to crowdsource and deliver safety-relevant information in a local community. The results show the benefits of involving community members in reminder design and connecting different perspectives. We also show that the proposed approach can broaden participation in local communities.",

Rather, our analysis showed that most research themes at CHI remain at the Bandwagon or Chaos quadrants. We simply roll from topic to topic, year after year, without developing any of them substantially. The discussion of our paper remained moderate and stuck to presenting the facts and figures of our analysis.

The increasing availability of digital mobility traces has provided new insights into collective human behaviour. Mobility datasets have been shown to be an accurate proxy for daily behaviour and social patterns, and behavioural data from Twitter has been used to predict real world phenomena such as cinema ticket sale volumes, stock prices, and disease outbreaks. In this paper we correlate city-scale urban traffic patterns with online search trends to uncover keywords describing the pedestrian traffic location. By analysing a 3-year mobility dataset we show that our approach, called Location Archetype Keyword Extraction (LAKE), is capable of uncovering semantically relevant keywords for describing a location. Our findings demonstrate an overarching relationship between online and offline collective behaviour, and allow for advancing analysis of community-level behaviour by using online search keywords as a practical behaviour proxy.",

In this paper, we present TestAWARE that enables developers to systematically test context-aware applications in laboratory settings. To achieve this, TestAWARE is able to download, replay and emulate contextual data on either physical devices or emulators. To support both white -box and black-box testing, TestAWARE has been implemented as a novel structure with a mobile client and code library. In blackbox testing scenarios, developers can manage data replay through the mobile client, without writing testing scripts or modifying the source code of the targeted application. In white-box testing scenarios, developers can manage data replay and test functional/non-functional properties of the targeted application by writing testing scripts \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a method that considers workers\u2019 cognitive ability to predict their suitability for a wide range of crowdsourcing tasks. We measure cognitive ability via fast-paced online cognitive tests with a combined average duration of 6.2 min. We then demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively assign or recommend workers to five different popular crowd tasks: Classification, Counting, Proofreading, Sentiment Analysis, and Transcription. Using our approach we demonstrate a significant improvement in the expected overall task accuracy. While previous methods require access to worker history or demographics, our work offers a quick and accurate way to determine which workers are more suitable for which tasks.  ",

We analyze the adoption of these technologies in public urban places with a conceptual technology appropriation model involving three layers of factors contributing to the adoption or rejection of a technology. Quantitative data shows that while the use of the WiFi network has grown steadily, the use of the displays has been declining. Qualitative data obtained with ethnographic methods reveals that the adoption of the displays is hampered by their questionable utility and people's apprehension about interacting with the displays in a public social setting. Finally, we identify issues that designers should take into account when deploying these technologies in urban spaces in the future.",

A global quantitative metric of model efficiency is proposed for assessing the overall behavior of the model, and a false-positives rating qualitative metric is used to assess the recall of the model. We evaluated the model with confined yet realistic cycling experiments and verify the precision of our model using an Android application installed in participants\u2019 smartphones. We compared our model with previous literature, achieving a promising model for in-the-wild cycling scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "Social conformity occurs when individuals in group settings change their personal opinion to be in agreement with the majority's position. While recent literature frequently reports on conformity in online group settings, the causes for online conformity are yet to be fully understood. This study aims to understand how social presencei.e., the sense of being connected to others via mediated communication, influences conformity among individuals placed in online groups while answering subjective and objective questions. Acknowledging its multifaceted nature, we investigate three aspects of online social presence: user representation (generic vs.user-specific avatars), interactivity (discussion vs.no discussion ), and response visibility (public vs.private ). Our results show an overall conformity rate of 30% and main effects from task objectivity, group size difference between the majority and the minority, and self \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A fundamental challenge in real-time labelling of activity data is user burden. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is widely used to obtain such labels for sensor data. However, in an in-situ deployment, it is not feasible to expect users to precisely label the start and end time of each event or activity. For this reason, time-point based experience sampling (without an actual start and end time) is prevalent. We present a framework that applies multi-instance and semi-supervised learning techniques to perform to predict user annotations from multiple mobile sensor data streams. Our proposed framework estimates users' annotations in ESM-based studies progressively, via an interactive pipeline of co-training and active learning. We evaluate our work using data collected from an in-the-wild data collection.",

By instrumenting the mobile applications with offloading mechanisms, a mobile device can save its energy and increase its performance. However, existing offloading mechanisms lack from efficient decision models for augmenting the mobile device with cloud resources on the fly. This problem is caused by the large amount of system\u2019s parameters and their scattered values that need to be considered and characterized merely by the device depending on its contextual needs. Thus, the offloading process still suffers from deficiencies that do not allow a device to maximize the advantages of going cloud-aware.

In this study, we aim to develop a proximity-based localization system and show how its longitudinal deployment can provide operational insights related to staff and patients' mobility and room occupancy in clinical settings. Such a streamlined data-driven approach can help in increasing the uptime of operating rooms and more broadly provide an improved understanding of facility utilization.Objective: The aim of this study is to measure the accuracy of the system and algorithmically calculate measures of mobility and occupancy.Methods: We developed a Bluetooth low energy, proximity-based localization system and deployed it in a hospital for 30 days. The system recorded the position of 75 people (17 patients and 55 staff) during this period. In addition, we collected ground-truth data and used them to validate system performance and accuracy. A number of analyses were conducted to estimate how people move in the hospital and where they spend their time.Results: Using ground-truth data, we estimated the accuracy of our system to be 96%. Using mobility trace analysis, we generated occupancy rates for different rooms in the hospital occupied by both staff and patients. We were also able to measure how much time, on average, patients spend in different rooms of the hospital. Finally, using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we showed that the system could differentiate between staff and patients without training.Conclusions: Analysis of longitudinal, location-based data can offer rich operational insights into hospital efficiency.

However, to date no study has investigated (i) how the situatedness of public displays affects the quantity and quality of collected feedback, and (ii) how public displays compare to traditional paper or web feedback mechanisms. We answer these research questions in a series of lab and field studies. We demonstrate that because people tend to approach this technology with no specific purpose in mind, the feedback collected with public displays is noisier than web and paper forms. However, we also show that public displays attract much more feedback than web and paper forms, and generate much more interest. Furthermore, we found that users appropriated our technology beyond its original purpose. Our analysis provides implications on the tradeoffs of using public displays \u2026",

On the other hand, attributes of network structure around the individual, quantified through networks analysis metrics, were related to cognitive empathy. Further, an examination of the interplay between network structure, social capital and empathy suggests that empathy facilitates the relation between network structure and social capital previously reported in literature.

A fundamental challenge in offloading is to distinguish situations where offloading is beneficial from those where it is counterproductive. Currently, offloading decisions are predominantly based on profiling performed on individual devices. While significant gains have been shown in benchmarks, these gains rarely translate to real-world use due to the complexity of contexts and parameters that affect offloading. We contribute by proposing crowdsensed evidence traces as a novel mechanism for improving the performance of offloading systems. Instead of limiting to profiling individual devices, crowdsensing enables characterizing execution contexts across a community of users, providing better generalisation and coverage of contexts.

To answer our question, we build on the established HCI tenet that there are three dimensions to situations where humans and computers, people and technology, come in contact: the user, the task and the domain.

We hypothesize that factors that increase the intrinsic motivation of a task\u2013such as framing a task as helping others\u2013may succeed in improving output quality where extrinsic motivators such as increased pay do not. In this paper we present an experiment testing this hypothesis along with a novel experimental design that enables controlled experimentation with intrinsic and extrinsic motivators in Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, a popular crowdsourcing task market. Results suggest that intrinsic motivation can indeed improve the quality of workers\u2019 output, confirming our hypothesis. Furthermore, we find a synergistic interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivators that runs contrary to previous literature suggesting \u201ccrowding out\u201d effects. Our results have significant practical and theoretical implications for crowd work.",

Leveraging urban resources for civic purposes, such as citizen participation and community engagement, has been gaining interest in HCI. Essentially, citizens can be empowered to be heard and engage the city better through the use of modern technology. Examples of these technologies are mobile phones, public displays, sensor networks, digital art installations, or any other type of urban technology. This workshop seeks to investigate the progress in creating public human interfaces for interactive urban engagement. We wish to discuss issues such as citizen participation in public life and decision-making, informing citizens, and civic engagement in all its various forms.",

We approach our analysis by introducing a \"Location Re-identification\" algorithm that is computationally efficient. Using data from Open Street Map, we conduct our analysis on datasets of multiple representative cities: New York City, Melbourne, Vancouver, Zurich and Shanghai. Our analysis indicates that urban morphology has a clear link to location privacy, and highlights a number of urban factors that contribute to location privacy. Our findings can be used in any systems or platforms where users reveal their proximal POIs, such as recommendation systems, advertising platforms, and appstores.",

The results indicate that young males, who live far from a village center or market, and have some knowledge of recent government policies, tend to have a more positive perception of mobile government, and therefore become potential adopters of the service.

We reflect on the reasons why the service was appropriated in this way and explore the evolution of photography in urban contexts.

There is a multitude of context classification systems, all of which are partial, covering both similar and different elements. Reported context classifications cover different types of context largely depending on their implementation. For the most part, however, context aware applications have utilized only isolated subsets of their context, such as a location or a device\u2019s state, eg [1, 2]. From the different classification systems, we purpose that the context classification system should cover five key elements; information about user, tools, social, physical environment and time.",

In our work, we investigate the impact of contextual determinants (such as majority group size, the number of opposing minorities and their sizes, and the nature of the task) and personal determinants (such as self-confidence, personality and gender) on online social conformity. In order to achieve this, we deployed an online quiz with subjective and objective multiple-choice questions. For each question, participants provided their answer and self-reported confidence. Following this, they were shown a fabricated bar chart that positioned the participant either in the majority or minority, presenting the distribution of group answers across different answer options. Each question tested a unique group distribution in terms of the number of minorities against the \u2026",

Traditional approaches to quantifying and modelling behaviour in HCI have tended to focus primarily on individuals and components. Complexity methods shift the focus onto interactions between components, and the emergence of behaviour from complex networks of interactions, as for example in Enactivist approaches to cognitive science. While we believe that complexity methods can be highly informative to HCI researchers, uptake in the community remains low due to widespread unfamiliarity.

The findings suggest that one's number of friends does not necessarily have an effect on the amount of bridging social capital. Conversely, the extent of structural holes and isolated friends in the network have an effect on bridging social capital. In addition, individuals low on agreeableness benefit more from isolated friends in terms of bridging social capital. In terms of bonding social capital, introverts benefit more from networks with higher transitivity. Women overall report higher bonding social capital, but there are no significant gender differences when it comes to leveraging one's network structure for bridging or bonding social capital.",

They are often used as a means to collect (or \u201csense\u201d) critical information by organizing and coordinating volunteers. Such a form of crowdsourcing enables swift sharing of disaster information although it has certain limitations in terms of data quality as well as ease of collaboration and coordination [2].Crowdsourced disaster information is often linked to location information and can be visualized on a map. For example, volunteers monitored wildfires in Santa Barbara by showing text reports, photos and videos on a digital map [3]. Crowds can generate such maps much before authoritative information becomes available, which is an important benefit that can outweigh the cost of error-prone crowdsourcing data. Likely relevant to this discussion is that not only grassroots organizations but also governmental agencies are now exploiting crowdsourcing. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the US recently introduced a crowdsourcing feature in their mobile app [4].",

Recent studies show, eg, that users of online social networking sites feel lonelier than non-users, and that people who have regular social offline interactions on a weekly basis enjoy a significantly reduction in mortality. Is there a way to have our cake and eat it, too? Can we design technology in such a way that its use comes not at the expense of social offline interaction, but supports it?

The data allows for a contrast between implicit and explicit attitudes regarding Facebook and online sharing. Our analysis reveals that while overall privacy concerns are not reflected in posting behaviour, awareness and familiarity with privacy controls is. This is supported by contrasting users\u2019 attitudes regarding day-to-day sharing against actual behaviour on Facebook. We theorise that there exists a failure in translating users\u2019 privacy needs into a social-technical environment such as social networking sites. This work demonstrates how aspects such as demographics and usage influence and shape users\u2019 behaviour and practices towards privacy. We therefore argue that the factorization of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Emotions have a significant impact on our decision-making, learning, awareness, social interactions, and mental and physical health. Even though large efforts have been put into quantifying human emotions, their subjectivity, context-dependence, and complexity render them as being almost unpredictable. However, while different streams of research in pervasive computing and psychology have made significant progress in the quantification of emotions, the most successful research results come out of controlled laboratory studies. In this article, we present a retrospective of a series of in-the-wild studies through the lens of human emotions. We are looking at the weaknesses and strengths of traditional research methods and present lessons learned. We furthermore call for a readjustment of research rigor and describe potential new research designs specific to out-of-the-lab studies.",

The soaring refugee death toll in Europe creates an urgent need for novel tools that monitor and forecast refugee flows. This study investigates the correlation between refugee mobility data and Internet search data from Google Trends. Google Trends is a freely accessible tool that provides access to Internet search data by analyzing a sample of all web queries. In our study, we surveyed refugees in Greece (entry point) and in Finland (destination point) to identify what search queries they had used during their travel. Next, we conducted time series analysis on Google search data to investigate whether interest in user-defined search queries correlated with the levels of refugee arrival data recorded by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

This paper explores the effect of locativeness on trust with two studies assessing user attitudes in depth. The first is an implicit, or preconscious, test and the second an explicit test based on voiced value judgments. To provide a richer context, the second study contrasts locativeness with other traditional aspects of design: branding and quality. The results indicate users have a strong implicit association between locative images and trust, and that this is partially reflected in their explicit choices. This is an important interface aspect that designers should consider in order to create trustworthy situated services.",

Today, an estimated 22% of the world\u2019s population owns a mobile phone, while 20% owns a personal computer. In western societies, mobile phones are used by more than 90% of the population, and developing nations are quickly catching up. The economies of scale involved in manufacturing billions of smartphones every year have reduced their cost and dramatically increased the scientific potential of their hardware. These economic, engineering, and scientific advances are rapidly turning smartphones into compelling scientific instruments. For instance, in the last decade smartphones have repeatedly been used to study the spread of disease (Wang et al., 2009; Wesolowski et al., 2012). Increasingly, however, this type of post hoc modeling overlooks many of the scientific opportunities afforded by modern devices and their sensing capabilities. Because smartphones have become ubiquitous, much more than personal computers, their instrumentation can now provide scientists unparalleled insight into humanity. Therefore, it is now possible to run studies and experiments that previously were simply impossible.",

Traditionally, NIRS has been an instrument reserved for laboratory usage, but recently affordable and smaller devices for NIRS have proliferated. Pairing this technology with the ubiquitous smartphone opens up a plethora of new use cases. In this paper, we explore one such use case, namely medication management in a nursing home/elderly care centre. First, we conducted a qualitative user study with nurses working in an elderly care centre to examine the protocols and workflows involved in administering medication, and the nurses' perceptions on using this technology. Based on our findings, we identify the main impact areas that would benefit from introducing miniaturised NIRS. Finally, we demonstrate via a user study in a realistic scenario that miniaturised NIRS \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Pervasive computing is a relatively new area of interest within computer science. Most of the challenges faced so far have been technical, as much of the research has been on implementation and the integration of various technologies in the pervasive environment [2]. Although such issues are important and should continue to be studied, they do not address vitally important issues of truly pervasive computing: security and privacy. As computing is moving away from our homes and offices and into our streets, current privacy and security issues are obsolete and need to be modified for our new environment: our pervasive computing world.Security is an issue which is not often addressed by the HCI community. However, there is a direct, if inverse, relationship between security and usability. In general the more stringent the security, the more it interferes with the user\u2019s experience causing a decrease in the usability of the system. The most common impact of security on user interaction is the identification and authentication process: entering usernames and passwords. Considering the desktop paradigm, a user may log on to a computer using a username and password, and never be bothered again by the identification and authentication process while they are logged on. However, when we move into the pervasive environment, this identification and authentication process will intrude more upon the user\u2019s interaction as we are exposed to more devices and external networks. The sheer number of usernames and passwords that must be remembered would become a problem [1]. This is considered a major usability problem, with password \u2026",

However, this assumption is not empirically validated, and in fact different studies apply different arbitrary thresholds in their analysis. To validate this assumption, we conducted a field study where we collected user-labelled activity data through ESM and sensor logging. Our results indicate that for the majority of instances where users return to their smartphone, ie, unlock their device, they in fact begin a new session as opposed to continuing a previous one. Our findings suggest that the commonly used approach of ignoring brief standby periods is not reliable, but optimisation is possible. We therefore propose various metrics related to usage sessions and evaluate various machine learning \u2026",

Our analysis shows that our approach has important benefits, such as the ability to identify undesired input, provide words of high semantic relevance, as well as a broader scope of keywords.

However, there is limited understanding of how we can examine and improve hospital workflows using the data collected through such apps as an alternative to costly and challenging research methods like ethnography and patient record analysis.We seek to identify whether the structure of the collected communication data provides insights into hospitals\u2019 workflows. Our analysis also aims to identify ways in which task management platforms can be improved and designed to better support clinical workflows.We present an exploratory analysis of clinical task records collected over 22 months through a smartphone app that enables structured communication between staff to manage and execute clinical workflows. We collected over 300,000 task records between July 2018 and May 2020 completed by staff members including doctors, nurses, and pharmacists across all wards in an Australian hospital.We show that important insights into how teams function in a clinical setting can be readily drawn from task assignment data. Our analysis indicates that predefined labels such as urgency and task type are important and impact how tasks are accepted and completed. Our results show that both task sent-to-accepted (P<.001) and sent-to-completed (P<.001) times are \u2026",

This often boils down to mapping the states of the cognitive processes underpinning human cognition: physiological responses (e.g., heart rate) and facial expressions (e.g., frowning) often reflect the states of our cognitive processes. However, it remains unclear whether physiological responses and facial expressions used in one particular task (e.g., gaming) can reliably assess cognitive performance in another task (e.g., coding), because complex and diverse tasks often require varying levels and combinations of cognitive processes. In this paper, we measure the cross-task reliability of physiological and facial responses.

Analysing this data, we first construct a time-varying Origin\u2013Destination matrix that describes how individual pedestrians in our city move at different times and places. We compare this ground-truth against a random pedestrian model to investigate how the latter underestimates or overestimates movement at various locations or times of day. By identifying these deviations, we can calibrate a weighted model that uses POIs from OpenStreetMap to adjust the simulated crowd. Our results show a significant accuracy improvement over the random model, while at the same time our work is readily applicable to simulating crowds \u2026",

To answer these questions we analyse the privacy policies of users of a real-time location sharing application, in which users actively shared their location with their contacts. The results show that users who are central to their network are more likely to reveal most about their whereabouts.

On the other hand, on a micro-level we identify unique characteristics in smartphone usage, and we present a rudimentary model that accounts for 92% in the variability of our smartphone use.",

Palaeoanthropological analysis of human remains suggests that abrupt climate change is linked to societal restructuring, but it has been challenging to reliably identify the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship. Here we identify one potential mechanism that can link climate to behavior change, and underpins many of the reported findings on social restructuring. Specifically, we show that daily weather is linked to human planning behavior, and this effect is moderated by climate. Our results demonstrate that as weather gets colder, humans increase their planning in cold regions and decrease planning in warm regions. Since planning has previously been linked to group efficiency, cooperation, and societal organization, our work suggests planning is one mechanism that can link climate change to societal restructuring.",

            "Abstract": "Although crowd work is typically completed through desktop or laptop computers by workers at their home, literature has shown that crowdsourcing is feasible through a wide array of computing devices, including smartphones and digital voice assistants. An integrated crowdsourcing platform that operates across multiple devices could provide greater flexibility to workers, but there is little understanding of crowd workers\u2019 perceptions on uptaking crowd tasks across multiple contexts through such devices. Using a crowdsourcing survey task, we investigate workers\u2019 willingness to accept different types of crowd tasks presented on three device types in different scenarios of varying location, time and social context. Through analysis of over 25,000 responses received from 329 crowd workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show that when tasks are presented on different devices, the task acceptance rate is 80.5% on personal computers, 77.3% on smartphones and 70.7% on digital voice assistants. Our results also show how different contextual factors such as location, social context and time influence workers decision to accept a task on a given device. Our findings provide important insights towards the development of effective task assignment mechanisms for cross-device crowd platforms.",

Loneliness is a malleable treatment target and preliminary evidence has shown that it can be addressed with digital platforms. Peer Tree is a strengths-based digital smartphone application aimed at reducing loneliness. The study aim is to reduce loneliness, and assess the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of Peer Tree in young people enrolled at university.Methods: This will be a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a strengths-based digital smartphone application (Peer Tree) with a treatment as usual (TAU) condition. Forty-two young people enrolled at university will be recruited for this pilot RCT. Participants with suicidality risk, acute psychiatric symptoms in the past month, or a current diagnosis of a mood or social anxiety disorder will be excluded. Allocation will be made on a 1: 1 ratio and will occur after the initial baseline assessment. Assessments are completed at baseline, post-intervention, and at follow-up. Participants in the TAU condition complete the same three assessment sessions. The primary outcomes of the study will be self-reported loneliness as well as the acceptability, usability, feasibility and safety of Peer Tree. Depression, social anxiety, and quality of life variables will also be measured as secondary outcomes.Discussion: This trial will report the ndings of implementing Peer Tree, a smartphone application aimed at reducing loneliness in university students. Findings from this trial will highlight the initial e cacy, acceptability and feasibility of using digital positive \u2026",

Due to the distributed, heterogeneous and resource constrained nature of the Fog computing nodes, Fog applications need to be developed as a collection of interdependent, lightweight modules. Since this concept aligns with the goals of microservices architecture, efficient placement of microservices-based IoT applications within Fog environments has the potential to fully leverage capabilities of Fog devices. In this paper, we propose a decentralized microservices-based IoT application placement policy for heterogeneous and resource constrained Fog environments. The proposed policy utilizes the independently deployable and scalable nature of microservices to place them as close as possible to the data source to minimize latency and network usage \u2026",

However, a common challenge in health care settings is low adherence, leading to low handwashing quality. Recent advances in machine learning and wearable sensing have made it possible to accurately measure handwashing quality for the purposes of training, feedback, or accreditation.Objective: We measured the accuracy of a sensor armband (Myo armband) in detecting the steps and duration of the WHO procedures for handwashing and handrubbing.Methods: We recruited 20 participants (10 females; mean age 26.5 years, SD 3.3). In a semistructured environment, we collected armband data (acceleration, gyroscope, orientation, and surface electromyography data) and video data from each participant during 15 handrub and 15 handwash sessions. We evaluated the detection accuracy for different armband placements, sensor configurations, user-dependent vs user-independent models, and the use of bootstrapping.Results: Using a single armband, the accuracy was 96%(SD 0.01) for the user-dependent model and 82%(SD 0.08) for the user-independent model. This increased when using two armbands to 97%(SD 0.01) and 91%(SD 0.04), respectively. Performance increased when the armband was placed on the forearm (user dependent: 97%, SD 0.01; and user independent: 91%, SD 0.04) and decreased when placed on the arm (user dependent: 96%, SD 0.01; and user independent: 80 \u2026",

While a lot of work has demonstrated the great potential of D2D communication, it is still unclear whether the benefits of the D2D approach can really be leveraged in practice. In this paper, we develop a software sensor, namely Detector, which senses the infrastructure in proximity of a mobile user. We analyze and evaluate D2D on the wild, ie, not in simulations. We found that in a realistic environment, a mobile is always co-located in proximity to at least one other mobile device throughout the day. This suggests that a device can schedule tasks processing in coordination with other devices, potentially more powerful, instead of handling the processing of the tasks by itself.",

Our results show that participants tend to be conservative in their judgment and are willing to trust the device in the absence of understandable label information. We further identify strategies to increase user trust in the system. Our work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on how NIRS can be mass-appropriated for everyday sensing tasks, and how to enhance the trustworthiness of assisted decision-making systems.",

            "Abstract": "This position paper discusses the role of advanced sensor systems, integrated into smart homes and transportation networks and measuring use and consumption, in supporting a transition at the level of individuals, small groups and entire communities, to more sustainable ways of living. It focuses on how such technologies can be leveraged as a motivational tool. In particular it highlights the potential of novel motivational techniques that operate through the recently popular paradigm of on-line social networking services. Examples of such techniques include relatively crude group motivators such as competition, to more subtle effects such as empowerment, in which motivation to act stems simply from increased capacity and ability. A further key element of this approach is to harness the collective power of communities. This refers not only to the increased reliability of aggregate sensor data (providing clearer messages as to the environmental costs of certain consumption behaviours), but also to the power of a community to discuss, debate and eventually identify and resolve its own sustainability problems. In short, this paper represents a novel research approach. It concludes with a discussion of the likely outcomes of this effort.",

            "Abstract": "Pervasive computing is a relatively new area of interest within computer science. Most challenges that have been faced so far in our attempts at designing pervasive systems have been technical, as the focus of much of the research has been on implementation aspects, such as the enabling technologies and techniques for combining and integrating various technologies in a system [Hightower & Borriello, 2001]. Although such issues are of crucial importance, they do not address a vitally important issue of truly pervasive computing: integration and interaction with society. We argue that this is in large part due to the physical and conceptual limitations of current attempts at implementing pervasive systems.Pervasive computing was supposed to be part of our everyday life and promised to assist us in all our activities regardless of our location [Weiser, 1991]. This vision of pervasive computing is that, ultimately, our whole society will benefit from such systems, and not just a few people doing very constrained tasks within physical \u201cislands\u201d of computing support. A pervasive system cannot reach its full potential\u2013and cannot really be described as pervasive\u2013when it is limited to, say, a \u201csmart house\u201d or a \u201csmart car\u201d. If the whole of society is to benefit from such systems, then the whole of society must be part of such a system. Thus, the social issues that arise are not just side effects or problems that can be dealt with ad hoc, but are at the heart of the challenge\u2013and the solution.",

            "Abstract": "Despite large investments in smartwatch development, the market growth remains smaller than forecasted. The purpose of smartwatch use remains unclear, indicated by the lack of large-scale adoption. Thus, we aim to better understand the early adoption and everyday smartwatch use. We investigate a diverse usage data of smartwatches logged over a period of up to 14 months from 79 individuals between December 2015 and March 2017, one of the largest wearable datasets collected. First, we identify both explorative and accepted behaviours that users exhibit and further investigate how the individual usage traits and features differ between the two categories. Our analysis offers an insightful perspective on how smartwatch use evolves organically. Our results improve our shared understanding of smartwatch use and users adapting their use of smartwatch over time to match the capabilities of the technology by \u2026",

This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a PIN entry system based on audio or haptic cues that is suitable for integration into such physical systems. The current implementation links movements on a mobile phone touch screen with the display of non-visual cues; selection of a sequence of these cues composes a password. Studies reveal the validity of this approach in terms of task times and error rates that improve over prior art. In sum, this paper demonstrates the potential of non-visual PINs as a mechanism for securing access to a range of systems, ultimately incorporating mobile, ubiquitous or tangible interfaces.",

Unlike online markets, situated crowdsourcing markets consist of workers who become serendipitously available for work in a particular location and context. So far, the literature has lacked a systematic study of task performance and uptake in such markets under varying incentives. In a 3-week field study, we demonstrate that in a situated crowdsourcing market, task uptake and accuracy are generally comparable with online markets. We also show that increasing task rewards in situated crowdsourcing leads to increased task uptake but not accuracy, while decreasing task rewards leads to decreases in both task uptake and accuracy.",

Traditional NIRS scanners used in research laboratories are large and expensive, while recently more and more affordable smaller NIRS scanners are appearing, which attract more end-users to buy and use. Besides, pairing the technology with mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) could get rid of other professional operation problems, and bring much more possibilities to non-expert users in realistic scenarios.

Although broadcasts enable high scalability and loose coupling in achieving collaboration among system components, there is no support for developers to verify the correctness of broadcast-driven nondeterministic processes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a verification approach for systems driven by all the four types of Android broadcasts. Our approach uses the PROMELA language to model broadcast senders and receivers, with regards to unique features of each broadcast type. Based on our design of initialisation procedures, developers can verify properties of their systems using the SPIN model checker. We evaluate our approach in a case study on an example system. Results show that our approach can effectively conduct verification in terms of safety, liveness and never claims with limited computing resources.",

We describe how users appropriated this technology beyond its original purpose and show that feedback mechanisms promoting rapid interaction or a sense of community lead to increased participation.

In this paper, we propose a novel semantics-aware mobility model that captures human mobility motivation using large-scale semantic-rich spatial-temporal data from location-based social networks. In our system, we first develop a multimodal embedding method to project user, location, time, and activity on the same embedding space in an unsupervised way while preserving original trajectory semantics. Then, we use hidden Markov model to learn latent states and transitions between them in the embedding space, which is the location embedding vector, to jointly consider spatial, temporal, and user motivations. In order to tackle the sparsity of individual mobility data, we further propose a von Mises-Fisher mixture clustering for user grouping so as to learn a reliable and fine-grained model \u2026",

We observe that the accumulated clock drift for smartphones can be more than 150ms per day in the worst case. We show that solutions using the public Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be noisy with errors up to 1800ms in one request. We describe a rapid clock synchronisation technique that reduces drift to 10ms on average (measured by linear regression) and achieves pair-wise synchronisation between smartphones with an average of 27ms (measured by accelerometer), following a Gaussian-like distribution. Our results provide a lower bound for rapid clock synchronisation as a guide \u2026",

We combined 3 atomic visual elements (color/greyscale, animation/static, and icon/text) to form 8 visual signals that were deployed on 8 interactive public displays on a university campus for 8 days. Our findings show that text is more effective in enticing interaction than icons, color more than greyscale, and static signals are more effective than animated.

Despite previous research in Psychology and Machine Vision, the factors affecting a person\u2019s verification ability are poorly understood. Through an online crowdsourcing study, we investigate the impact of gender, race and medium type (image vs video) on kinship verification-taking into account the demographics of both raters and ratees. A total of 325 workers completed over 50,000 kinship verification tasks consisting of pairs of faces shown in images and videos from three widely used datasets. Our results identify an own-race bias and a higher verification accuracy for same-gender image pairs than opposite-gender image pairs. Our results demonstrate that humans can still outperform current state-of-the-art automated unsupervised approaches. Furthermore, we show that humans perform better when presented with videos instead of still images. Our findings contribute to the design of future humanin-the-loop kinship verification tasks, including time-critical use cases such as identifying missing persons.",

We focus on settings where indoor location or rooms have strongly associated semantics, such as hospitals. We describe an approach that can work with different localisation systems, with little knowledge of the physical space properties, and with minimal bootstrapping required. We propose a movement representation that consists of time-encoded strings, and discuss how our approach can be used for analysing and visualising longitudinal indoor localisation data.",

Factors such as branding and presentation are known to affect whether users are prepared to invest trust in services, but little is known about trust in situated services. This paper describes an experiment to measure de facto trust in Wi-Fi hotspots in public places, as opposed to examining trust behaviour in a simulated lab setting. We investigated two hypotheses about the effect of location-specific images in the hotspot's pages on trust behaviours, compared to images of non-specific locations. We found a significant result which confirms that decisions to access an unfamiliar Wi-Fi hotspot can be affected by location-relevant images.",

These concerns have been compounded by the fact that there exists a lack of empirical evidence on how the field has evolved until today. In this study we applied co-word analysis to examine the status of Ubicomp research. We constructed the intellectual map of the field as reflected by 6858 keywords extracted from 1636 papers published in the HUC, UbiComp and Pervasive conferences during 1999--2013. Based on the results of a correspondence analysis we identify two major periods in the whole corpus: 1999--2007 and 2008--2013. We then examine the evolution of the field by applying graph theory and social network analysis methods to each period. We found that Ubicomp is increasingly focusing on mobile devices, and has in fact become more cohesive in the past 15 years. Our findings refute the assertion that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The quality of service of a mobile application is critical to ensure user satisfaction. Techniques have been proposed to accomplish adaptation of quality of service dynamically. However, there is still a limited understanding about how to provide a utility model for code execution. One key challenge is modeling the level of quality in the code execution that can be provisioned by the cloud. Since the allocation of cloud resources has a cost, it is important to optimize cloud usage. We propose a software-defined networking approach that allows modeling and controlling code acceleration of a mobile application deployed across multiple type of devices. By segregating the computational requirements of the mobile application into groups, we were able to define the acceleration needed by each group of devices. As the computational requirements of a device can change across time, a mobile device can be re-assigned to \u2026",

We test a non-paid crowdsourcing service on public displays with eight different motivation settings and analyse users' behavioural patterns and crowdsourcing performance (eg, accuracy, time spent, tasks completed). The results show that altruistic use, such as for crowdsourcing, is feasible on public displays, and through the controlled use of motivational design and validation check mechanisms, performance can be improved. The results shed insights on three research challenges in the field: i) how does crowdsourcing performance on public displays compare to that of online crowdsourcing, ii) how to improve the quality of feedback collected from public displays which tends to be noisy, and iii) identify users' behavioural patterns towards crowdsourcing on public displays \u2026",

However, an internal factor which is known to negatively impact cognitive abilities -- stress -- has not been systematically investigated in terms of its impact on mobile interaction. In this paper, we report a study where we use the Trier Social Stress Test to induce stress on participants, and investigate its effect on three aspects of mobile interaction: target acquisition, visual search, and text entry. We find that stress reduces completion time and accuracy during target acquisition tasks, as well as completion time during visual search tasks. Finally, we are able to directly contrast the magnitude of these effects to previously published effects of environmentally-caused impairments.
