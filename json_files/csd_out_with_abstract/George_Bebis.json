            "Abstract": "Prediction model is needed for reducing mudflow disaster impact. We assume that mudflow has similar characteristic with fluid dynamic model. Therefore we adopt dynamical model of fluid to build hot mudflow movement model. The general parameters of this model are landscape data, mud volume per-day, and obstacle such as dikes and buildings. In this research we use approximation model using cellular automata to create a novel model for mudflow movement that is simple and powerful model to simulate dynamical model of fluid flow. The important properties in our model as cellular automata model are neighbor definition and rules. We use 8 neighbor cells and moment with Gaussian function. Cellular automata rules are built with landscape data and obstacle data. The simulation result is visualization of mudflow movement as fluid movement that depends on dynamical model characteristics.",

The performance of previous face detection methods reported in the literature is far from perfect and deteriorates ungracefully where lighting conditions cannot be controlled. We propose a method that outperforms state-of-the-art face detection methods in environments with stable lighting. In addition, our method can potentially perform well in environments with variable lighting conditions. The approach capitalizes upon our near-IR skin detection method reported elsewhere [Proceedings IEEE Workshop on Computer Vision beyond the Visible Spectrum: Methods and Applications; 2000, IEEE Trans. Int. Trans. Sys.; vol. 1; 72\u201385]. It ascertains the existence of a face within the skin region by finding the eyes and eyebrows.

First, an adaptive statistical method, called adaptive kernel density estimation (AKDE), is proposed as a base-line system that addresses the scene dependence issue. After investigating its performance we introduce a novel general statistical technique, called recursive modeling (RM). The RM overcomes the weaknesses of the AKDE in modeling slow changes in the background. The performance of the RM is evaluated asymptotically and compared with the base \u2026",

In these applications, the visual hull is used to approximate the 3D geometry of an object. Existing volumetric visual hull construction techniques, however, produce a 3-color volume data that merely serves as a bounding volume. In other words it lacks an accurate surface representation. Polygonization can produce satisfactory results only at high resolutions. In this study we extend the binary visual hull to an implicit surface in order to capture the geometry of the visual hull itself. In particular, we introduce an octree-based visual hull specific adaptive sampling algorithm to obtain a volumetric representation that provides accuracy proportional to the level of detail. Moreover, we propose a method to process the resulting octree to extract a crack-free polygonal visual hull surface. Experimental results illustrate the performance of the algorithm.",

In order to detect moving foreground regions in such videos the background and its changes should be modeled to help detecting moving regions of interest. Support Vector Data Descriptors (SVDD) can be employed in order to analytically model the background and explicitly account for its inherent changes. The major draw back of the SVDD modeling is the issue of training of the SVDD which is a quadratic programming (QP) problem. In this paper we propose a method to efficiently train the SVDD\u2019s. The advantages of our technique are its low memory requirement and its efficiency in terms of speed.

Although face categorization using common visual cues yields meaningful face categories, developing accurate and robust gender, ethnicity, and age categorizers is a challenging issue. Moreover, it limits the overall number of possible face categories and, in practice, yields unbalanced face categories which can compromise recognition performance.

It takes under consideration the local structure of the patterns in order to extract a local path. The overall global path is sequentially formed from each segment. We present the preprocessing steps used to extract patterns of interest from an image and the results from two case study examples. The methodology has applications in the autonomous path planning of aerial vehicles following a specified structure, such as that of a river or road.",

The final project is to write an image processing program with applications in computer vision. The program will read in a two dimensional array of data from a file that represents a black and white photographic image, perform one or more transformations on the data and write the transformed data to a new file. A simple image viewer program is used to display the before and after images. In addition to learning more about programming it is the intent of the project that students also have some fun with images. Most students did indeed enjoy the visual nature of the project and were surprised that they could write a program to accomplish so much after just one programming course. A few students wrote very creative transformation functions. This CS1 module \u2026",

As a case study, we aim to detect pedestrian/vehicle in an observation area.

Our experiments indicate that IR-based recognition performance degrades seriously when eyeglasses are present in the probe image but not in the gallery image and vice versa. To address this serious limitation of IR, we propose fusing the two modalities, exploiting the fact that visible-based recognition is less sensitive to the presence or absence of eyeglasses. Our fusion scheme is pixel-based, operates in the wavelet domain, and employs genetic algorithms (GAs) to decide how to combine IR with visible information \u2026",

There are two main optimization concerns: how many filters should be in a Gabor filter band and what should be their parameters. Addressing these issues, this work focuses on finding optimizing Gabor filter banks based on an incremental clustering algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We employ an SVM with Gaussian kernel as a fitness function for PSO.

An image of a hand is obtained, which is then segmented into a palm region and separate finger regions. Acquisition of the image is performed without requiring particular orientation or placement restrictions. Segmentation is performed without the use of reference points on the images. Each segment is analyzed by calculating a set of Zernike moment descriptors for the segment. The feature parameters thus obtained are then fused and compared to stored sets of descriptors in enrollment templates to arrive at an identity decision. By using Zernike moments, and through additional manipulation, the biometric analysis is invariant to rotation, scale, or translation or an in put image.

Although human actions can be inferred from a wide range of data, it has been demonstrated that simple human actions can be inferred by tracking the movement of the head in 2D. This is a promising idea as detecting and tracking the head is expected to be simpler and faster because the head has lower shape variability and higher visibility than other body parts (e.g., hands and/or feet). Although tracking the movement of the head alone does not provide sufficient information for distinguishing among complex human actions, it could serve as a complimentary component of a more sophisticated action recognition system.

In the proposed method, an image is first decomposed into three color components. LBP histograms are then calculated from overlapping blocks from each component. The histogram distance between the blocks is calculated and the block-pairs having the minimal distance are retained. If the retained block-pairs are present in all the three color components, they are selected as primary candidates. 8-connected neighborhood clustering is then applied to refine the candidates. The proposed method shows significant improvement in reducing the false positive rates over some recent related methods.",

As word-based spam filters have become better and more prevalent, spammers have adjusted their tactics by embedding the text of an email into an image or multiple images, and then sending those images as the entire content of the email. This leaves word-based filters without enough information to make a classification. In this paper, we will demonstrate how Eigenspaces and Support Vector Machines can be used to recognize certain keywords in images that would provide a strong indication that the image is spam-like.",

Prominent approaches to horizon line detection rely on edge detection as a pre-processing step which is inherently a non-stable approach due to parameter choices and underlying assumptions. We present a novel horizon line detection approach which uses machine learning and Dynamic Programming (DP) to extract the horizon line from a classification map instead of an edge map. The key idea is assigning a classification score to each pixel, which can be interpreted as the likelihood of the pixel belonging to the horizon line, and representing the classification map as a multi-stage graph. Using DP, the horizon line can be extracted by finding the path that maximizes the sum of classification scores.

Current background modeling techniques use heuristics to build a representation of the background, while it would be desirable to obtain the background model automatically. In order to increase the accuracy of modeling it needs to adapt to different parts of the same scene and finally the model has to be robust to noise.

Using the p-La placian equation (PLE), we generalize a series of  regularization terms based on the gradient of the implicit function, and we  show that the present methods lack additional constraints for a more stable  solution. The novelty of our approach is in the deployment of a new  regularization term when p --> infinity which leads to the infinite  Laplacian equation (ILE). We show that ILE minimizes the supremum of the  gradient and prove that it is optimal for metamorphism since intermediate  solutions are equally distributed along their normal direction.

Working with a small number of projections provides a lower radiation dose and a fast scan time, however an error associated with the sparse-view reconstruction increases significantly as the space sparsity increases that may cause the reconstruction process to diverge. The iterative reconstruction-re-projection (IRR) algorithm which uses filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction has been used for the sparse-view computed tomography applications for several years. The IRR-TV method has been developed as a higher performance alternative to the IRR method by adding the total variation (TV) minimization. Here, we propose an algebraic iterative reconstruction-re-projection (AIRR) algorithm with the shearlet regularization. The AIRR coupled with the shearlet regularization in image space attains a better estimation in the projection space and yielded a higher performance based on subjective and objective quality metrics.",

Then, GAs are used to select the female eigenfaces and the male eigenfaces from the gender eigenface subset, using SVMs to classify the error between the reconstructed images and average gender images. Finally, in order to fuse the outputs of SVMs from the previous two stages and get the classification decision, the sum rule is employed.

In copy\u2013move image forgery, a region from some image location is copied and pasted to a different location of the same image. Typically, post-processing is applied to better hide the forgery. Using keypoint-based features, such as SIFT features, for detecting copy\u2013move image forgeries has produced promising results. The main idea is detecting duplicated regions in an image by exploiting the similarity between keypoint-based features in these regions. In this paper, we have adopted keypoint-based features for copy\u2013move image forgery detection; however, our emphasis is on accurate and robust localization of duplicated regions. In this context, we are interested in estimating the transformation (eg, affine) between the copied and pasted regions more accurately as well as extracting these regions as robustly by reducing the number of false positives and negatives. To address these issues, we propose using a more powerful set of keypointbased features, called MIFT, which shares the properties of SIFT features but also are invariant to mirror reflection transformations. Moreover, we propose refining the affine",

Each feature extraction method was compared with each other using the NIST-4 database in terms of accuracy and time. Moreover, we have investigated the issue of \u2026",

In this paper, we consider the problem of object detection using genetic algorithms (GA) for feature subset selection. We argue that feature selection is an important problem in object detection, and demonstrate that GA provide a simple, general, and powerful framework for selecting good sets of features, leading to lower detection error rates. As a case study, we have chosen to perform feature extraction using the popular method of principal component analysis (PCA) and classification using support vector machines (SVM). We have tested this framework on. two difficult and practical object detection problems: vehicle detection and face detection. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in both cases.",

One main problem in this approach is to find category specific features. We addressed category specific face recognition based on gender and explored which feature descriptor is more suitable for male category and which is more appropriate for female category. We tested four feature extraction techniques: Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Weber's Law Descriptor (WLD). To reduce the dimension of the feature space in each case, we used two-stage feature subset selection method.

            "Abstract": "In general, Zernike moments are often used efficiently as shape descriptors of image objects, such as logos or trademarks that cannot be defined by a single contour. However, because these moments are defined in a unit disk space and extracted by a polar raster sampling shape, information of skewed and stretched shapes is lost. As a result, they can be inefficient shape descriptors when there is skew and stretch distortion. In this paper, a method is proposed that addresses this issue. More specifically, Zernike moments are obtained from a transformed unit disk space that allows for the extraction of shape descriptors which are invariant to rotation, translation, and scale as well as skew and stretch, thus preserving more shape information for the feature extraction process. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more accurate in relation to skew and stretch distortions when compared to \u2026",

Manual detection of craters is laborious and impractical, and many approaches have been proposed in the field to automate this task. However, none of these methods have yet become a standard tool for crater detection due to the challenging nature of this problem. In this paper, we propose a new crater detection algorithm (CDA) which employs a multi-scale candidate region detection step based on convexity cues and candidate region verification based on machine learning. Using an extensive dataset, our method has achieved a 92 % detection rate with an 85 % precision rate. ",

The focus of this paper is on the problem of feature extraction and classification for rear-view vehicle detection. Specifically, we propose using Gabor filters for vehicle feature extraction and support vector machines (SVM) for vehicle detection. Gabor filters provide a mechanism for obtaining some degree of invariance to intensity due to global illumination, selectivity in scale, and selectivity in orientation. Basically, they are orientation and scale tunable edge and line detectors. Vehicles do contain strong edges and lines at different orientation and scales, thus, the statistics of these features (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and skewness) could be very powerful for vehicle detection. To provide robustness, these statistics are not extracted from the whole image but rather are collected \u2026",

Our work builds upon the tensor voting and the iterative voting frameworks to propose an efficient method to detect and refine perceptually interesting curvilinear structures in images. The novelty of our method lies on the idea of iteratively tuning the tensor voting fields, which allows the concentration of the votes only over areas of interest. We \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In past decades, many techniques have been used to improve face recognition performance. The most common and well-studied ways are to use the whole face image to build a subspace based on the reduction of dimensionality. Differing from methods above, we consider face recognition as an image classification problem. The face images of the same person are considered to fall into the same category. Each category and each face image could be both represented by a simple pyramid histogram. Spatial dense scale-invariant feature transform features and bag of features method are used to build categories and face representations. In an effort to make the method more efficient, a linear support vector machine solver, Pegasos, is used for the classification in the kernel space with additive kernels instead of nonlinear SVMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve very high \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a blind copy move image forgery detection method using dyadic wavelet transform (DyWT). DyWT is shift invariant and therefore more suitable than discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for data analysis. First we decompose the input image into approximation (LL1) and detail (HH1) subbands. Then we divide LL1 and HH1 subbands into overlapping blocks and measure the similarity between blocks. The key idea is that the similarity between the copied and moved blocks from the LL1 subband should be high, while the one from the HH1 subband should be low due to noise inconsistency in the moved block. We sort pairs of blocks based on high similarity using the LL1 subband and high dissimilarity using the HH1 subband. Using thresholding, we obtain matched pairs from the sorted list as copied and moved blocks. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method over \u2026",

One such application that has received significant attention from the computer vision community is traffic surveillance. We propose a new traffic surveillance system that works without prior, explicit camera calibration, and has the ability to perform surveillance tasks in real time. Camera intrinsic parameters and its position with respect to the ground plane were derived using geometric primitives common to any traffic scene. We use optical flow and knowledge of camera parameters to detect the pose of a vehicle in the 3D world. This information is used in a model-based vehicle detection and classification technique employed by our traffic surveillance application. The object (vehicle) classification uses two new techniques\u2212 color contour based matching and gradient based matching. Our experiments on several real traffic video sequences demonstrate good results for our foreground object detection, tracking, vehicle detection and vehicle speed estimation approaches.",

The key idea is classifying saliency histograms in several cases by considering the relative position of the modes of the figure/ground distributions and applying specific actions in each case.

In copy\u2013move image forgery, a region from some image location is copied and pasted to a different location of the same image. Typically, post-processing is applied to better hide the forgery. Using keypoint-based features, such as SIFT features, for detecting copy\u2013move image forgeries has produced promising results. The main idea is detecting duplicated regions in an image by exploiting the similarity between keypoint-based features in these regions. In this paper, we have adopted keypoint-based features for copy\u2013move image forgery detection; however, our emphasis is on accurate and robust localization of duplicated regions.

First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to represent each image as a feature vector (i.e., eigen-features) in a low-dimensional space. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are then employed to select a subset of features from the low-dimensional representation by disregarding certain eigenvectors that do not seem to encode important gender information. Four different classifiers were compared in this study using genetic feature subset selection: a Bayes classifier, a Neural Network (NN) classifier, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and a classifier \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Gender recognition from facial images plays an important role in biometric applications. We investigated Dyadic wavelet Transform (DyWT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for gender recognition in this paper. DyWT is a multi-scale image transformation technique that decomposes an image into a number of subbands which separate the features at different scales. On the other hand, LBP is a texture descriptor and represents the local information in a better way. Also, DyWT is a kind of translation invariant wavelet transform that has better potential for detection than DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform). Employing both DyWT and LBP, we propose a new technique of face representation that performs better for gender recognition. DyWT is based on spline wavelets, we investigated a number of spline wavelets for finding the best spline wavelets for gender recognition. Through a large number of experiments \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The fingerprint is one of the leading biometric modalities that is used worldwide for authenticating the identity of persons. Over time, a lot of research has been conducted to develop automatic fingerprint verification techniques. However, due to different authentication needs, the use of different sensors and the fingerprint verification systems encounter cross-sensor matching or sensor interoperability challenges, where different sensors are used for the enrollment and query phases. The challenge is to develop an efficient, robust and automatic system for cross-sensor matching. This paper proposes a new cross-matching system (SiameseFinger) using the Siamese network that takes the features extracted using the Gabor-HoG descriptor. The proposed Siamese network is trained using adversarial learning. The SiameseFinger was evaluated on two benchmark public datasets FingerPass and MOLF. The results of the experiments presented in this paper indicate that SiameseFinger achieves a comparable performance with that of the state-of-the-art methods. View Full-Text",

An image of a hand is obtained, which is then segmented into a palm region and separate finger regions. Acquisition of the image is performed without requiring particular orientation or placement restrictions. Segmentation is performed without the use of reference points on the images. Each segment is analyzed by calculating a set of Zernike moment descriptors for the segment. The feature parameters thus obtained are then fused and compared to stored sets of descriptors in enrollment templates to arrive at an identity decision. By using Zernike moments, and through additional manipulation, the biometric analysis is invariant to rotation, scale, or translation or an in put image.

The vehicle detection algorithm consists of two main steps: multi-scale driven hypothesis generation and appearance-based hypothesis verification. In the multi-scale hypothesis generation step, possible image locations where vehicles might be present are hypothesized. This step uses multi-scale techniques to speed up detection but also to improve system robustness by making system performance less sensitive to the choice of certain parameters. Appearance-base hypothesis verification verifies those hypothesis using Haar Wavelet decomposition for feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification.

This can be achieved by finding a temporal relationship, which we named association, between consecutive frames. The disparity range of the current frame is deduced from the disparity map of the preceding frame and the association between the two frames. Dynamic programming technique is considered for matching the image features. The proposed approach is tested on virtual and real stereo image sequences and the results are satisfactory.

Copy move forgery is one type of tempering that is commonly used for manipulating the digital contents, in this case, a part of an image is copied and is pasted on another region of the image. The non-intrusive approach for this problem is becoming attractive because it does not need any embedded information, but it is still far from being satisfactory. In this paper, an efficient non-intrusive method for copy-move forgery detection is presented. This method is based on image segmentation and similarity detection using dyadic wavelet transform (DyWT). Copied and pasted regions are structurally similar and this structural similarity is detected using DyWT and statistical measures. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the stat-of-the-art methods.",

The LBP normalized histogram is calculated from each of the wedges. The final feature vector is obtained by fusing all the histograms. The proposed method is evaluated on three image forgery datasets and compared with some state of the art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the compared methods.

Our objective is to investigate the discrimination power of different parts of the hand in order to develop a simpler, faster, and possibly more accurate and robust verification system. Specifically, we propose a new approach which decomposes the hand in different regions, corresponding to the fingers and the back of the palm, and performs verification using information from certain parts of the hand only.

To extract Gabor features, a set of Gabor filters tuned to several different frequencies and orientations is utilized. The computational complexity of these features, due to their non-orthogonality, prevents their use in many real-time or near real-time tasks. Many research efforts have been made to address the computational complexity of Gabor filters. Most of these techniques utilize the separability of Gabor filters by decomposing them into 1-D Gaussian filter. The main issue in these techniques is the efficient pixel interpolation along the desired direction. Sophisticated interpolation mechanisms minimize the interpolation error with the increased computational complicity.

Without any a-priori knowledge about the location and size of a face in an image, every possible image location and face size should be considered, leading to a very large search space. In this paper, we propose using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for searching the image efficiently. Specifically, we use GAs to find image sub-windows that contain faces and in particular, the face of interest.

Experimental results show that the proposed system with WLD histogram, feature selection, and city block distance classifier achieves accuracies of Asian: 97.74%, Black: 96.89%, Hispanic: 92.06%, Middle: 98.33%, and White: 99.53%.

            "Abstract": "Cancer is an umbrella term that includes a range of disorders, from those that are fast-growing and lethal to indolent lesions with low or delayed potential for progression to death. One critical unmet challenge is that molecular disease subtypes characterized by relevant clinical differences, such as survival, are difficult to differentiate. With the advancement of multi-omics technologies, subtyping methods have shifted toward data integration in order to differentiate among subtypes from a holistic perspective that takes into consideration phenomena at multiple levels. However, these integrative methods are still limited by their statistical assumption and their sensitivity to noise. In addition, they are unable to predict risk scores of patients using multi-omics data. Here we present a novel approach, named Subtyping via Consensus Factor Analysis (SCFA), that can efficiently remove noisy signals from consistent molecular patterns in order to reliably identify cancer subtypes and accurately predict risk scores of patients. In an extensive analysis of 7,973 samples related to 30 cancers that are available at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we demonstrate that SCFA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in discovering novel subtypes with significantly different survival profiles. We also demonstrate that SCFA is able to predict risk scores that are highly correlated with true patient survival and vital status. More importantly, the accuracy of subtype discovery and risk prediction improves when more data types are integrated in the analysis. The SCFA software and TCGA data packages will be available on Bioconductor.",

Using the University of Nevada at Reno (UNR) and the University of Notre Dame (UND) hand databases, we compare a geometric-based method, a component-based approach using Zernike moments, and an algorithm employing 3D finger surface features. Both recognition and authentication experiments have been conducted to investigate the performance and robustness of the three methods.

Many studies of network traffic classification have focused on classifying applications such as web, peer-to-peer, and DNS traffic. In general, machine learning approaches have been applied on classifying applications, security awareness, and anomaly detection.

            "Abstract": "Video surveillance has significant application prospects such as security, law enforcement, and traffic monitoring. Visual traffic surveillance using computer vision techniques can be non-invasive, cost effective, and automated. Detecting and recognizing the objects in a video is an important part of many video surveillance systems which can help in tracking of the detected objects and gathering important information. In case of traffic video surveillance, vehicle detection and classification is important as it can help in traffic control and gathering of traffic statistics that can be used in intelligent transportation systems. Vehicle classification poses a difficult problem as vehicles have high intra-class variation and relatively low inter-class variation. In this work, we investigate five different object recognition techniques: PCA\u2009+\u2009DFVS, PCA\u2009+\u2009DIVS, PCA\u2009+\u2009SVM, LDA, and constellation-based modeling applied to the problem of vehicle classification. We also compare them with the state-of-the-art techniques in vehicle classification. In case of the PCA-based approaches, we extend face detection using a PCA approach for the problem of vehicle classification to carry out multi-class classification. We also implement constellation model-based approach that uses the dense representation of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features as presented in the work of Ma and Grimson (Edge-based rich representation for vehicle classification.

We investigate the problem of selecting a subset of the most relevant gait features for improving gait recognition performance. This is achieved by discarding redundant and irrelevant gait features while preserving the most informative ones. Motivated by our previous work on feature subset selection using genetic algorithms (GAs), we propose using GAs to select an optimal subset of gait features. First, features are extracted using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) on spatiotemporal projections of gait silhouettes.

Our approach builds upon the tensor voting and the iterative voting frameworks. Its efficacy lies on iterative refinements of curvilinear structures by gradually shifting from an exploratory to an exploitative mode. Such a mode shifting is achieved by reducing the aperture of the tensor voting fields, which is shown to improve curve grouping and inference by enhancing the concentration of the votes over promising, salient structures. The proposed technique is validated on delineating adherens junctions that are imaged through fluorescence microscopy. However, the method is also applicable for screening other organisms based on characteristics of their cell wall structures. Adherens junctions maintain tissue structural integrity and cell-cell interactions. Visually, they exhibit fibrous patterns that may be \u2026",

Our method does not require a priori information about the shape and proportions of the tracked subject, can be applied to arbitrary motion sequences, and renders dedicated initialization poses unnecessary. To serve this purpose, our algorithm first identifies individual rigid bodies by means of a variant of spectral clustering. Thereafter, it determines joint positions at each time step of motion through numerical optimization, reconstructs the skeleton topology, and finally enforces fixed bone length constraints.

Wavelet features are particularly attractive for vehicle detection because they form a compact representation, encode edge information, capture information from multiple scales, and can be computed efficiently. Traditionally, methods using wavelet features for classification truncate the coefficients by keeping only the ones with largest magnitude. We believe that the actual values of the wavelet coefficients are not very important for vehicle detection. In fact, the coefficient magnitudes indicate local oriented intensity differences, information that cold be very different even for the same vehicle under different lighting conditions.

In this context, we use the chaotic behavior of logistic map to build the projection vectors using a methodology that makes the construction of the projection matrix depend on the biometric template and its identity.

This paper presents a framework for video-based surveillance where target detection is integrated with tracking to improve detection results. In contrast to methods that apply target detection and tracking sequentially and independently from each other, we feed the results of tracking back to the detection stage in order to adaptively optimize the detection threshold and improve system robustness. First, the initial target locations are extracted using background subtraction. To model the background, we employ Support Vector Regression (SVR) which is updated over time using an on-line learning scheme. Target detection is performed by thresholding the outputs of the SVR model. Tracking uses shape \u2026",

Currently, the only technology that satisfies the advanced requirements of hand-based input for HCI is glove-based sensing. This technology, however, has several drawbacks including that it hinders the ease and naturalness with which the user can interact with the computer-controlled environment, and it requires long calibration and setup procedures. Computer vision (CV) has the potential to provide more natural, non-contact solutions. As a result, there have been considerable research efforts to use the hand as an input device for HCI. In particular, two types of research directions have emerged. One is based on gesture classification and aims to extract high-level abstract information corresponding to motion patterns or postures of the hand.

Recently, two machine learning based approaches have been proposed for horizon line detection: one relying on edge classification and the other relying on pixel classification. In the edge-based approach, a classifier is used to refine the edge map by removing non-horizon edges. The refined edge map is then used to form a multi-stage graph where dynamic programming is applied to extract the horizon line. In the edge-less approach, classification is used to obtain a confidence of horizon-ness at each pixel location. The horizon line is then extracted by applying dynamic programming on the resultant dense classification map rather than on the edge map. Both \u2026",

Within this context, eyegaze information will be an important component in the development of systems that monitor the driver and alert him/her of any insecure driving conditions. Based on the requirements of our application, accurate gaze estimates are not really necessary. On the other hand, speed is very important. The approach we have taken involves classifying gaze into five directions (\" straight\",\" up\",\" down\",\" left\", and\" right\"). Each gaze direction is modeled by a distinct eigenspace. Novel gaze directions are classified as one of the above five gaze directions by computing the distance of the novel direction from each eigenspace. The eigenspace associated with the smallest distance determines the classification result. The proposed approach is very simple and fast. Also, it is not intrusive and does not required extracting any special features. Our preliminary results illustrate that it is a promising approach.",

We have also found that these modules can be used effectively at the community college level and can provide resources to community college faculty that they might not otherwise have readily available. In fact, the use of computer graphics and image processing programs as teaching and motivational tools is becoming common at all levels of education. As an example, one of our modules used in CS1 provides a brief background in computer vision concepts and allows students to write an image processing program with applications in computer vision. Using concepts learned in a first programming course students can read in a two dimensional array of data from a file that represents a black and white photographic image, perform one or more transformations on the data, and write the transformed data to a new file. A simple image viewer program can be used to display the before and after images and students can actually see and understand the effects of the transformation. In addition to learning more about the target subject it is the intent of the modules that students also have some fun with images. Many students do indeed \u2026",

Specifically, the outputs of some classifiers are simply\u201d distances\u201d, that is, they represent\u201d distance measurements\u201d between a query pattern and a decision boundary. We argue that the distance component is very helpful for decision fusion. Unfortunately, some of the most popular statistical decision fusion rules, such as the Sum rule and Product rule, do not take advantage of the\u201d distance\u201d property. Even worse, these rules make assumptions about data independence and distribution models which do not hold in practice. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple decision-level fusion rule in the context of vehicle detection. Our fusion rule takes advantage of\u201d distance\u201d information and does not make any assumptions. We have applied this rule on a vehicle detection problem, showing that it outperforms well known statistical fusion rules.",

To address these issues, we propose an edge-less horizon line detection approach based on pixel classification, hence not relying on edge information. The key idea is formulating a multi-stage graph using classification maps, instead of edge maps, where each node cost reflects the likelihood of pixel belonging to the horizon boundary. The shortest path is found in the formulated multi-stage graph using dynamic programming which conforms to the detected horizon line.

            "Abstract": "A novel patch based adaptive diffusion method is presented for image denoising. This is done with the purpose of locally and feature adaptive diffusion and for attaining patch-wise best peak signal to noise ratio. Our framework uses over-segmentation method to segment the image in to sensible regions and then diffusion of each segment/region to obtain the near-optimal solution and iterates to a lessersegmented region/patches until a best PSNR value is attained. In performing diffusion the method uses the inverse difference moment (IDM) which is a robust feature in determining the amount of local intensity variation in the presence of noise. The experiments show that the proposed method delivers high denoising performance, both in terms of objective metric and the visual quality.",

            "Abstract": "The issue of verifying the authenticity and integrity of digital images is becoming increasingly important. Copy-move forgery is one type of image tempering that is commonly used for manipulating digital content; in this case, some part of an image is copied and pasted on another region of the image. Using a non-intrusive approach to solve this problem is becoming attractive because it does not need any embedded information, but it is still far from being satisfactory. In this paper, an efficient non-intrusive method for copy-move forgery detection is presented. The method is based on image segmentation and a new denoising algorithm. First, the image is segmented using a multi-scale segmentation algorithm. Then, using the noise pattern of each segment, a separate noise image is created. The noise images are used to estimate the overall noise of the image which is further used to re-estimate the noise \u2026",

Accounting for the presence of regions that do not belong to objects of interest, global ambient illumination variations in the environment over long periods of time, and the real-time constraints inherent to visual surveillance applications are among such obstacles.

Our method uses a novel formulation of Hidden Markov Models designed to model a robot's experience and interaction with the world.

In order for cancer to survive it develops its own blood supply system, which is different than the supply system of normal tissue. The velocity of the blood flowing through the cancerous blood vessels is different than the velocity of the blood flowing through blood vessels of normal tissue. Due to this fact the ultrasound signal is absorbed differently in the cancerous areas than in the normal tissue areas. The energy of the signal, the continuity of the signal, the autocorrelation function and frequency domain properties are different in the normal tissue than in cancerous tissue. All of these indicators are weighted here for the purpose of classifying the image of the tissue as being cancerous or non-cancerous.

Many researchers have studied vessel segmentation and centerline extraction on retinal images while less attention and efforts have been devoted to cerebral angiography images. Since cerebral angiograms consist of vessels that are much noisier because of the possible patient movement, it is often a more challenging task compared to working on retinal images. In this study, we propose a multi-scale tensor voting framework to extract the vessel centerlines from cerebral angiograms. The developed framework is evaluated on a dataset of routinely acquired angiograms and reach an accuracy of 91.75 during our experiments.",

Our focus is on systems where the camera is mounted on the vehicle rather than being fixed such as in traffic/driveway monitoring systems. First, we discuss the problem of on-road vehicle detection using optical sensors followed by a brief review of intelligent vehicle research worldwide. Then, we discuss active and passive sensors to set the stage for vision-based vehicle detection. Methods aiming to quickly hypothesize the location of vehicles in an image as well as to verify the hypothesized locations are reviewed next.

These adaptive changes are thought to improve visual performance by optimizing both discrimination and recognition, but may take substantial time to fully adjust the observer to a new stimulus context. Here we explore the advantages of instead adapting the image to the observer, obviating the need for sensitivity changes within the observer. Adaptation in color vision adjusts to both the average color and luminance and to the variations in color and luminance within the scene. We modeled these adjustments as gain changes in the cones and in multiple post-receptoral mechanisms tuned to stimulus contrasts along different color-luminance directions. Responses within these mechanisms were computed for a range of different \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Horizon line detection is a demanding problem in various tasks associated with planet exploration, because no standard approaches such as global positioning system is available. Horizon line is a boundary line defined between a sky and non-sky region in 2D images, and it is an important visual clue that can be utilized for calculating the rover\u2019s position and orientation during planetary missions. The problem of segmenting an image into sky and non-sky regions is classically referred as \u201chorizon line detection\u201d. Subsequently, the localization problem can be solved by matching the detected horizon line in 2D images with virtually generated horizon lines from 3D terrain patterns. In this paper, we propose a new real-time horizon line detection (HLD) method by coupling clustering and classifications, as well as implementing the algorithm on the NVIDIA\u2019s compute unified device architecture (CUDA). The proposed method has been evaluated on NASA Basalt Hill dataset and on a set of mountainous images that have been collected from the web. The experiments demonstrate high accuracy in determining the horizon line that is proven by provided Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.",

Without using an effective scheme to select an appropriate set of features in this space, however, these methods rely mostly on powerful classification algorithms to deal with redundant and irrelevant features. In this paper, we argue that feature selection is an important problem in object detection and demonstrate that genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a simple, general, and powerful framework for selecting good subsets of features, leading to improved detection rates.

Our focus in this paper is on improving the performance of on-road vehicle detection by employing a set of Gabor filters specifically optimized for the task of vehicle detection. This is essentially a kind of feature selection, a critical issue when designing any pattern classification system. Specifically, we propose a systematic and general evolutionary Gabor filter optimization (EGFO) approach for optimizing the parameters of a set of Gabor filters in the context of vehicle detection. The objective is to build a set of filters that are capable of responding stronger to features present in vehicles than to nonvehicles, therefore improving class discrimination. The EGFO approach unifies filter design with filter selection by integrating \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of recognizing 3D objects from 2D images assuming different viewing angles and positions. Specifically, we propose improving 3D object recognition based on Algebraic Functions of Views (AFoVs) by integrating AFoVs, a powerful framework for predicting geometric appearance due to viewpoint changes, with indexing and learning. During training, we compute the space of views that groups of object features can produce under the assumption of 3D linear transformations, by combining a small number of references views that contain the object features using AFoVs. Unrealistic views (eg, due to the assumption of 3D linear transformations) are eliminated by imposing a pair of rigidity constraints based on knowledge of the transformation between the reference views of the object. To represent the space of views that an object can produce compactly while allowing efficient hypothesis generation during recognition, we propose combining indexing with learning in two stages. In the first stage, we sample the space of views of an object sparsely and represent information about the samples using indexing. In the second stage, we build probabilistic models of shape appearance by sampling the space of views of the object densely and learning the manifold formed by the samples. Learning employs the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and takes place in a \u201cuniversal\u201d, lower-dimensional, space computed through Random Projection (RP). During recognition, we extract groups of point features from the scene and we use indexing to retrieve the most feasible model groups that might have produced them (ie, hypothesis \u2026",

For classification, we compute the distance of a given part from two different eigenspaces, one corresponding to the male class and the other corresponding to female class.

Then the LL1 and HH1 subbands are divided into overlapping blocks and the similarity between blocks is calculated. The key idea is that the similarity between the copied and moved blocks from the LL1 subband should be high, while that from the HH1 subband should be low due to noise inconsistency in the moved block. Therefore, pairs of blocks are sorted based on high similarity using the LL1 subband and high dissimilarity using the HH1 subband. Using thresholding, matched pairs are obtained from the sorted list as copied and moved blocks. Experimental results show the \u2026",

We argue that feature selection is an important issue in gender classification and we demonstrate that by removing features that do not encode important gender information from the image representation of faces, the error rate can be reduced significantly. Automatic feature subset selection is used. First, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to represent each image as a feature vector (i.e., eigen-features) in a low-dimensional space, spanned by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the training images (i.e., coefficients of the linear expansion). A genetic algorithm (GA) is then used to select a subset of features from the low-dimensional representation by removing certain eigenvectors. Finally, a neural network is trained to perform gender classification using the selected eigen-feature \u2026",

Therefore these techniques can only exploit the input sample very similar to the current template set leading to local optimization of a template set. To address this issue, this paper introduces a technique by decomposing the hand silhouette into the different parts (i.e. fingers) and analyzing the confidences of these parts in order to lead to global optimization of templates.

We refer to the surviving edges as Maximally Stable Extremal Edges (MSEEs). The number of edges is further reduced by classifying MSEEs into horizon and non-horizon edges using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

There are at least three reasons for the blooming research in this field: first, the startling losses both in human lives and finance caused by vehicle accidents; second, the availability of feasible technologies accumulated within the last 30 years of computer vision research; and third, the exponential growth of processor speed has paved the way for running computation-intensive video-processing algorithms even on a low-end PC in realtime. This paper provides a critical survey of recent vision-based on-road vehicle detection systems appeared in the literature (i.e., the cameras are mounted on the vehicle rather than being static such as in traffic/driveway monitoring systems).",

This capability is particularly relevant for situations that involve collaboration among multiple agents or detection of situations that can pose a particular threat. We propose an approach that allows a physical robot to detect the intentions of others based on experience acquired through its own sensory-motor abilities. It uses this experience while taking the perspective of the agent whose intent should be recognized. The robot\u2019s capability to observe and analyze the current scene employs a novel vision-based technique for target detection and tracking, using a non-parametric recursive modeling approach. Our intent recognition method uses a novel formulation of Hidden Markov Models (HMM\u2019s) designed to model a robot\u2019s experience and its interaction with the world \u2026",

Specifically, by treating the problem of vehicle detection as a two-class classification problem, we have investigated several different feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis, wavelets, and Gabor filters. To evaluate the extracted features, we have experimented with two popular classifiers, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs).

Dynamic programming is performed for matching edge points in stereo pairs. The matching control edge points are used to drive the search for an optimal solution in the search plane.

In particular, in our project human activity is strongly related with the ability of describing and interrelating events. Thus, the L-G graph (local-global graph) provides a powerful description of the structural image features presented in an event, the SPN (stochastic Petri net) model offers a description of the functional behavior of the changes or operations in video presented in an event, and the NN (neural network) model provides the capability of extracting and learning behavioral patterns, presented in human activities.",

WLD is a texture descriptor that performs better than other similar descriptors but it is holistic due to its very construction. We extend it by introducing local spatial information; divide an image into a number of blocks, calculate WLD descriptor for each block and concatenate them. This spatial WLD descriptor has better discriminatory power. Spatial WLD descriptor has three parameters. Through a large number of experiments performed on FERET database, we report the best combination of these parameters and that our proposed spatial WLD descriptor with simplest classifier gives much better accuracy i.e. 99.08% with lesser algorithmic complexity than state-of-the-art gender recognition approaches.",

According to this theory, the variety of 2D views depicting an object can be expressed as a combination of a small number of 2D views of the object. This implies a simple and powerful strategy for object recognition: novel 2D views of an object (2D or 3D) can be recognized by simply matching them to combinations of known 2D views of the object. In other words, objects in a scene are recognized by \"predicting\" their appearance through the combination of known views of the objects.

Kruskal-Wallis feature selection technique is applied to the histograms to select the significant bins for race recognition. Then the selected bins from the two histograms are concatenated block by block to produce the final feature set of the face image. Minimum city block distance is used as a classifier.

However, the presence of intrinsically low quality fingerprints and various distortions introduced during the acquisition process pose challenges in the development of robust and reliable feature extraction and matching algorithms. Our focus in this study is on improving minutiae-based fingerprint matching by effectively combining minutiae information from multiple impressions of the same finger. Specifically, we present a new minutiae template-merging approach based on hierarchical Delaunay triangulations. The key idea is synthesizing a super-template from multiple enrollment templates to increase coverage area, restore missing features, and alleviate spurious minutiae. Each minutia in the super-template is assigned a weight representing its frequency of occurrence, which \u2026",

Mass is one type of breast lesion and the detection of masses is highly challenged problem. Almost all methods that have been proposed so far suffer from high number of false positives and false negatives. In this paper, a method for detecting true masses is presented, especially, for the reduction of false positives and false negatives. The key idea of the proposal is the use of Gabor filter banks for extracting the most representative and discriminative local spatial textural properties of masses that are present in mammograms at different orientations and scales. The system is evaluated on 512 (256 normal+256 true mass) regions of interests (ROIs) extracted from digital mammograms of DDSM database. We performed experiments with Gabor filter \u2026",

A major challenge in the design of exergames, however, is that it is difficult to assess the amount of physical activity an exergame yields due to limitations of existing techniques to assess energy expenditure of exergaming activities. With recent advances in commercial depth sensing technology to accurately track players' motions in 3D, we present a technique called Vizical that uses a non-linear regression approach to accurately predict energy expenditure in real-time. Vizical may allow for creating exergames that can report energy expenditure while playing, and whose intensity can be adjusted in real-time to stimulate larger health benefits.",

Currently, the only technology that satisfies the advanced requirements of hand-based input for HCI is glovebased sensing. This technology, however, has several drawbacks including that it hinders the ease and naturalness with which the user can interact with the computer controlled environment, and it requires long calibration and setup procedures. Computer vision has the potential to provide much more natural, non-contact solutions. As a result, there have been considerable research efforts to use the hand as an input device for HCI. A very challenging problem in this context, which is the focus of this review, is recovering the 3D pose of the hand and the fingers as glove-based devices do.

Although combining different cues for boundary detection has been shown to outperform methods using a single cue, results can be further improved by integrating perceptual organization cues with the boundary detection process.

The focus of this study is on the sensitivity of thermal IR imagery to facial occlusions caused by eyeglasses. Specifically, our experimental results illustrate that recognition performance in the IR spectrum degrades seriously when eyeglasses are present in the probe image but not in the gallery image and vice versa. To address this serious limitation of IR, we propose fusing IR with visible imagery. Since IR and visible imagery capture intrinsically different characteristics of the observed faces, intuitively, a better face description could be found by utilizing the complimentary information present in the two spectra.

The velocity of the blood flowing through the cancerous blood vessels is different than the velocity of the blood flowing through blood vessels of normal tissue. Due to this fact the ultrasound signal is absorbed differently in the cancerous areas than in the normal tissue areas. The energy of the signal, the continuity of the signal, the autocorrelation function and frequency domain properties are different in the normal tissue than in cancerous tissue. All of these indicators are weighted here for the purpose of classifying the image of the tissue as being cancerous or non cancerous.

            "Abstract": "An algorithm of cancer recognition of ultrasound images is developed in this paper. As we pointed out in our previous work, in order for cancer to survive it develops its own blood supply system, which is different than the supply system of normal tissue. The velocity of the blood flowing through the cancerous blood ves-sels is different than the velocity of the blood flowing through blood vessels of normal tissue. Due to this fact the ultrasound signal is absorbed differently in the cancerous areas than in the normal tissue areas. The energy of the signal, the continuity of the signal, the autocorrelation function and frequency domain properties are different in the normal tissue than in cancerous tissue. All of these indicators are weighted here for the purpose of classifying the image of the tissue as being cancerous or non cancerous. Preliminary results based on limited number of ultrasound images show that our method has the ability to recognize cancer in ultrasound images. tor to obtain several images of the part of the body which is of particular interest; furthermore, the acquisition of multiple images from different angles also allows for a 3-D image reconstruction using stereo image algorithms. Due to the multiple reflections of the sound signal (scattering of the signal), significant noise is incorporated with the signal. If we obtain several images of the same tissue sections by stabilizing the instrument and the patient, then we can reduce the noise considerably. The changes in the noise component are positive and negative, and they are a result of the fluctuation of the voltage, the fact that the patient is not totally still, and due to the inability of the instrument \u2026",

            "Abstract": "LFAD is a novel locally-and feature-adaptive diffusion based method for removing additive white Gaussian (AWG) noise in images. The method approaches each image region individually and uses a different number of diffusion iterations per region to attain the best objective quality according to the PSNR metric. Unlike block-transform based methods, which perform with a predetermined block size, and clustering-based denoising methods, which use a fixed number of classes, our method searches for an optimum patch size through an iterative diffusion process. It is initialized with a small patch size and proceeds with aggregated (ie, merged) patches until the best PSNR value is attained. Then the diffusion model is modified; instead of the gradient value, we use the inverse difference moment (IDM), which is a robust feature in determining the amount of local intensity variation in the presence of noise. Experiments with benchmark images and various noise levels show that the designed LFAD outperforms advanced diffusionbased denoising methods, and it is competitive with state-of-the-art block-transformed techniques; block and ring artifacts inherent to transform-based methods are reduced while PSNR levels are comparable.",

            "Abstract": "Horizon or skyline detection plays a vital role towards mountainous visual geo-localization, however most of the recently proposed visual geo-localization approaches rely on user-in-the-loop skyline detection methods. Detecting such a segmenting boundary fully autonomously would definitely be a step forward for these localization approaches. This paper provides a quantitative comparison of four such methods for autonomous horizon/sky line detection on an extensive data set. Specifically, we provide the comparison between four recently proposed segmentation methods; one explicitly targeting the problem of horizon detection[2], second focused on visual geo-localization but relying on accurate detection of skyline [15] and other two proposed for general semantic segmentation - Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) [21] and SegNet[22]. Each of the first two methods is trained on a common training set [11 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Zernike Moments are useful tools in pattern recognition and image analysis due to their orthogonality and rotation invariance property. However, direct computation of these moments is very expensive, limiting their use especially at high orders. There have been some efforts to reduce the computational cost by employing quantized polar coordinate systems, which also reduce the accuracy of the moments. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to accurately calculate Zernike moments at high orders. To preserve accuracy, we do not use any form of coordinate transformation and employ arbitrary precision arithmetic. The computational complexity is reduced by detecting the common terms in Zernike moments with different order and repetition. Experimental results show that our method is more accurate than other methods and it has comparable computational complexity especially in case of using \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Dune-field patterns are believed to behave as self-organizing systems, but what causes the patterns to form is still poorly understood. The most obvious (and in many cases the most significant) aspect of a dune system is the pattern of dune crest lines. Extracting meaningful features such as crest length, orientation, spacing, bifurcations, and merging of crests from image data can reveal important information about the specific dune-field morphological properties, development, and response to changes in boundary conditions, but manual methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming. We are developing the capability to recognize and characterize patterns of sand dunes on planetary surfaces. Our goal is to develop a robust methodology and the necessary algorithms for automated or semi-automated extraction of dune morphometric information from image data. Our main approach uses image processing \u2026",
