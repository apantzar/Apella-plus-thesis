            "Abstract": "The 4G mobile era will be based on a heterogeneous infrastructure comprising different wireless (and wired) systems in a complementary manner, where users will enjoy ubiquitous access to applications in an 'Always Best Connected' (ABC) ? mode that utilises the most efficient combination of systems available (e.g. UMTS and WLAN). We analyse the 'ABC' concept in an interworked UMTS/WLAN network context and reveal important issues. Next, we identify major requirements of the 'ABC' capacity, point out the limitations of UTMS/WLAN standards and discuss key enabling technologies and research efforts. We develop an application model for 'ABC' and analyse its complexity proving that, in principle, being 'ABC' translates to a family of NP-hard problems. Next, we present the design of an object-oriented UML real-time model for an 'ABC' system and provide preliminary results from simulation scenarios. In \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Multimedia content delivery via the cellular infrastructure increases fast due to the very high volumes of mobile video traffic generated by the billions of end devices populating the mobile data network. A critical mass of mobile video content requests refers to the consumption of the same popular video content, which is consumed by different end terminals spanning small geographical regions. Such content requests place a great burden on the backhaul of content-agnostic cellular networks, which fail to exploit the correlation of video requests to decongest their backhaul links. This creates redundant retransmissions while fetching the same video content from a central server to the network edge, using the bandwidth-limited backhaul at peak-time periods. With the integration of multi-access edge computing (MEC) capabilities in 5G mobile cellular networks, mobile network operators can place popular video content \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Although the resource reservation protocol (RSVP) is considered efficient for fixed access networks, its performance is problematic over wireless links, due to the variable available bandwidth they provide, asking for adaptable resource management techniques. If, for example, the channel quality falls to a level that the available bandwidth cannot support all reservations of admitted flows, then none of them is operating properly. One solution to this problem is to reject one or more of the flows in order to maintain quality of service (QoS) to the rest. In this paper describes a flow rejection mechanism that is based on priorities and bandwidth requirements, and aims at minimizing the number of rejected flows. Simulation results have shown that, compared to a random rejection mechanism, the attained flow rejection probability is significantly reduced, especially for high priority flows, while, at the same time, the bandwidth \u2026",

The proposed scheme uses the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol to protect the authentication procedure of EAP-SIM by encapsulating its packets. In this way the vulnerabilities of EAPSIM authentication method are eliminated. After the employment of IKEv2, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel is established that protects data transferred over the air interface. The tunnel, which is based on IPsec, ensures confidentiality, authentication and integrity of the data exchanged in the WLAN environment. The proposed scheme has minimal impact on the existing network infrastructure. The user is still authenticated by proving the possession of a SIM card, in order to get subscribed in his home network for billing and charging purposes. The proposed scheme requires only that each end-point of the established VPN tunnel must have the appropriate IPsec software.",

In this paper an architecture for enhancing the GPRS core network with IP QoS support is presented. The proposed scheme is based on the integrated services (IntServ) architecture, processed in the IETF during the past years. The applicability of the proposed architecture as well as the required signalling enhancements and modifications in the components of the GPRS architecture are discussed. To identify the applicability of our proposal in a real GPRS network, a simulation model of the proposed IntServ architecture was developed in order to quantify the effect that signalling overhead has on GPRS \u2026",

Since IP was not designed to support such functionality, new protocols have been specified and implemented to tackle these issues. Mobile IP is currently the dominant protocol that allows users to retain connectivity while roaming in IP networks. RSVP (Resource reSerVation Protocol) is a well established protocol for reserving network resources to support QoS requirements. These protocols, when deployed separately, can work quite efficiently. However, if their functionality is combined, several inefficiencies arise in terms of QoS deterioration and misuse of the network resources. To minimize these inefficiencies, we propose a new approach that limits mobility and QoS related network modifications inside the domain, in which a user moves \u2026",

The mechanism coordinates adaptations of the modulation order at the Physical layer and the media encoding mode at the Application layer, to improve packet loss rate, throughput and mean delay. With the use of Continuous Flow Modeling, the system is considered as a \u201cfluid\u201d queue with inflow and outflow rates representing its traffic generation and service rates, respectively. Each data source is modeled as a Markov chain, from the steady-state of which the optimal adaptation thresholds of the cross-layer mechanism are derived. Performance evaluation results show that the optimized operation of the mechanism attains a significant performance improvement compared to both the sub-optimal mechanism, and a legacy system.",

A large number of solutions have been proposed in an attempt to tackle all relevant technical issues concerning handover management. In order to evaluate these solutions, a more systematic categorization is needed. This survey gives an overview of the most recent handover management architectures for integrated WLAN/Cellular networks, focusing mainly on 802.11-based WLANs and GPRS/UMTS cellular networks.

In this paper we introduce a novel use for a wireless network based on the IEEE 802.11 standard: a smart spaces system that proposes to wireless users to assume optimum locations in order to obtain a satisfactory QoS level when the wireless hot-spot becomes saturated. The system, being kept up to date with the traffic across the network and the location of each user, is capable of making the appropriate proposal urging users to move to new locations at reasonable distances. In that way, user perceived QoS and wireless network load-balancing can be both achieved. MITOS is the name of the developed smart spaces system. We discuss the general system architecture and operation as well as the optimum proposal algorithm. The operation of the system was verified in \u2026",

One of the main design challenges in 802.16 is the introduction of an efficient traffic scheduler that handles resource allocation in the wireless interface. This paper proposes such a scheduler, referred to as the \"frame registry tree scheduler\", that aims at providing differentiated treatment to data connections, based on their QoS characteristics. The scheduler uses a tree structure in order to prepare time frame creation and reduce processing needs at the beginning of each time frame. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduler can attain considerable improvement in terms of throughput and packet losses",

Fixed spectrum allocation lacks efficient mechanisms for sharing spectral resources. Prompted by the recent regulatory changes and radio technology advances, opportunistic use of spectrum bands is becoming increasingly attractive, as it can alleviate the spectrum scarcity problem in the unlicensed bands. We study the dynamic spectrum access for a CDMA wireless environment, where unlicensed users run elastic data applications, i.e., throughput has to be within a range of acceptable values. Unlicensed users may transmit in idle licensed bands (i.e., not used by a licensed user). We focus on the band selection problem of unlicensed users. We propose a prediction-driven and a probabilistic, distributed strategy with which users might efficiently share the available resources \u2026",

However, existing proposals for supporting mobility with SIP are not efficient in handling micro-mobility and do not cater for all types of traffic. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical mobile SIP (HMSIP), for efficient micro-mobility management in SIP environments. HMSIP is a SIP-based scheme that builds on existing IP mobility protocols, aiming at integrating their key concepts in the most beneficial way. Our proposed scheme minimizes the handoff latency and the backbone signaling overhead, while catering for all types of traffic. Moreover, HMSIP can be effectively \u2026",

The cognitive radio network follows the principles of opportunistic spectrum access that utilises an optimal power adaptation policy for channel allocation.

The vast collection of heterogeneous network equipment with divergent radio capabilities (e.g. multi-GHz operation) is vulnerable to wireless network attacks, raising questions on the service availability and coverage performance of future multi-tier wireless networks. In this paper, we study the impact of black hole attacks on service coverage of multi-tier heterogeneous wireless networks and derive closed form expressions when network nodes are unable to identify and avoid black hole nodes. Assuming access to multiple bands, the derived expressions can be readily used to assess the performance gains following from the employment of different association policies and \u2026",

This increases the spatial capacity of the cellular system and reduces the costs for installing, managing, and operating the radio access network. However, the impact of such an unplanned network densification on the robustness of cell handover (HO) still remains unclear and needs to be studied. For this purpose, in this paper we highlight the key aspects of the cell HO process in the presence of small cells and identify the main issues that affect its robustness. We summarize lessons learned from the rich literature on HO decision algorithms for small cells, and present an algorithm for alleviating interference in the cellular uplink while prolonging the battery lifetime of the user terminal.

            "Abstract": "Heterogeneous networks combine different access technologies. An important problem in such networks is the selection of the most suitable radio access network. To perform this task efficiently, a lot of information is required, such as signal strength, QoS, monetary cost, battery consumption, and user preferences. These are well known issues and a considerable effort has been made to tackle them using a number of solutions. These efforts improve the performance of vertical handover but also add considerable complexity. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced algorithm for radio access network selection, which is simple, flexible and applicable to future mobile systems. Its main characteristics are the distribution of the radio access selection process among the mobile terminal and the core network, the evaluation of mobile terminal connections separately and the primary role of user preferences in the final decision. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through simulation results, which show that the algorithm provides a high rate of user satisfaction. It decreases the messages required for the vertical handovers in the whole network and it alleviates the core network from the processing of unnecessary requests.",

In this way, the proposed framework resolves pseudo-congestion and enables elastic radio-resource management while meeting the individual traffic requirements at the end users. The formation of virtual cells is driven by a QoE-centric approach that monitors whether the Mean-Opinion Score (MOS) of specific applications drops below a prescribed user-specific threshold.

In this concept, we provide a comprehensive study on device discovery protocols and we examine the key design aspects towards an LTE-tailored device discovery. We give insights into the radio access approach that can be used for device discovery, considering in-coverage synchronized devices that exploit a dedicated spectrum portion to discover each other. Useful remarks on the optimal theoretical performance in terms of the number of required discovery transmissions and time-slots are presented, while comparative simulation results for various radio access approaches are provided.",

The interaction of multiple clients with a caching server is modeled as a non-cooperative game, in which clients are viewed as players, and the caching server disk space as a resource for which players are competing. However, some clients may continuously request new objects, thus, occupying a considerable portion of the cache disk, enjoying high hit rates. Such an aggressive behavior may have significant impact to the overall cache performance, as few clients may monopolize the total disk space, and the remaining clients may suffer the eviction of their \"important\" resources from the cache, thus, experiencing numerous cache misses. Moreover, it is observed that the majority of hits in cache systems are due to shared objects, i.e., clients tend to refer to a \"pool\" of common resources.

The question that arises is whether (and to what extent) NB-IoT can meet the requirement for massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) in the 5G era. In view of this, we study coverage enhancement in NB-IoT. We describe the subframe structure for various physical channels of NB-IoT and explain the repetition mechanism used for downlink transmissions in poor coverage areas. Focusing on optimizing this mechanism, we analyze how the latency and user blockage can be reduced by a proper selection of the downlink radio resources.",

To this end, several mechanisms of physical layers such as adaptive modulation, multiple-input multiple output antennas; channel coding and/or combination of them should be studied. These studies should be accomplished in terms of spectral efficiency. Therefore, the gain of cognitive radio in wireless networks available into the market will be identified practically. Another issue under consideration should be the performance evaluation of cognitive radio assuming a cross-layer combination between the cognitive physical and the upper layers. To this direction, this paper presents a study on spectral efficiency at the physical layer with cognitive capabilities. In sequel, we study a cross-layer combination of physical layer with upper layers in the same cognitive context. The performance gain of cognitive radio in such a physical layer is realized practically as well as a few cross-layer design issues have been raised.",

These entities are located in mobility enhanced switches that control the execution of mobility procedures (e.g., handovers).The main benefit from the application of LMCP is the establishment of connections that do not contain any misrouted segments. Furthermore, it requires minor modifications to the PNNI and enables its inter-working with other location management mechanisms.

A simple protocol is proposed that allows nodes to report their charging conditions in an effort to select efficient energy-beamforming strategies. Analytical expressions for the probability of successful information reception and successful reporting are provided for two benchmark schemes: the random and the circular energy-beamforming scheme. A Markov chain is used for the former to model the energy level of sensor nodes. Simple sector selection strategies are presented and their performance, in terms of delay and failure information delivery, is assessed through simulations. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Mobile/wireless Internet is becoming available with the advent of third generation (3G) mobile communication systems. Along with the variety of new perspectives, mobile Internet also raises new concerns on security issues. The radio transmission is by nature more susceptible to eavesdropping and fraud in use than wireline transmission. The user mobility and the universal network access certainly provoke security treats. The introduction of IP-based transport technology to the core of 3G networks brings along new vulnerabilities and potential threats. Mobile network operators do not deploy their own private networks, but they rather rely on the existing Internet infrastructure for the establishment of intra-network, and inter-network communications. Furthermore, the complex network topologies and the heterogeneity of the involved technologies increase the dependability challenge.Security is a critical factor to realize the opportunities presented by the ubiquity of mobile devices and networks. It is therefore important to address information security concerns for wireless applications, especially for those applications that have anything to do with mobile e-business, e-government, e-finance and e-health. Moreover, seamless access to private networks by mobile workforce is expected to be a fashionable and valuable service. Telemetry and other un-tethered equipment, traveling sale forces, field maintenance crews, telecommuters, and other mobile professionals are driving demands for anywhereanytime secure access to corporate intranets, databases, and e-mail servers.",

A promising approach towards this direction is to allow the establishment of direct device-to-device (D2D) communications in the assigned spectrum.

An algorithmic framework for the management of the decision-making requests for reconfiguration or handovers is proposed.

This contribution exploits a cohesive control and management framework for serving reconfigurable devices; the primary functional entities of this logical model are described, along with a physical realization in Beyond 3G networks. In order to assure end-to-end quality of service for user traffic generated upon radio software download and equipment reconfiguration, a novel negotiation control scheme for the core network is proposed. As reconfigurability will gradually stretch from end-user devices to base stations and, in the long term, to interior network elements, the considered mechanism employs an end-to-end label capturing key reconfiguration indicators. The paper raises the issue of self-awareness of network nodes on the end-to-end data path established after a reconfiguration and discusses the challenge of providing transparent operation over so-called reconfigurationignorant nodes.",

For ubiquitous reconfiguration to become commonplace in wireless mobile communications, a global architecture for modeling, expressing and circulating metadata essential to reconfiguration, including reconfigurable device capabilities and semantic properties of reconfigurable protocol stacks, is necessary. We outline relative standardization initiatives in the mobile domain, summarize existing work in reconfiguration architectures and identify key shortcomings that may hinder the advent of ubiquitously reconfigurable systems. Further on, we point out some major limitations of current metadata standards in the mobile domain for the representation of capability information pertaining to reconfigurable protocol stacks. We identify essential metadata classes in support of reconfigurable communication systems, and introduce an associated object-oriented UML model. We elaborate on the design rationale of the UML model, presenting and discussing the alternative metadata representation standards and suitable encoding formats.

In this paper, we take advantage of recent subjective results regarding the impact of throughput fluctuations on the QoE of interactive applications and revisit well-known scheduling algorithms. By quantifying the impact of traditional radio schedulers on user-perceived QoE, we manage to draw new conclusions regarding the radio scheduling problem, such as the importance and impact of consistency of the resource allocation decisions on the users' QoE. As main result, fair algorithms inherently seem to be more consistent than greedy ones, providing less throughput fluctuations and, thus, better QoE.

Alas, this significant increase in flexibility has come at the cost of an increased complexity in network management tasks, particularly with regard to the accommodation of performance requirements. Especially in mobile settings, this is due to the greater probability of unforeseen communication contexts that renders the efficient provisioning of multiple dissimilar protocol stacks a challenging task. To address this unpredictability, several approaches based on the dynamic adaptation of protocol stacks during runtime have been proposed and investigated over the years. This article \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Broadband and mobile communications are presently the two major drivers in the telecommunications industry. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is considered the most suitable transport technique for the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN), due to its ability to flexibly support a wide range of services with Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. These services are categorized in five classes according to their traffic generation rate pattern: Constant Bit Rate (CBR), real-time Variable Bit Rate (rt-VBR), non-real-time Variable Bit Rate (nrt-VBR), Available Bit Rate (ABR) and Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR). On the other hand, wireless communications are enjoying a large growth in the last decade. Wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) in particular, are becoming popular for indoor data communications because of their tetherless feature and increasing transmission speed. The combination of wireless communications and ATM, referred to as \u201cwireless ATM\u201d, aims at providing freedom of mobility with service advantages and QoS guarantees.",

Flow rejection occurs when the channel quality decreases to a level that even the minimum bandwidth requirements per flow cannot be fulfilled. The proposed algorithm aims at significantly improving the flow dropping probability, without affecting the bandwidth utilization. Its operation is based on setting priority classes and rejecting the minimum required number of flows per class, in order to guarantee QoS to the remaining. Both mathematical analysis and simulation results show that the overall flow rejection probability can be significantly reduced.",

In this paper, we propose a D2D resource allocator based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) theory. ACO is exploited towards identifying interference isolated D2D links that can safely share the same resources, consulting a graph representation of the network. Simulation studies demonstrate the self-learning nature of this method, which results to a comparable performance to that of an optimal resource allocator of significantly higher computational complexity.",

To do so, we introduce a novel approach for caching popular contents. This caching strategy follows a dynamic programming approach to tackle the optimization complexity of selecting most popular files among a wide range of files, under certain constraints. The proposed strategy gives the combination of popular files to be cached that maximizes the optimal cache hit probability with a pseudo-polynomial time complexity.

One of the most promising contributors towards this direction is the shift from Quality of Service (QoS) to Quality of Experience (QoE) service provisioning paradigms. QoE, i.e., the degree of delight or annoyance of a service as this is perceived by the end-user, paves the way for flexible service management and personalized quality monitoring. This is enabled by exploiting parametric QoE assessment models, namely specific formula-based QoE estimation methods. In this paper, recognizing a gap in the literature between the lack of a proper manual regarding the objective QoE estimation and the ever increasing interest from network stakeholders for QoE intelligence, we provide a comprehensive guide to standardized and state-of-the \u2026",

To reduce the associated overhead, only percentages of inbound traffic are copied to the cell's neighborhood on the basis of estimated probabilities. The time scheduling for datagram relocation is also taken into account. Simulations of the proposed architecture show substantial performance improvements for TCP traffic.",

Flow rejection occurs when the channel quality decreases to a level that even the minimum bandwidth requirements per flow cannot be fulfilled.

Selecting the best target server for dispatching a mobile agent is, therefore, a multi-faceted problem that needs to be carefully tackled. In this paper we propose distributed, adaptive routing schemes (next node selection) for mobile agents. The proposed schemes overcome risks like load oscillations, i.e., agents simultaneously abandoning a congested node in search for other, less saturated node.

Considering the benefits for operators and consumers, a plethora of resource and interference management approaches in the literature deal with parallel cellular and D2D transmissions. However, this feature is not yet supported by modern cellular systems, such as the Long Term Evolution (LTE). The current paper targets at filling this gap by enabling D2D transmissions in LTE networks. Standardized LTE capabilities are utilized to provide a comprehensive framework on which existing or future resource and interference management schemes for D2D communications may be applied. The proposed framework is assessed under a moderate scenario where the cellular resource management policy is not affected. Results show that multiple D2D \u2026",

The inherent subjectivity in this definition explains the fact that QoE research has attracted interest from multiple disciplines and has been studied from various angles. In this work, we address QoE from a telecom operator\u2019s perspective, providing insights towards enabling QoE provisioning in the next generations of cellular networks. In cellular networks, despite the catholic presence of inherently deployed Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, QoE has been more of an \u201cafterthought\u201d. This means that previous and existing network generations have not been inherently designed with QoE principles in mind. It is envisioned, however, that the next, ie 5th, generation of communication networks will be more user-centric, designed to deliver consistent experience to the users and to give them the perception of \u201cinfinite capacity\u201d[2].",

A major deficiency of the current GPRS specification is the lack of adequate IP quality of service support. Two schemes for enhancing the GPRS architecture with the existing IP QoS support architectures, IntServ and DiffServ, are proposed. Solutions are proposed to the problem of establishing QoS reservations across the GPRS core network, and the required signaling enhancements and modifications in the components of the GPRS architecture are identified. Of the two proposed schemes the IntServ one requires frequent refreshing of state information and extra signaling. To quantify the effect that signaling overhead has on GPRS operation and performance, a simulation model of the proposed IntServ architecture was developed, which \u2026",

Among the various aspects of QoS provisioning, QoS state establishment and maintenance in intermediate routers is a major factor, responsible for dynamic resource allocation. The dynamic manipulation of QoS state is possible through the utilization of appropriate QoS signaling that triggers the respective resource allocation in QoS-capable network elements. At first, protocol design assumed a homogeneous underlying network and resulted in end-to-end QoS protocols that applied a specific QoS configuration in all routers along the path.

In such an environment, it is expected that mobility enhanced switches will co-exist with standard switches (i.e., no support for mobility procedures), and that different sets of switches will form disjoint areas of continuous radio coverage. LAMPS takes advantage of the PNNI routing functionality to tackle the location management requirements. In addition, location agents located in the mobility enhanced switches, store when required, the location areas of the mobile terminals.",
