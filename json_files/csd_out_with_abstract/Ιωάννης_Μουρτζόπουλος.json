The resonance frequency, absorption and Q factor of the panel was evaluated at different positions for a sound source and different geometries of the panel mainly over the frequency range from 20Hz to 100Hz. The results showed that as the source moves away from the panel, the absorbed frequency is getting lower (2-3Hz every 0.1 m) but the Q factor stays constant. The attenuation 5-7 meters from the panel can be up to 20dB for the central absorption frequency. Also it was observed that the absorption frequency can be lower by reducing the panel\u2019s perforation density.",

The BRTFs are related to the anechoic Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) and the corresponding RTFs. Consequently, the statistical properties of the RTFs and HRTFs can be systematically related to the statistical properties of the BRTFs. In this work, the standard deviation of BRTFs measured in different types of rooms, for various source/receiver distances and azimuth angles is computed. The derived values are compared to the ones obtained from the single channel RTFs measured at the same positions. Their relationship to the 5.57 dB value is discussed.",

Light-to-sound transduction is achieved via laser-induced breakdown, leading to the formation of plasma acoustic sources in any desired spatial location. The acoustic signal is encoded into pulse streams via a discrete-time audio modulation and is reproduced by fast consecutive excitation of the target medium with appropriately modulated laser pulses. This results in the signal being directly reconstructed at the desired location of the target medium without the need for a receiver or demodulation device. In this work, the principles and evaluation results of such a novel laser-sound prototype system are presented.

However, in the past few decades there has been an increasing interest towards the acoustical and sensual properties of the material past. Especially within sensual archaeology, current research considers the aural perspectives of ancient sacred grottos and other rural sacred places, offering the potential to enrich interpretations of how ancient buildings or natural spaces were used, and proclaiming the importance of sound as one of the determinants in their identification as places of divine presence and worship [3, 4, 5, 6].(c) European Acoustics AssociationCaves are understood as complicated enclosed spaces composed of numerous surfaces, objects, and geometries, creating an acoustic space which behaves differently from open-air spaces [7]. Likewise, the underground sanctuaries dedicated to the Nymphs and Pan in ancient Greece should not only be perceived as landscapes with certain visual characteristics, but also as soundscapes with important auditory features [8]. As a result, an acoustic survey of these caves and an appropriate analysis of their aural characteristics, combined with archaeological and musical methods is necessary, in order to understand whether sound was a determining factor in the selection of caves as appropriate sacred sites to host the combined cult of Pan and the Nymphs in antiquity.",

            "Abstract": "Theatre masks were fundamental elements of the ancient Greek theatre tradition, having a dramatic impact on the artistic performance. Apart from the obvious change of the visual appearance of the actors, the masks also altered the acoustic characteristics of their voices. Therefore, both from the spectator\u2019s and the actor\u2019s point of view these masks significantly modified the acoustic events and inevitably transformed the overall theatrical experience. As the art of theatre evolved, the physical characteristics of the masks were transformed in terms of their size, mouth and ear openings and construction materials. Quite recently, masks replicating the original shape and structure of the ancient prototypes have been constructed based on the relevant literature and on archaeological findings. In this work, such a theatre mask is created in order to measure the corresponding acoustic characteristics. For this, the KEMAR manikin is used and the acoustic impulse responses are measured both from the listener\u2019s and the speaker\u2019s point of view. Based on semi-anechoic measurements the acoustic effect of the mask is presented for various azimuth angles and the spectral and timbral characteristics of the reconstructed mask are discussed. Two of the authors have already analysed the perceptual effect of the mask on the actors, while studying how they alter the overall artistic performance. In the present work, the above research results are discussed in relation to the obtained acoustic measurements, providing insights on the perceptual impact of the masks\u2019 employment.",

The method considered in this work is that of inverse filtering using complex-smoothed responses. Experiments were conducted via simulation, using real room measurements with variable reverberation time and for different room positions. The results indicate a small but consistent increase of the ASR rate in all test cases.",

Although the exact form, shape and material of such masks can be only deduced from limited archaeological finds, based on these and other sources, a number of typical mask templates were constructed covering most of the potential alternative forms. For these mask templates, the acoustic frequency response, the angle-dependent radiation and the actor's voice self-perception were tested via use of a KEMAR manikin and appropriate post processing. The novel results illustrate important acoustic and voice communication aspects of these masks.",

Plasma filaments in air can be considered as massless optoacoustic sound sources, since filamentation is followed by the emission of a sound pulse with acoustic energy within and beyond the audible range. In this work, the acoustic radiation of plasma filaments is studied using a simple model based on the classical cylindrical acoustic source. The impact of the filament?s geometry, particularly its length, on the radiation directivity is systematically evaluated. The limit in length for omnidirectional radiation within the audible range is identified and the acoustic frequency spectrum of the sound pulses is calculated and compared to that taken from broadband acoustic measurements. The possibility of studying such laser filament sound sources via scale models developed in acoustics simulation software is examined and compared to measured results.",

Byzantine churches have extremely long Reverberation Time and their acoustics is dominated by the contributions of the diffuse sound field. Thus, the sound character of Byzantine chanting is closely linked to the acoustic reverberation. In this work we examine the perceived preference for the various features of reverberation imposed on excerpts of Byzantine psalms. This is achieved by simulations of typical churches with varying internal volume, reverberation time and source/receiver distance, utilizing chants from the DAMASKINOS corpus. The simulation (auralization) results were evaluated via statistical preference method using a group of 15 listeners. The results of such controlled experiments illustrate the listener preferences and acceptability of various parameters or combinations of parameters related to reverberation, eg of the Reverberation Time value in relation to church dimensions and listener position inside the church.",

The paper will examine the limitations imposed by current technologies and methods in each of these contributing fields, ie: WLANs, amplification, signal processing for format adaptation and acoustics compensation and direct acoustic transduction of digital streams. It will be shown that current WLAN protocols lacking adequate quality guarantees cannot support the required high resolution multichannel audio traffic without appropriate post-processing for potential channel-induced error concealment. It will be also discussed why such systems may need to incorporate flexible bitstream conversion between PCM audio (the de-facto format after wireless reception), PWM (most \u2026",

Through the continuous evolution during the Roman era, via the Renaissance theaters and the modern concert halls, these specially constructed spaces allowed the performance-based art forms to be sustained and evolve as essential constituents of the western cultural heritage and civilization.

Complete elimination of these distortions usually requires excessive oversampling of the source PCM audio signal, which results to impractical realizations of digital PWM systems. In this paper, a description of digital PWM distortion generation mechanism is given and a novel principle for their minimization is proposed, based on a process having some similarity to the dithering principle employed in multibit signal quantization.

Moreover, the excitation signal derived from the Linear Prediction (LP) analysis of the noisy speech along with the estimated power spectrum of the late reflections are used to suppress late reverberation through spectral subtraction while a Wiener filter compensates for the ambient noise.

Using this hardware, three software applications were implemented:(i) a device driver that handles the communication of the digital audio capture card with the PDA,(ii) a PDA application that realizes the WiFi connection with the personal computer, also incorporating a data recording function and suitable presentation of their analysis, and (iii) the personal computer application that initiates the playback sequence as dictated by the connected PDA.

Although mostly located around the Mediterranean, such theatres were built in every major city of the ancient world in Europe, Middle East, North Africa and beyond, spreading from Alexandria on Oxus (now Ai Khanum) in Afghanistan to Lisbon along the east-west axis, and from the Roman sites in northern England to Ptolemais in southern Egypt, along the north-south axis. To date, 741 ancient theatre structures have been identified and documented, 194 being earlier Greek theatres, 425 theatres and 46 odeia being from the Roman period and another 76 recorded theatres not accurately categorised. The evolution of these theatres starts from 6th century BC and the transition from the Hellenistic to the Roman period is placed around the mid-1st century BC. These ancient theatres stand as the earliest testament to the close relationship \u2026",

In this study, this approach is extended to the binaural case. Binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) measured in various enclosed spaces, for various source/receiver distances and orientation angles are used. Reverberant speech signals are used in a listening test where the test subjects are asked to evaluate the perceived coloration effect on the audio signals. The results of the listening test are discussed as a function of the source/receiver listener, orientation angle (azimuth plane) of the BRIR measurements. Based on the listening test results, a model for the minimum audible spectral standard deviation difference is proposed.",

Then, an auditory masking model is employed in sub-bands to extract the reverberation masking index (RMI) which identifies signal regions with perceived alterations due to late reverberation. Utilizing a selective signal processing technique only these regions are suppressed through sub-band temporal envelope filtering based on analytical expressions.

However, given that DTAs generally increase harmonic distortion, especially for off-axis listening positions, optimization in signal encoding and bit-to-transducer assignment, is necessary. Here, a number of novel, alternative strategies are examined, concerning the input signal encoding via PCM-to-PWM conversion, as well as techniques for bit-assignment on the transducers of a DTA.

This letter presents a systematic study, both experimental and theoretical, of the acoustic radiation by femtosecond laser-generated filaments. A theoretical model is developed based on the experimental results and is used to evaluate the directivity of the filament's acoustic radiation within and beyond the audible frequency range. It is shown that the acoustic directivity of plasma filaments can be derived from the model of a weighted acoustic line source, consisting of elementary point sources with N-shaped excitation.",

DBPWM is evaluated in terms of energy efficiency (thermal loading) and reproduction fidelity for direct driving of loudspeaker units by DBPWM signals. Detailed physical models of low-frequency (woofer) and high-frequency (tweeter) loudspeakers are employed for simulation of the coupling between the DBPWM signal and the electro-mechanical and acoustic properties of loudspeaker systems in the broadband PWM spectral range. Derived frequency responses are used to estimate the reproduced sound signal of the loudspeaker. Equivalent impedance of the speaker's voice coil is used to estimate thermal loading by the DBPWM signal's out-of-band spectral energy, comparing standard filtered PWM implementations to the proposed method.",

Byzantine churches/cathedrals are usually characterized by particularly diffuse fields and very long Reverberation Time (RT) values. In the first part of this work, the perceptual effect of long reverberation on Byzantine music excerpts is investigated. Then, a case where Byzantine music is recorded in non-ideal acoustic conditions is considered. In such scenarios, a sound engineer might require to add artificial reverb on the recordings.

Apart from the obvious change of the visual appearance of the actors, the masks also altered the acoustic characteristics of their voices. Therefore, both from the listener\u2019s and the actor\u2019s points of view these masks significantly modified the acoustic events and inevitably transformed the overall theatrical experience. In this work, we employ recreations of such masks and through controlled experiments, via measurements and simulations, we evaluate their impact on the acoustics of the most typical and famous of the ancient theatres, this one of Epidaurus. Emphasis is given on unraveling the character of the combined acoustics of the voice of masked actor and the response of such a theatre which is famous for its perfect acoustics for speech and drama plays.",

A running kurtosis approach is applied in order to define the RIR early/late reflections boundary. Then, the power spectrum of the late reverberant part of the measured RIR along with the excitation signal derived from the Linear Prediction (LP) analysis of the reverberant source are used to estimate the late reverberant power spectrum. A gain magnitude regularization step is also employed to compensate for overestimation errors and reduce musical noise artifacts. Objective and subjective performance measures show that a significant enhancement of the reverberant signals is achieved in all examined cases.",

However, the topic still remains open especially with respect to the contributions of the specific architectural elements to the theatre's excellent acoustic performance. Here, the study focuses on 3 novel aspects for a better understanding of the theater's acoustics:(a) introduces a wave-based acoustics simulation of the Epidaurus theatre based on a flexible but simplified 3D geometric model (b) matches temporal and spectral features of measured and modeled responses, The wave model considers direct, reflected, diffracted and mixed reflection-diffraction sound paths for calculating the theatre's acoustic Impulse Response (IR) in several listening positions, from the front rows of the lower tier to the last rows of the upper tier. For exact tuning of the model, such simulated IR discrete temporal features due to the calculated sound paths are examined through time-distance matching, allowing thus direct comparison to the theatre's measured IRs and further interpretation of the effects of each of the architectural features of the theatre. In order to precisely match the simulation to measurements, the acoustic behavior of reflecting and diffracting surfaces/edges is incorporated in the model through application of special filters, developed according to the spectral characteristics of the reflection and diffraction features of the measured IRs. From the study it is deduced that sound diffraction plays a major role in the theatre's acoustics, assisting signal reception especially at the distant positions.",

The room effect cannot be separated from the problem without making assumptions about the properties of the source signal. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods of distance estimation separately for different types of source signals. In this paper, we focus on speech signals. The proposed solution is to compute a number of statistical and source specific features from the speech signal and to use pattern recognition techniques to develop a robust distance estimator for speech signals. Experiments with a database of real speech recordings showed that the proposed model is capable of estimating source distance with acceptable performance for applications such as ambient telephony.",

Hence, blind or semi-blind dereverberation methods have been developed, utilising single or multiple input channels. Dereverberation is also important for binaural applications in the context of digital hearing aids, binaural telephony and hands free devices. However, the development of binaural dereverberation solutions is not trivial. Apart from the challenging task of reducing reverberation without introducing audible artifacts, binaural dereverberation should also at least preserve the interaural arrival-time and amplitude differences of the signals at the two ears, as these represent relevant cues for sound-source localization. In this chapter, an overview of auditory perception and physical features of reverberation is given. Further, a literature review of \u2026",

The goal of this method is to allow optimal utilization of such parameters in Neural Networks and other Machine Learning applications. For such applications, a compromise is required between training data size and information preservation. The complete set of subband binaural parameters is projected into characteristic two-dimensional profiles resulting to an easily scalable approach with extremely high data reduction ratio. The proposed method provides approximately 88% reduction in such binaural parameter data, while retaining the important cue components for accurate results. The method was tested for convergence performance of NNs trained using the proposed dimensionally-reduced vectors in comparison to traditional approaches based on unprocessed binaural cues. Results for estimating the DOA of signals in rooms, indicate a significant reduction in convergence time when the proposed method was utilized. The algorithm also presents linear time and space complexity, making it a prime candidate for use in real-time embedded systems employing binaural cues.",

Performance is shown to be independent of the signal gain and level, but depends on the reverberation time and the characteristics of the room. Overall, the system performs well especially for close distances and for rooms with low reverberation time and it appears to be robust to small distance mismatches.

Based on previous work by the authors, the maps unify results derived from an image localization classifier and the sweet spot area metric estimating the direction of arrival angles (DOA) of all potential image source positions reproduced by the system via a perceptual model. The statistical analysis of these maps indicates the skewness and kurtosis of the DOA classification error and hence the consistency and robustness of the image definition along the plane of listener positions. Results utilize such parameter mappings to objectively illustrate the robustness of this qualitative aspect of audio reproduction in rooms.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the robustness of room acoustics real-time equalization using inverse filters derived from the Complex Smoothing of the Transfer Function using perceptual criteria. The robustness of the method is assessed by real-time tests which compare the performance of Complex Smoothing-based equalization (for different filter lengths) with the traditional, ideal inverse filtering, over a range of room locations, which differ to the ones where response measurements were taken. Objective measurements and audio examples will show that the Complex Smoothing-based equalization performance, is largely immune to position changes and does not introduce processing artifacts, problems affecting the traditional ideal inversion.",

            "Abstract": "A novel and computationally efficient method for evaluating the response of a perforated absorption panel with an arbitrary number of Helmholtz resonator elements is proposed. The method is based on a simplified, parametric filter-based model using 2nd-order parametric IIR digital filters that emulate both the linear filtering response of each resonator and the relative acoustic path delays and gains of responses. This allows for the evaluation of the time-and frequency-domain response of arbitrary-sized perforated panels in any specific receiver position under free-field and diffuse-field acoustic environments. Unlike existing analytical approaches, the proposed approach offers significant computational efficiency and allows flexible and fast practical evaluation of the effects of such panel absorbers.",

            "Abstract": "This work examines statistical quantities (ie kurtosis, skewness) of room transfer functions and audio signals (anechoic, reverberant, speech, music). Measurements are taken under various reverberation conditions in different real enclosures ranging from small office to a large auditorium and for varying source-receiver positions. Here, the statistical properties of the room responses and signals are examined in the frequency domain. From these properties, the relationship between the spectral statistics of the room transfer function and the corresponding reverberant signal are derived.",

            "Abstract": "Room reverberation changes perception in a signal-dependent way. A reverberation masking index (RMI), which relates to room size and listening location, represents the way in which reverberation decay produces perceptual smearing and masking. These influences are time varying and signal dependent rather than a signal-independent description of room acoustics. Informal listening tests show a direct relationship between the RMI and subjective experience. The index also provides guidance for preprocessing the audio signal for a particular acoustic environment.",

These tests were aiming at verifying the accuracy of the modelling procedure, optimising its parameters, and investigating the various means for describing the 3-D sound field for acoustic analysis and auralization. The detailed computer simulation of the theatre and acoustic measurements were made for 5 identical listener/receiver positions, respectively. The measurements consisted of single-channel impulse responses, 8-channel microphone array responses and 2-channel binaural responses. From the analysis of the singlechannel response measurements and the simulation results, comparisons are drawn related to various acoustic parameters (RASTI, D-50, C-80, etc). The microphone array responses were processed to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "After fractional-octave smoothing of measured acoustic responses of various spaces, comparisons were undertaken with the original responses using well-established time and frequency domain criteria. It was found that after smoothing, the late reflection energy is largely suppressed, clarity is increased, spectral mean and deviation is lowered, especially at mid and high frequencies.",

            "Abstract": "The problem of distance estimation by computational methods utilizing binaural information is discussed. Initially, a brief overview is given concerning findings related to the auditory distance perception. Then, several acoustical parameters that depend on the distance between the source and the receiver especially within reverberant rooms are presented. An overview of several existing distance estimation techniques using binaural signals is given and a recent distance estimation method is presented in more detail. This method relies on several statistical features extracted from binaural signals and incorporates all the above features into a classification framework based on Gaussian Mixture models.",

            "Abstract": "The analog voltage-controlled filter used in historical music synthesizers by Moog is modeled using a digital system, which is then compared in terms of audio measurements with the original analog filter. The analog model is mainly borrowed from D'Angelo's previous work. The digital implementation of the filter incorporates a recently proposed antialiasing method. This method enhances the clarity of output signals in the case of large-level input signals, which cause harmonic distortion. The combination of these two ideas leads to a novel digital model, which represents the state of the art in virtual analog musical filters. It is shown that without the antialiasing, the output signals in the nonlinear regime may be contaminated by undesirable spectral components, which are the consequence of aliasing, but that the antialiasing technique suppresses these components sufficiently.

            "Abstract": "The spectral magnitude of Room Transfer Functions (RTFs) and signals (anechoic and reverberant) is analysed using statistical quantities, such as the standard deviation and the kurtosis. These measures are examined for RTFs recorded at di erent distances between source and receiver and their dependency on distance is modeled using polynomial expressions. Using such models, novel relationships are derived that can describe the dependence of the statistical properties of the reverberant signal on the RTF statistical properties. The models are then evaluated for di erent types of audio signals, estimating these two statistical measures for the anechoic signal directly from the reverberant signal and the results show that there was only a very small error on the predictions that depends on the Reverberation Time (RT) of the room. The proposed methodology can provide a promising framework for the blind estimation of any statistical parameter of the source speech/audio spectrum using only the reverberant signals.",

It is mainly used to minimize the effect of leakage and room acoustics on the received signal. In this work, the properties of the close-microphone response are investigated from a signal processing point of view, through the respective frequency domain statistical moments. Room impulse response measurements were made in various rooms and source-microphone distances and statistical moments were calculated over frequency and distance. It is shown that the statistical properties of the impulse responses remain relatively constant for short source-microphone distances and this in turn provides a consistent sound, which was validated through a subjective evaluation test.",

It is envisaged that the remaining components such as cables, amplifiers and transducers will soon be also implemented in digital form, potentially leading to networked, integrated and highly optimized solutions. The paper examines theoretical and implementation aspects related to each of the modules that could constitute such an all-digital audio/acoustic transducer, namely:(a) the digital wireless receiver, via the Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 protocols,(b) audio decoding and format adaptation (c) DSP for acoustic compensation, based on measured results for smoothed response equalization,(d) digital amplification, and,(e) all-digital transduction.",

Devices fabricated by appropriate materials utilise such a mechanism in order to achieve acoustic wave generation by direct application of an electrical audio signal and without the use of any moving components. A thermoacoustic transducer causes local vibration of air molecules resulting in a proportional pressure change. The present work studies an implementation of this alternative audio transduction technique for a prototype developed on silicon wafer. Measurements of the performance of this hybrid solid state device are presented and compared to the theoretical principles of its operation which are evaluated via simulations.",

However, real-time digital audio streaming over unreliable wireless IP networks, such as WLANs, may encounter significant playback quality degradation, due to the unpredictable and variable link quality that causes delayed audio delivery or even permanent loss of the transmitted packets. In this paper, we present a perceptually efficient error concealment technique which combined with playback synchronization correction schemes, and a high-rate wireless transmission protocol with Quality-of-Service (QoS) support that can significantly enhance the overall audio playback quality of typical multichannel home-theater wireless applications.",

Typical system identification methods require access to the original source signal which is seldom available in practice, while blind system identification methods require prior knowledge of the statistical properties of the source signal which for audio applications, are not available. In this work, a new system identification method is proposed using a close-microphone reference signal and it is shown that it accurately identifies real room impulse responses.",
