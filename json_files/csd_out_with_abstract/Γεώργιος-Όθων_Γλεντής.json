First, the multichannel embedding is adopted for the transformation of the discrete-time Volterra model to an equivalent multi-input single output format. Then, the LMS algorithm with delayed coefficients adaptation is applied, for the identification of the model parameters. The adaptation delay introduced in the computational flow of the adaptive scheme, allows for a pipelined implementation, however, the convergence and tracking properties of the algorithm are affected. Proper correction terms are subsequently introduced that compensate the adaptation delay and give results identical to the original LMS algorithm, subject to a latency delay.",

Recent work on data-adaptive approaches have shown that both the iterative adaptive approach (IAA) and the sparse learning via iterative minimization (SLIM) algorithm offer excellent performance with high-resolution and low side lobe levels for both complete and incomplete data sets. Regrettably, both algorithms are computationally intensive if applied directly to the phase history data to form the SAR images.

The LMS algorithm and its Transform Domain (TD-LMS) counterpart are considered for the adaptive processing task involved in the design of optimum GSC systems. Since all input signals are represented by complex variables, complex valued arithmetic is utilized for the realization of GSC algorithms, either on general purpose computers, or on dedicated VLSI ASICs. Using algorithmic strength reduction (SR) techniques, two novel algorithms are developed for efficient realizations of both LMS GSCs and TD-LMS GSC schemes.

Specifically, non-return to zero differential quaternary phase shift keying (NRZ-DQPSK) in deployed fiber plants, combined with high-performance, low-complexity electronic equalizers to compensate residual impairments at the receiver end, can be proved as a viable solution for high-performance, high-capacity optical links. Joint processing of the constructive and the destructive signals at the single-ended DQPSK receiver provides improved performance compared to the balanced configuration, however, at the expense of higher hardware requirements, a fact that may not be neglected especially in the case of high-speed optical links. To overcome this bottleneck, the use of partially joint constructive/destructive DQPSK equalization is investigated in this paper. Symbol-by-symbol equalization is performed by means of Volterra decision feedback-type equalizers, driven by a reduced subset of signals selected from the constructive and the destructive ports of the optical detectors. The proposed approach offers a low-complexity alternative for electronic equalization, without sacrificing much of the performance compared to the fully-deployed counterpart. The efficiency of the proposed equalizers is demonstrated by means of computer simulation in a typical optical transmission scenario. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, an FPGA implementation of a Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) Decision Feedback equalizer (DFE) is proposed, for the electronic compensation of the impairments in 40Gb/s Intensity Modulated Direct Detection (IM/DD) optical communication links employing NRZ DQPSK signaling. The proposed equalizer is used for the electronic compensation the residual Chromatic Dispersion (CD) along the installed optically compensated optical paths. The required processing rate is achieved by applying intensive pipelining and parallelism in the original architecture of the equalizer. At the given processing rate, a 8-input 2-output DFE involving three taps feedforward filtering and two taps backward filtering is implemented on a single, cutting edge technology, Xilinx FPGA device.",

            "Abstract": "In this work suitable architectures and high-throughput FPGA implementations of Volterra Decision Feedback Equalizers (VDFEs) for optical communication links are presented. Two VDFE configurations were selected based on the available resources of the employed FPGA devices, and two multiplexer-based architectures were developed for each of them in order to achieve the target throughput. The comparison of the experimental results with respect to different VDFE configurations, throughput, and FPGA devices points out the platform-specific design characteristics. The introduced architectures meet the desired 10Gb/s throughput, so it is demonstrated that the FPGA is a suitable platform for high-speed optical fiber communication systems.",
