We numerically calculated the guiding and thermal properties of the hybrid structure in terms of the effective index, single-mode operation, confinement loss, numerical aperture (NA), effective modal area (EMA) and fraction of power into the polymer-filled cladding for different relative hole sizes, d/\u039b (0.35-0.75) of the hybrid PCF whereas direct comparison with a conventional air-filled PCF is also shown. Further investigation of EMA, NA and fraction of power in the cladding with respect to thermal variations is also reported for a range of temperatures from 0\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C.",

The fiber laser uses a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) as the gain medium, while mode-locking is achieved by its gain modulation, via an external optical pulsed signal. We solved the model analytically developing a novel technique, where we have assumed double saturation of the SOA by both the mode-locked and the externally introduced pulsed signal. The study revealed the locus of the laser parameters to achieve mode-locking. In particular, it was found that SOA gain and energy of the externally introduced signal are two critical parameters that must simultaneously set properly for exact mode-locking. Another outcome of our analysis is that the study of the chirp parameter should be carried out keeping the nonlinear terms of the SOA gain.

Gain modulation is achieved by an externally introduced optical pulsed signal. This signal periodically saturates the amplifier gain and forces the ring laser to mode lock. Using this laser platform, we demonstrate picosecond pulsetrain generation at repetition rates up to 40 GHz, either in single or multiwavelength operation mode. In particular, using rational harmonic mode locking, 2.5-ps pulses were obtained up to a 40-GHz repetition rate, while output pulses and output power were constant over a 20-nm tuning range. In addition, a multiwavelength optical signal was obtained using the same laser platform with the addition of a Fabry-Pe/spl acute/rot filter for comb generation.

Synchronization of TCP flows appears when optical bursts with segments from different flows inside are dropped in the network causing flow congestion windows decreasing simultaneously. In this article, this imminent effect is studied with different assembly schemes and network scenarios. Different metrics are applied to quantitatively assess synchronization with classical assembly schemes. A new burst assembly scheme is proposed that statically or dynamically allocates flows to multiple assembly queues to control flow aggregation within the assembly cycle. The effectiveness of the scheme has been evaluated, showing a good improvement in optical link utilization.",

A solution to the RWA problem is proposed through a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach to search for the most suitable set of paths from many possible ones. We use GAs to solve this problem by introducing a new fitness function based on the mean value of occurrence of the common edges between the different genes of a single chromosome. In addition, we further improve performance and particularly execution times by considering the maximum quantity of edge disjoint paths (EDPs) to initialize the population with some indigo chromosomes. These EDPs are pre-computed and inserted in the GA-RWA problem. The proposed approach has been evaluated on the NSF network topology and compared with other similar schemes.",

In particular, ORION exploits the possible idle periods of established lightpaths to transmit packets destined to the next common node, or even directly to their common end-destination. Depending on whether all lightpaths are allowed to simultaneously carry and terminate overspill traffic or overspill is restricted to a sub-set of wavelengths, the architecture limits itself to constrained or un-constrained ORION. To evaluate both cases, we developed an extensive network simulator where the basic features of the ORION architecture were modeled, including suitable edge/core node switches \u2026",

For the first time, it is shown that such devices can provide enhanced intensity modulation reduction to return-to-zero (RZ) formatted input pulse trains, when the SOA is saturated with a strong continuous-wave (CW) input signal. A novel theoretical platform has been developed in the frequency domain, which reveals that the intensity modulation of the input pulse train can be suppressed by more than 10 dB at the output. This stems from the presence of the strong CW signal that transforms the sinusoidal transfer function of the interferometric switch into an almost flat, strongly nonlinear curve. This behavior has also been verified experimentally for both periodically and randomly degraded, in terms of intensity modulation, signals at 10 Gb/s using the ultrafast \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In many scientific and medical applications, such as laser         systems and microscopes, wavefront-sensor-less (WFSless) adaptive optics         (AO) systems are used to improve the laser beam quality or the image         resolution by correcting the wavefront aberration in the optical path. The         lack of direct wavefront measurement in WFSless AO systems imposes a         challenge to achieve efficient aberration correction. This paper presents an         aberration correction approach for WFSlss AO systems based on the model         of the WFSless AO system and a small number of intensity measurements,         where the model is identified from the input-output data of the WFSless         AO system by black-box identification. This approach is validated in an         experimental setup with 20 static aberrations having Kolmogorov spatial         distributions. By correcting N = 9 Zernike modes (N is the number of \u2026",

The change of the layer thickness of biomolecules can then be detected as a change in the coupling length between the two cores. We compare mPOF structures with 1, 2, and 3 air-holes between the solid cores and show that the sensitivity increases with increasing distance between the cores.

The output queuing buffer design requires less active devices (QD-SOA) when implementing large buffers, but the parallel buffer design becomes more profitable, when the number of wavelength channels that can be simultaneously processed by the wavelength selective switches (QD-SOAs) increases. This is because the number of active devices depends only on the buffer size.

An Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is proposed to solve the problem of attack-aware routing and wavelength assignment (Aa-RWA), jointly with the placement of OPM equipment, in order to minimize the impact of physical layer jamming attacks in optical networks.

For every output port, each agent-node maintains a simple data structure in the form of a table that records the utilization profile of that outgoing link.

In dynamic circuit switching (wavelength routing) networks, capacity is immediately hard-reserved upon the arrival of a setup message at a node, but it is used at least a round-trip time delay later. This waste of resources is significant in optical multi-gigabit networks and can be used to transmit traffic of a lower class of service in a non-competing way. The proposed hybrid OBS architecture, takes advantage of this idle time to transmit one-way optical bursts of a lower class of service, while high priority data explicitly requests and establishes end-to-end lightpaths. In the proposed scheme, the two control planes (two-way and one-way OBS reservation) are merged, in the sense that each SETUP message, used for the two-way lightpath establishment, is \u2026",

Currently, Grid computing using optical network infrastructure is dedicated to a small number of well known organizations with extremely large jobs (eg large data file transfers between known users or destinations [1]. Due to the static or semi-static nature of this type of Grids, long-lived wavelength paths between clients and Grid resources with centralized job management strategies are usually deployed (Lambda Grids). This type of Grid networking relies on carrier provision of optical network resources while the Grid users have no visibility of the lambda infrastructure. In other words, the Grid user is not able to setup paths over the optical Grid network.As Grid applications evolve, the need for user controlled network infrastructure is apparent in order to support emerging dynamic and interactive services. Examples of such applications may be high resolution home video editing, real-time rendering, highdefinition interactive TV, e-health and immersive interactive learning environments. These applications need infrastructures that makes vast amount of storage and computation resources potentially available to a large number of users.

The architecture uses  wavelength converters and fixed-length delay lines that are combined to form either a multiple-input buffer or a  shared buffer. Both architectures are modular, allowing the expansion of the buffer at a cost that grows  logarithmically with the buffer depth, where the cost is measured in terms of the number of switching elements, and  wavelength converters are employed. The architectural design also provides a tradeoff between the number of  wavelength converters and their tunability. The buffer architectures proposed are complemented with scheduling  algorithms that can guarantee lossless communication and are evaluated using physical-layer simulations to obtain  their performance in terms \u2026",

This feature allows bursts to reserve resources beyond their actual size to increase their successful forwarding probability and is used to provide QoS differentiation. The proposed signaling protocol offers a low blocking probability for bursts that can tolerate the round-trip delay required for the reservations.

SLIP-IN architecture takes advantages of the pre-transmission idle periods of optical lightpaths and slips into them packets or bursts of packets. In optical circuit switching (wavelength-routing) networks, capacity is immediately hard-reserved upon the arrival of a setup message, but is only used after a round-trip time delay. This idle period is significant for optical multi-gigabit networks and can be used to transmit traffic of a lower class of service. In this paper, we present the main features and dependencies of the proposed hybrid switching architecture, and further we perform a detailed evaluation by conducting network wide simulation experiments on the NSFnet backbone topology.

            "Abstract": "The present invention provides a method and an FSK/IM receiver to solve the problem of burst-mode detection of frequency modulated labels on an ASK (or IM) payload. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, two FSK tones of an input FSK/IM optical signal are separated and communicated to a balanced detector. At the balanced detector, the two FSK tones are subtracted from each other and result in an AC-coupled data stream. The AC-coupled data stream is communicated to a Schmitt-trigger where the hysteresis of the Schmitt-trigger finally eliminates any residual ASK (or IM) payload in the recovered output data. The present invention provides both single channel and WDM solutions.",

The circuits use the semiconductor-based ultrafast nonlinear interferometer (UNI) as the nonlinear switching element. We also present the integration of these circuits in a more complex unit that performs header and payload separation from short synchronous data packets at 10 Gb/s.

We have used classical analysis to obtain protocol and application traffic statistics. Our study revealed that TCP traffic is dominant in the network, while nearly 50% of the outgoing and 37% of the incoming traffic is peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic, with a further 25.6% of traffic using not registered ports and suspected to be P2P as well. Finally, we have also observed a remarkable traffic locality phenomenon in the P2P services, where more than the 90% of the traffic was heading or generated by 50 hosts",

This method fixes the average delay of the packets belonging to an assembled burst to a desired value T AVE that may be different for each forwarding equivalence class (FEC). We show that the proposed method significantly improves the delay jitter experienced by the packets during the burst assembly process, when compared to that of timer-based and burst length-based assembly policies. Minimizing packet delay jitter is important in a number of applications, such as real-audio and streaming-video applications. We also find that the improvement in the packet delay jitter yields a corresponding significant improvement in the performance of TCP, whose operation depends critically on the ability to obtain accurate estimates of the round-trip times (RTT).",

            "Abstract": "We present a multiwavelength ring laser source using an uncoated semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) for providing both gain as well as the comb-like filtering function in the cavity. A SOA-based ring laser source oscillates over a wide bandwidth range due to heterogeneous spectral broadening and the broad gain spectrum of the SOA. Multi-wavelength operation can be obtained by inserting comb-like filters inside the cavity. Fig. 1 (a) shows the relative simple experimental setup used. Gain was provided by a bulk, 500\u00b5m long, InGaAsP/InP ridge waveguide SOA (OptoSpeed, SA) with facets tilted at 10oand without AR-coatings. The reflectance of the uncoated facets was calculated to be about 0.3. A polarization controller was incorporated to adjust polarization state and an isolator to ensure unidirectional oscillation in the ring cavity. Output was obtained via a 50: 50 fused fiber coupler. The total length of the cavity was 11, 45m corresponding to a fundamental ring frequency of 16.9 MHz. The oscillating spectrum was defined by the Fabry-Perot modes of the uncoated SOA whose free spectral range was 65GHz. At the output of the ring laser a 1.5 mm SOA was used for amplification and a fiber Fabry-Perot for individual channel isolation and detection in an optical or electrical spectrum analyzer. Multi-wavelength operation is possible even by using the reflection coated SOA alone considered as a linear, 500 um long, cavity, providing lasing lines determined by the Fabry-Perot modes that experience the highest gain. However, due to gain compression caused by the extreme low cavity losses, its performance as a multiwavelength source is \u2026",

Switching with high-speed electronics requires optical-to-electronic (O/E) conversion of the data stream, making the switch a potential bottleneck of the network: any effort (including parallelization) for electronics to approach the optical speeds seems to be already reaching its practical limits. Furthermore, the store-and-forward approach of packet-switching does not seem suitable for all-optical implementation due to the lack of practical optical Random-Access-Memories to buffer and resolve contentions. Circuit switching on the other hand, involves a pre-transmission delay for call setup and requires the aggregation of microflows into circuits, sacrificing the granularity and the control over individual flows, and is inefficient for bursty traffic.

The scope of this paper is to explore the correlation, if any, between the impacts of the financial crisis and the penetration of broadband services as well as the coverage of broadband networks both of the fixed and mobile sectors. The analysis is mainly based on the examination of several quantitative indicators relevant to broadband penetration over the period of crisis. The findings of this paper strongly indicate that on one hand there is no correlation between the impacts of the crisis and the growth of fixed broadband services penetration and broadband fixed and mobile networks coverage. On the contrary it seems that the financial crisis slowed up the penetration of mobile broadband service penetration.",

In addition, large assembly times do not yield any throughput gain, despite the large number of segments per burst transmitted, but result in a low throughput variation, and thus a higher notion of fairness among the individual flows. To this end we propose a new burst assembly scheme that dynamically assigns flows to different assembly queues with different assembly timers, based on their instant window size.

The index guiding properties of the new PDMS-layer/Silica structures were investigated and optimized numerically using FDTD analysis. Films with thicknesses ranging from 100nm to 1\u03bcm were formed using different PDMS solution concentrations and different solution movement speeds. The thickness of films was very uniform along almost all the deposition length as indicated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images and micro- Raman mapping.",

            "Abstract": "A new hybrid signaling scheme is proposed in this work, that combines a two-way with an one-way reservation protocol. The key idea is to synchronize the assembly process with the reservation and hard reserve part of the end-to-end path in two way mode, for a duration equal to the burst assembly time. In this way, upon the arrival of the first packet in the assembly queue, the two-way reservation part of the signaling scheme may start simultaneously. Upon the completion of the burst assembly process, burst transmission may start immediately since the path has been successfully established for a certain number of hops. The framework that we propose benefits from the parallel execution of the signaling messages and the assembly process, and exploits the burstification delay to guarantee burst transmission for at least a part of the network path.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we study the burstification effect on the TCP synchronization and TCP congestion window mechanism. It is shown that short assembly times are optimal for flows with similar characteristics, while large assembly time provide a higher notion of fairness. In addition, this paper analyzes the synchronization of multiple TCP flows when aggregated together over the same optical bursts. It is shown that there is a strong TCP synchronization effect upon burst losses, in the sense that flows\u2019 windows increase/decrease simultaneously, resulting to a significant variation of outgoing traffic. These deficiencies may be dealt with employing a multi-queue burst assembly scheme with different timers and taking into account the TCP dynamics.",

            "Abstract": "Photonic crystal fibers are typically all-silica optical fibers in which a pattern of air-holes running along their entire length [1]. Such fibers allow for the introduction of polymers (and other active materials such as liquid crystals, high index fluids, etc.) into the air regions yielding hybrid polymer/silica waveguides that allow enhanced tunability of guiding properties due to the strong temperature dependence of the polymer refractive index [2, 3]. In this work, we present a solid-core endlessly single mode (ESM) PCF infiltrated with PDMS elastomer conserving index-guiding mechanism. PDMS (poly-dimethylsiloxane) is a polymeric widely used material in optoelectronics (particularly in opto/microfluidics) with refractive index lower than silica (around 1.41). Normally, the temperature dependence of the refractive index is described by the thermo-optic coefficient dn/dT (\u2212 4.5/C for PDMS-Sylgard 184), which quantifies the shift \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In future transparent optical networks, it is important to consider the impact of physical impairments in the routing and wavelengths assignment process, to achieve efficient connection provisioning. In this paper, we use classical multi-objective optimization (MOO) strategies and particularly genetic algorithms to jointly solve the impairment aware RWA (IA-RWA) problem. Fiber impairments are indirectly considered through the insertion of the path length and the number of common hops in the optimization process. It is shown that blocking is greatly improved, while the obtained solutions truly converge towards the Pareto front that constitutes the set of global optimum solutions. We have evaluated our findings, using an Q estimator tool, that calculates the signal quality of each path analytically.",

Recently, a hybrid PCF with poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer inclusions has been demonstrated [6]. PDMS is widely used in the area of photonics and optofluidics. It is highly transparent with a refractive index~ 1.41, conserving the total internal reflection guiding mechanism of the hybrid PCF. When PDMS is irradiated with UV light its refractive index increases [7]. In this paper we present the first example of a Bragg grating directly written using UV light on the PDMS inclusions of a conventional silica PCF.",

In the network layer, physical parameters aware algorithms are foreseen to pursue reliable network performance. In the physical layer, some new M&C methods were developed and rating of the state-of-the-art reported in literature is given. Optical monitoring implementation and viability is discussed.",
