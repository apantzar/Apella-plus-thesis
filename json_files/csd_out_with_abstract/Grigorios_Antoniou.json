The objective of the school was to provide an introduction into methods and issues of the Semantic Web, a major endeavor in current Web research, where the World Wide Web Consortium W3C plays an important role. The main idea of the Semantic Web is to enrich Web data with meta-data carrying a \u201cmeaning\u201d of the data and allowing Web-based systems to reason about data (and meta-data). The meta-data used in Semantic Web applications is usually linked to a conceptualization of the application domain shared by di? erent applications. Such a conceptualization is called an ontology and sp-i? es classes of objects and relations between them. Ontologies are de? ned by ontology languages, based on logic and supporting formal reasoning. Just as the current Web is inherently heterogeneous in data formats and data semantics, the Semantic Web will be inherently heterogeneous in its reasoning forms.-deed, any single form of reasoning turns out to be insu? cient in the Semantic Web.",

Despite suicide prevention strategies being applied, the rate of suicide has not changed substantially over the past decades. Advances in machine learning make it possible to attempt to predict suicide based on the analysis of relevant data to inform clinical practice. This paper reports on findings from the analysis of data of patients who died by suicide in the period 2013-2016 and made use of both structured data and free-text medical notes. We focus on examining various text-mining approaches to support risk assessment. The results show that using advance machine learning and text-mining techniques, it is possible to predict within a specified period which people are most at risk of taking their own life at the time of referral to a mental health service.",

In this work, we propose a semantic enrichment of the BT Hypercat Data Hub, using well-accepted Semantic Web standards and tools. We propose an ontology that captures the semantics of the imported data and present the BT SPARQL Endpoint by means of a mapping between SPARQL and SQL queries. Furthermore, federated SPARQL queries allow queries over multiple hub-based and external data sources. Finally, we provide two use cases in order to illustrate the advantages afforded by our semantic approach.",

Much work has been done for agents' interoperability; especially in the areas of ontology-based metadata and rule-based reasoning. Nevertheless, the SW proof layer has been neglected so far, although it is vital for agents and humans to understand how a result came about, in order to increase the trust in the interchanged information. This paper focuses on the implementation of third party SW reasoning and proofing services wrapped as agents in a multi-agent framework. This way, agents can exchange and justify their arguments without the need to conform to a common rule paradigm. Via external reasoning and proofing services, the receiving agent can grasp the semantics of the received rule set and check the validity of the inferred results.",

This system is intended to perform real-time activity recognition that could assist users in an Ambient Intelligent (AmI) environment. Ontologies can offer quite rich semantics that, to our knowledge, have not been utilized yet in a system that performs real-time activity recognition, mainly due to the time-cost of loading/querying ontologies. For the utilization of the information that ontologies offer (such as hierarchies), we introduce novel methods to record them in machine learning datasets. We also present ways that make real-time activity recognition viable, by keeping execution-time and memory requirements low. Post-processing of the suggested activities is also involved to make sure that the returned results will contain as few errors as possible. Results on the experiments that we held, in order to present the performance of our system, are also provided.",

Traditionally, logic programming has focused on complex knowledge structures/programs, so the question arises whether and how it can work in the face of Big Data. In this paper, we examine how stratified semantics of logic programming, equivalent to the well-founded semantics for stratified programs, can process huge amounts of data through mass parallelization. In particular, we propose and evaluate a parallel approach using the MapReduce framework. Our experimental results indicate that our approach is scalable and that stratified semantics of logic programming can be applied to billions of facts.",

Creating ontologies is simply the first step; ontologies, just like any structure holding knowledge, need to be updated as well. There are several reasons why an ontology should change: changes could be initiated because of a change in the world being modeled; the users needs may change, requiring a different conceptualization; knowledge previously unknown, classified or otherwise unavailable may become known; or a design flaw may have been noticed in the original conceptualization.In all these cases, the representation of our knowledge in the ontology should be modified so as to form a more accurate or adequate conceptualization of the domain. Such a modification presents several difficulties from both the practical and the theoretical point of view, as it is not always clear what the expected, or desired, result of any particular modification should be, nor how such a result can be determined.",

Fuzzy rule-based models are generally considered interpretable that are able to reflect the associations between medical conditions and associated symptoms, through the use of linguistic if-then statements. Systems built on top of fuzzy sets are of particular appealing to medical applications since they enable the tolerance of vague and imprecise concepts that are often embedded in medical entities such as symptom description and test results. They facilitate an approximate reasoning framework which mimics human reasoning and supports the linguistic delivery of medical expertise often expressed in statements such as \u2018weight low\u2019 or \u2018glucose level high\u2019 while describing \u2026",

Such reasoning is useful in many Semantic Web applications, like policies, business rules, brokering, bargaining and agent negotiations. Nevertheless, defeasible logic is based on solid mathematical formulations and is, thus, not fully comprehensible by end users, who often need graphical trace and explanation mechanisms for the derived conclusions. Directed graphs can assist in confronting this drawback. They are a powerful and flexible tool of information visualization, offering a convenient and comprehensible way of representing relationships between entities. Their applicability, however, is balanced by the fact that it is difficult to associate data of a variety of types with the nodes and the arcs in the graph.

A basic aspect of temporal information is duration of intervals, thus embedding duration relations into ontologies along with their semantics and reasoning rules is an important practical issue. This work proposes a new representation for intervals and their durations in ontologies by means of OWL properties and reasoning rules in SWRL embedded into the ontology.

There are several reasons for the significance of this work: (a) establishing links between formal systems leads to a better understanding and cross-fertilization, in particular our work sheds light on the argumentation-theoretic features of defeasible logic; (b) we provide the first ambiguity blocking Dung-like argumentation system; (c) defeasible reasoning may provide an efficient implementation platform for systems of argumentation; and (d \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The study of Ambient Intelligence environments and pervasive computing systems has introduced new research challenges in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. These are mainly caused by the imperfect nature of context and the special characteristics of the entities that possess and share the available context knowledge. In such environments, context may be unknown, ambiguous, imprecise or erroneous. Ambient agents are expected to have different goals, experiences and perceptive capabilities and use distinct vocabularies to describe their context. Due to the highly dynamic and open nature of the environment and the unreliable wireless communications that are restricted by the range of transmitters, ambient agents do not typically know a priori all other entities that are present at a specific time instance nor can they communicate directly with all of them. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a fully distributed approach for contextual reasoning in Ambient Intelligence environments, which combines the virtues of Multi-Context Systems and Defeasible Argumentation. The general approach consists of three models:(a) a representation model, which is a nonmonotonic extension of Multi-Context Systems; according to this, local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories (contexts), and information flow between agents is achieved through defeasible mapping rules that associate concepts used by different contexts;(b) an argument-based reasoning model, in which conflicts that arise from the interaction of mutually inconsistent contexts are captured through attacking arguments, and conflict resolution is \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Ontologies and automated reasoning are the building blocks of the Semantic Web initiative. Derivation rules can be included in an ontology to define derived concepts, based on base concepts. For example, rules allow to define the extension of a class or property, based on a complex relation between the extensions of the same or other classes and properties. On the other hand, the inclusion of negative information both in the form of negation-as-failure and explicit negative information is also needed to enable various forms of reasoning. In this paper, we extend RDF graphs with weak and strong negation, as well as derivation rules. The ERDF stable model semantics of the extended framework (Extended RDF) is defined, extending RDF (S) semantics. A distinctive feature of our theory, which is based on Partial Logic, is that both truth and falsity extensions of properties and classes are considered, allowing for truth value gaps. Our framework supports both closed-world and open-world reasoning through the explicit representation of the particular closed-world assumptions and the ERDF ontological categories of total properties and total classes.",

In this paper, we study how the well-founded semantics can be computed over huge amounts of data using mass parallelization.

This framework is useful for a formal definition of the reduction of one Knowledge Representation model to another.

Defeasible logic and its variants are an important family of defeasible reasoning methods. So far no relationship has been established between defeasible logic and mainstream nonmonotonic reasoning approaches.In this paper we will compare an ambiguity propagating defeasible logic with default logic. In fact the two logics take rather contrary approaches: defeasible logic takes a directly deductive approach, whereas default logic is based on alternative possible world views, called extensions. Computational complexity results suggest that default logics are more expressive than defeasible logics. This paper answers the opposite direction: an ambiguity propagating defeasible logic can be directly embedded into default logic.",

            "Abstract": "The study of ambient computing environments and pervasive computing systems has introduced new research challenges in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. The imperfect nature of context, the different viewpoints from which the ambient agents face the available context, and their heterogeneity with respect to the language and inference system that they use cannot be efficiently handled by the classical centralized reasoning approaches followed by most of the systems presented so far. The current paper proposes a distributed reasoning approach from the field of Multi-Context Systems (MCS) that handles these requirements by modeling ambient agents as peers in a P2P system, local context knowledge as local rule theories, and mapping rules through which an ambient agent imports context knowledge from other ambient agents as defeasible rules. To resolve potential inconsistencies that \u2026",

This work is motivated by the recent unparalleled explosion of available data coming from the Web, sensor readings, databases, ontologies and more. Such datasets could benefit from the introduction of rule sets encoding commonly accepted rules or facts, application or domain specific rules, commonsense knowledge etc. This raises the question of whether, how, and to what extent knowledge representation methods are capable of handling huge amounts of data for these applications. Our results indicate that our method shows good scalability properties and is able to handle a benchmark dataset of 1 billion triples, bringing it on par with state-of-the-art methods for monotonic reasoning on the semantic web.",

In this paper we describe these scenarios in more detail along with the implementation of the DR-DEVICE system, which is capable of reasoning about RDF data over multiple Web sources using defeasible logic rules. The system is implemented on top of CLIPS production rule system and builds upon R-DEVICE, an earlier deductive rule system over RDF data that also supports derived attribute and aggregate attribute rules.

Early diagnosis and treatment is of significant importance to patients for the acquisition of a better quality life and precaution against subsequent complications.

In particular, the proposed approach starts with the generation of a crisp rule base through a decision tree learning mechanism, which is data-driven and able to learn simple rule structures. The crisp rule base is then transformed into a fuzzy rule base, which forms the input to the powerful neuro-fuzzy framework of ANFIS, further optimising the parameters of both rule antecedents and consequents.

On the other hand, the inclusion of negative information both in the form of negation-as-failure and explicit negative information is also needed to enable various forms of reasoning. In this paper, we extend RDF graphs with weak and strong negation, as well as derivation rules.

This formalization is used to describe any knowledge representation model, including databases, logic-based schemes, semantic networks etc. It is also applied to introduce a general comparison method for KR-schemes and a formal definition of the reduction of one scheme to another. Using this model, we can reason about KR-schemes in an abstract manner and to determine whether a certain reduction is possible or not.",

Some of these errors, such as inferring rdfs: range on page 99, might be caused by problems of timing-at one time in the formalization of RDFS rdfs: range did allow such inferences; because of certain undesirable properties of the formalization at that time the meaning of rdfs: range was later changed to not admit such inferences.

Defeasible reasoning, a rule-based approach to reasoning with incomplete and conflicting information, is a powerful tool in many Semantic Web applications. Despite its strong mathematical background, logic, in general, and defeasible logic, in particular, may overload the user with tons of additional complex semantic relationships among data and metadata of the Semantic Web. To this end, a comprehensible, visual representation of these semantic relationships (rules) would help users understand them and make more use of them.

This can be the case when exact coordinates of spatial regions are not available, they are incomplete or unreliable. Topological spatial relations are the most important aspect of spatial representation and reasoning, thus embedding such relations into an ontology along with their semantics as expressed using reasoning rules is an important issue. In this work we propose a representation of RCC-5 topological relations using OWL object properties and axioms, combined with reasoning rules expressed using SWRL embedded into the ontology.",

Six event shape variables calculated using hadronic jets are studied in inclusive multi-jet events in 35 pb(-1) of integrated luminosity at a center-of-mass energy of root s = 7 TeV. These measurements are compared to predictions by three Monte Carlo event generators containing leading-logarithmic parton showers matched to leading order matrix elements for 2 -> 2 and 2 -> n (n = 2, ... , 6) scattering. Measurements of the third-jet resolution parameter, aplanarity, thrust, sphericity, and transverse sphericity are generally well described. The mean value of each event shape variable is evaluated as a function of the average momentum of the two leading jets p(T,1) and p(T,2), with a mean p(T) approaching 1 TeV.",

There are several reasons why an ontology should change: changes could be initiated because of a change in the world being modelled; the users\u2019 needs may change, requiring a different conceptualization; knowledge previously unknown, classified or otherwise unavailable may become known; or a design flaw may have been noticed in the original conceptualization.

Attempts have previously been made to address the problem of forgetting in relatively simple description logics (DLs) such as DL-Lite and extended . The ontologies used in these attempts were mostly restricted to TBoxes rather than general knowledge bases (KBs). However, the issue of forgetting for general KBs in more expressive description logics, such as  and OWL DL, is largely unexplored. In particular, the problem of characterizing and computing forgetting for such logics is still open.In this paper, we first define semantic forgetting about concepts and roles in  ontologies and state several important properties of forgetting in this setting. We then define the result of forgetting for concept descriptions in , state the properties of forgetting for concept \u2026",

This problem is usually referred to as the problem of belief change. The AGM approach, introduced in (Alchourron, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985), is the dominating paradigm in the area but it makes some non-elementary assumptions about the logic at hand which disallow its direct application in some classes of logics. In this paper, we drop all such assumptions and determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a logic to support AGM-compliant operators. Our approach is directly applicable to a much broader class of logics. We apply our results to establish connections between the problem of updating in Description Logics (DLs) and the AGM postulates. Finally, we investigate why belief base operators cannot satisfy the AGM postulates in standard logics.",

            "Abstract": "A Multi-Context System consists of a set of contexts and a set of inference rules (known as mapping or bridge rules) that enable information flow between different contexts. A context can be thought as a logical theory-a set of axioms and inference rules-that models local context knowledge. Different contexts are expected to use different languages and inference systems, and although each context may be locally consistent, global consistency cannot be required or guaranteed. Reasoning with multiple contexts requires performing two types of reasoning;(a) local reasoning, based on the individual context theories; and (b) distributed reasoning, which combines the consequences of local theories using the mappings. The most critical challenges of contextual reasoning are;(a) the heterogeneity of local context theories; and (b) the potential conflicts that may arise from the interaction of different contexts through the mappings. Our study mainly focuses on the second issue, by modeling the different contexts as peers in a P2P system, and performing some type of defeasible reasoning on the distributed peer theories.Two recent studies that deploy non-monotonic reasoning approaches in Multi-Context Systems are the nonmonotonic rule-based MCS framework, which supports default negation in the mapping rules, proposed in (Roelofsen and Serafini 2005), and the multi-context variant of Default Logic presented in (Brewka, Roelofsen, and Serafini 2007). The latter models the bridge relations between different contexts as default rules, and has the additional advantage that is closer to implementation due to the well-studied relation between Default \u2026",

The aim of the RuleML workshop series is to stimulate research on all issues related to web rule languages and to provide an annual forum for presenting and discussing new research results. The Semantic Web is a major world-wide endeavor to advance the Web by enriching its multimedia document content with propositional information that can be processed by inference-enabled Web applications. Rules and rule markup languages, such as RuleML, will play an important role in the success of the Semantic Web. Rules will act as a means to draw inferences, to express constraints, tospecifypoliciesforreactingtoevents, totransformdata, etc. Rule markup languages will allow us to enrich Web ontologies by adding de? nitions of derived concepts, to publish rules on the Web, to exchange rules between di? erent systems and tools, etc. RuleML 2003 built on the success of RuleML 2002, which was held in c-junction with ISWC 2002, Sardinia, Italy. The proceedings of RuleML 2002 can be found at http://www. ceur-ws. org/Vol-60/.

Our system produces automatically proof explanations using a popular logic programming system (XSB), by interpreting the output from the proof\u2019s trace and converting it into a meaningful representation. It also supports an XML representation for agent communication, which is a common scenario in the Semantic Web. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the system, a RuleML language extension for the representation of a proof explanation, and we give some examples of the system. The system in essence implements a proof layer for \u2026",

In this work, we propose a semantic enrichment of Hypercat, defining an RDF-based catalogue. We propose an ontology that captures the core of the Hypercat RDF specification and provides a mapping mechanism between existing JSON and proposed RDF properties. Finally, we propose a new type of search, called Semantic Search, which allows SPARQL-like queries on top of semantically enriched Hypercat catalogues and discuss how this semantic approach offers \u2026",

This paper extends previous results to address authorization issues in distributed environments. First, the authors present the formal high-level authorization language DEAL to specify access control policies in open and dynamic distributed systems. DEAL has rich expressive power by supporting negative authorization, rule priorities, hierarchical category authorization, and nonmonotonic reasoning. The authors then define the language semantics through Defeasible Logic.

In this paper, we propose a framework for modular ERDF ontologies, called modular ERDF framework, which enables collaborative reasoning over a set of ERDF ontologies, while support for hidden knowledge is also provided. In particular, the modular ERDF stable model semantics of modular ERDF ontologies is defined, extending the ERDF #n-stable model semantics.

Defeasible Logic is a simple but efficient nonmonotonic language which can handle both defeasibility and priority. In this paper we propose a novel approach to combining Defeasible Logic with Description Logics by introducing the Description Defeasible Logic (DDL). DDL is similar to Defeasible Logic but it also contains queries to the Description Logic knowledge base. DDL allows nonmonotonic reasoning to be built on top of ontologies, and to a certain degree, allows ontologies to be built on top of nonmonotonic reasoning. We give some basic properties of DDL, one of which shows that DDL is a tractable language provided that the underlying Description Logic is tractable.",

However, SQL, Prolog and RDF do not allow the representation of negative information, only OWL does so. RDF does not even include any negation concept. While SQL and Prolog only support reasoning with closed predicates based on negation-as-failure, OWL supports reasoning with open predicates based on classical negation, only. However, in many practical application contexts, one rather needs support for reasoning with both open and closed predicates. To support this claim, we show that the well-known Web vocabulary FOAF includes all three kinds of predicates ie closed, open and partial predicates. Therefore, reasoning with FOAF data, as a typical example of reasoning on the Web, requires a formalism that supports the distinction between open and closed predicates. We argue that ERDF, an extension of RDF, offers a solution to deal with this problem.",

In this context, addressing the evolution of RDF knowledge bases while respecting associated constraints is a challenging issue, yet to receive a full formal treatment. This problem has become more important with the emergence of Linked Open Data, which is based on RDF. Linked Open Data is becoming a key enabler as it is rapidly being taken up by governments and organizations to make their information available and usable, and is the basis of significant economic activity around an emerging\" data economy\".In this talk we describe a theoretical framework for dealing with both schema and data change requests, based on the notion a rational change operator as one that satisfies the belief revision principles of Success, Validity and Minimal Change. The semantics of such an operator is subject to customization, by tuning the properties that a rational change should adhere to. We prove some interesting theoretical results, as well as algorithmic solutions. We then show how the problem of ontology repair can be addressed with similar techniques.

According to this framework, each predicate defined in a rule base is characterized by its defining reasoning mode, scope, and exporting rule base list. Each predicate used in a rule base is characterized by its requesting reasoning mode and importing rule base list. For valid MWeb modular rule bases S, the MWebAS and MWebWFS semantics of each rule base s\u2208 S wrt S are defined, model-theoretically. These semantics extend the answer set semantics (AS) and the well-founded semantics with explicit negation (WFSX) onELPs, respectively, keeping all of their semantical and computational characteristics. Our framework supports:(i) local semantics and different points of view,(ii) local closed-world and open-world assumptions,(iii) scoped negation-as-failure,(iv) restricted propagation of local inconsistencies, and (v) monotonicity of reasoning, for \u201cfully shared\u201d predicates.",

The explicit representation of the semantics of data, accompanied with domain theories (ontologies), will enable a web that provides a qualitatively new level of service. It will weave together an incredibly large network of human knowledge and will complement it with machine processability. Various automated services will help the user to achieve goals by accessing and providing information in a machine-understandable form. This process may ultimately create extremely knowledgeable systems with various specialized reasoning services systems.

A solution to this problem is to choose from several logics and, when necessary, combine the representations. In general, such an approach results in a very difficult problem of combination. However, if we can choose the logics from a uniform framework then the problem of combining them is greatly simplified. In this paper, we develop such a framework for defeasible logics. It supports all defeasible logics that satisfy a strong negation principle. We use logic meta-programs as the basis for the framework.",

DDL is similar to Defeasible Logic but it also contains queries to the Description Logic knowledge base. DDL allows nonmonotonic reasoning to be built on top of ontologies, and to a certain degree, allows ontologies to be built on top of nonmonotonic reasoning. We give some basic properties of DDL, one of which shows that DDL is a tractable language provided that the underlying Description",

For example, the Linked Open Data initiative has been very successful in making ontologically annotated datasets available online, with a constantly evolving set of interconnected RDF graphs. While existing semantic tools and reasoning engines are getting better in dealing with time invariant ontological knowledge, supporting rapidly changing information has not until now attracted sufficient attention. However, with the deluge of dynamic data now being created\u2013from sensor data streams, to geospatial information and imagery, financial transactions, news feeds, 3D models, engineering data, information for policy intelligence\u2013the issues of evolving, maintaining, updating and managing data and knowledge on the Web over time are becoming critical. The ontologies as the basis of the Semantic Web need to be updated: changes could be initiated because of a change in the world being modelled; or by a change in the users\u2019 needs which would require a different conceptualization; or by the acquisition of knowledge previously unknown, unclassified or otherwise unavailable; or by the noticing of a design flaw in the original conceptualization. In all these cases, the representation of knowledge in the ontology should be modified so as to form a more accurate or adequate conceptualization of the domain.At the data level, semantic data on the Web, especially linked data, suffers from the same issues. Conceptual structures at the basis of the representation of the data need to be maintained, access methods to the data \u2026",

We have implemented ParQR using the Apache Spark framework, and evaluated our approach using both large scale synthetic datasets and real-world knowledge graphs.

The proposed mechanisms are defined by very simple modular program transformations, and integrate both open and closed world reasoning. These program transformations are shown to be appropriate for the two major semantics for extended logic programs: answer set semantics and wellfounded semantics with explicit negation.

Given the increasing amount of sensitive RDF data available on the Web, it becomes increasingly critical to guarantee secure access to this content. In this paper we advocate the use of an abstract access control model to ensure the selective exposure of RDF information. The model is defined by a set of abstract operators and tokens. Tokens are used to label RDF triples with access information. Abstract operators model RDF Schema inference rules and propagation of labels along the RDF Schema (RDFS) class and property hierarchies. In this way, the access label of a triple is a complex expression that involves the labels of the triples and the operators applied to obtain said label.

            "Abstract": "RDF/S ontologies are often used in e-science to express domain knowledge regarding the respective field of investigation (eg, cultural informatics, bioinformatics etc). Such ontologies need to change often to reflect the latest scientific understanding on the domain at hand, and are usually associated with constraints expressed using various declarative formalisms to express domain-specific requirements, such as cardinality or acyclicity constraints. Addressing the evolution of ontologies in the presence of ontological constraints imposes extra difficulties, because it forces us to respect the associated constraints during evolution. While these issues were addressed in previous work, this is the first work to examine how ASP techniques can be applied to model and implement the evolution process. ASP was chosen for its advantages in terms of a principled, rather than ad hoc implementation, its modularity and flexibility, and for being a state-of-the-art technique to tackle hard combinatorial problems. In particular, our approach consists in providing a general translation of the problem into ASP, thereby reducing it to an instance of an ASP program that can be solved by an ASP solver. Our experiments are promising, even for large ontologies, and also show that the scalability of the approach depends on the morphology of the input.",

Our results show that the former has a strictly stronger expressive power. The difference is caused by the latter logic's failure to capture the idea of teams of rules supporting a specific conclusion.",

It may be used to express derivation rules for enriching web ontologies by adding definitions of derived concepts or for defining data access permissions; to describe and publish the reactive behaviour of a system in the form of reaction rules; and to provide a complete XML-based specification of a software agent. Further uses may arise in novel web applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of how to design a general web rule language that can be used for these and for future emerging purposes. Given the great diversity of rule concepts and existing rule languages, such a language will consist of several overlapping sublanguages that share a common metamodel. The development of this rule metamodel is a difficult conceptualisation and integration problem.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years interactive visualization of 3D data has become important and widespread due to the requirements of several application areas. However, current user interfaces often lack adequate support for 3D interactions: 2D desktop systems are often limited in cases where natural interaction with 3D content is required, and 3D user interfaces consisting of stereoscopic projections and tracked input devices are rarely adopted by ordinary users. Touch interaction has received considerable attention for 2D interfaces, and more recently for 3D interfaces. Many touch devices now support multiple degrees of freedom input by capturing multiple 2D contact positions on the surface as well as varying levels of pressure and even depth. There is great potential for multi-touch interfaces to provide the traditionally difficult to achieve combination of natural 3D interaction without any instrumentation. When combined with a stereoscopic display as well as depth cameras, we believe that multi-touch technology can form the basis for a next generation of 3D user interfaces. Several research groups have begun to explore the potential, limitations, and challenges of this and other 3D touch environments, and first commercial systems are already available.The goal of the seminar \u201cTouching the 3rd Dimension (T3D)\u201d is to address the research and industrial challenges involved in exploring the space where the flat digital world of surface computing meets the physical, spatially complex, 3D space in which we live.

Such datasets could benefit from the introduction of rule sets encoding commonly accepted rules or facts, application- or domain-specific rules, commonsense knowledge etc. This raises the question of whether, how, and to what extent knowledge representation methods are capable of handling huge amounts of data for these applications. In this paper, we consider inconsistency-tolerant reasoning in the form of defeasible logic, and analyze how parallelization, using the MapReduce framework, can be used to reason with defeasible rules over huge datasets. We extend previous work by dealing with predicates of arbitrary arity, under the assumption of stratification. Moving from unary to multi-arity predicates is a decisive step towards practical applications, e.g. reasoning with linked open (RDF) data. Our experimental results demonstrate that defeasible reasoning with millions of data is performant, and has the potential to scale to billions of facts.",

Reasoning in MCS introduces many challenges that arise from the heterogeneity of contexts with respect to the language and inference system that they use, and from the potential conflicts that may arise from the interaction of context theories through the mappings. This study proposes a P2P reasoning model for MCS, which represents contexts as peer theories in a P2P system, mapping rules as defeasible rules (rules that can be defeated in the existence of adequate contrary evidence), and uses a preference relation (which, eg, expresses trust information) to resolve the potential conflicts. It also provides a reasoning algorithm for query evaluation, analyzes its formal properties, and discusses alternative methods for conflict resolution, which differ in the type of information that they use to resolve the conflicts.",

One significant step is to support the integration and enrichment of a broad variety of data, often using state of the art linked data approaches. Among the many advantages of such enrichment is that this may enable the use of intelligent processes to autonomously manage urban facilities such as traffic signal controls.In this paper we document an attempt to integrate sets of sensor and historical data using a data hub and a set of ontologies for the data. We argue that access to such high level integrated data sources leads to the enhancement of the capabilities of an urban transport operator. We demonstrate this by documenting the development of a planning agent which uses such data as inputs in the form of logic statements, and when given traffic goals to achieve \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Ambient Intelligence environments consist of various devices that collect, process, change and share the available context information. The imperfect nature of context, the open and dynamic nature of ambient environments, and the special characteristics of the involved devices have introduced new research challenges in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, which have not yet been successfully addressed by current Ambient Intelligence systems.This thesis proposes a solution based on the Multi-Context Systems paradigm, in which local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories (contexts), and information ow between agents is achieved through mapping rules that associate concepts used by different contexts. To handle imperfect context, we extend Multi-Context Systems with non-monotonic features, such as local defeasible theories, defeasible mapping rules, and a preference ordering over the system contexts. On top of this model, we have developed an argumentation framework that exploits context and preference information to resolve potential con icts caused by the interaction of ambient agents through their mappings. We also provide an operational model in the form of a distributed algorithm for query evaluation, which is sound and complete with respect to the argumentation framework, as well as three alternative versions of the algorithm, each of which implements a different strategy for con ict resolution. The four strategies, which mainly differ in the type and extent of context and preference information that is used to resolve potential con icts, have been evaluated in a simulated peer-to-peer system and \u2026",

Such reasoning is useful for many applications in the Semantic Web, such as policies and business rules, agent brokering and negotiation, ontology and knowledge merging, etc. However, the syntax of defeasible logic may appear too complex for many users. In this paper we present a graphical authoring tool for defeasible logic rules that acts as a shell for the DR-DEVICE defeasible reasoning system over RDF metadata. The tool helps users to develop a rule base using the OO-RuleML syntax of DR-DEVICE rules, by constraining the allowed vocabulary through analysis of the input RDF namespaces, so that the user does not have to type-in class and property names. Rule visualization follows the tree model of RuleML. The DR-DEVICE reasoning system is implemented on top of the CLIPS \u2026",

The system, DR-DEVICE, is capable of reasoning about RDF metadata over multiple Web sources using defeasible logic rules. It is implemented on top of CLIPS production rule system and builds upon R-DEVICE, an earlier deductive rule system over RDF metadata that also supports derived attribute and aggregate attribute rules.

In this paper, we examine the postulate of relevance which has been proposed in the belief revision literature as a more intuitive alternative to the AGM postulate of recovery. Even though relevance and recovery have been proven to be equivalent in the presence of the other AGM postulates in classical logics, we show that this is not true for nonclassical ones. Based on this fact, we are able to show that the relevance postulate is a very attractive alternative to recovery for ontology evolution, as it can be used to define contraction operators in all interesting ontology representation languages.",

In particular, this paper presents the semantics of Rule Interchange Format (RIF) of multi-documents, analyses it and some deficiencies are elicited.

The approach is based on the translation of SPARQL into relational queries over annotated relations with values of the most general m-semiring, and in this way also refuting a claim in the literature that the OPTIONAL construct of SPARQL cannot be captured appropriately with the known abstract models.",

In particular, we give a translation of a defeasible theory D into a program P(D). We show that under a condition of decisiveness, the defeasible consequences of D correspond exactly to the sceptical conclusions of P(D) under the stable model semantics. Without decisiveness, the result holds only in one direction (all defeasible consequences of D are included in all stable models of P(D)). If we wish a complete embedding for the \u2026",

Such reasoning is useful for many applications in the Semantic Web. However, the RuleML syntax of defeasible logic may appear too complex for many users. Furthermore, the interplay between various technologies and languages, such as defeasible reasoning, RuleML, and RDF impose a demand for using multiple, diverse tools for building rule-based applications for the Semantic Web. In this paper we present VDR-Device, a visual integrated development environment for developing and using defeasible logic rule bases on top of RDF ontologies.

This paper presents a knowledge representation model based on the Multi-Context Systems paradigm, which represents ambient agents as autonomous logic-based entities that exchange context information through mappings, and uses preference information to express their confidence in the imported knowledge.

            "Abstract": "We are witnessing an explosion of available data from the Web, government authorities, scientific databases, sensors and more. Such datasets could benefit from the introduction of rule sets encoding commonly accepted rules or facts, application-or domain-specific rules, commonsense knowledge etc. This raises the question of whether, how, and to what extent knowledge representation methods are capable of handling the vast amounts of data for these applications. In this paper, we consider nonmonotonic reasoning, which has traditionally focused on rich knowledge structures. In particular, we consider defeasible logic, and analyze how parallelization, using the MapReduce framework, can be used to reason with defeasible rules over huge data sets. Our experimental results demonstrate that defeasible reasoning with billions of data is performant, and has the potential to scale to trillions of facts.",

The AGM theory, introduced in [1], is the dominating paradigm in the area of belief change. Unfortunately, the assumptions made by the authors of [1] in the formulation of their theory restrict its use to a specific class of logics. In this report, we investigate the possibility of extending their framework in a wider class of formalisms by examining the applicability of the AGM postulates in logics originally excluded from the AGM model. We conclude that in the wider class that we consider there are logics which do not admit AGM-compliant operators. As a case study, we investigate the applicability of the AGM theory to Description Logics (DLs). Furthermore, we use our results to shed light on our inability to develop AGM-compliant operators for belief bases.",

Traditionally, defeasible reasoning has focused on complex knowledge structures over small to medium amounts of data, but recent research efforts have attempted to parallelize the reasoning process over theories with large numbers of facts. Such work has shown that traditional defeasible logics come with overheads that limit scalability. In this work, we design a new logic for defeasible reasoning, thus ensuring scalability by design. We establish several properties of the logic, including its relation to existing defeasible logics.

For this purpose, we advocate the use of natural language expressions, such as \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cafter\u201d, for temporal entities whose exact durations or starting and ending points in time are unknown. Reasoning over all types of temporal information (such as the above) is also an important research problem.

In belief change, a well known approach for defining contraction is via epistemic entrenchments which are preference orderings over formulas. The approach however is not applicable in DL-LiteR as classic belief change assumes an underlying logic that is different from DL-LiteR. Thus we reformulate the epistemic entrenchment approach to make it applicable to DL-LiteR. We then provide instantiation for the reformulated approach.",

Attempts have previously been made to address the problem of forgetting in relatively simple description logics (DLs), such as DL\u2010Lite and extended . However, the issue of forgetting for ontologies in more expressive DLs, such as  and OWL DL, is largely unexplored. In particular, the problem of characterizing and computing forgetting for such logics is still open. In this paper, we first define semantic forgetting about concepts and roles in  ontologies and state several important properties of forgetting in this setting. We then define the result of forgetting for concept descriptions in , state the properties of forgetting for concept descriptions, and present algorithms for computing the result of forgetting for concept descriptions.

            "Abstract": "Models, and modeling languages, are a particularly important means of investigating analysis and design problems. For analyzing and designing the rules of a rule-based Web application we need a rule modeling language based on a general language for information modeling. In addition, business/domain models are used in the communication between business/domain analysts and business/domain experts for analyzing and documenting system requirements. Consequently, the modeling language used must not be'technical', but should allow (semi-) visual and/or natural-language-like rule expressions, which can be understood by business/domain experts without extensive technical training. The design of a Web rule language, however, is a meta-modeling problem.Rules can be visualized in many ways. Different types of rules require different graphical expressions. In addition, there are several purposes of rule visualizations. For instance:\u2022 expressing the syntactical structure of rules\u2022 expressing dependencies between rules and their constituents\u2022 including rules in model diagrams\u2022 supporting testing and debugging of rules",

Our work is motivated by the recent unparalleled explosion of available data coming from the Web, sensor readings, databases, ontologies and more. Such datasets could benefit from the introduction of rule sets encoding commonly accepted rules or facts, application-or domain-specific rules, commonsense knowledge etc. This raises the question of whether, how, and to what extent knowledge representation methods are capable of handling huge amounts of data for these applications. We present a scalable MapReduce-based method for reasoning using defeasible stratified logics. Our results indicate that our method shows good scalability properties and is able to handle a benchmark dataset of 1 billion triples, bringing it on par with state-of-the-art methods for monotonic logics.",

In this large and uncoordinated environment, reasoning can be used to check the consistency of the data and of associated ontologies, or to infer logical consequences which, in turn, can be used to obtain new insights from the data. However, reasoning approaches need to be scalable in order to enable reasoning over the entire Web of Data.

The current paper proposes four alternative strategies for using context and preference information to resolve conflicts in a Multi-Context Framework, in which contexts are modeled as rule theories, mappings as defeasible rules, and global inconsistency is handled using methods of distributed defeasible reasoning.",

The case of positive programs/relational algebra is well-understood but handling negation (or set difference in relational algebra) has not been addressed in its full generality or has deficiencies. The approach defined in this work provides full provenance information for logic programs under the least model, well-founded semantics and answer set semantics, and is related to the major existing notions of justifications for all these logic programming semantics.",

In the tradition of mathematical logic, there is a general preference to consider positive information as basic and treat negative information as derived. This has also been the approach in relational databases, in normal logic programs, and is now again the approach in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) that has recently been proposed as a general language for representing propositional information on the Web by the World Wide Web Committee (W3C). However, as we argue in this article, any practical knowledge representation formalism, especially for the Web, has to be able to deal with knowledge items involving partial predicates for which negative information is as informative as positive information, and which may have truth-value gaps and truth-value clashes. This kind of knowledge is best represented and processed with the help of the two negations of partial logic, one expressing explicit falsity and the other one expressing non-truth.",

Even if a number of specialised qualitative reasoning tools have been developed so far, an important barrier to the wider adoption of these tools is that only qualitative reasoning is supported natively, when real-world problems most often require a combination of qualitative and other forms of reasoning. In this work, we propose to overcome this barrier by using ASP as a unifying formalism to tackle problems that require qualitative reasoning in addition to non-qualitative reasoning.

Conventional implementations on this condition, such as one based on hash redistribution, often incur significant network communication, while the duplication-based approaches are complex and inefficient.

In particular, we give a translation of a defeasible theory D into a program P(D). We show that under a condition of decisiveness, the defeasible consequences of D correspond exactly to the sceptical conclusions of P(D) under the answer set semantics. Without decisiveness, the result holds only in one direction (all defeasible consequences of D are included in all answer sets of P(D)). If we wish a complete embedding for the \u2026",

In this work, we develop a rule-based recognition system for hierarchically-organized activities that returns only logically consistent scenarios. This is achieved by explicitly formulating conflicts as Weighted Partial MaxSAT clauses to be satisfied. The system also has the ability to adjust the desired level of detail of the scenarios returned. This is accomplished by assigning preferences to clauses of the SAT problem.

            "Abstract": "Time, as a phenomenon, has been in the focus of scientific thought from ancient times. It continues to be an important subject of research in many disciplines due to its importance as a basic aspect for understanding and formally representing change. The goal of this analytical review is to find out if the formal representations of time developed to date suffice to the needs of the basic and applied research in Computer Science, and in particular within the Artificial Intelligence and Semantic Web communities. To analyze if the existing basic theories, models, and implemented ontologies of time cower these needs well, the set of the features of time has been extracted and appropriately structured using the paper collection of the TIME Symposia series as the document corpus. This feature set further helped to structure the comparative review and analysis of the most prominent temporal theories. As a result, the selection of the subset of the features of time (the requirements for a Synthetic Theory) has been made reflecting the TIME community sentiment. Further, the temporal logics, representation languages, and ontologies available to date, have been reviewed regarding their usability aspects and the coverage of the selected temporal features. The results reveal that the reviewed ontologies of time taken together do not satisfactorily cover some important features:(i) density;(ii) relaxed linearity;(iii) scale factors;(iv) proper and periodic subintervals;(v) temporal measures and clocks. It has been concluded that a cross-disciplinary effort is required to address the features not covered by the existing ontologies of time, and also harmonize the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Defeasible reasoning is a rule4based approach for efficient reasoning with incomplete and inconsistent information. Such reasoning is, among others, useful for ontology integration, where conflicting information arises naturally; and for the modeling of business rules and policies, where rules with exceptions are often used. In this demonstration we pre4 sent a prototype system for defeasible reasoning on the Web. The system is called DR4DEVICE [4] and is capable of reasoning about RDF metadata over multiple Web sources using defeasible logic [1] rules. The system is implemented on top of CLIPS production rule system and builds upon R4DEVICE [5], an earlier deductive rule system over RDF metadata that also supports derived attribute and aggregate attribute rules. Rules can be expressed either in a native CLIPS4like language, or in an extension of the OO4RuleML [9] syntax. The operational semantics of defeasible logic are implemented through compilation into the generic rule language of R4DEVICE. This demonstration includes a complete use case of a semantic web broker that reasons about apartment renting. The most important features of DR4DEVICE are the following:\u2022 Support for multiple rule types of defeasible logic, such as strict rules, defeasible rules, and defeaters.\u2022 Support for both classical (strong) negation and negation-as-failure.\u2022 Support for conflicting literals, ie derived objects that exclude each other.\u2022 Direct import from the Web of RDF ontologies and data as input facts to the defeasible logic program.\u2022 Direct import from the Web of defeasible logic programs in an XML compliant rule syntax (RuleML).\u2022 Direct export to \u2026",

In previous work, we proposed a non-monotonic extension to MCS and an argument-based reasoning model that enable handling cases of imperfect context information based on defeasible reasoning. To deal with ambiguities that may arise from the interaction of context theories through mappings, we used a preference relation, which is represented as a total ordering on the system contexts. Here, we extend this approach to additionally deal with incomplete preference information. To enable this, we replace total preference ordering with partial ordering, and modify \u2026",

Its use in various application domains has been advocated, including modelling of contracts (Grosof 2004),(Governatori 2005), legal reasoning (Governatori, Rotolo, & Sartor 2005), agent negotiations (Governatori et al. 2001), modelling of agents and agent societies (Governatori & Rotolo 2004). Nonmonotonic rule systems are expected to play an important role in the layered development of the Semantic Web. Defeasible reasoning systems that are used on applications to the Semantic Web have already been implemented (Antoniou & Bikakis 2007). Semantic Web community has performed extensive research in the area of policies. It is a concept that encompasses many different notions and one of them are the business rules. In the current work, we develop a nonmonotonic rulebased system that can reason in Semantic Web applications associated with policies and business rules. It is based on an extension of defeasible logic with \u2026",

However, in order for the full potential of the Semantic Web to be achieved, the ability of reasoning over the available information is also essential. Rules can assist in this affair and various logics have been proposed for the Semantic Web domain. One of them is defeasible reasoning that deals with incomplete and conflicting information. However, despite its solid mathematical notation, it may be confusing to end users. To confront this downside, we proposed a representation schema for defeasible logic rule bases, which is based on directed graphs that feature distinct node and connection types. This paper presents DR-VisMo, a defeasible logic rule base editor and visualization system that implements this representation approach. The system also features a stratification algorithm for visualizing rule bases that \u2026",

Relevant key questions cutting across all of these themes were:(i) how can existing DB and IR solutions be adapted to manage semantic data; and (ii) are there new challenges that arise for the DB and IR communities (ie are radically new techniques required)? The outcome was a deeper, more integrated understanding of the current state of the art on semantic data management and a the identification of a set of open challenges that will inform the three communities in this intersection.",

The system is called DR-DEVICE and is capable of reasoning about RDF metadata over multiple Web sources using defeasible logic rules. The system is implemented on top of CLIPS production rule system and builds upon R-DEVICE, an earlier deductive rule system over RDF metadata that also supports derived attribute and aggregate attribute rules.

At present, the highest layer that has reached sufficient maturity is the ontology layer in the form of the description logic based languages, DAML+ OIL and OWL. The next step in the development of the Semantic Web will be the logic and proof layers. Rule systems can play a twofold role in the Semantic Web initiative:(a) they can serve as extensions of, or alternatives to, description logic based ontology languages; and (b) they can be used to develop declarative systems on top (using) ontologies. Defeasible reasoning is a simple rule-based approach to reasoning with incomplete and inconsistent information. It can represent facts, rules, and priorities among rules. Its main advantage is the combination of enhanced representational capabilities allowing one to reason with incomplete and contradictory information, coupled with low computational complexity compared to mainstream nonmonotonic reasoning.In this paper we report on the implementation of a defeasible reasoning system for reasoning on the Web. Its main characteristics are the following:(a) It is compatible with RuleML (details in full paper1);(b) It is based on Prolog. The core of the system consists of a well-studied translation [Antoniou et. al., 2001] of defeasible knowledge into logic programs under Well-Founded Semantics [van Gelder et al., 1991];(c) The main focus is on flexibility. Strict and defeasible rules and priorities are part of the interface and the implementation. Also, a number of variants are implemented (ambiguity blocking/propagation, conflicting \u2026",

The first international NMR workshop was held at Mohonk Mountain House, New Paltz, New York in June, 1984, and was organized by Ray Reiter and Bonnie Webber. In the last 10 years the area of nonmonotonic reasoning has seen a number of important developments. Significant theoretical advances were made in the understanding of general abstract principles underlying nonmonotonicity. Key results on the expressibility and computational complexity of nonmonotonic logics were established. The role of nonmonotonic reasoning in belief revision, abduction, reasoning about action, planing and uncertainty was further clarified. Several successful NMR systems were built and used in applications such as planning, scheduling, logic programming and constraint satisfaction. The papers in the proceedings reflect these recent advances in the field. They are grouped into sections corresponding to special sessions as they were held at the workshop: 1. General NMR track 2. Abductive reasonig 3. Belief revision: theory and practice 4. Representing action and planning 5. Systems descriptions and demonstrations 6. Uncertainty frameworks in NMR",

We define the notion of a rational change operator as one that satisfies the belief revision principles of Success, Validity and Minimal Change. The semantics of such an operator are subject to customization, by tuning the properties that a rational change should adhere to. We prove some interesting theoretical results and propose a general-purpose algorithm for implementing rational change operators in knowledge bases with integrity constraints, which allows us to handle uniformly any possible change request in a provably rational and consistent \u2026",

In this work, we propose two versions of a trajectory calculus based on the allowed properties over trajectories, where trajectories are defined as a sequence of non-overlapping regions of a partitioned map. More specifically, if a given trajectory is allowed to start and finish at the same region, 6 base relations are defined (TC-6). If a given trajectory should have different start and finish regions but cycles are allowed within, 10 base relations are defined (TC-10). Both versions of the calculus are implemented as ASP programs; we propose several different encodings \u2026",

Defeasible reasoning is a useful tool towards the development of the logic layer of the semantic Web architecture. However, having a solid mathematical notation, it may be confusing to end users, who often need graphical trace and explanation mechanisms for the derived conclusions. In a previous work of ours, we outlined a methodology for representing defeasible logic rules, utilizing directed graphs that feature distinct node and connection types. However, visualizing a defeasible logic rule base also involves the placement of the multiple graph elements in an intuitive way, a non-trivial task that aims at improving user comprehensibility. This paper presents a stratification algorithm for visualizing defeasible logic rule bases that query and reason about RDF data as well as a tool that applies this algorithm.",

This process consists of the determination of the allowed change operations, the identification of the inconsistencies that could be caused by each such operation as well as the various alternatives to deal with each such inconsistency, and, finally, some (manual or automatic) selection mechanism that allows the determination of the \u201cbest\u201d of these alternatives. Unfortunately, most ontology evolution algorithms implement these steps using a case-based, ad-hoc methodology, which is cumbersome and error-prone. In this paper we propose a general framework for ontology change management that generalizes the methodology employed by existing tools. The introduction of this framework allows us to devise a whole class of ontology evolution algorithms, which, due to their formal underpinnings, avoid many of the problems exhibited by ad-hoc frameworks. We exploit this framework by implementing a specific ontology evolution algorithm for RDF ontologies.",

This way, one could exploit more than 20 years of research regarding the \u201crationality\u201d of belief change operators, since the concept of rationality is independent of the underlying knowledge representation scheme used. We follow this path by applying a generalized version of the AGM theory of contraction [1, 2] to DLs; the contribution of our current work is the determination of the applicability of the approach in several DLs.

In this work we discuss defeasible logic, a less-expressive but more efficient non-monotonic logic. We report on two new implemented systems for defeasible logic: a query answering system employing a backward-chaining approach, and a forward-chaining implementation that computes all conclusions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the systems can deal with large theories (up to hundreds of thousands of rules). We show that defeasible logic has linear complexity, which contrasts markedly with most other non-monotonic logics and helps to explain the impressive experimental results.

Additional endpoints included virologic failure, discontinuation due to virologic failure, discontinuation for other reasons, and virologic suppression. We studied 222 patients treated with darunavir/ritonavir and 1791 patients treated with atazanavir/ritonavir. Following multivariable adjustment, there was no difference between darunavir/ritonavir and atazanavir-ritonavir in the risk of regimen failure (adjusted hazard ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.03) Darunavir/ritonavir-treated patients were at lower risk of virologic failure relative to atazanavir/ritonavir treated patients (aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.91), findings driven largely by high rates of virologic failure among atazanavir/ritonavir-treated patients in the province of British Columbia.

            "Abstract": "Representation and reasoning over legal rules is an important application domain and a number of related approaches have been developed. In this work, we investigate legal reasoning in practice based on three use cases of increasing complexity. We consider three representation and reasoning approaches:(a) Answer Set Programming,(b) Argumentation and (c) Defeasible Logic. Representation and reasoning approaches are evaluated with respect to semantics, expressiveness, efficiency, complexity and support.",

            "Abstract": "In order to extend the limited expressiveness of RDF Schema, a more expressive Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In this chapter we analyse the limitations of RDF Schema and derive requirements for a richer Web Ontology Language. We then describe the three-layered architecture of the OWL language, and we describe all of the language constructs of OWL in some detail. The chapter concludes with two extensive examples of OWL ontologies.",
