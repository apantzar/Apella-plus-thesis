            "Abstract": "We live in an increasingly interconnected world, one in which a growing number of people turn to the web to make important medical, financial and political decisions [1]. As more people use the Web\u2019s search engines daily as their primary source for locating information on many important issues, search engines are in the position to influence what is perceived as relevant information through their mechanism of ranking web pages. However, as studies have shown [2], interested groups and individuals can also make use of web spamming mechanisms to trick search engines in ranking their pages higher than those of their rivals. The battle for controlling the messages in cyberspace is spreading over many ideological, cultural, and political issues where controversial positions vie for the public support. For example, consider issues such as abortion legality and morality, children vaccination risks, creationism vs. evolution, homosexuality, etc.[3]. Nowhere this battle is more obvious than when it comes to issues related to national elections. Obviously, the stakes here are high. If one is able to influence the public elect officials that will be favorable to his/her agenda, this will have far-reaching implications. The term \u201cWeb Spam\u201d or Adversarial Web Search [4] is broadly used to describe misinformation planted on the Web. Google-bombs are probably the best known examples of Web spamming, because of their broad coverage in the press [5]. Web spammers are creating misinformation using \u201ctext spam\u201d and \u201clink spam\u201d, while using \u201ccloaking\u201d to cover their tracks. This generic categorization of practical actions does not explain why they are successful \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In recent years several researchers have reported that the volume of Google Trends and Twitter chat over time can be used to predict several kinds of social and consumer metrics. From the success of new movies before their release to the marketability of consumer goods to the prediction of voting results in the recent 2009 German elections, Google Trends and Twitter message volume have been treated as indispensable tools for not only recording current social trends, but even for predicting the future. This is surprising, given the significant differences in the demographics of voters and people who use social networks and Web tools. But is there some underline logic behind these predictions or are they simply a matter of luck? With this work we wanted to test their predictive power against the US elections. One could argue that, following the previous research literature, and given the high utilization that the Web and the social networks have in the US, Google Trends and Twitter volume may be able to predict the outcomes of the US Congressional elections. In this paper we report that Google Trends was, actually, not a good predictor of both the 2008 and 2010 elections, and we offer some explanation on why this may be the case. On a forthcoming paper we report on our analysis on Twitter.\u2014Keywords: Social Web, Google Trends, Twitter, US elections, predictions, statistical analysis\u2014Citation: Catherine Lui, Panagiotis T.

But it is mainly a serious problem for Web users because they tend to confuse trusting the search engine with trusting the results of a search. In this paper, we propose \"backwards propagation of distrust,'' as an approach to finding spamming untrustworthy sites. Our approach is inspired by the social behavior associated with distrust. In society, recognition of an untrustworthy entity (person, institution, idea, etc) is a reason for questioning the trustworthiness of those that recommended its entity. People that are found to strongly support untrustworthy entities become untrustworthy themselves. So, in society distrust is propagated backwards. Our algorithm simulates this social behavior on the Web graph with considerable success. Moreover, by \u2026",

            "Publication url": "https://repository.wellesley.edu/object/ir264",
            "Abstract": "Web spammers are individuals who attempt to manipulate the structure of the Web in such a way that a search engine (SE) will give them higher ranking location (and thus, greater visibility) in search results than what they would get without manipulation. Typically, Web spammers aim to promote their own financial, political or religious agendas exploiting the trust that users associate with SE query results. Over the last ten years, search engines have taken steps to defend against spammers with some success. Arguably, Web spamming is crucial during election times, when voters are likely to use search engines to get information about electoral candidates. At times of elections, spammers could succeed in spreading propaganda manipulating SE query results of candidates' names. In a symmetric but, arguably, less likely scenario, SEs might influence elections by manipulating their own results to favor one candidate over another. In fact, some have suggested that SEs (Google in particular) should be proactively regulated to avoid such a possibility. In this paper, we investigate to what degree the SE query results related to searches of electoral candidates names were altered by anyone (Web spammers or SEs) during the 2016 US congressional election, an election that saw the rise of\" fake news\" sites. Our results indicate that different SEs had different degree of success defending against spammers: Google gave preference to reliable sources in the first 6 of the top-10 search results when queried with the name of any electoral candidate. Also, Google did not allow much variation in the ranking of the top-10 results and did not allow\" fake news\" \u2026",

            "Abstract": "There is an indisputable need for reliable online information. This need becomes imperative in real-time information channels (R-TICs) that are omnipresent in the Social Web these days. R-TICs are online systems that provide instant interaction, commenting and notification (eg, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc.) While helping us decrease our time and effort to be informed, R-TICs will put new stress to our abilities to act under time pressure in making decisions. Being able to determine the trustworthiness of the information we receive, therefore, will be paramount. How one determines the quality of the information received? Certainly, one needs to be skilled in critical thinking, but technology can also help one act with confidence, by maintaining a network of trusted sources and understanding the reasons why one should trust, or distrust, the information received. The overall aim of our ongoing research is to lay the foundation of a comprehensive approach to support critical thinking and increase security while maintaining privacy in a trusted cyber-world. Building on the work of other researchers, as well as on the success we had in the past with recognizing and uncovering some of the causes of misinformation, we design a system that can maintain trails of trustworthiness for information propagated through real-time information channels. When confronted with information that requires fast action, our system will enable its educated users to evaluate its provenance, its credibility and the independence of the multiple sources that may provide this information.\u2014Keywords: Social Web; Information Reliability; Social Networks, Trustworthiness \u2026",

We have found evidence of low coverage for commercial and medical controversial queries, and high coverage for a political query that is highly contested.

In this paper we present and analyze a simple, yet optimal, error-diffusion parallel algorithm for digital halftoning and we discuss an implementation on a parallel machine. In particular, we describe implementations on data-parallel computers that contain linear arrays and two-dimensional meshes of processing elements. Our algorithm runs in 2\u2022 n+m parallel steps, a considerable improvement over the 10\u2022 m\u2022 n sequential algorithm.

            "Abstract": "Arguably one of the most important features of Twitter is the support for \u201cretweets\u201d or messages re-posted verbatim by a user that were originated by someone else. Despite the fact that retweets are routinely studied and reported, many important questions remain about user motivation for their use and their significance. In this paper we answer the question of what users indicate when they retweet. We do so in a comprehensive fashion, by employing a user survey, a study of user profiles, and a meta-review of over 100 research publications from three related major conferences. Our findings indicate that retweeting indicates not only interest in a message, but also trust in the message and the originator, and agreement with the message contents. However, the findings are significantly weaker for journalists, some of whom beg to differ declaring so in their own user profiles. On the other hand, the inclusion of hashtags strengthens the signal of agreement, especially when the hashtags are related to politics. While in the past there have been additional claims in the literature about possible reasons for retweeting, many of them are not supported, especially given the technical changes introduced recently by Twitter.",

Arguably, one of the most interesting aspects of this trend is the possibility of ''pulsing'' the public's opinion in near real-time and, thus, it has attracted the interest of many researchers as well as news organizations. Recently, it has been reported that predicting electoral outcomes from social media data is feasible, in fact it is quite simple to compute. Positive results have been reported in a few occasions, but without an analysis on what principle enables them. This, however, should be surprising given the significant differences in the demographics between likely voters and users of online social networks.

            "Abstract": "Web spamming, the practice of introducing artificial text and links into web pages to affect the results of searches, has been recognized as a major problem for search engines. It is also a serious problem for users because they are not aware of it and they tend to confuse trusting the search engine with trusting the results of a search (16). The parallels between web spamming on the internet and propaganda in the real world suggest that we can use anti-propaganda techniques to educate users and develop tools to help them evaluate the reliability of the information they find online. In this paper, we first analyze the effects that web spam has on the evolution of the search engines and their relationship to propagandistic techniques in society. Then, we examine the neighborhoods of untrustworthy sites, finding that a dense biconnected component (BCCs) containing the site provide a reasonable trust neighborhood that has parallels in social network theory. The fact that spammers employ propagandistic techniques enables us to design a heuristic that follows anti-propagandistic practices in order to recognize a spamming network. In society, recognition of an untrustworthy message (in the opinion of a particular person or other social entity) is a reason for questioning the entities that recommend the message. Entities that are found to strongly support more untrustworthy messages become untrustworthy themselves. So, social distrust is propagated backwards for a number of steps. Our heuristic simulates this behavior on the trust neighborhood of a spammer. In our experiments, we examined trust neighborhoods of web sites, both trustworthy and not \u2026",

It has expanded into new forms of propaganda, bullshit (as defined by Harry Frankfurt), 2 and financial scams, all of which have existed since the creation of early human communities. Since ancient times, people have been exposed to lies, misinformation, and falsehoods. Believing lies can come at grave personal and social costs. In some extreme cases, communities, religions, and cultures were destroyed due to misplaced belief in falsehoods. Even the end of the first democracy came when the Athenian citizens, led by the charismatic populist leader Alcibiades, believed reports that their Syracusan enemies were cowards and Sicilian city-states would support them as allies, and entered in a disastrous war they could not win. 3 Today, we are exposed to \u201cfake news,\u201d a newer phenomenon in the everwidening genre of deception. We faced and overcame challenges throughout our history, but I argue that this time is different. The volume of (mis) information reaching us comes at speeds and levels that we, as a species, have not evolved to handle. Technology, ethical policies, laws, regulations, and trusted authorities, including fact-checkers, can help, but we will not solve the problem without the active engagement of educated citizens.

By following what people are blogging about or what they are searching about can give us some intuition on the collective psyche and lead us to understand what is currently happening in society before it has actually happened. Sometimes people refer to this phenomenon as the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d, that is, taking into account the opinions of the society as a whole, instead of the opinions of the expert.Facebook and Twitter are services where users can share personal opinions, and the APIs provided by these companies make it relatively easy to extract and process them. Google search volume trends, also accessible by APIs, can give an indication on what people are currently searching for, thus providing some insight into their current needs and worries. Theoretically, these data, if used correctly, can lead to predictions of currently occurring events influenced by human behavior. In fact, Choi & Varian (2009) have coined the term \u201cpredicting the present\u201d to describe this phenomenon, while Asur & Huberman (2010) simply refer to it as \u201cpredicting the future\u201d.",

Poll results were triumphantly tweeted, blogged, and covered in news reports among homophilous groups. In addition, users attempted to influence trends, real time search and news coverage by enlisting other users to increase volume on Facebook and Twitter for favored candidates. In addition the conservative Patriot Action Network threatened liberal news coverage and liberal journalists with a Twitter spam and the America Future Fund sent a\" Twitterbomb\" framed as replies to users interested in the Senate race. Given these efforts, Our results show that reporters must be cautious in interpreting Twitter and other manipulable, motivated and opinionated media trends as a guide to public opinion.",

Arguably, one of the most interesting aspects of this trend is the possibility of \u201cpulsing\u201d the public opinion in near real-time and, thus, it has attracted the interest of many researchers as well as news organizations. Recently, it has been reported that predicting electoral outcomes from social media data can be feasible and even simple to compute. Positive results have been reported in a few occasions, but without analysis on what principle enables them. This, however, should be surprising given the significant differences in the demographics of likely voters and users of online social networks.This work aims to test the predictive power of social media metrics against several Senate races of the recent US Congressional elections. Our conclusion is that such prediction are not better than chance, shedding some light on the limits of predictability of elections by means of social networks data. Further, we offer detailed explanation on why the community should be skeptical on reports of predictability of election results through raw data from social media.",

However, their ability to provide useful and unbiased information can be manipulated by Web spammers. Web spamming, the practice of introducing artificial text and links into web pages to affect the results of searches, has been recognized as a major problem for search engines. But it is mainly a serious problem for web users because they tend to confuse trusting the search engine with trusting the results of a search.In this paper, first we discuss the relationship between Web spam in cyber world and social propaganda in the real world. Then, we propose \u201cbackwards propagation of distrust,\u201d as an approach to finding spamming untrustworthy sites. Our approach is inspired by the social behavior associated with distrust. In society, recognition of an untrustworthy entity (person, institution, idea, etc) is a reason for questioning the trustworthiness of those that recommended this entity. People that are found to strongly support untrustworthy entities become untrustworthy themselves. In other words, in the society, distrust is propagated backwards. Our algorithm simulates this social behavior on the web graph with considerable success. Moreover, by respecting the user\u2019s perception of trust through the web graph, our algorithm makes it possible to resolve the moral question of who should be making the decision of weeding out untrustworthy spammers in favor of the user, not the search engine or some higher authority. Our approach can lead to browser-level, or personalized \u2026",

In 1996 the same group offered a revised curriculum reflecting advances in the discipline, the accompanying technology, and teaching pedagogy [6]. In each case, the LACS models represented, at least in part, a response to the recommendations of the ACM/IEEE-CS [1][2]. Continuing change in the discipline, technology, and pedagogy coupled with the appearance of Computing Curriculum 2001 [3] have led to the 2007 Model Curriculum described here. This report begins by considering just what computer science is and what goals are appropriate for the study of computer science in the landscape of the liberal arts. A curricular model for this setting follows, updating the 1996 revision. As in previous LACS curricula,[4] and [6], the model is practical; that is, students can schedule it, it can be taught with a relatively small size faculty, and it contributes to the foundation of an excellent liberal arts education. Finally, this 2007 Model Curriculum is compared with the recommendations of CC2001 [3].\u2014Citation: A 2007 Model Curriculum for a Liberal Arts Degree in Computer Science. with members of the Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium (LACS).

The ways in which it affects the teaching and learning, however, have not been assessed satisfactorily yet. Throughout the 1998-1999 academic year, the Wellesley Technology Assessment Committee (or WTAC) met to develop an agenda for research on the instructional use of technology at Wellesley College. The work of the committee during that first project told us that we wanted to know more, and to know differently, about how technology was affecting the nature of teaching and learning in our classrooms. We wanted to examine what was happening in human domains affected by the machine: inside human minds engaged in teaching and learning; in human social interaction; and in disciplinary knowledge, wherever and however such knowledge might be encoded. This paper describes in some detail Phase I of a multi-year project. We believe that both the process we developed and the findings of the preliminary phase will be of interest to those responsible for implementing technology plans on their campuses, and urge other educational institutions to see our process as a model.",

In addition, it will compute and report the rumor's level of visibility and, as an example of the power of crowdsourcing, the audience's skepticism towards it which correlates with the rumor's credibility. We envision {\\sc TwitterTrails} as valuable tool for individual use, but we especially for amateur and professional journalists investigating recent and breaking stories.

Another domain, in which there is uncertainty about the supporting evidence and truthfulness of a claim, is social networks. We propose that a similar method can be used to communicate uncertainty in these contexts, and present a tool for visualizing social network claims that builds upon research in both contexts.\u2014Keywords: Uncertainty, personal genomics, personal informatics\u2014Citation: Lauren Westendorf, Christina Pollalis, Clarissa Verish, Orit Shaer, Panagiotis Takis Metaxas, Samantha Finn, Madeleine Ball, Oded Nov.\" From Personal Genomics to Twitter: Visualizing the Uncertainty of Evidence\".

In fact, search engines such as Google and Bing have special agreements, which allow them to include into their search results public conversations happening in real-time in these social networks. However, for anyone who only reads these conversations occasionally, it is difficult to evaluate the (often) complex context in which these conversation bits are embedded. Who are the people carrying on the conversation? Are they random participants or people with a specific agenda? Making sense of real-time social streams often requires much more information than what is visible in the messages themselves.

There is no doubt that teacher actions can have a profound positive e ffect on student learning. In this paper, we discuss what students can do to increase their learning outcome. In particular, we describe an instrument that facilitates students' reflection of their own learning. Although the use of reflection on learning is not novel, its use in CS education has not been explored extensively. Our system was developed as a result of an experiment that we performed in a CS2 course, successfully giving students opportunities to take control of their own learning process. One of the attractive features of our system is that it is relatively easy for the instructor to set up and monitor the students' progress. In our evaluation of the system, we found that it can increase significantly the students' programming confidence at the end of the course. Even though this paper studies the eff effectiveness of introducing the\" reflection questionnaires\" instrument in a CS2-type course, it can be applied to most other courses in a curriculum. We provide the material we used in our experiment so that they can be adopted by educators.\u2014Keywords: Learning Methods, Reflection, Student learning, CS-2 course\u2014Citation: Stella Kakavouli and Panagiotis Takis Metaxas (2012).\" Also Your Job to Learn!

            "Abstract": "How widespread is the phenomenon of commenting or editing a tweet in the practice of retweeting by members of political communities in Twitter? What is the nature of comments (agree/disagree), or of edits (change audience, change meaning, curate content). Being able to answer these questions will provide knowledge that will help answering other questions such as: what are the topics, events, people that attract more discussion (in forms of commenting) or controversy (agree/disagree)? Who are the users who engage in the processing of curating content by inserting hashtags or adding links? Which political community shows more enthusiasm for an issue and how broad is the base of engaged users? How can detection of agreement/disagreement in conversations inform sentiment analysis-the technique used to make predictions (who will win an election) or support insightful analytics (which policy issue resonates more with constituents). We argue that is necessary to go beyond the much-adopted aggregate text analysis of the volume of tweets, in order to discover and understand phenomena at the level of single tweets. This becomes important in the light of the increase in the number of human-mimicking bots in Twitter. Genuine interaction and engagement can be better measured by analyzing tweets that display signs of human intervention. Editing the text of an original tweet before it is retweeted, could reveal mindful user engagement with the content, and therefore, would allow us to perform sampling among real human users.

Like bibliographics co-citation used to indicate that two papers treat a related subject matter, co-retweeting is used to indicate that two accounts present similar opinions in an online discussion. Thus, the co-retweeted network can be seen as a form of consulting the opinion of the crowd that is following the discussion about the similarity (or difference) of positions expressed by the highly visible accounts. When applied on political conversations related to some event, the co-retweeted network enables the measurement of the polarity of political orientation of major players (including news organizations) based on the views of the audience.

            "Abstract": "Using social media for political discourse is becoming common practice, especially around election time. One interesting aspect of this trend is the possibility of pulsing the public\u2019s opinion about the elections, and that has attracted the interest of many researchers and the press. Allegedly, predicting electoral outcomes from social media data can be feasible and even simple. Positive results have been reported, but without an analysis on what principle enables them. Our work puts to test the purported predictive power of socialmedia metrics against the 2010 US congressional elections. Here, we applied techniques that had reportedly led to positive election predictions in the past, on the Twitter data collected from the 2010 US congressional elections. Unfortunately, we find no correlation between the analysis results and the electoral outcomes, contradicting previous reports. Observing that 80 years of polling research would support our findings, we argue that one should not be accepting predictions about events using social media data as a black box. Instead, scholarly research should be accompanied by a model explaining the predictive power of social media, when there is one.",

Among its findings were the discovery and documentation of what was labeled a\" Twitter bomb\", an organized effort to spread misinformation about the democratic candidate Martha Coakley through anonymous Twitter accounts. In this paper, after summarizing the details of that event, we outline the recipe of how social networks are used to spread misinformation. One of the most important steps in such a recipe is the\" infiltration\" of a community of users who are already engaged in conversations about a topic, to use them as organic spreaders of misinformation in their extended subnetworks. Then, we take this misinformation spreading recipe and indicate how it was successfully used to spread fake news during the 2016 US Presidential Election. The \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper explores the creation of smart mobs and their ability to gain knowledge, social capital, and expand individual authority through participation. The evolution of smart mobs through computer-mediated communications has extended and expanded the traditional realm of individual influence and authority. In the decade since Rheingold identified smart mobs, this type of behavior has continued to grow and expand, influencing social, political and economic domains. But what makes or breaks a smart mob? Researchers in the last decade have tried unsuccessfully to identify their key components. This paper offers a \u201crecipe\u201d for creating smart mobs, by discovering the must-have characteristics that are necessary for their success: Desire for Communication; Affordable Communication Devices; Opportunities for Instantaneous Communication; Shared Goal; and Small Time Frame. In conclusion we propose that the future of effective smart mobs can be based on a template that has been successfully implemented since 2008, and that as individuals gain authority through the vehicle of smart mobs, governments will have to re-define their role in response to the collective action facilitated by smart mobs.",

Therefore, better understanding the predictive power and limitations of social media is of utmost importance.  \u2013 Different types of forecasting models and their adaptation to the special circumstances of social media are analyzed and the most \u2026",
