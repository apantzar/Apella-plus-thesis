            "Abstract": "Wireless mobile networks are characterized by stochastic topology variations. Sudden movements of mobile hosts in and out of each other's range impose limitations on the system performance. Routing protocols have been proposed for producing stable routes. All these protocols address the issue of route stability rather than connection stability. This paper proposes a new protocol for enhancing stability of connections rather than routes, without increasing the related overhead. The new protocol is based on the employment of a number of disjoint paths in each route discovery phase. Its performance is evaluated by simulations in the Java programming language that present adaptability to increased mobility.",

The wireless channel is vulnerable to malicious nodes that can eavesdrop data exchanges. Moreover, all nodes in an opportunistic network can act as routers and thus, gain access to sensitive information while forwarding data. Node anonymity and data protection can be achieved using encryption. However, cryptography-based mechanisms are complex to handle and computationally expensive for the participating (mobile) nodes. We propose SimBet-BF, a privacy-preserving routing algorithm for opportunistic networks. The proposed algorithm builds atop the SimBet algorithm and uses Bloom filters so as to represent routing as well as other sensitive information included in data packets. SimBet-BF provides anonymous communication and avoids expensive cryptographic \u2026",

The popularity of the approach stems from its flexibility to effectively operate in networks with diverse characteristics without requiring special customization. Nonetheless, its drawback is the tendency to produce a high number of replicas that consume limited resources such as energy and storage. To tackle the problem we make the observation that network nodes can be grouped, based on their utility values, into clusters that portray different delivery capabilities.

To capture these aspects various evaluation metrics are used, such as the number of delivered packets, the delivery delay and the number of transmissions. Unfortunately, in the context of opportunistic networks, these metrics are often highly correlated and usually conflicting. To make things worse, the characteristics of the network affect the importance of each metric as well as the levels of its correlation with other metrics. In this work, we first propose a set of performance evaluation metrics that are normalized with respect to the optimal performance. This approach tackles several of the above-mentioned shortcomings of traditional evaluation metrics. We then formulate the evaluation of routing protocols as a Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem \u2026",

The existing strategies rely either on fairness techniques or on diverting traffic to alternative routes in order to control congestion. The result is a dilemma between performance and fairness. In this work, we introduce a congestion control mechanism that provides a tunable trade-off between efficiency and fairness. We rely on the social preferences of the nodes for dynamically tuning the aforementioned trade-off. Our simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves high delivery ratio, combined with low end-to-end delay and routing cost, without sacrificing fairness under high traffic load.",

Random movements of mobile hosts in and out of each other's range encumber smooth system operation and impose limitations on the network performance. Various routing protocols suitable for such networks have been proposed however implementation and performance issues are still considered top research priorities. This paper proposes a new reactive protocol that introduces the use of sequence numbers for evaluating validity of cached routing information when source routing and route caching are used. The new protocol reduces the possibility of using and spreading across the network stale routing information therefore reduces the overhead involved in finding a route.

Two coding approaches are suitable for mobile networks; random linear network coding (RLNC) and XOR-based coding. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multiple source broadcasting in mobile ad hoc networks. We make the observation that RLNC provides increased resilience to packet losses compared with XOR-based coding. We develop an analytical model that justifies our intuition. However, the model also reveals that combining RLNC with probabilistic forwarding, which is the approach taken in the literature, may significantly impact RLNC's performance. Therefore, we take the novel approach to combine RLNC with a deterministic broadcasting algorithm in order to prune transmissions. More specifically, we propose a connected dominating set-based algorithm that works in synergy with \u2026",

The proposed algorithm can be used for satellite handover as well as for cell handover when a fixed amount of resources is allocated to each cell. Specifically, we consider the case in which the satellite system provides services to users of different QoS requirements. The first type of users require the minimization and, if possible, the elimination of the probability of forcing a connection in progress to termination during a handover. On the other hand, the users of the second category do not have any specific handover requirements. The new method is evaluated through extensive simulations and is proved to meet the requirements of the first type of users while at the same time maximizes the system utilization for both types of users.",

In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient method which, without incurring any additional cost, allows nodes to share information about the replication process in order to avoid unnecessary replication.

We first model the activity of a subscriber station using a Markov chain and its queue as an M/G/1 system with vacations in order to facilitate the analysis of the piggyback mechanism. We then derive a set of fixed point equations that describe not only the contention process at the network level but also bandwidth allocation to contending and piggybacked requests. Our model uses a minimal set of assumptions and is generic in the sense that it is customizable through a set of parameters. It can also reproduce the system performance in both saturated and non-saturated conditions.

In contrast to traditional networking, routing a query involves its delivery to as many as possible peers that are relevant to the query while at the same time minimizing the number of non-relevant peers involved in the process, therefore economizing on the limited network resources. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel protocols, namely TDP-ECT and CTPD-ECT.

            "Abstract": "Low earth orbit satellite constellations could play an important role in future mobile communication networks due to their characteristics, such as global coverage and low propagation delays. However, because of the non\u2010stationarity of the satellites, a call may be subjected to handovers, which can be cell or satellite handovers. Quite many techniques have been proposed in the literature dealing with the cell handover issue. In this paper, a satellite handover procedure is proposed, that investigates and exploits the partial satellite diversity (namely, the existing common coverage area between contiguous satellites) in order to provide an efficient handover strategy, based always on a tradeoff of blocking and forced termination probabilities for a fair treatment of new and handover calls. Three different criteria were examined for the selection of a satellite. Each one of them could be applied either to new or handover \u2026",

            "Abstract": "On demand routing protocols that exploit local caches have received a lot of attention lately in wireless ad-hoc networking. In this paper, we specifically address cache management, an issue that has been a main source of criticism for the applicability of such protocols. In particular, we tackle the problem of accessing the cache content efficiently. To this end, we propose summarizing the cache content so that we achieve efficient lookups. This not only saves both the restrictive resources of the wireless devices such as computational power and energy but also improves the overall protocol performance. We use Bloom filters as summaries. Our experimental results using the ns simulator show that both resource savings and performance improvements are attained when such filters are integrated within the DSR protocol which is one the most widely used instance of an on demand protocol",
