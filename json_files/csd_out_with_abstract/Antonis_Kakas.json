            "Abstract": "The language\u00a3 for reasoning about actions and change can be translated into an argumentation framework. In this paper, we extend this translation of the basic language and show how it can, together with methods from abduction, form the basis for a principled implementation of\u00a3. The extension we have considered concerns the addition of new type of sentences in the language as well as allowing theories where the narrative of events given is incomplete. A system, called\u00a3-RES, is developed within the argumentation framework of Logic Programming without Negation as Failure (LPwNF). This can support directly a variety of modes of common sense reasoning such as: default persistence in credulous or sceptical form, assimilation of observations and their diagnosis possibly under incomplete information, as well as combinations of these. To improve the efficiency of the system we have considered the integration of a SAT solver within the LPwNF computation, to carry out the of validating the time universal constraints imposed by ramification statements.",

            "Abstract": "From the very beginning of their investigation of human reasoning, philosophers have identified two other forms of reasoning, besides deduction, which we now call abduction and induction. Deduction is now fairly well understood, but abduction and induction have eluded a similar level of understanding. The papers collected here address the relationship between abduction and induction and their possible integration. The approach is sometimes philosophical, sometimes that of pure logic, and some papers adopt the more task-oriented approach of AI. The book will command the attention of philosophers, logicians, AI researchers and computer scientists in general.",

In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving. This integration of constraint solving into abductive reasoning facilitates a general form of constructive abduction and enables the application of abduction to computationally demanding problems. The paper studies the formal declarative and operational semantics of the ACLP framework together with its application to various problems. The general characteristics of the computation of ACLP and of its application to problems are also discussed. Empirical results based on an implementation of the ACLP framework on top of the CLP language of ECLiPSe show that ACLP is computationally viable, with performance \u2026",

The main objective of the proposed model is to give the traveler the capability of exploring the information space in a natural way where the information offered will remain continuously interesting. The system offers links to information in a dynamic and adaptive way. This is achieved by employing intelligent navigation techniques, which combine user profiling and meta-data. Electronic roads emphasize the presentation of multi-contextual information, i.e., information that is semantically related but of different nature at different locations and time.

The novel features of the model include: its innovative use of Computational Logic (CL) in a way that facilitates both the formal analysis of the model and its computational realisability directly from the high-level specification of the agents (a first prototype for the development of KGP agents exists, based upon a correct computational counterpart of the model), the modular separation of concerns and flexibility afforded by the model in designing heterogeneous agents and in developing independently the various components of an agent, and the declarative agent control provided through a context-sensitive cycle CL theory component that regulates the agent\u2019s operational behaviour, according to the current circumstances of operation, thus breaking away from the conventional one-size-fits-all control of operation.",

In particular, we extend earlier work of translating the language E for RAC into a logic-based argumentation framework, by introducing new types of arguments for (i) backward persistence and (ii) persistence from observations. This forms a conservative extension of the language E that gives a semantic meaning to domains that cannot be interpreted under E thus addressing further the frame and (exogenous) qualification problems. As such the paper strengthens the link between argumentation theory and RAC in artificial intelligence.",

Individually, abduction reasons from effects to possible causes, while induction learns general rules for particular observations. In combination, abduction and induction can be integrated within an iterative cycle of knowledge development. But, recent attempts to such hybrid methods in tasks that require spatio-temporal learning and reasoning, have begun to reveal a need for more expressive formalisms and inference mechanisms than offered by existing systems.This workshop will focus on expressive methodologies and applications of logic-based abduction and induction. To provide a concrete application domain, the AIAI\u201907 workshop will be co-located with the 1st Franco-Japanese Symposium on Knowledge Discovery in Systems Biology. The aims of the workshop are to investigate need for expressive logical formalisms in bioinformatics and other areas of AI, to idendity the state-of-the-art inference techniques for handling such formalisms, and to encourage interaction between biologists and logicians by discussing potential application areas and suggesting possible solutions.",

The approach is comparable to laboratory genotypic resistance testing in that it aims to determine which viral mutations a patient is carrying and predict which drugs they are most likely resistant to. But, instead of genetically analysing samples of the virus taken from patients\u2013which is not always practicable\u2013our approach infers likely mutations using the patient\u2019s full clinical history and a model of drug resistance maintained by a leading HIV research agency. Unlike previous applications of abduction, our approach does not attempt to find the\u201d best\u201d explanations, as we can never be absolutely sure which mutations a patient is carrying. Rather, the intrinsic uncertainty of this domain means that multiple alternative explanations are inevitable and we must seek ways to extract useful information from them. The computational and pragmatic issues raised by this approach have led us to develop a new ALP methodology for handling numerous explanations and for drawing predictions with associated levels of confidence. We present our in-Silico Sequencing System (iS3) for reasoning about HIV drug resistance as a concrete example of this approach.",

The system offers a high level of flexibility in addressing both the tasks of crew scheduling and rescheduling. Itcan be used to generate a valid and good quality initial solution and then help the human operators adjust and refine further this solution in order to meet extra requirements of the problem. These additional needs can arise either due to new foreseen requirements that the company wants to have or experiment with for a particular period in time, or due to unexpected events that have occurred while the solution (crew-roster) is in operation. This work shows the ability and flexibility of abduction, and, more specifically \u2026",

Systems developed to tackle this challenge have typically been evaluated on a small set of hand-crafted collections of sentences, since the development of new sentences by individuals is itself a rather challenging task, requiring care and creativity. In this paper we approach the problem of developing Winograd schemas via the introduction of WinoFlexi, a flexible online crowdsourcing system. Our empirical evaluation of the system\u2019s performance suggests that WinoFlexi allows crowdworkers to develop Winograd schemas of quality similar to that of most typical existing collections.",

They have each been studied as central inference mechanisms in order to tackle a set of particular but largely different problems. Abduction is mainly used to address problems of diagnosis and planning whereas induction is primarily used in the problem of machine learning. Within the wider context of the formation and the development of a knowledge theory, however, these two forms of reasoning interact and can be integrated together in a cooperative and enhancing way. In this paper we study this possibility of integration between abduction and induction and present a cycle of knowledge development based on this integration. This paper is a summary of part of the introductory chapter of a recent book [5] which addresses more generally the issues of the relation and integration between abduction and induction.",

            "Abstract": "Among the issues faced by an intelligent agent, central is that of reconciling the, often contradictory, pieces of knowledge\u2014be those given, learned, or sensed\u2014at its disposal. This problem, known as knowledge qualification, requires that pieces of knowledge deemed reliable in some context be given preference over the others. These preferences are typically viewed as encodings of reasoning patterns; so, the frame axiom can be encoded as a preference of persistence over spontaneous change. Qualification, then, results by the principled application of these preferences. We illustrate how this can be naturally done through argumentation, by uniformly treating object-level knowledge and reasoning patterns alike as arguments that can be defeated by other stronger ones. We formulate an argumentation framework for Reasoning about Actions and Change that gives a semantics for Action Theories that include a State Default Theory. Due to their explicit encoding as preferences, reasoning patterns can be adapted, when and if needed, by a domain designer to suit a specific application domain. Furthermore, the reasoning patterns can be defeated in lieu of stronger external evidence, allowing, for instance, the frame axiom to be overridden when unexpected sensory information suggests that spontaneous change may have broken persistence in a particular situation.",

Identifying such anomalies from observed data, or the task of anomaly detection, is an important and often critical analysis task. This includes finding abnormalities in a medical image, fraudulent transactions in a credit card history, or structural defects in an aircraft\u2019s engine. The importance of this problem has resulted in a large body of literature on this topic. However, given that the definition of an anomaly is strongly tied to the underlying application, the existing research is often embedded in the application domains, and it is unclear how methods developed for one domain would perform in another. The goal of this article is to provide a general introduction of the anomaly detection problem. We start with the basic formulation of the problem and then discuss the various extensions. In particular, we discuss the challenges associated with identifying anomalies in structured data and provide an overview of existing research in this area. We hope that this article will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.",

This form of control is adopted by the KGP model of agency and has been successfully implemented in the PROSOCS platform. We also show how, via cycle theories, we can formally verify properties of agents\u2019 behaviour, focusing on the concrete property of agents\u2019 interruptibility.

The framework uses roles and context to define policy preferences at different levels of deliberation allowing a modular representation of the agent's knowledge that avoids the need for explicit qualification of the agent's decision rules. We also employ a simple form of abduction to deal with the incompleteness and evolving nature of the agent's knowledge of the external environment and illustrate how an agent's self deliberation can affect the mode of interaction between agents. The high degree of modularity of the framework gives it a simple computational model in which the agent's deliberation can be naturally \u2026",

Inhibition is very important from the therapeutic point of view since many substances designed to be used as drugs can have an inhibitory effect on other enzymes.

In this first part of the study the work concentrates on the central problem of integration (or elaboration) of the explicit information from the text with the implicit (in the reader\u2019s mind) common sense world knowledge pertaining to the topic (s) of the story given in the text. We show how the major challenges for a successful story comprehension are closely related to those of NMR, as found in Default Reasoning and Reasoning about Action and Change and the specific problems of Knowledge Qualification and Revision within these areas and, how an appropriate formulation through argumentation can give a basis for automating the construction and revision of a coherent comprehension model of a narrative. We report on a first set of empirical experiments to harness the implicit world knowledge used by humans reading a story to guide the background knowledge given as input to our framework and present a prototype system that is used to evaluate the ability of our approach to capture both the majority and the variability of understanding of a story by the human readers in the experiment.

Information from disparate heterogeneous sources often with no a-priori common schema needs to be synthesized in a flexible, transparent and intelligent way in order to respond to the demands of a query thus enabling a more informed decision by the user or application program. The field although relatively young has already found many practical applications particularly for integrating information over the World Wide Web. This paper gives a brief introduction of the field highlighting some of the main current and future research issues and application areas. It attempts to evaluate the current and potential role of Computational Logic in this and suggests some of the problems where logic-based techniques could be used.",

            "Abstract": "Abduction and induction are two forms of reasoning with incomplete information that are appropriate for many tasks in Artificial Intelligence (AI). To a first approximation, abduction reasons from effects to possible causes, while induction learns general rules to account for particular observations. As our logical and philosophical understanding of these two forms of reasoning continues to grow, and our computational techniques are steadily improved, evidence accumulates that there are potentially significant benefits to be gained from integrating abduction and induction, in a cooperative way, within an incremental cycle of knowledge development. Different conceptual models for integrating abduction and induction are emerging which seem particularly promising for application to scientific modelling such as in the area of Systems Biology. Recent work in Machine Learning and Scientific Discovery is now demonstrating the viability of such an integrated approach by providing the first tentative applications of frameworks and systems designed to exploit the combination of abductive and inductive reasoning. This special issue reports on such recent developments focusing on expressive methodologies for logic-based abduction and induction. The volume grew out of the AIAI'07 workshop on Abduction and Induction in Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics, which took place on September 15th, 2007 in Aix-en-Provence, France. This workshop followed the series of workshops on abduction and induction that took place in the 1990s, culminating in the edited volume Abduction and Induction: Essays on their Relation and Integration (Kluwer, 2000); and \u2026",

(carob) tree have been widely studied for their ability to prevent many diseases mainly due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds. In this study, we explored, for the first time, the anti-cancer properties of Cypriot carobs. We produced extracts from ripe and unripe whole carobs, pulp and seeds using solvents with different polarities. We measured the ability of the extracts to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer and normal immortalized breast cells, using the MTT assay, cell cycle analysis and Western Blotting. The extracts\u2019 total polyphenol content and anti-oxidant action was evaluated using the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu method and the DPPH assay. Finally, we used LC-MS analysis to identify and quantify polyphenols in the most effective extracts. Our results demonstrate that the anti-proliferative capacity of carob extracts varied with the stage of carob maturity and the extraction solvent. The Diethyl-ether and Ethyl acetate extracts derived from the ripe whole fruit had high Myricetin content and also displayed specific activity against cancer cells. Their mechanism of action involved caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis. Our results indicate that extracts from Cypriot carobs may have potential uses in the development of nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals.",

It forms a general high-level knowledge representation environment for abductive problems in Artificial Intelligence and other areas. In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving facilitating its application to complex problems. The ACLP system is currently implemented on top of the CLP language of ECLiPSe as a meta-interpreter exploiting its underlying constraint solver for finite domains. It has been applied to the problems of planning and scheduling in order to test its computational effectiveness compared with the direct use of the (lower level) constraint solving framework of CLP on which it is built. These experiments provide evidence that the abductive framework of ACLP does not compromise significantly the computational efficiency of the solutions. Other experiments show the natural ability of ACLP to accommodate easily and in a robust way new or changing requirements of the original problem.",

In this framework, it is possible to learn with incomplete background information about the training examples by exploiting the hypothetical reasoning of abduction. We also study how the ACL framework can be used as a basis for multiple predicate learning.An algorithm for ACL is developed by suitably extending the top-down ILP method: the deductive proof procedure of Logic Programming is replaced by an abductive proof procedure for Abductive \u2026",

In a knowledge elicitation task, undergraduate students recorded the knowledge they deemed necessary for understanding each sentence in a set of four short stories in the form of property and causal knowledge rules. Results indicated the activation of a limited amount of knowledge that maintained both situational and conceptual connections with input. Situational inferencing and continuity (ie, carrying over of previously activated ideas) were positively associated and varied as a function of story part. Findings are discussed in relation to dominant theoretical models of narrative comprehension and for their implications regarding the computational representation of knowledge in automated story comprehension.",

The proposed argumentation framework is dynamic, with arguments and their strength depending on the particular context that the agent finds himself, thus allowing the agent to adapt his decisions in a changing environment. In addition, in order to enable the agent to operate within an open environment where the available information may be incomplete we have integrated abduction within this argumentation framework. This is particular useful when the agent finds himself in a dilemma and hence needs additional information to resolve this. We have also developed, motivated by work in Cognitive Psychology, within the same framework an argumentation based personality theory for agents thus incorporating a dimension of individuality in the decisions of the agent.",

KGP provides a highly modular agent architecture that integrates a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities, synthesised within transitions that update the agent's state in response to reasoning, sensing and acting. Transitions are orchestrated by cycle theories that specify the order in which transitions are executed while taking into account the dynamic context and agent preferences, as well as selection operators for providing inputs to transitions.",

Argumentation is also close to the original inception of logic as a framework for formalizing human argumentation and debate.

Classical deductive reasoning will be expressed entirely in terms of notions and concepts from argumentation so that formal logical entailment is equivalently captured via the arguments that win between those supporting concluding formulae and arguments supporting contradictory formulae. This allows us to go beyond Classical Logic and smoothly connect it with human reasoning, thus providing a uniform argumentation-based view of both informal and formal logic.",

            "Abstract": "Motivation and Objective: Although a plethora of machine learning and deep learning methods were used for the assessment of Alzheimer Disease (AD) MRI structural changes, the main drawback of these models is that they are regarded as black-box models and even though the results obtained are highly satisfactory, they lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, and thus we have difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory imaging structures. The objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of rule extraction in the assessment of AD using decision trees and random forests algorithms. Material and Methods: The decision trees and random forests algorithms were applied on brain MRI images acquired from normal controls (NC)(N= 114), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)(N= 129) and AD (N= 69). These images were downloaded from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. All the subjects had a standardized protocol on 1.5-T MRI units (typically 1.25\u00d7 1.25\u00d7 1.25 mm3 voxels) according to an ADNI protocol. Regions of interest (ROI) segmentation was performed using the Freesurfer v6. 0 software. The following MRI brain features were extracted when a subject was diagnosed from the hippocampus: volume (HipVol) and texture features (Angular Second Moment, Contrast, Correlation, Sum Average, Entropy and Cluster Shade). The KNIME analytics platform was used to compute the decision trees. Results: The overall accuracy achieved for the NC versus AD models was in the region of 90%, whereas the overall accuracy achieved for the NC versus MCI models was in the region of 65 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents an argumentation based framework, developed as an extension of an existing framework for nonmonotonic reasoning, in order to support an agent\u2019s self deliberation process. The framework allows the agent to draw conclusions taking into account in a natural way a given preference policy. After developing the argumentation framework we examine two general cases of such argumentative deliberation:(a) under a preference policy that takes into account the roles agents can have within a context pertaining to an environment of interaction and (b) under a preference policy for the current needs of the agent emerging from his profile. In the first case we apply the argumentative deliberation model within a simple agent interaction scenario where each agent\u2019s selfdeliberation determines, according to his own policy, his position at each step of the interaction process. In the second case we apply the framework to model motivational factors that apparently drive human behaviors and therefore can define agent personalities. Agents will thus similarly, as it is claimed in psychological literature for human beings, chose at any moment to pursue, those goals that are most compatible with their current motivations. The proposed argumentation framework allows us to define policy preferences at different levels of deliberation resulting in modular representations of the agent\u2019s knowledge or personality profile. This high degree of modularity gives a simple computational model in which the agent\u2019s deliberation can be naturally implemented.",

It is based on a hybrid computational model that implements the abductive search in terms of two tightly coupled processes: a reduction process of the high-level logical representation to a lower-level constraint store and a lower-level constraint solving process. A set of initial\" proof of principle\" experiments demonstrate the versatility of the approach stemming from its declarative representation of problems and the good underlying computational behaviour of the system. The approach offers a general methodology of declarative problem solving in AI where an incremental and modular refinement of the high-level representation with extra domain knowledge can improve and scale the computational performance of the framework.",

Broadly speaking, abduction aims at finding explanations for, or causes of, observed phenomena or facts. Learning occurs when an agent adapts its state or behaviour on the basis of experience. Both processes have a number of common characteristics. They both aim at improving their picture or model of the universe of discourse; they are both hypothetical, in the sense that the results may be wrong; and they can both be seen as reasoning processes, with the observations and the current knowledge of the world as input statements and the learned or abduced hypotheses as output statements.1 In the case of learning from examples, which is the most common form of learning studied in artificial intelligence, this form of reasoning is called induction, and that is the term we will be mostly \u2026",

            "Abstract": "E-RES is a system that implements the Language E, a logic for reasoning about narratives of action occurrences and observations. E's semantics is model-theoretic, but this implementation is based on a sound and complete reformulation of E in terms of argumentation, and uses general computational techniques of argumentation frameworks. The system derives sceptical non-monotonic consequences of a given reformulated theory which exactly correspond to consequences entailed by E's model-theory. The computation relies on a complimentary ability of the system to derive credulous non-monotonic consequences together with a set of supporting assumptions which is sufficient for the (credulous) conclusion to hold. E-RES allows theories to contain general action laws, statements about action occurrences, observations and statements of ramifications (or universal laws). It is able to derive consequences both forward and backward in time. This paper gives a short overview of the theoretical basis of E-RES and illustrates its use on a variety of examples. Currently, E-RES is being extended so that the system can be used for planning.",

The solution we propose is based on argumentation reasoning, that is a well suited technique for implementing decision making mechanisms under conflicting and incomplete information. Our proposal permits us to identify the attacker of a cyber attack and decide the regulation rule that should be used while using and sharing data.

By allowing administrators to define network abstractions (e.g. subnets, protocols etc) security requirements can be specified in a declarative manner using high-level terms. Also it is possible to specify preferences to express the importance of one requirement over another.

It reviews the state-of-the-art work over the past few decades on the link of these two reasoning forms with machine learning work, and from this it elaborates on how the explanation-generating role of Abduction and Argumentation makes them naturally-fitting mechanisms for the development of Explainable Machine Learning and AI systems. Abduction contributes towards this goal by facilitating learning through the transformation, preparation, and homogenization of data. Argumentation, as a conservative extension of classical deductive reasoning, offers a flexible prediction and coverage mechanism for learning -- an associated target language for learned knowledge -- that explicitly acknowledges the need to deal, in the context of learning, with uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent data that are incompatible with any classically-represented logical theory.",

It uses argumentation to develop a computational approach for SC as this is understood and studied in psychology. Argumentation provides uniform solutions to various representational and reasoning problems required for SC such as the frame, ramification, and qualification problems, as well as the problem of contrapositive reasoning with default information. The grounded semantics of argumentation provides a suitable basis for the construction and revision of comprehension models, through the synthesis of the explicit information from the narrative in the text with the implicit (in the reader\u2019s mind) common sense world knowledge pertaining to the topic (s) of the story given in the text. We report on the empirical evaluation of the approach through a prototype system and its ability to capture both the majority and the variability of understanding of stories by human readers. This application of argumentation can provide an important test-bed for the more general development of computational argumentation.",

The conference, once again, brought together researchers, practitioners, and vendors from all over the world working on all aspects of computer-aided timetable generation. The main aim of the PATAT conference series is to serve as an international and inter-disciplinary forum for new timetabling research results and directions. The conference series particularly aims to foster mul-disciplinary timetabling research. Our eld has always attracted scientists from a number of traditional domains including computer science and operational-search and we believe that the cross-fertilisation of ideas from di erent elds and disciplines is a very important factor in the future development of timetabling research. The Constance conference certainly met these aims. As can be seen from the selection of papers in this volume, there was a wide range of interesting approaches and ideas for a variety of timetabling application areas and there were delegates from many di erent disciplines. It is clear that while considerable progress is being made in many areas of timetabling research, there are a number of important issues that researchers still have to face.

In this paper we study how one such framework, the Language E, can form the basis for planning under (possibly) incomplete information. We define two types of plans: weak and safe plans, and propose a planner, called the E-Planner, which is often able to extend an initial weak plan into a safe plan even though the (explicit) information available is incomplete, e.g. for cases where the initial state is not completely known. The E-Planner is based upon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural proof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this proof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts argumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We provide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in particular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known.",

We investigate two main issues of concern: (a) can we represent complex domains that capture together different problems such as ramifications, non-determinism and concurrency of actions, at a high-level, close to the given natural ontology of the problem domain and (b) what features of such a representation can affect, and how, its computational behaviour. The paper describes the main problems faced in this representation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological guidelines for representing complex domains. Although our work has been carried out within one particular high-level description language, we believe that the results, especially those that relate to the problems of representation, are independent of the specific modeling language.",

This paper examines the link between argument and cognition from the psychological and the computational perspectives, and investigates how the synthesis of work on reasoning and narrative text comprehension from Cognitive Psychology and of work on computational argumentation from AI can offer a scientifically sound and pragmatic basis for building human-aware cognitive systems for everyday tasks. The paper aims, thus, to reveal how argumentation can form the science of common sense thought on which new forms of cognitive systems can be engineered.",

            "Abstract": "Declarative problem solving attempts to tackle problems using a high-level representation of the expert knowledge on the problem at hand. In a logical setting such a declarative representation would employ an alphabet of constants, functions and predicate symbols that naturally represent objects, functions and relationships between these objects in the domain of discourse. In a truly declarative representation of the problem, the logic theory contains knowledge known to be true about the problem domain rather than information on how to solve tasks, ie it does not contain definitions of concepts describing problem solving methods. In such a setting, problem solving in many cases consists simply in filling in missing information. This could for example be finding the extension of a predicate or some logical relation between existing predicates.In such cases, therefore, problem solving with a declarative representation consists of extending the existing description (eg, logical theory) of the problem to a new one such that the problem goal is satisfied in this extended description. This process is otherwise known by the name of abduction. In this logical setting, abduction as a problem solving method assumes that the general data structure for the solution to a problem (or solution carrier) is at the predicate level and hence a solution is described in the same terms and level as the problem itself. In artificial intelligence a prototypical problem where abduction is used is that of diagnosis. Here abduction is employed to produce an explanation for the observed, often faulty, behavior of the system in terms of primitive causes according to some theory describing \u2026",

A system, called E-RES, is developed within the argumentation frame-work of Logic Programming without Negation as Failure (LPwNF). This can support directly a variety of modes of common sense reasoning such as: default persistence in credulous or sceptical form, assimilation of ob-servations and their diagnosis possibly under incomplete information, as well as combinations of these.

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a new system called ProLogICA for Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) with Negation as Failure (NAF) and Integrity Constraints (ICs). The system builds upon existing ALP techniques but includes several optimisations and extensions necessitated by recent applications in computational biology, temporal reasoning and machine learning. Unlike some other ALP systems that support non-ground abduction through the integrated use of constraint solving, we adopt a more lightweight approach which avoids this complexity at the expense of only computing ground hypotheses. We argue our approach is suited to a wide class of real-world problems and demonstrate the effectiveness of ProLogICA on three non-trivial applications.",

We show how we can model, within Abductive Logic Programming (ALP), inhibition in metabolic pathways and use abduction to generate facts about inhibition of enzymes by a particular toxin (e.g. Hydrazine) given the underlying metabolic pathway and observations about the concentration of metabolites. These ground facts, together with biochemical background information, can then be generalised by ILP to generate rules about the inhibition by Hydrazine thus enriching further our model. In particular, using Progol 5.0 where the processes of abduction and inductive generalization are integrated enables us to learn such general rules.

In particular, it shows that AL and PL are logically equivalent in that they have the same entailment relation from any given classically consistent theory. This equivalence follows from a correspondence between the non-acceptability of (arguments for) sentences in AL and Natural Deduction (ND) proofs of the complement of these sentences. The proof of this equivalence uses a restricted form of ND proofs, where hypotheses in the application of the Reductio of Absurdum inference rule are required to be \u201crelevant\u201d to the absurdity derived in the rule. The paper also discusses how the argumentative re-interpretation of PL could help control the application of ex-falso quodlibet in the presence of inconsistencies.",

            "Abstract": "Inhibition is important from the therapeutic point of view since many substances designed to be used as drugs against some diseases can eventually have an inhibitory side effect on other enzymes. For example, Paracetamol is an inhibitor COX-3 cyclo-oxygenase [20], preventing the formation of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which are involved in pain and fever process. Paracetamol is transformed by the cytochrome P450 dependent enzymes producing N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imine (NAPQI), which is normally conjugated with glutathione for renal elimination. In case of overdose the glutathione production pathways are not able to produce enough glutathione and NAPQI, which is very reactive, accumulates in the liver leading to its failure [21]. Hence, any system able to predict the inhibitory effect of substances on the metabolic network would be useful in assessing the potential harmful side effects of drugs.",

However, network size and complexity make firewall configuration and maintenance notoriously difficult. Tools are needed to analyse firewall configurations for errors, to verify that they correctly implement security requirements and to generate configurations from higher-level requirements. In this paper we extend our previous work on the use of formal argumentation and preference reasoning for firewall policy analysis and develop means to automatically generate firewall policies from higher-level requirements. This permits both analysis and generation to be done within the same framework, thus accommodating a wide variety of scenarios for authoring and maintaining firewall configurations. We validate our approach by applying it to both examples from the literature and real firewall configurations of moderate size (ap 150 rules).",

Since then the field has expanded in various directions and has contributed to the development of many other areas in Computer Science. Logic Programming has helped to place logic firmly as an integral part of the foundations of Computing and Artificial Intelligence. In particular, over the last two decades a new discipline has emerged under the name of Computational Logic which aims to promote logic as a unifying basis for problem solving. This broad role of logic was at the heart of Bob Kowalski\u2018s work from the very beginning as expounded in his seminal book\u2014Logic for Problem Solving.\u201cHe has been instrumental both in shaping this broader scientific field and in setting up the Computational Logic community.This volume commemorates the 60th birthday of Bob Kowalski as one of the founders of and contributors to Computational Logic. It aspires to provide a landmark of the main developments in the field and to chart out its possible future directions. The authors were encouraged to provide a critical view of the main developments of the field together with an outlook on the important emerging problems and the possible contribution of Computational Logic to the future development of its related areas.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a computational model for reasoning with causal explanations of observations within the framework of Abductive Event Calculus (AEC). The model is based on abductive reasoning based on the notions of\u201d deserts\u201d and\u201d oases\u201d on the time line. Our work is motivated from the need to recover from the inconsistency that can arise when observations of fluents are added to the narrative of a domain description. We study how such observations can be assimilated via abductive explanations in order to render the domain frame consistent. Typically, such explanations would involve non-ground events whose time of occurrence can only be constraint within some interval. We present some notions of minimal commitment for such explanations and study how we can reason and compute with these explanations once they have been chosen and added to the theory. The computational model proposed can be readily implemented by exploiting, in a modular way, any of the different computational models for Abductive Logic Programming or for Answer Set Programming, augmented, again in a modular way, by suitable forms of temporal constraint solving.",

KGP is used as a model for the mind of the agent, so that the agent can act autonomously using a collection of logic theories, providing the mind's reasoning functionalities. The behavior of the agent is controlled by a cycle theory that specifies the agent's preferred patterns of operation. The implementation of the mind's generic functionality in PROSOCS is worked out in such a way so it can be instantiated by the platform for different agents across applications. In this context, the development of a concrete example illustrates how an agent developer might program the generic functionality of the mind for a simple application.",

To complete this emancipation, a new way of interacting with, and controlling the behavior of, computing-enabled devices is needed. This position paper argues for the adoption of cognitive programming as the paradigm for this user-machine interaction, whereby the machine is no longer viewed as a tool at the disposal of the user, but as an assistant capable of being supervised and guided by the user in a natural and continual manner, and able to acquire and employ common sense to help the user in the completion of everyday tasks. We argue that despite the many challenges that the proposed paradigm presents, recent advances in several key areas of Artificial Intelligence, along with lessons learned from work in Psychology, give reasons for optimism.",

In this paper we take this idea one step further and develop the concept of a fully integrated argumentation-based agent architecture. Under this architecture, an agent is composed of a collection of modules each of which is responsible for a basic capability or reasoning task of the agent. A local argumentation theory in the module gives preferred decision choices for the module\u2019s task in a way that is sensitive to the way the agent is currently situated in its external environment. The inter-module coordination or intra-agent control also relies on a local argumentation theory in each module that defines an internal communication policy between the modules. The \u2026",

Emphasis in this work is placed on the qualification problem, central when dealing with default reasoning, and in any attempt to integrate different forms of such reasoning.Our framework can be viewed as offering a semantics to two natural problems: (i) that of employing default static knowledge in a temporal setting, and (ii) the dual one of temporally projecting and dynamically updating default static knowledge.The proposed integration is introduced through a series of example domains, and is then formalized through argumentation. The semantics follows a pragmatic approach. At each time-point, an agent predicts the next state of affairs. As long as this is consistent with the available \u2026",

Before you begin, permit me to send him a brief personal, but public, message: Bob, how right you were, and how wrong I was. I should explain. When Bob arrived in Edinburgh in 1967 resolution was as yet fairly new, having taken several years to become at all widely known. Research groups to investigate various aspects of resolution sprang up at several institutions, the one organized by Bernard Meltzer at Edinburgh University being among the first. For the half-dozen years that Bob was a leading member of Bernard\u2019s group, I was a frequent visitor to it, and I saw a lot of him. We had many discussions about logic, computation, and language.",

We also show how a notion of (micro) processes can be used to facilitate reasoning at the dual levels of temporal granularity necessary for narrative-based domains involving \"instantaneous\" series of indirect and knock-on effects.",

Decisions taken individually by stakeholders can be contradicting, so there is a need for an arbitration service that will resolve the conflict and conclude on a single decision. Centralized mediation approaches gather all relevant context information and decide on the prevailing decision option as suggested individually by multiple stakeholders. There is high complexity on resolving all possible competing option conflicts among all competing stakeholders, thus, usually centralized solutions do not scale. Our approach avoids this complexity because it is based on defining an arbitration meta-policy for deciding on the priorities among stakeholders, which are few, and not among \u2026",

It uses argumentation to capture appropriate solutions to the frame, ramification and qualification problems and generalizations of these problems required for text comprehension. In this first part of the study the work concentrates on the central problem of integration (or elaboration) of the explicit information from the narrative in the text with the implicit (in the readers mind) common sense world knowledge pertaining to the topic(s) of the story given in the text. We also report on our empirical efforts to gather background common sense world knowledge used by humans when reading a story and to evaluate, through a prototype system, the ability of our approach to capture both the majority and the variability of understanding of a story by the human readers in the experiments.",

KGP provides a highly modular agent architecture that integrates a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities, synthesised within transitions that update the agents state in response to reasoning, sensing and acting.
