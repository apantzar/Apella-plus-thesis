We present a new defect coverage-driven window-based LFSR reseeding technique, which offers both high test quality and high compression. The efficiency of the proposed encoding technique in detecting defects is boosted by an efficient \u201coutput deviations\u201d metric for grading the calculated LFSR seeds. We show that, compared to standard compression-driven LFSR reseeding, higher defect coverage is obtained without any loss of compression.",

In this paper, we take advantage of the inherent parallelism of Huffman decoding and we present a generalized multilevel Huffman-based compression approach that is suitable for cores with multiple scan chains. The size of the encoded data blocks is independent of the slice size (i.e., the number of scan chains), and thus it can be adjusted so as to maximize the compression ratio.

The proposed BIST schemes are derived by: (a) properly assigning the Test Pattern Generator (TPG) outputs to the multiplier inputs, (b) modifying the TPG circuits and (c) reducing the test set length. Our results indicate that the total power dissipated during testing can be reduced from 29.3% to 54.9%, while the average power per test vector applied can be reduced from 5.8% to 36.5% and the peak power dissipation can be reduced from 15.5% to 50.2% depending on the implementation of the basic cells and the size of the multiplier.

Moreover, defects in advanced semiconductor technologies are not always covered by the most commonly used fault-models, and the probability of defect-escapes increases even more.

The produced software tests emulate the functionality of a scan path design, and can be applied during the normal-operation mode of the microprocessor, thus enabling at-speed testing. A major advantage of the proposed approach lies in the fact that the generation of the software tests does not require any knowledge about the low-level implementation of the microprocessor and is only based on its RT-level description and its instruction set architecture.",

The bit sequences of multiple cells of an LFSR, which is used as test pattern generator, are exploited for effectively encoding the test set of the core under test (multiphase architecture). A new algorithm which comprises four heuristic criteria is introduced for efficiently selecting the required seeds and LFSR cells. Also, a cost metric for assessing the quality of the algorithm's results is proposed. By using this metric, the process of determining proper values for the algorithm's input parameters is significantly simplified. The proposed method compares favorably with the most recent and effective test set embedding techniques in the literature",

In this paper we propose a new algorithm for seeds selection in LFSR (linear feedback shift register) based test-per-clock BIST. The proposed algorithm uses the well-known concept of solving systems of linear equations and, based on heuristics, minimizes the number of seeds and test vectors while achieving 100% fault coverage.

To increase the compression ratio, the same codeword can be reused for encoding compatible blocks of different sizes.

Despite its benefits, the use of DVS increases test time because high product quality can only be ensured by testing every core at multiple supported voltage settings; hence the repetitive application of the same or different tests at multiple voltage settings becomes necessary. In addition, testing at lower supply voltage settings increases considerably the length of each test because lower scan frequencies must be used for shifting test data using scan chains. Standard scheduling techniques fail to reduce the test time for DVS-based SoCs since they do not model testing at multiple voltage settings.

For achieving this, a special purpose slice, called stop-slice, that indicates the end of a seed's usage is encoded as the last slice of each seed. Thus, the seeds include by construction the information of where they should stop and, for that reason, we call them self-stoppable.

The proposed algorithm targets the maximization of run-lengths of zeros (or ones) in the test set accompanying the CUT.

            "Abstract": "Recently proposed power-gating structures for intermediate power-off modes offer significant power saving benefits as they reduce the leakage power during short periods of inactivity. Even though they are very effective for reducing static power consumption, their reliable operation can be compromised by process variations and manufacturing defects. In this paper, we propose a signature analysis technique to efficiently test power-gating structures that provide intermediate power-off modes. Based on this technique, a methodology to repair catastrophic and parametric faults, and to tolerate process variations is presented. For testing and repairing multimode power switches, we propose a robust built-in self-test and built-in self-repair scheme that reduces test cost and obviates additional manufacturing steps for post-silicon repair.

Our technique eliminates the need of a ROM for storing the seeds since the reseeding is performed on-the-fly by inverting the logic value of some of the bits of the next state of the Test Pattern Generator (TPG). The proposed reseeding technique is generic and can be applied to TPGs based on both Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) and accumulators. An efficient algorithm for selecting reseeding points is also presented, which targets complete fault coverage and allows to well exploiting the trade-off between hardware overhead and test length. Using experimental results we show that the proposed method compares favorably to the other already known techniques with respect to test length and the hardware implementation cost.",

The main drawback of these methods is that X-filling for low power leads to lower defect coverage than random-fill. We propose a unified low-power and defect-aware X-filling method for scan testing. The proposed method reduces shift power under constraints on the peak power during response capture, and the power reduction is comparable to that for the Fill-Adjacent X-filling method. At the same time, this approach provides high defect coverage, which approaches and in many cases is higher than that for random-fill, without increasing the pattern count. The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated with simulation results for the largest ISCAS and the IWLS benchmark circuits.",

We present a novel approach to placement and routing in standard cell arrays inspired by geometric constraint usage in traditional CAD systems. Placement is performed by an algorithm that places the standard cells in a spiral topology around the center of the cell array driven by a DFS on the interconnection graph. We provide an improvement of this technique by first detecting dense graphs in the interconnection graph and then placing cells that belong to denser graphs closer to the center of the spiral. By doing so we reduce the wirelength required for routing. Routing is performed by a variation of the maze algorithm enhanced by a set of heuristics that have been tuned to maximize performance. Finally we present a visualization tool and an experimental performance evaluation of our approach.",

For eliminating this problem, we present a new, low-overhead decompression scheme that can generate clusters of test bits in parallel. The test data are encoded using a recently proposed and very effective compression method called multilevel Huffman. Thus, apart from the significantly reduced test-application times, the proposed approach offers high compression ratios, as well as increased probability of detection of unmodeled faults, since the majority of the unspecified bits of the test sets are replaced by pseudorandom data.

The proposed technique can be used either in a full BIST implementation or in a test-resource partitioning scenario, since the test-data storage requirements on the tester are very low.

Recently, new linear decompression architectures were proposed which offer reduced shift power at the expense however of increased test data volume and test sequence length. This chapter presents a linear encoding method which offers both high compression and low shift power dissipation at the same time. A low-cost, test-set-independent scheme is also described which can be combined with any linear decompressor for reducing the shift power during testing. Extensive experiments show that the new method offers reduced test power dissipation, test sequence length and test data volume at the same time, with very small area requirements.",

            "Abstract": "The use of multiple voltage levels introduces new challenges for testing Multi-V dd  SoCs. Time-Division-Multiplexing (TDM) tackles many of these challenges and offers very effective test-schedules. However, the effectiveness of TDM for minimizing test time depends on the Test-Access-Mechanism (TAM) in the SoC. Single-V dd  TAM optimization techniques consider neither the highly constrained test environment of multi-V dd  SoCs nor the benefits provided by TDM, therefore they are not suitable for multi-V dd  SoCs. In this paper, we propose the first TAM optimization technique for multi-V dd  SoCs. The proposed method exploits unique scheduling opportunities and flexibility offered by TDM, and by the means of a Branch-&-Bound approach, it quickly identifies the most effective TAM configurations. Experiments using SoCs from industry highlight the benefits of the proposed technique on multi-V dd  designs, for \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The thermal activity during testing can be considerably reduced by applying power-oriented filling of the unspecified bits of test vectors. However, traditional power-oriented X-fill methods do not correlate the thermal activity with delay failures, and they consume all the unspecified bits to reduce the power dissipation at every region of the core. Therefore, they adversely affect the un-modeled defect coverage of the generated test vectors. The proposed method identifies the unspecified bits that are more critical for delay failures, and it fills them in such a way as to create a thermal-safe neighborhood around the most critical regions of the core. For the rest of the unspecified bits a probabilistic model based on output deviations is adopted to increase the un-modeled defect coverage of the test vectors.",

            "Abstract": "Even though system-on-chip (SoC) testing at multiple voltage settings significantly increases test complexity, the use of a different shift frequency at each voltage setting offers parallelism that can be exploited by time-division multiplexing (TDM) to reduce test length. We show that TDM is especially effective for small-bitwidth and heavily loaded test-access mechanisms (TAMs), thereby tangibly increasing the effectiveness of multi-site testing. However, TDM suffers from some inherent limitations that do not allow the fullest possible exploitation of TAM bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, we propose space-division multiplexing (SDM), which complements TDM and offers higher multi-site test efficiency. We implement space-and time-division multiplexing (STDM) using a new, scalable test-time minimization method based on a combination of bin packing and simulated annealing.

The proposed technique achieves complete fault coverage with shorter test sequences and requires less hardware for its implementation than the corresponding already-known techniques.

The effectiveness of test methods for such circuits can therefore be measured in terms of the coverage obtained for unmodeled faults. In this paper, we present a new defect-oriented dynamic LFSR reseeding technique for test-data compression. The proposed technique is based on a new output-deviation metric for grading stuck-at patterns derived from LFSR seeds. We show that, compared to standard compression-driven dynamic LFSR reseeding and a previously proposed deviation-based method, higher defect coverage is obtained using stuck-at test cubes without any loss of compression.",

            "Abstract": "In order to provide high performance with low power consumption, many multicore chips employ dynamic voltage scaling and voltage islands that operate at multiple power-supply voltage levels. Effective defect screening for such chips requires test applications at different operating voltages, which leads to higher test time and test cost compared to systems-on-a-chip (SoCs), which operate at only a single voltage level. We propose test scheduling techniques to minimize the testing time for multicore chips when each core is tested at multiple voltage levels and when it is tested for state retention when the core switches between two voltage levels. The proposed techniques include exact optimization based on integer linear programming and fast heuristic methods. Experimental results for two test-case SoCs from the industry highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The proposed technique is generic and can be applied to test set embedding or mixed-mode schemes based on various TPG. The imposed hardware overhead is very small since it is confined to just one extra bit per seed plus one very small counter in the scheme's control logic, while the test-sequence-length reductions achieved are up to 44.71%. Along with the test-sequence-reduction technique, an efficient seed-selection algorithm for the test-per-clock, LFSR-based, test set embedding case is presented. The proposed algorithm targets the minimization of the selected seed volumes and, combined with the test-sequence-reduction technique, delivers results with fewer seeds and much smaller test sequences than the already proposed approaches.",

The proposed design method is the first method in the open literature that takes into account a realistic fault model and can be applied for most practical values of m and n. Apart from the above the proposed checkers are very compact and very fast. The single output checkers are near optimal with respect to the number of transistors required for their implementation. Another benefit of the proposed TSC checkers is that all faults are tested by a very small set of single pattern tests, thus the probability of achieving the TSC goal is greater than in checkers requiring two-pattern tests. The single output TSC checkers proposed in this paper are the first known single output TSC checkers for m-out-of-n codes.",

To alleviate this problem we present a sophisticated version of the recently proposed State Skip LFSRs, the Variable-State Skip (VSS) LFSRs. By using VSS LFSR successive jumps of variable lengths can be performed in the state sequence of the LFSRs and thus the useless parts of the test sequences can be effectively skipped. A low-overhead decompression architecture, that overcomes the limitations of simple State Skip LFSRs, is also proposed. The combination of VSS LFSRs with the proposed architecture offers the very small test-data volumes of test set embedding, with drastically shortened test sequences. Also, in a multi-core environment where a common decompressor is used, maximum test-sequence-length reduction can be achieved for every individual IP core that is tested.",
