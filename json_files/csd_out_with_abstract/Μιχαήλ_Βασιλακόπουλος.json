SpatialHadoop supports several spatial operations (eg, K Nearest Neighbor search, range query, spatial intersection join, etc.) and seven spatial partitioning techniques (Grid, Quadtree, STR, STR+, k-d tree, Z-curve and Hilbert-curve). Distance-Join Queries (DJQs), like the K Nearest Neighbors Join Query (K NNJQ) and K Closest Pairs Query (K CPQ), are common operations used in numerous spatial applications.

The KCPQ finds the K closest pairs of points from two datasets and the \u03b5DJQ finds all the possible pairs of points from two datasets, that are within a distance threshold \u03b5 of each other.

Regarding query processing, the higher performance of SSDs is maximized when large sequences of queries (batch queries) are executed by exploiting the massive I/O advantages of SSDs.

Moreover, we compare experimentally this with other methods proposed in the literature for the same purpose.

In particular, in commercial systems R-tree entries are mapped onto relational tables, which implement their own concurrency protocols on top of existing table-level concurrency mechanisms. In analogy, the actual industrial implementations of B-trees do not apply the well-known merging procedure from textbooks in case of node underflows, but rather they apply the free-at-empty technique. This way, space is sacrificed for the benefit of faster deletions and less locking operations, whereas the search performance practically remains unaffected.

The outcome of this study is the derivation of the outperforming configuration (in terms of buffer structure, page replacement algorithm and buffering scheme) for CPQs.

Matching of words is not a trivial process since words have grammatical (inflectional and derivational) variations. There are two main approaches for matching between inflected words: Stemming (removing word suffixes based on ad-hoc selected suffixes) and Lemmatizing (replacing the inflected form with the base form of a word). However, these approaches normalize the word variations in their rightmost side. We claim it will be beneficial to additionally concentrate on word normalization at the left side, by removing word prefixes.

In this paper, we present another approach, where the Information System designers would be able to directly represent the real world in a database model, very close to the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. A query and manipulation language that can handle composite data types, close to ER diagrams, is the Conceptual Universal Database Language (CUDL). We demonstrate that a database modelled by ER diagrams can be directly expressed to the CUDL Abstraction Level (CAL), the data model corresponding to CUDL, by a set of rules for direct transformation of ER diagrams to CAL. This set consists of a basic set of five rules, which is extended with an extra rule that deals with specific situations appearing in practical applications. Consequently, the resulting more powerful and composite data can be directly maintained with the CUDL. In this way, the development process consisting in conceptual design (ER), transformation to Logical Relational Schema, usage of SQL for data manipulation/retrieval and the reverse steps to present the results in the conceptual level is simplified by conceptual design (ER), transformation to CAL and the usage of CUDL for direct manipulation/retrieval of real world (conceptual) structures.",

This type of spatial query is characterized by a distance range over one or two datasets. The most representative and known DRQs are the \u03b5 Distance Range Query (\u03b5DRQ) and the \u03b5 Distance Range Join Query (\u03b5DRJQ). Given the increasing volume of spatial data, it is difficult to perform a DRQ on a centralized machine efficiently. Moreover, the \u03b5DRJQ is an expensive spatial operation, since it can be considered a combination of the \u03b5DR and the spatial join queries. For this reason, this paper addresses the problem of computing DRQs on big spatial datasets in SpatialHadoop, an extension of Hadoop that supports spatial operations efficiently, and proposes new algorithms in SpatialHadoop to perform efficient parallel DRQs on large-scale spatial datasets. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithms in several situations with big synthetic and real-world datasets. The experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and scalability of our proposal.",

Typically, GPU devices have much larger numbers of processing cores than CPUs and faster device memory than main memory accessed by CPUs, thus, providing higher computing power.

Although the related algorithms work well for low-dimensional data spaces, their performance degrades as the number of dimensions increases (dimensionality curse). To obtain acceptable response time in high-dimensional data spaces, algorithms that obtain approximate solutions can be used. In this chapter, we review the most important approximation techniques for reporting sufficiently good results quickly. We focus on the design choices of efficient approximate DBQ algorithms that minimize the response time and the number of 1/0 operations over tree-like structures.

In this context, we adapt an indexing method, called XBR trees, to support range queries about the history of trajectories of moving objects. The XBR tree is a quadtree like external memory, balanced and compact structure that follows regular decomposition.

Other ants that locate this trail, follow it and reinforce it, since they also lay down pheromone. As a result, shorter paths to food have more pheromone and are more likely to be followed. ACO algorithms are probabilistic techniques for solving computational problems that are based in finding as good as possible paths through graphs by imitating the ants\u2019 search for food.

In this paper, we discuss another approach, where the Information System designers would be able to depict the real world in a database model directly. This model provides more powerful and composite data types, as those of the real world. However, more powerful models need query and manipulation languages that can handle the features of the new composite data types. The Conceptual Universal Database Language (CUDL) is such a language that leads to more abstract database design levels. We demonstrate that a database modelled by Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams can be directly expressed to the CUDL Abstraction Level (CAL), by a set of rules for direct transformation of ER diagrams to CAL. This set consists of 5 rules, proposed in a previous work by us and, in this paper, it is extended with an extra rule that deals with specific situations appearing in practical applications. Consequently, the resulting more powerful and composite data can be directly maintained with the CUDL language. In this way, the development process consisting in conceptual design (ER), transformation to Logical Relational Schema, usage of SQL for data manipulation/retrieval and the reverse steps to present the results in the conceptual level is simplified by conceptual design (ER), transformation to CAL and the usage of CUDL for direct manipulation/retrieval of real world (conceptual) structures.",

The``D distance-value''of this n-tuple is the value of a linear function of distances of the n objects that make up this n-tuple, according to the edges of the QG. This paper addresses the problem of\u00ae nding the K n-tuples between n spatial datasets that have the smallest Ddistance-values, the so-called K-multi-way distance join query (K-MWDJQ), where each set is indexed by an Rtree-based structure. This query can be viewed as an extension of K-closest-pairs query (K-CPQ)[8] for n inputs. In addition, a recursive non-incremental branch-and-bound algorithm following a depth-\u00ae rst search for processing synchronously all inputs without producing any intermediate result is proposed. Enhanced pruning techniques are also applied to n R-trees nodes in order to reduce the total response time and the number of distance computations of the query. Due to the exponential nature of the problem, we also propose a time-based approximate version of the recursive algorithm that combines approximation techniques to adjust the quality of the result and the global processing time.

For this reason, this paper addresses the problem of computing the KCPQ on big spatial datasets in SpatialHadoop, an extension of Hadoop that supports spatial operations efficiently, and proposes a novel algorithm in SpatialHadoop to perform efficient parallel KCPQ on large-scale spatial datasets. We have evaluated the performance of the algorithm in several situations with big synthetic and real-world datasets. The experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and scalability of our proposal.",

Spatial indexes, such as those based on the Quadtree, are important in spatial databases for efficient execution of queries involving spatial constraints and objects. In this paper, we study a recent balanced disk-based index structure for point data, called xBR+-tree, that belongs to the Quadtree family and hierarchically decomposes space in a regular manner. For the most common spatial queries, like Point Location, Window, Distance Range, Nearest Neighbor and Distance-based Join, the R-tree family is a very popular choice of spatial index, due to its excellent query performance. For this reason, we compare the performance of the xBR+-tree with respect to the R*-tree and the R+-tree for tree building and processing the most studied spatial queries \u2026",

For this purpose, a number of methods have been proposed to efficiently organize and index moving objects and answer spatiotemporal queries. The majority of all these methods are addressing either the past or the future movement of the moving objects. Up until now, addressing both the past and the future movement of the objects in an integrated manner has rarely appeared in the literature. In the current paper, based on a spatiotemporal access method, the XBR-tree, we propose algorithms for the efficient processing of spatiotemporal window (past) and timestamp (past, present and future) queries.

The R-tree and its variations are commonly cited multidimensional access methods that can be used for answering such queries. Although, the related algorithms work well for low-dimensional data spaces, their performance degrades as the number of dimensions increases (dimensionality curse). In order to obtain acceptable response time in high-dimensional data spaces, algorithms that obtain approximate solutions can be used. Approximation techniques, like N-consider (based on the tree structure), or \u03b1-allowance and \u03b5-approximate (based on distance), can be applied in branch-and-bound algorithms for DBQs in order to control the trade-off between cost and accuracy of the result [CCV02]. In this paper, we improve the algorithms presented in [CCV02] by extending the use of approximation techniques at the leaf level of R-trees and by applying a combination of two such techniques in the same algorithm (hybrid approximate scheme). We investigate the performance of these improvements for the most representative DBQs (the K-nearest neighbors query and the K-closest pairs query) in high-dimensional data spaces, as well as the influence of the algorithmic parameters on the control of the trade-off between the response time and the accuracy of the result.",

            "Abstract": "Processing of spatial queries has been studied extensively in the literature. In most cases, it is accomplished by indexing spatial data by an access method. For queries involving a single dataset, like the Point Location Query, the Window (Distance Range) Query, the (Constrained) K Nearest Neighbor Query, the R*-tree (a data-driven structure) is a very popular choice of such a method. In this paper, we compare the performance of the R*-tree for processing single dataset spatial queries to the performance of a disk based structure that belongs to the Quadtree family, the xBR-tree (a space-driven structure). We demonstrate performance results (I/O efficiency and execution time) of extensive experimentation that was based on real datasets, using these two index structures. The winner depends on several parameters and the results show that the xBR-tree is a promising alternative for these spatial operations.",

In this paper, we present the Multiversion Linear Quadtree (MVLQ), a spatio-temporal access method based on Multiversion B-trees (MVBT) [2], embedding ideas from Linear Region Quadtrees [4]. More specifically, instead of storing independent numerical data having a different transaction-time each, for every consecutive image we store a group of codewords that share the same transaction-time, whereas each codeword represents a spatial subregion. Thus, the new structure may be used as an index mechanism for storing and accessing evolving raster images. We also conducted a thorough experimentation using sequences of real and synthetic raster images. In particular, we examined the time performance of temporal window queries, and provide \u2026",

Let a group of query points, for each of which we need to compute the k-NNs within a reference dataset to derive the dominating feature class. When the reference points volume is extremely big, it can be proved challenging to deliver low latency results. Furthermore, when the query points are originating from streams, the need for new methods arises to address the computational overhead. We propose and implement two in-memory GPU-based algorithms for the k-NN query, using the CUDA API and the Thrust library. The first one is based on a Brute Force approach and the second one is using heuristics to minimize the reference points near a query point. We also present an extensive experimental comparison against existing algorithms, using synthetic and real datasets. The results show that both of our algorithms outperform these algorithms, in terms of execution time as well as total volume of in-memory reference points that can be handled.",

It is an operation widely adopted by many spatial and GIS applications. As a combination of the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and the spatial join queries, KCPQ is an expensive operation. Given the increasing volume of spatial data, it is difficult to perform a KCPQ on a centralized machine efficiently. For this reason, this paper addresses the problem of computing the KCPQ on big spatial datasets in SpatialHadoop, an extension of Hadoop that supports spatial operations efficiently, and proposes a novel algorithm in SpatialHadoop to perform efficient parallel KCPQ on large-scale spatial datasets. We have evaluated the performance of the algorithm in several situations with big synthetic and real-world datasets.

In this paper we investigate an alternative option instead of app collaboration which is based on remote application calling (RAC). Under the RAC framework, a trusted source is able to invoke application actions at other people's devices, without necessarily owning himself the application it handles.

Currently, they are also interested in exploiting the positive characteristics of flash-based Solid State Drives (SSDs) like fast reads and writes. However, designing spatial indices for SSDs, termed flash-aware spatial indices, has been a challenging task because of the intrinsic characteristics of these devices. Among existing works in the literature, FAST and eFIND distinguish themselves by proposing general approaches that can be employed to design flash-aware spatial indices. In this article, we apply these approaches to the xBR+-tree, an efficient spatial index for points. The goal is to understand how they should be adapted in order to deal with the particular properties of the xBR+-tree. As a result, we specify two novel flash-aware spatial indices for points, the eFIND xBR+-tree and the FAST xBR+-tree. We also conduct a performance evaluation to analyze their performance. As main conclusion, we point out that eFIND fits very well with the xBR+-tree and allowed to reduce the processing of the index construction from 30.8% to 91.4% and the execution of spatial queries from 22.5% to 46%.",

            "Abstract": "Processing of spatial queries when the datasets involved are big can be accomplished efficiently in a parallel and distributed environment. The (K) Closest-Pair (s) Query, KCPQ, is a common query in many real-life applications involving geographical, or, in general, spatial data. It consists in finding the (K) closest pair (s) of objects between two spatial datasets. Although, processing of this query has been studied extensively for centralized environments, few solutions have appeared for parallel and distributed frameworks. Apache Spark is such a framework that has several advantages compared to other popular ones, like Hadoop MapReduce. In this work, we present an algorithm for processing the KCPQ in Apache Spark and experimentally study its efficiency and scalability, using big real-world datasets.",

The \u201cD distance -value\u201d of this n-tuple is the value of a linear function of distances of the n objects that make up this n-tuple, according to the edges of the QG. This paper addresses the problem of finding the Kn-tuples between n spatial datasets that have the smallest D distance -values, the so-called K-Multi-Way Distance Join Query (K-MWDJQ), where each set is indexed by an R-tree-based structure. This query can be viewed as an extension of K-Closest-Pairs Query (K-CPQ) [4] for n inputs. In addition, a recursive non-incremental branch-and-bound algorithm following a Depth-First search for processing synchronously all inputs without producing any intermediate result is proposed. Enhanced pruning techniques are also applied to the n R-trees nodes in order to reduce the total response time \u2026",

The family of R-trees is considered a good choice (especially the R*-tree) for indexing a spatial dataset.

We demonstrate that the adoption of such a language, the Conceptual Universal Database Language (CUDL), leads to higher database design levels: a database modeled by Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams can be first transformed to the CUDL Abstraction Level (CAL), which can be then transformed to the FDB model.

Although the related algorithms work well for low-dimensional data spaces, their performance degrades as the number of dimensions increases (dimensionality curse). To obtain acceptable response time in high-dimensional data spaces, algorithms that obtain approximate solutions can be used.

The main characteristic of all these structures is that they subdivide space (in an hierarchical and regular fashion) into disjoint regions. These spatial access methods are fully dynamic, while insertions are not complicated to program and affect only one path in the tree. Moreover, x-BR trees are variable resolution structures. That is, the number of space subdivisions is not predefined, making these structures suitable for very large amounts of data.

The most representative and known DBJQs are the K Closest Pairs Query (KCPQ) and the \u03b5 Distance Join Query (\u03b5DJQ). These types of join queries are characterized by a number of desired pairs (K) or a distance threshold (\u03b5) between the components of the pairs in the final result, over two spatial datasets. Both are expensive operations, since two spatial datasets are combined with additional constraints.

In this paper, we present algorithms for Nearest Neighbor Queries using a disk based structure that belongs to the Quad tree family, the xBR-tree, that can be used for indexing large point datasets. We demonstrate performance results (I/O efficiency and execution time) of alternative Nearest Neighbor algorithms, using real datasets.",

            "Abstract": "In spatial database applications the similarity or dissimilarity of complex objects is examined by performing distance-based queries (DBQs) on data of high dimensionality (a generalization of spatial data). The R-tree and its variations are commonly cited as multidimensional access methods that can be used for answering such queries. Although the related algorithms work well for low-dimensional data spaces, their performance degrades as the number of dimensions increases (dimensionality curse). To obtain acceptable response time in high-dimensional data spaces, algorithms that obtain approximate solutions can be used. In this chapter, we review the most important approximation techniques for reporting sufficiently good results quickly. We focus on the design choices of efficient approximate DBQ algorithms that minimize the response time and the number of I/O operations over tree-like structures. The chapter concludes with possible future research trends in the approximate computation of DBQs.",

We focus on the deletion operation over the xBR-tree, a spatial data secondary memory structure that belongs to the Quad tree family. The algorithm of handling deletions is presented, taking into account that the deletion of a leaf item may cause entries deletions from internal nodes. The well-known merging technique is applied, to retain the efficiency of the xBR-tree.",

            "Abstract": "One of the most representative and studied Distance-Based Queries in Spatial Databases is the K-Closest-Pairs Query (KCPQ). This query involves two spatial data sets and a distance function to measure the degree of closeness, along with a given number K of elements of the result. The output is a set of pairs of objects (with one object element from each set), with the K lowest distances. In this paper, we study the problem of processing KCPQs between RAM-based point sets, using Plane-Sweep (PS) algorithms. We utilize two improvements that can be applied to a PS algorithm and propose a new algorithm that minimizes the number of distance computations, in comparison to the classic PS algorithm. By extensive experimentation, using real and synthetic data sets, we highlight the most efficient improvement and show that the new PS algorithm outperforms the classic one, in most cases.",

The cost of buiding indexes to accelerate query processing would not be repaid for such data sets. We consider an extension of the popular (K) Nearest-Neighbor Query, called the (K) Group Nearest Neighbor Query (GNNQ). This query discovers the (K) nearest neighbor(s) to a group of query points (considering the sum of distances to all the members of the query group) and has been studied during recent years, considering data sets indexed by efficient spatial data structures. We study (K) GNNQs, considering non-indexed RAM-resident data sets and present an existing algorithm adapted to such data sets and two Plane-Sweep algorithms, that apply optimizations emerging from the geometric properties of the problem.

Apart from reviewing the    related previous research work and relevant web-based systems, we present the    main elements of the system\u2019s analysis and its design, the extensions that    could lead to even more powerful systems, and conclusions about the    advantages, limitations and practical application of the DSS.",
