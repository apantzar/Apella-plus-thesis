More specifically considering realistic three-dimensional (3-D) non-isotropic scattering channel modelling combined with opportunistic relay selection for various fading conditions. Moreover, the stratospheric nodes are battery-dependent and relay selection aims at power reduction. As Channel State Information (CSI) overhead is introduced by the selection process, proactive and reactive versions are presented based on instantaneous CSI knowledge. In this setting, the selection policies in terms of outage probability, throughput and power reduction are evaluated and comparisons with statistical channels and with a relaying scheme that does not perform power adaptation are provided.",

When combined with relaying, FD systems are expected to dramatically increase the throughput of future wireless networks. However, the degrading effect of self-interference (SI) due to the simultaneous transmission and reception at the relay threatens their efficient rollout in real-world topologies. At the same time, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can further increase the spectral efficiency of the network.

Thus, in a multitier network, the demand for high-speed and interference-free transmission and reception is inevitable. Beamforming (BF) is an advanced technology that offers a significantly improved solution to reduce the interference levels and improve the system capacity. Accordingly, the establishment of relays in mobile data networks has emerged spectral efficiency enhancements and cell capacity gains from an overall system perspective. This paper provides a comprehensive survey focused on the performance of adopted beamforming technique on MIMO relay networks that is expected to overcome crucial obstacles in terms of capacity and interference. The main objective is to point out the state-of-the-art research activity on BF techniques in MIMO relay networks, under various network performance challenges. Thereby, it focuses on recently developed procedures for interference modeling and mitigation, BF channel modeling, channel estimation and feedback, complexity and power consumption, adaptive BF for multiuser relaying, degrees of freedom, diversity issues, and spectral efficiency, in cooperative and opportunistic systems. Different network topologies have been considered and categorized, pertaining the challenges of BF implementation in MIMO relay networks.",

The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via simulations and comparisons with another state-of-the-art DPS selection scheme, in terms of UE transitions between Transmission Points (TPs) and throughput. The results show that LOCH achieves significantly less transitions, while having the same or better throughput performance.

In this paper, we propose the inclusion of such information in SI by introducing modifications into the respective 3GPP specifications. Thus, we propose a Delay Aware Channel Prioritization (DACP) criterion optimized for real-time services. Furthermore, we propose a DACP-based packet Scheduler (DACP-S) which is able to dynamically manage the Enhanced Dedicated Channel\u2019s (E-DCH) transmissions \u2026",

They are trained and tested with path loss data collected from an extensive measurement campaign that have been carried out in diverse rural areas in Greece. The results demonstrate that all the proposed machine learning models outperform the empirical ones, exhibiting, in any case, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values between 4.0 and 6.5 dB. The poorest prediction of the measured data is encountered for SVR with Polynomial kernel. Furthermore, B-kNN and RF algorithms preserve comparable path loss approximations with remarkably low RMSE on the order of 4.2\u20134.3 dB. The error \u2026",

Nonetheless, it results in increased end-to-end delay, as packets tend to reside in the relays' buffers for many time-slots. In order to enable the adoption of BA relays in delay-intolerant applications, the combination with successive relaying can increase the number of packets that are transmitted. In this work, hybrid relay selection algorithms are studied, where delay- and diversity aware (DDA) half-duplex algorithms are complemented with successive BA relaying. Moreover, a hybrid DDA algorithm is presented, namely LoLA4SOR that adapts to the transmit conditions, switching between half-duplex (HD) and successive relaying (SuR). The performance of LoLA4SOR is compared to several HD, successive and hybrid algorithms, in terms of outage probability, throughput and delay. The results indicate that \u2026",

The proposed controllers are designed to satisfy I/O decoupling, stability and atmospheric disturbance attenuation.

Remote sites are equipped with a special communication unit (videoconference unit or internet protocol phone) and may also incorporate a medical data acquisition unit.

Transmission rates at 128 kbps (48 kbps guaranteed bandwidth) are sufficient to support high-quality VoIP communication and medical data transmission together.

We propose a relay selection policy that, by exploiting the benefits of buffering at the relays, decouples the receiving relay at the previous time slot to be the transmitting relay at the next slot. Furthermore, we impose an interference cancellation threshold allowing the relay that is selected for reception to decode and subtract the inter\u2010relay interference.

            "Abstract": "The continuous increase in mobile data traffic creates the need for radical innovations in the mobile broadband system design. The demand for high-speed and interference-free transmission and reception is inevitable and one sine qua non condition is the efficient spatial reuse. However, increasing traffic within a fixed limited bandwidth creates more interference in the system and degrades the signal quality. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques offer many benefits in practical wireless systems including capacity and spectral efficiency increment, fading mitigation, and improved resistance to interference. Beamforming is a multiantenna technique that significantly reduces interference and improves system capacity.An emerging research trend considers relays in terrestrial and satellite networks as the most promising proposal for achieving significant performance gains. Enhanced reliability and extended cell coverage are two of the advantages the relay networks offer. Relay networks encompass amplify-andforward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, fulland half-duplex operation, experience fading and interference, and incorporate power constraints. Although beamforming techniques at the source and/or the destination in a relay network have been examined, their use in MIMO relay networks has been recently proposed and is expected to overcome crucial obstacles in terms of capacity and interference. It is thus expected to contribute to the performance of the network, while combining various attributes of networks\u2019 design parameters.",

In this paper, we propose the inclusion of such information in SI by introducing a modification of the respective 3GPP specifications.

            "Abstract": "The currently deployed terrestrial wireless networks experience difficulties while coping with the massive connectivity demands of coexisting users and devices. The addition of satellite segments has been proposed as a viable way of providing improved coverage and capacity, leading to the formation of integrated satellite-terrestrial networks. In such topologies, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can further enhance the efficient use of wireless resources by simultaneously serving multiple users. In this paper, an integrated satellite-terrestrial NOMA network is studied where cooperation between ground users is allowed, following the device-to-device (D2D) paradigm. More specifically, the proposed satellite NOMA cooperative (SANOCO) D2D scheme optimally selects pairs of users, by considering the channel conditions of the satellite and the terrestrial D2D links. In SANOCO-D2D users are served through NOMA in the satellite link, and then, if the weak user fails to decode its signal, terrestrial D2D communication is activated to maintain the total sum rate of the system. Comparisons with conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and an alternative NOMA optimal user pairing scheme show that significant sum rate and spectral efficiency gains can be harvested through SANOCO-D2D under varying channel conditions and terrestrial D2D bandwidth.

The main degrading factor in this scheme is the IRI introduced by the best relay, which is selected to forward the previous frame, while the rest of the relays are receiving the current source frame.

One is based on the hybrid relay selection algorithm, where the relay selection takes into account the queue sizes so that the delay is reduced and the diversity is maintained. The other approach is based on the max - link relay selection algorithm. For the max - link algorithm, a delay-aware only approach starves the buffers and increases the outage probability of the system. Thus, for \u2026",

Aiming to reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) acquisition and processing, we propose a suboptimal distributed method for relay selection, for which the network performance is not degraded significantly. We show that power adaptation offers reduced overhead of CSI acquisition.

In Ku band the capacity is highly variable with the elevation angle, taking values between 2 and 5.9 b/s/Hz, whereas the maximum capacity values are observed in a blocked environment. At L and S bands the capacity is uncorrelated with distance for element spacing up to 1.5 cm and varies between 5.5 and 6 b/s/Hz.

An extension of SOR is defined for the case of out-of-band relaying, when additional spectrum bands are available and in networks with buffer-aided relays. Moreover, the use of full-duplex (FD) relays is outlined, in view of the effect of loop-interference (LI) from the relay's output to its input and, also, the power reduction is presented. As networks with multiple relays suffer from increased coordination overhead, a reduced Channel State Information (CSI) policy is proposed.

Due to overlapping transmissions by the source and the relay which transmits to the destination, inter-relay interference arises. The efficient mitigation of inter-relay interference either through cancellation or avoidance, requires increased channel state information. Thus, in order to reduce the implementation complexity induced by centralized selection, distributed switch-and-stay combining is combined with buffer-aided successive opportunistic relaying. In this way, by applying a rate threshold we can avoid increased relay-pair switching and channel state information acquisition. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulations and comparisons with other state-of-the-art relay selection policies.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, we propose a buffer-aided successive opportunistic relaying scheme that aims to improve the average capacity of the network when inter-relay interference arises between relays that are selected for transmission and reception. In order to exploit the benefits of buffering at the relays, we propose a relay-pair selection policy that decouples the receiving relay at the previous time slot from being the transmitting relay at the next slot. Furthermore, we impose an interference cancellation threshold allowing the relay that is selected for reception, to decode and subtract the inter-relay interference. The proposed relaying scheme selects the relaying pair that maximizes the average capacity of the relay network. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via simulation and comparisons with other state-of-the-art half and full-duplex relay selection schemes, in terms of outage probability, average \u2026",

The proposed model utilizes the geometric characteristics of the environment, the angle of arrival and angle of departure of each one of the propagation paths, the antenna elements and their spacing. The results showed that the system capacity increases significantly if two or four elements are used at both terminal antennas instead of the basic SISO configuration. In order to accomplish major improvement in the data rates, a MIMO system at 60 GHz should operate within a range of 10 to 20 m in an indoor environment with the view of obtaining sufficient Signal to Noise Ratios.",

In this research effort, we briefly review the state of art in fairness mechanisms in multi-hop networks and we propose an algorithm that tries to differentiate the traffic among the connections in a wireless multi-hop ad-hoc sensor network, so that the fairness is enhanced. This is achieved by an adaptive scheme, which tries to assign a higher priority to the traffic connections that experience delay greatly larger than the average, so that their delay is reduced, and the fairness of the system is improved.",

The measurements were carried out using a commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) network operating with Time-Division Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) configuration. From the path loss analysis, not all of the examined models are appropriate to describe accurately the expected losses. The close-in, WINNER II, and 3GPP/ITU-R models present the best performance. On the other hand, the Extended Hata model is not accurate for the specific area since it over-predicts path loss. Finally, from the statistical analysis the shadow fading is approximated by the Lognormal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of 5.8 dB. An almost excellent fit is achieved regardless of the dissimilar propagation \u2026",

Thus, DHC is able to provide backhaul load balancing for the eNBs while offering high quality wireless connections and high data rates to the users. DHC exploits the feedback from the mobile devices and takes into account the backhaul load conditions in order to adjust the backhaul latency to tolerable levels and maintain optimal channel quality.

The kinetic model of the system is presented and a static feedback with dynamic precompensator controller involving time delays is proposed.

One of the major challenges related to this observation is the delivery of homecare and the reduction of healthcare cost without compromising the quality of services provided. Pervasive homecare systems provide information and mechanisms to alert when pathological situations are identified. The implementation of technological solutions for homecare applications minimizes the time to provide help in abnormal situations and improve quality of life in elderly and chronically ills. Pervasive homecare networks provide continuous medical monitoring, control of home appliances, medical data storage and processing and emergency situations awareness. Constant monitoring provides early detection of emergency conditions and assists in optimum scheduling of a wide range of healthcare services for people with various degrees of cognitive and physical disabilities. Researchers continuously explore technological solutions in order to provide homecare and healthcare services for the elderly, chronically ill and children. The amount of proposals reveal a rapidly growing scientific area of high impact on sensitive groups that significantly improve quality of life and prevent or deal with life threatening situations.
