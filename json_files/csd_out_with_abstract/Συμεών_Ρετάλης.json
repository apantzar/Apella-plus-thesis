In the field of e-learning, design patterns are frequently advocated as a powerful way of providing structured, teacher-friendly, textual representations of learning designs, or of expressing the design rationale underlying learning objects. The purpose of this chapter is to look at e-learning design patterns from a critical perspective. We provide a historical, multidisciplinary excursus of the notion of design patterns. We propose a taxonomy of e-learning design patterns, providing examples in the various categories. Finally, we discuss both the benefits of design patterns for e-learning professionals (particularly, novice ones) and their \u2026",

They also offer adaptive sequencing (navigation) over the learning content based on rules that stem from the user model requirements and the instructional strategies. EAHA are gaining the focus of the research community as a means of alleviating a number of user problems related to hypermedia. However, the difficulty and complexity of developing such applications and systems have been identified as possible reasons for the low diffusion of Adaptive Hypermedia in web-based education. Experience from traditional Software Engineering as well as Hypermedia Engineering suggests that a model-driven design approach is appropriate for developing applications where such requirements and constraints occur. This paper presents on a model-driven design process of EAHA. This \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Networked learning is much more ambitious than previous approaches of ICT-support in education. It is therefore more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the networked learning activities. Evaluation of learners\u2019 interactions in networked learning environments is a difficult, resource and expertise demanding task. Educators participating in online learning environments, have very little support by integrated tools to evaluate students\u2019 activities and identify learners\u2019 online browsing behavior and interactions. As a consequence, educators are in need for non-intrusive and automatic ways to get feedback from learners\u2019 progress in order to better follow their learning process and appraise the online course effectiveness. They also need specialized tools for authoring, delivering, gathering and analysing data for evaluating the learning effectiveness of networked learning courses.Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose a new set of services for the evaluator and lecturer so that he/she can easily evaluate the learners\u2019 progress and produce evaluation reports based on learners\u2019 behaviour within a Learning Management System. These services allow the evaluator to easily track down the learners\u2019 online behavior at specific milestones set up, gather feedback in an automatic way and present them in a comprehensive way. The innovation of the proposed set of services lies on the effort to adopt/adapt some of the web usage mining techniques combining them with the use of semantic description of networked learning tasks",

However, there is limited knowledge about exploiting the complete design potential of bodily interplay in learning games. We conducted an in-the-wild study with 8 children, with special educational needs, playing a language based educational motion-based touchless game. We collected children's interaction data (correctness and reaction time), and data regarding the different design elements (game settings) implemented in 90 game sessions. Our analysis shows that number of items on-screen, selection gestures, and time to select items, impact the effectiveness (correctness) and efficiency (reaction time) of the children. We highlight the value of interaction analytics and quantify the relationship between different game design elements and children? s efficiency and effectiveness.

This paper gives an overview of the various features that current learning design tools support and discusses the required ones that will make these tools more appealing to the teachers. Factors that discourage teachers from using these tools are the lack of both user friendly graphical notation and the non support of a layered approach to learning design. Thus, this paper proposes to build learning design tools following the concept of the \u201cseparation of concerns\u201d that stems from the principles of web engineering. A graphical, IMS-LD level A compliant learning design tool, called CADMOS, which supports the \u201cseparation of concerns\u201d concept in learning design, is being presented.",

Most of these devices come with\" Application Stores\", which users can browse and select applications to download from. These applications pose various interesting challenges to user interaction designers, because their interaction design process has many differences compared to other app paradigms, such as mobile apps and classical desktop apps. Some of these challenges come from the fact that the only method of input is by using touch interactions, due to the specific operating system ways of handling user input and how running apps can be shown to the user. In this paper, we propose five patterns for interaction design for Windows 8 applications in tablet devices. These patterns are accompanied by some thumbnails that can be found in the literature.",

Students undoubtedly need to overcome a lot of barriers during the instructional process of OOP such as to understand new concepts (eg object, class, attributes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism), to learn an OO programming language, etc [7]. Various approaches have been proposed for augmenting the learning effectiveness of OOP instructional practices such as the adoption of \u201cobjects-first\u201d strategy [8], the gradual explanation of concepts from simple to higher level ones [9], the use of guidelines like \u201cDon\u2019t start with a blank screen\u201d, and \u201cRead code\u201d[8] etc.",

However, this variety can make it difficult for researchers and teachers to assess the tool that is best suited to their objectives and contexts as learning designers. Several of the tools are presented elsewhere in this issue. In this article, the aforementioned tools are used as lenses to view the same learning design narrative - an inquiry-based learning lesson on healthy eating aimed at secondary-school students - from different perspectives, in a manner inspired by the plot structure of Kurosawa's film \"Rashomon\". In modelling the lesson on five tools, we uncovered similarities and differences in relation to the challenges posed by modelling a particular learning scenario, the ease of implementation of the computer-interpretable products' output by the tools and their different target audiences and pedagogical specialities. This comparative analysis thus illustrates some of the current underlying issues and challenges in the field of Learning Design.",

A CLFP defines the sequence of the tasks that the strategy dictates as well as other elements needed for the various tasks, such as the duration of a task, the use of a particular tool for a given task and so on. Designers often face the difficulty of mixing and matching strategies in order to create personalized scripts that are more appropriate to the learners' preferences, knowledge level, needs and the learning context in general. Designers need to make configurations of a \u201ctraditional\u201d CLFP in order to balance a variety of organizational, administrative, instructional and technological components.

On the other side, students are characterized by different learning styles: preferences or predispositions to behave in a particular way when engaged in a learning process. In the elearning area, adaptive educational hypermedia applications are designed in order to offer personalised learning experience based on the personal learning style. It has been proven that the good match between learning style and instructional design drives to effective learning. This paper proposes a systematic approach for designing leaning tasks for educational hypermedia applications that suit the individual learning style. In particular, we show how the design patterns approach can be used as a design model tool.",

We followed the principles of action research in order to explore students\u2019, teachers\u2019 and parents perception of 1:1 iPad approach in the classroom.

In special education the challenges are greater due to the need of individualized learning in 1:1 base, physical prompt, visual support and direct reinforcement. Nowadays, the internet services, like remote learning and teletherapy, could be an alternative and effective method of providing virtual intervention services using either well known video conferencing platforms, or more specialized ones. However, while such platforms hold great promise, there are few research studies that discuss the design decisions of the remote learning services and the most effective learning model that could be offered to children with Special Education Needs (SEN).

They also offer adaptive sequencing (navigation) over the learning content based on rules that stem from the user model requirements and the instructional strategies. EAHA are gaining the focus of the research community as a means of alleviating a number of user problems related to hypermedia. However, despite the growing interest of the community and the increasing number of available systems, the actual impact of these systems in e-learning remains low. The difficulty and complexity of developing such applications and systems have been identified as a possible reason for this low diffusion of Adaptive Hypermedia in web-based education. The development of EAHA (authoring process) is a complex task engaging people with different backgrounds: instructional designers, subject matter experts, content developers, multimedia developers, user interface experts, programmers, etc. Experience from traditional Software Engineering as well as Hypermedia Engineering suggests that a model-driven design approach is appropriate in developing applications where such requirements and constraints occur. This paper presents on a model-driven design process of EAHA. This process accords to the principles of hypermedia engineering and its innovation is the use of a formally specified object oriented design model.",

            "Abstract": "A great number of Learning Management Systems (LMSs), commercial or open source exists nowadays (eg WebCT, Blackboard, IBM LearningSpace, etc.) offering integrated services such as the creation and distribution of on-line learning material, the communication between stakeholders, the management of the instruction process etc., thus providing the basic software platform for supporting web-based learning in an easy-touse, and pedagogically flexible manner. This paper proposes a framework on the analysis of potentiality and on the evaluation of LMSs\u2019 admissibility. The most commonly used LMSs have been selected for the application of this specific framework. The aim of the evaluation is twofold; to search their usefulness and their quality in use.",

The proposed instructional method is based on Sternberg\u2019s model of problem solving within an authentic context. It consists of three main phases: observation, collaboration and semi-structured guidance. The ultimate learning objective is to augment the autonomous problem-solving skills of primary school children. In our study the Synergo tool was used, which is a synchronous computer supported collaborative learning tool, as well as the Moodle learning management system. The context which frames the method is authentic, very close to a students\u2019 realistic learning situation. The findings of this study advocate that students can increase their problem-solving skills in a relatively short period of time. At the same time, they can improve their \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a systematic pattern development cycle, whose most important aspects focus on reverse engineering of existing systems in order to elicit features that are cross-validated through the use of appropriate, authentic scenarios. However, an iterative pattern process is proposed that takes advantage of multiple data sources, thus emphasizing a holistic view of the teaching \u2013 learning processes. The proposed schema of pattern mining has been extensively validated for Asynchronous Network Supported Collaborative Learning (ANSCL) systems, as well as for other types of tools in a variety of scenarios, with promising results.",

These games, which offer natural user interaction modalities, seem to be very beneficial for this population because of the combination of physical activities with cognitive-training tasks. There is still an open research issue about how to integrate such games into schools and how to organize systematic evaluation studies for showing their added value. This paper presents the positive findings of a pilot research study in inclusive classroom settings that were carried out at two primary schools with 20 children who have special educational needs and who used the Kinems suite that contains movement-based educational games for such children.

            "Abstract": "The development of software systems is a complex process which requires a diverse set of skills and expertise. The Object Oriented programming paradigm has been proven to better organize the inherent complexity of software systems, than the traditional procedural paradigm. Hence, Object Oriented (OO) is becoming the dominant paradigm in the recent years. The software industry is placing increasing emphasis on newer, object-oriented programming languages and tools, such as Java. It is highly interested for software engineers capable to analyze and develop systems using the OO programming paradigm. The early exposure of students to object oriented programming has become increasingly important in both academia and industry. As an effect, after IEEE and ACM recommendations, the object oriented programming approach has established its place in the Computing Science (CS) Curricula of the Universities. Furthermore, a lot of research is being conducted with regards to the effective instructional methods for the Object Oriented design and programming. Such methods propose the utilization of educational tools for helping students overcome learning difficulties. The scope of this paper is to present some of the well known educational tools which can support the instructional process of Object Oriented design and programming. It also aims to show how one of the most widely known educational tool, called BlueJ, has been utilised and evaluated by students within an educational setting. Finally it discusses trends in the development of this tool (and other related ones) which could influence the teaching of Object Oriented design \u2026",

Therefore, it becomes apparent that since a successful instructor is one who achieves the best\" learning outcome\" from most of his/her students, then he/she should be able to cater for his/her students' different learning styles. When the instructor's role is played by an educational hypermedia system, then its capabilities should be such so as to deal with different learning styles-something that can be regarded as primarily a design issue.

            "Abstract": "The evaluation of the economic contribution of training programs of first generation adult immigrants is a field of importance against social exclusion and in favor of economic and social integration. The aim of this paper is to present some preliminary findings on the impact of language training programs on adult immigrant' income in Greece. Data were collected from the population of foreigners who attended a Greek language course organized by the Ministry of Education General Secretariat for Lifelong Learning. Overall, the results indicate that change in income was more noticeable for female immigrants, as compared to their male counterparts, two years after the completion of the training program. We conclude by highlighting the importance of such initiatives and offer further directions for future research.",

The authors' aim is to investigate whether a game design exploiting the less used combination of complex storytelling, endogenous cooperation, and competition has the potential to sufficiently convey cultural content. More specifically, through four game interventions, it was investigated how a story-driven board game functions with teenage and adult users alike. A mixed research methodology was followed in all game sessions and data were collected through observation, semi-structured group interviews, and short questionnaires. Findings confirmed the playability of the suggested design and the potential to amuse players while providing learning gains and engagement with cultural content.

Instructional systems, based on these networked technologies, have been constructed to solve instructional problems. There is evidence that these systems efficiently support the instructional process. Instructional developers should follow effective and quality driven development methodologies, which are specifically developed to support the development of network-based instructional systems. This article presents a methodology, CADMOS, which accords to the principles of the third and partially the fourth generation of Instructional Systems Development (ISD). The main innovation of CADMOS is its advocacy on splitting an instructional system into four sub-systems: human, webware, other learning resources, and specific infrastructure sub-systems.",

This paper provides a unifying view of several representative proposals in order to situate and introduce the types of patterns that can be used for generating collaboration scripts that are suitable of being computationally represented and interpreted by learning management systems (LMSs). The paper also presents a hierarchical structure that relates these patterns according to their focus and granularity. The structure shows how the different types of patterns are complementary and should be considered in the process of creating a script. In addition to authoring tools and LMSs, there are other types of tools in which the application of patterns may be useful. This paper points out these tools locating them along the \"life cycle\" of the scripts",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, teachers in school practice design and apply complex interactive learning scenarios according to standardised collaborative learning strategies such as jigsaw, TPS, etc. There is a well justified and an immediate need to help teachers to easily assess student\u2019s performance. The assessment process in such complex educational scenarios is not a trivial issue since teachers have to combine data gathered during student\u2019s individual performance along with the data which has been gathered throughout group collaboration-activities. Effective means of facilitating the assessment task is the use of rubrics as well as the interaction analysis indicators. This paper has proposed the idea of enriching the traditional assessment rubrics with indicators that measure the students\u2019 performance in computer supported synchronous or asynchronous collaborative activities. Thus in this paper we propose a new \u2026",

From this perspective, the exploration of learning environments that promote bodily activity in relation to cognitive tasks are gaining the attention of the research community in the recent days. One such case is the use of multimodal, motion-based games mediated by sensors like a Kinect camera to enable learning through active and embodied interaction with learning content. This paper presents findings from an empirical investigation of using embodied touchless interactive games to enhance motor performance for children with learning disabilities and motor impairments.

This paper aims to fill this void, which is the absence of disciplined design, by recording the expertise of existing Adaptive Web-based Educational Systems in the form of design patterns. We present a categorization of the patterns according to an established paradigm in Adaptive Hypermedia and we provide three exemplary patterns.",

LAe-R is based on the concept of the \u201cenriched rubrics\u201d, which is becoming a popular assessment technique in education. This technique is a blend of marking criteria and grading levels of a \u201cclassic/traditional\u201d rubric and performance indicators stemmed from analysis of learners\u2019 interaction and learning behavior in a LMS based e-learning environment.

New and affordable educational technologies (e.g., motion-based technologies, AR, VR) enable researchers and practitioners to include more gestures and body movements into their learning designs. Yet, while technology-enhanced embodied learning shows positive results during controlled trials in laboratory settings or one-to-one interventions in special classrooms or units, findings are dissimilar when relevant implementations are conducted in mainstream school classrooms. This paper presents the first stage of a design-based research study aiming at implementing an orchestration strategy for technology-enhanced embodied learning, guided by an already published conceptual framework on classroom orchestration. With this study we aim to spark the dialog on classroom orchestration strategies for the successful enactment of technology-enhanced embodied learning in the classroom, highlighting the essential need to consider learning design as it is not a simple process to shift laboratory success to real world learning.",

A lot of work has been done in the field of the instructional designing rather than on hypermedia designing of such applications.

Indeed, traditional on-the-job training activities are of great educational value and complement uniquely any classroom-based learning activity. However, it has been observed that several obstacles arise when integrating on-the-job training with traditional learning and that new network-based tools can be used to improve the situation. Following this concept, in this paper we introduce a network-assisted educational structure for business simulation activities which can be considered as an alternative or a complement to on-the-job training activities in technical professional education. Business Simulation Activities are based on the execution of business scenarios in a controlled educational environment with support by network tools. A simulation of the real world business \u2026",

Many studies advocate the integration of these environments in the daily teaching practice of various subjects. This requires innovative design in order create the appropriate affective/ pedagogical conditions as well as the development and use of well-structured activities in order to achieve effective collaborative learning. This paper presents an exploratory study in which collaborative learning strategies and cognitive apprenticeship models act as the pedagogical framework to facilitate learning and collaboration. The context is the teaching of mathematics in primary education via a 3D virtual environment. Specifically, we focus on evaluating students\u2019 engagement (behavioral, affective and cognitive) in the collaborative learning process as they learn fractional concepts in a meaningful way.

The technological nature and complexity of the innovations require team work, among specialists from different disciplines. Often these teams work in a distributed fashion, across boundaries of time and place. Therefore, they need electronic \u2018spaces\u2019 that support (\u2018afford\u2019) their creative collaboration. Co-creativity support is not only a matter of making appropriate groupware spaces available but also of providing concurrent support in all these dimensions. These considerations inspired the development of the idSpace platform. idSpace is a collaboration platform integrating a variety of creativity tools with pedagogy-based guidance. It aims to optimise both the use of creativity techniques themselves and of the supporting processes of team collaboration and knowledge creation \u2026",

The Kinect camera detects user's body movements and gestures, which means that the full body becomes the controller. Lately, there is a tremendous interest in developing Kinect educational games. In this paper, we present the innovative Kinems learning games which have been developed for helping children with learning disabilities such as autism, dyspraxia and ADHD improve their skills. The paper contains the outcomes of a recent study, which was to investigate and measure the Kinems learning effectiveness. The research hypotheses were examined through an educational intervention that lasted about one month and was implemented with 11 children with ADHD of 4-8 years old.

Creativity process is an intense collaborative process of generating and exploring ideas meant to contribute to innovative solution of particular problems. During this process, team members go through cycles of divergence, in which new ideas are generated and explored, and convergence, in which new ideas are valued and detailed. Innovators need appropriate methods and supportive tools to generate ideas, reuse them, take them apart, criticise them, or even reject them. Empowering team members to personalise their creativity process in a supportive computer-based collaborative environment of peer assistance, reflection and critique and in interaction with experts and domain specialists can lead also to effective informal learning activities.Networked technologies \u2026",

Within these games, children's digital persona (ie, avatar), enables them to efficiently communicate their motion-based interactivity. However, the role of children's Avatar Self-Representation (ASR) in educational MBTG is rather under-explored. We present an in-situ within subjects study where 46 children, aged 8--12, played three MBTG with different ASRs. Each avatar had varying visual similarity and movement congruity (synchronisation of movement in digital and physical spaces) to the child. We automatically and continuously monitored children's experiences using sensing technology (eye-trackers, facial video, wristband data, and Kinect skeleton data). This allowed us to understand how children experience the different ASRs, by providing insights into their affective and \u2026",

DEPTH is a method for performing expert-based scenario driven heuristic usability evaluation of e-sites. DEPTH focuses on the functionality of e-sites and emphasizes on usability characteristics within their context. This can be done not only by examining the availability of functionality of an e-site but also the usability performance of the supported functionality according to specific context related usage scenarios. Scenario driven expert based usability evaluation/inspection is resource demanding. Moreover, it is not easy to find usability experts for specific types/genres of e-sites. Thus, the main motivational idea for proposing DEPTH have been: i) to minimize the preparatory phase of a usability evaluation process by re-using inspection scenarios and ii) to assist a novice usability evaluator (one who is not necessarily familiar with the genre of the e-site) by showing best design practices. Thus, DEPTH proposes the (re) use of expert\u2019s knowledge captured in design patterns. This paper briefly describes the DEPTH method and presents findings from applying it to a usability evaluation study of e-travel sites.",

This paper proposes a conceptual framework for interaction analysis which is accompanied by a set of evaluation techniques such as descriptive statistics, log file analysis and social network analysis. Our main goal is the in-depth understanding of the nature of learners' interactions within NSCL environments in order to help teachers get a holistic picture of the learning process. We applied the proposed framework in a pilot study where primary school children attended a NSCL course on Mathematics in order to augment their self-regulative problem-solving skills.

The consequence is that the hypermedia applications being developed are of poor functionality and lack qualities such as modifiability, usability and maintainability. Especially the design phase is one of the phases that lack sufficient support from methods and CASE tools.

            "Abstract": "In this paper a synchronous computer supported collaborative learning tool called SyCo is presented. It was designed to facilitate students in performing tasks according to the principles of various collaborative learning strategies, such as Jigsaw and eARMA. SyCo innovates because during the collaborative learning process it allows each student to have a private space to think and draw their ideas before presenting them to their peer-students in the public space. Thus, within SyCo peers can move into and out of a shared space, work privately, copy and paste parts of their own work that had been sketched in their private space in order to share them with others.",

            "Abstract": "The management of the infrastructure and content of the World Wide Web is a growing problem for the development of web-based educational applications (WbEA) and is hidden beneath the tremendous benefits of the web. Moreover, such systems undergo more frequent and quite extensive changes in their development and operational period because the client's perception (either the learner, the teacher or institutional organisation) of the complete end product is a \"moving target\". So, there is a need for a disciplined approach to managing the evolution of web-based educational applications. Such a disciplined approach as applied throughout the software engineering process is called software configuration management (SCM). This paper begins a discussion of how the development of web-based educational applications could benefit from SCM techniques and tools and proposes a model for the management \u2026",

Focusing on this challenge, a new assessment tool, called Learning Analytics Enriched Rubric (LAe-R) is presented in this paper. LAe-R is based on the concept of assessment rubrics which is a very popular assessment technique in education. LAe-R contains\" enriched\" criteria and grading levels that are associated to data extracted from the analysis of learners' interaction and learning behavior in an e-learning environment. LAe-R has been developed as a plug-in for the Moodle learning management system. Via an example, we will show how LAe-R can be used by teachers and students.",

Storytelling is used in games regarding cultural places, but it often takes a simple form. Thus, the authors\u2019 aim is to investigate the possibility to communicate cultural content through a narrative-based game that can function with multiple narratives. Another core element of our design is the less exploited in serious games combination of endogenous cooperation and competition. The social dimension of our design was expressed through features of Classroom Multiplayer Presential Games (CMPGs), in respect of using a one-to-many game environment projected on a single screen, while enhancing collaborative work in small teams. After providing an overview of the game, we briefly explain how this was implemented with the use of Twine, a free authoring tool for the creation of interactive stories and text-based games \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Video summarization is a challenging problem in part because knowing which part of a video is important requires prior knowledge about its main topic. We present TVSum, an unsupervised video summarization framework that uses title-based image search results to find visually important shots. We observe that a video title is often carefully chosen to be maximally descriptive of its main topic, and hence images related to the title can serve as a proxy for important visual concepts of the main topic. However, because titles are free-formed, unconstrained, and often written ambiguously, images searched using the title can contain noise (images irrelevant to video content) and variance (images of different topics). To deal with this challenge, we developed a novel co-archetypal analysis technique that learns canonical visual concepts shared between video and images, but not in either alone, by finding a joint-factorial \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between usability and user satisfaction in Web Museums. Web museums are websites that have specific goals to meet in terms of influencing their visitors\u2019 experiences. A user experience study was conducted with 28 graduate students, in which in addition to the students\u2019 opinions on the web museum\u2019s characteristics, it was attempted to capture the satisfaction and dissatisfaction levels that resulted from visiting those web museums. These results were analyzed in order to identify correlations between users\u2019 perceptions of web museum features and their subsequent (dis) satisfaction levels. It was concluded that most users\u2019 emotions of (dis) satisfaction were influenced by their perceptions of colours, image quality and information organization. Furthermore, we discovered that the users\u2019 overall opinion of the web museum was influenced by both aesthetic design and the features/functions offered. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of this work and provides suggestions for future research directions.",

            "Abstract": "A productive and independent learner tends to be one of the first priorities of a contemporary educational system almost all over the world. It is recognised that the capability of self-regulation exists in all human beings and this enables us to survive, evolve and improve ourselves. Researchers have indicated that self-regulation can be taught, but the period of the attainment is often long. However, a start must be made and the earlier the better. While problem solving is placed in the heart of mathematics (NCTM, 2000), it is considered to contribute to the whole thinking processes. Nevertheless, differences in mathematical problem solving ability begin to appear in Grade 1 and increase gradually throughout the formal years of schooling. These differences have already been recorded and are known as \u2018novice\u2019compared to \u2018expert\u2019differences. However, there is a period of unknown duration which raises some questions in which novices are transformed into experts. Students who pass through this period in mathematics are called \u2018medium\u2019solvers by their teacher. The present pilot study examines this period in three different environments in an effort to describe under what conditions the transformation is achieved more effectively. Additionally, the study explores the main characteristics of this category of students.",

            "Abstract": "The design of web-based instructional systems is largely conducted on an intuitive, ad hoc basis, thus resulting in inefficient systems that do not capitalise on the strengths of networked technologies. Among these strengths, one could mention: multiple media delivery formats, synchronous and asynchronous communication and relaxation of constraints in place and time of instructional delivery. Moreover, the web-based instructional systems are inherited the growing problem hidden beneath the tremendous benefits of the World Wide Web (WWW) which is the management of the web\u2019s infrastructure and its content. Change is inevitable when computer software is built, but the web-based systems undergo changes more often and quite extensively, in their development and operational period. Additionally, a web-based instructional system must be developed through an evolution rather than a revolution, meaning that it is not released in one \u201cbig bang\u201d at the end of the project. This is because the client\u2019s perception (either learner\u2019s or teacher\u2019s or institutional organisation\u2019s) of the complete end product is a \u201cmoving target\u201d. So, there is a need for a disciplined approach to managing the evolution of such systems. Such a disciplined approach that is applied throughout the software engineering process is called software configuration management (SCM). This paper begins a discussion of how the development of web-based instructional systems could benefit from SCM techniques and tools in order to achieve better learning effectiveness as well as development efficiency.",

            "Abstract": "During the last few years, there has been a growing interest in students getting engaged in digital game-making activities so as to enhance their thinking skills. The findings of studies that have examined the impact of such initiatives are quite positive, especially concerning the promotion of 21st century skills; however, many students seem to face difficulties in getting a deeper understanding of the game development life cycle. Additionally, students often have difficulties in meaningfully reusing and applying the concepts from various subjects, mainly mathematics and physics, into their game-making tasks or in understanding advanced programming commands while creating their games. The present study presents an innovative game-making teaching approach that suggests a series of steps for the systematic design and rapid development of motion-based touchless games, ie, games that are based on natural user interaction technologies, like the Microsoft Kinect camera. Findings from evaluation studies in two (2) secondary schools indicate that this approach can increase student motivation, strengthen their computational thinking, enhance their understanding of geometric principles and improve their social skills.

            "Abstract": "Adaptive Web-based Educational Systems represent an emerging technology that provides a unique advantage over traditional Web-based Educational Systems; that is the ability to adapt to the user's needs, goals, preferences etc. Adaptive Web-based Educational Systems are increasingly becoming part of the mainstream education, yet there does not exist a disciplined way of designing them-most of the development is ad-hoc. This paper aims to fill this void, which is the absence of disciplined design, by recording the expertise of existing Adaptive Web-based Educational Systems in the form of design patterns. We present a categorization of the patterns according to an established paradigm in Adaptive Hypermedia, we examine the patterns in one of these categories and provide an exemplary pattern.",

It is quite easy for teachers (even novice learning designers) to create a learning script by applying a flow design pattern. However, they often need to mix and match learning strategies in order to create customized learning scripts that are more appropriate to the learners\u2019 preferences and the learning context in general. This task is even more challenging when such adaptations need to be made on-the-fly, i.e. during the learning process and in response to the learner\u2019 online behavior.

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a method for performing expert-based scenariodriven usability evaluation of personalisable and configurable web-based systems, based on an innovative method called DEPTH (DEsign PaTterns & Heuristics criteria). DEPTH focuses on the specificities of web-based system functionality, emphasises usability issues within the specific context of their use (eg e-learning, e-commerce, etc) and adopts the main principles of the scenario-based evaluation techniques. The main idea behind DEPTH is to minimize the preparatory phase of a usability evaluation process, and allow a novice usability expert (ie one who is not necessarily familiar with the specific genre/type of the web-based system under evaluation) to perform the usability evaluation study effectively. Towards this goal, we (re) use expert\u2019s design knowledge captured in design patterns for the specific genre of the system under evaluation. Such use of design patterns, which are also associated with scenarios for expert\u2019s inspection, is one of the innovative aspects of our method. In this paper we will describe an example of DEPTH\u2019s application for evaluating adaptive web-based systems, thus clarifying the main points of the method.",

            "Abstract": "Over the last years the Web has been increasingly used as a platform for supporting the delivery of flexible and interactive hypermedia applications. However, it is admitted that the dominant approach is ad hoc development. Developers should be educated in the use of effective processes, process models, methods, tools and documentation guidelines. In few words, they should be trained on the Web Engineering discipline. The number of courses which deal with this discipline is augmenting. National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece offers such a course with a main pedagogical aim to make students well aware of the advantages when following systematic hypermedia development approaches contrary to ad hoc practices. NTUA\u2019s approach was to use open learning methods based on a Web-based instructional system. NTUA team developed the instructional system in a systematic way having challenged itself that such way can lead to pedagogically effective instructional delivery and to learning material fo high quality. The evaluation results showed that the challenge was met. This paper presents the NTUA\u2019s instructional approach about the web engineering discipline and the qualitative evaluation results.",

They clearly state that the topic of learning objects is rather new and in an experimental phase. There is an agreement about the attributes of a learning object (reusability, accessibility, interoperability-portability, duration) within the learning technology community. However, stakeholders see the usefulness of learning objects from different optical angles: on the one hand, the training sector tends to be engaged in reuse and just-in-time/on-demand content aggregation in order to augment their market share; on the other hand universities and the learning sector in general, consider the reuse and repurposing of learning material as a big opportunity to save resources as well as to offer new (more enhanced) learning experiences.",

            "Abstract": "Solving problems is considered as a very important learning activity in formal educational settings concerning all grades of education from primary to tertiary education. Students\u2019 engagement in problem solving activities helps them to acquire not only knowledge and skills on a subject domain but also useful attitudes such as thinking, flexibility, creativity, and productivity which are very important to real life. As a result numerous problem solving models and creativity techniques, mostly collaborative ones, have been proposed for aiding students solve problems. These models specify the steps of a systematic process of solution-building for a given problem description. One main open research question is \u201chow can students learn how to apply a problem solving model\u201d? Research has demonstrated the potential of collaborative learning sessions for enhancing young children's cognitive development and learning. The scope of this paper is to show how collaborative learning flow patterns (CLFP) can help teachers to design effective interactive learning scenarios based on well defined strategies such as Jigsaw, TPS and others that can help students learn apply problem solving models and at the same time acquire higher-order thinking skills. It is argued that CLFPs are a designer friendly way to portray the coordination and the sequencing of tasks during the learning process as well as the rationale behind them. We will present a CLFP of a collaborative problem solving strategy called e-ARMA in an attempt to explain the added value of the use of CLFPs for designing learning sessions that foster the acquisition of creative problem solving skills.",

            "Abstract": "Networked learning is much more ambitious than previous approaches of using technology in education. It is, therefore, more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the networked learning activities. Evaluation of learners\u2019 interactions in networked learning environments is a resource and expertise demanding task. Educators participating in networked learning communities, have very little support by integrated tools to evaluate students\u2019 learning activities flow and identify learners\u2019 online browsing behaviour and interactions. As a consequence, educators are in need for non-intrusive and automatic ways to become informed about learners\u2019 progress in order to better follow their learning process and appraise the online course effectiveness. They also need specialized tools for gathering and analysing data for evaluating the learning effectiveness of networked learning instructional models. The aim of this paper is to present a conceptual framework and an innovative tool, called AnalyticsTool, which is based on this framework, that allow teacher and evaluator to easily track the learners\u2019 online behaviour, make judgements about learners\u2019 activity flow and have a better insight about the knowledge constructed and skills acquired in a networked learning environment. The innovation of the proposed tool is that interoperates with the Moodle learning management system and that it guides the educator perform the interaction analysis of collaborative learning scenarios that have been designed following specific learning strategies such as TPS, Jigsaw, Pyramid, etc.",

These systems currently operate at a limited scale but their use is vastly increasing, especially in the context of multi-faceted educational organizations, such as virtual universities. This paper presents some of these systems that are extensively used in the e-learning market. It then moves on to provide an overview of the ideal functionality that e-Learning Resource Brokers should provide.

            "Abstract": "\u201cA design pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice\"(Alexander et al., 1977). In the field of e-learning, design patterns are frequently advocated as a powerful way of providing structured, teacher-friendly, textual representations of learning designs, or of expressing the design rationale underlying learning objects. The purpose of this chapter is to look at e-learning design patterns from a critical perspective. We provide a historical, multidisciplinary excursus of the notion of design patterns. We propose a taxonomy of e-learning design patterns, providing examples in the various categories. Finally, we discuss both the benefits of design patterns for e-learning professionals (particularly, novice ones) and their drawbacks, and investigate how such pros and cons may affect the role of patterns for learning designs.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a tool that supports a scenario based expert evaluation method called DEPTH (usability evaluation method based on DEsign PaTterns & Heuristics criteria). DEPTH is a method for performing scenario-based heuristic usability evaluation of e-systems. DEPTH focuses on the functionality of e-systems and emphasizes on usability characteristics within their context. This can be done not only by examining not only the availability of a functionality within an e-system but also the usability performance of the supported functionality according to a specific context of use. The main underlying ideas of DEPTH are: i) to minimize the preparatory phase of a usability evaluation process and ii) to assist a novice usability expert (one who is not necessarily familiar with the genre of the e-system). Thus, we (re)use expert\u2019s knowledge captured in design patterns and structured as design pattern \u2026",

One such effort is the establishment of virtual universities. The term \u201cvirtual university\u201d has been widely used with various meanings. In this paper we aim to define this term as accurately as possible. Moreover, we intend to present the requirements and the challenges that led to their establishments as well as to make comments about the way they operate without making negative criticism but with the will of posing open questions to encourage a dialogue among researchers, educational managers and decision makers.",

            "Abstract": "Air quality information portals (AQIP) serve the need to communicate environmental information, taking into account human perception concerning (a) the content and (b) the communication channel employed. The design of such portals has not been extensively studied, and it is usually undertaken on the basis of arbitrary,\u201ccommon sense\u201d assumptions. Nevertheless, a first look in some of the existing ones, suggests that they offer information services with a high degree of similarity, in spite of their differences in architecture, technical specifications and software resources used. It is of course evident that some design decisions about the same or similar services are much better than others. Thus, there is a need for defining, developing and disseminating good design practices about air quality information portals, in order to increase the effectiveness of human-computer interaction. One way of achieving this goal is by studying design patterns for environmental portals. In the present paper, we examine the main characteristics of AQIP and we study their basic design patterns, in order o come up with a list of suggested AQIP evaluation criteria and usability best practices.",

In particular, it explores the extent to which student engagement - behavioral, affective and cognitive - is fostered by such tools in order to enhance collaborative learning.For the study we used a purpose-created 3D virtual environment and a macro-script incorporating learning tasks related to basic fractions. The study itself took place during four teaching sessions in a primary school classroom. The data collected and analyzed included chat logs, classroom observation notes and the results of pre- and post-tests.The findings indicate that the 3D virtual environment actively engages the students\u2019 interest and leads to richer interaction between them. This in turn results in a higher level of student engagement in the collaborative learning process.We believe that 3D virtual environments provide novel \u2026",

Thus, the goals of a \u201cgood instructor\u201d should be both to adapt, at some degree and at least part of the time, his or her instructional approach according to students\u2019 learning preferences, and to help students build their skill in their preferred and less preferred learning modes.

In several countries, the use of e-learning has now begun to noticeably contribute to economic growth. In Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean Sea located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, many large-scale e-learning initiatives are currently being undertaken by both public and private organizations, establishing the country as a center for education in the region.Between the 1960s and 1990s, educational technology efforts in Cyprus schools were limited to the use of traditional audiovisual equipment and a few educational radio and television programs produced by the government. In recent years, however, considerable efforts have been devoted to promoting lifelong learning and integrating information and commu-",

Following guidelines from a script (based on a CSCL strategy), they must ultimately assess their students\u2019 performance during their engagement in various learning activities; however, content and process assessments differ from script to script. Thus, a teacher faces a serious problem during content and process assessment. Here, the authors present a holistic framework for performance assessment and specify indexes for it. The authors aim to facilitate the teacher/evaluator\u2019s work by equipping him or her with easy-to-apply tools and techniques for in-depth analysis of interactions. Finally, they describe our application of the proposed framework in an exploratory case study of a problem-solving activity in which a complex collaborative strategy is applied.",

It seems that design patterns are emerging as a valuable conceptual design tool for experienced TEL practitioners and novice designers. Design patterns can help because of their empirical foundations, their inclusive or democratic nature, the way they offer action-oriented, evidence-based advice, the scope they leave for creativity and their emphasis on the reusability of good design practices.

            "Abstract": "CADMOS is a graphical learning design (LD) authoring tool that helps a teacher design a unit of learning in two layers: (i) the conceptual layer, which seems like a concept map and contains the learning activities with their associated learning resources and (ii) the flow layer, which contains the orchestration of these activities. One of CADMOS\u2019 main innovative features is that it can bridge the gap between the design of a unit of learning and its enactment into Moodle. This paper presents how one can create a LD using CADMOS and deploy it into Moodle. Also, the paper shows the findings from a case study which was organized in order to evaluate the usability of the tool, its pedagogical flexibility and the usefulness of its innovative feature of deploying a LD into Moodle. CADMOS seems to be an easy-to-use tool, which offers guidance and flexibility during the design process.",

The way it can be integrated in the classroom and the curriculum is related to the vision of every reform that aims at improving education. Most of the existing 3d virtual worlds do not combine learning benefits, development of advanced learning and communicative skills, as well as substantial involvement of both students and teachers in the learning process. At first, the theoretical background of the structure and organisation of our world is given. Then, a description is given of the general characteristics of Active Worlds software that was used, along with a brief description of the structure and characteristics of the 3d virtual environment that is being constructed to support the teaching of Mathematics in primary schools. The expected outcomes and proposals for future utilization follow.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents the first very positive findings from an empirical study about the effectiveness of the use of a Kinect learning game for children with gross motor skills problems and motor impairments. This game follows the principles of a newly presented approach, called Kinems, which advocates that special educators and therapists should use learning games that via embodied touchless interaction\u2013thanks to the Microsoft Kinect camera-children with dyspraxia and other related disorders such as autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Attention Deficit Disorder, can improve related skills. Several Kinems games have been proposed (http://www. kinems. com). These games are innovative and are played with hand and body gestures. Kinems suggests that games should be highly configurable so that a teacher can modify the settings (eg difficult level, time settings, etc.) for the individual needs of each child. Also, a teacher should have access to kinetic and learning analytics of the child\u2019s interaction progress and achievements should be safely stored and vividly presented.",

            "Abstract": "Scenario based inspection methods are currently widely used for evaluating the usability of web-based information systems (e-systems). However, it is neither easy nor cheap to find usability experts who possess the competencies for performing a usability inspection while at the same time have deep knowledge of the context for which each e-system has been developed. Moreover, the effectiveness of these methods depends on the quality of the inspection scenarios. These issues can be tackled by finding potential users of the e-systems under inspection who have basic knowledge about human-computer interaction and adequately support them to execute the appropriate scenarios. Towards this goal, a new usability evaluation method called DEPTH along with a web based tool that supports its application, have been created. This chapter describes DEPTH\u2019s underlining philosophy which is the re-use of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Learning Management Systems are sophisticated web-based applications that are being engineered today in increasing numbers by numerous institutions and companies that want to get involved in e-learning either for providing services to third parties, or for educating and training their own people. Even though the construction of such systems has been taking place for many years, they are still designed and developed from scratch. The reason is that experience from previous Learning Management Systems, is not codified or documented, resulting in forcing the development teams to \u2018re-invent the wheel\u2019. This paper presents an approach of recording design experience in the form of design patterns for Learning Management Systems and aims at developing a pattern language for these systems. The proposed design patterns are semantically organized and categorized, and form the basic core of a pattern language for Learning Management Systems.",
