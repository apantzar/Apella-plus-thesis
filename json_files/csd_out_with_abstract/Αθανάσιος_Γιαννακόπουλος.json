            "Abstract": "In recent years functionally-graded composites have been proposed to develop strong surfaces that can withstand high contact and frictional forces. The present work presents a new graded composite that can be used for the development of surfaces with excellent strength properties. The composite is inspired by the human teeth, which nature builds as a hard and tough functionally-graded composite. The outer surface of teeth is of enamel, composed of prismatic hydroxyapatite crystallites, whereas the inner part of teeth is of dentine, composed collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite. Enamel is hard, brittle, and wear resistant, while dentine is softer and flexible. The dentine-enamel junction is formed as a region at which enamel mixes with dentine in a continuous way. The nanomechanical properties of the transition zone have been recently revealed. Of particular interest in this investigation is the variation in the elastic \u2026",

The gradient responses have been found considerably tougher as compared to the classical theory predictions and the observed deviation increases with increasing values of the non-dimensional parameter g/L (microstructural length over structural length). Based on the analytical solution of the strain energy release rate for the three-point bending case, a new, simple and universal, strain gradient elasticity, brittle fracture criterion and a new, size adjusted fatigue crack growth law have been established. Finally, the analytical predictions of the current modeling compare well with previous experimental data, based on three-point bending tests on single-edge notched concrete beams.",

            "Abstract": "The anti-plane dynamic flexoelectric problem is stated as a dielectric solid that incorporates gradients of electric polarization and flexoelectricity due to strain gradients. It is shown that the coupling of the mechanical with the electrical problem can be condensed in a single mechanical problem that falls within the area of dynamic couple stress elasticity. Moreover, static and steady state dynamic anti-plane problems of flexoelectric or couple stress elastic materials can be modeled as anisotropic plates with a non-equal biaxial pre-stress. This analogy is materialized in a finite element code. Screw dislocations play prominent role in crystal growth, plasticity, development of thin epitaxial films, micro-components and opto-mechanical devices and are important for our modern understanding of seismology. In general, screw dislocations are treated in the context of anti-plane elasticity. In this work we solve the steady-state \u2026",

The current (quasistatic charge increment) induced in the indentor due to the polarised layer on the contact surface increases with load as the contact area increases. Excellent agreement was found between the measured currents as a function of load with those predicted using an analytical model. The current increases with increasing indentor diameter as expected. Further, the scatter in data is significantly reduced as the indentor diameter increases. The measured current for a given load increases as the volume fraction of PZT fibers in the composite increases and is larger for composites containing PZT-5H fibers as compared to those containing PZT-4 fibers.

The proposed methodology is based on general results obtained from the analysis of pipe connections, a topic that has been investigated in recent years in the field of offshore structural engineering. A key aspect for implementing the stress\u2013concentration\u2013factor approach is the recognition that the axial load due to pressure and flow dynamics exerted along the graft axis controls the \u201chot spots\u201d on the juncture line, which in turn affects the mechanical response of the sutures.

Analytical expressions for the different critical temperatures at which distinct transitions occur in thermally induced deformation are presented and are correlated with the three regimes of interface fracture; elastic, partially plastic and fully plastic. Furthermore, a large-scale contact model, which predicts the shielding effect of contact in the wake of an interface crack, is also presented and the attendant reduction in the energy release rate is estimated.

However, the majority of these works is based on classical elasticity theory, according to which the rigidity of the cable is neglected. The present work re-examines in detail the behavior of steel cables under in-plane loading, taking into account the effect of the material microstructure on the overall stiffness, on the basis of the well-established simplified gradient elasticity theory. Accounting for two-dimensional deformations the generalized equilibrium equations under dipolar action are assessed and the corresponding boundary value problem is solved. Numerical results obtained for a characteristic cable segment indicate a much stiffer behavior than the one predicted by classical elasticity theory. This phenomenon is observed in the rod or cable-actuated braking \u2026",

            "Abstract": "It is well known that instrumented indentation tests are useful tools in probing mechanical properties of materials such as metals and ceramics. Instrumented indentation of hyperelastic materials such as rubbers, bio-materials, tissues etc. has not been examined in depth, especially the inverse problem of material characterization from instrumented indentation response. The difficulty of the inverse problem for such materials is that the unknown property is a function, the elastic energy density function. There are several such functions and each function is often characterized by more than one parameter. If the maximum indentation depth is low, we have shown that instrumented indentation of initially unstretched hyperelastic materials can only resolve a combination of the material parameters. If the maximum indentation depth is high, the indentation can provide independent material properties, however not in a unique way. Moreover, high indentation loads could lead to surface puncturing and so blur the test results. In this work, we show that we can use spherical indentation of a substrate at different but known prestretch levels to obtain the involved material properties of the energy density function. The present methodology can also incorporate a limit energy failure criterion and instrumented indentation can incorporate this behavior which we may call indentation strength.",

Our model is a two dimensional composite made of circular hard inclusions randomly dispersed in a soft matrix. Both inclusions and matrix are described by isotropic linear elastic constitutive laws. The composite, however, is described by an isotropic gradient elastic law. The elastic modulus and the Poisson\u2019s ratio are given by the exact classic analysis of Christensen. The in-plane microstructural length is estimated by energy optimization, based on solutions of the gradient elastic hollow cylinder. It was shown that the microstructural length decreases with the composition of the particles, taking high values at low particle composition. Naturally, the microstructural length is proportional to the particle diameter and increases with the stiffness of the particles. It was shown that there can be no microstructural \u2026",

In this context, little in-depth work has been done for soft bio-materials like biofilms, tissues, gels, cells, etc. Such materials show large elastic strains when subjected to relatively fast loading (excluding viscoelastic phenomena). The present work focuses on the adhesive contact of such materials. Flat punches of circular imprint are used and are subjected to pullout normal forces or bending moments. The materials are modeled as hyperelastic (fast-testing conditions), using the Mooney\u2013Rivlin (M\u2013R) strain energy density function. We examine both incompressibility and compressibility issues. The contact problem of half-space materials interacting with rigid indenters is solved explicitly for moderate deformations and is compared with finite element results. Experiments are \u2026",

Patch angioplasty is the pertinent technique mostly preferred by vascular surgeons. It entails an arteriotomy followed by closure with a textile, polymer or biological tissue patch. We propose a novel indentation methodology as a technique for mechanically characterizing biological patches used in carotid artery repair. The proposed methodology is a simple, yet accurate one, requiring only one initial experimental measurement to support the relevant calculations. Bovine pericardium patches are indented herein. Results, including material properties, are then obtained analytically. The experimental results indicate that indentation is a reliable method to assess the elastic properties of bovine patches.

We performed finite element indentation analysis for three types of material models: Mohr-Coulomb (associative), Drucker Prager (associative and non-associative), and foam-type. The material models assumed isotropic elasticity (with low elastic strains) and no strain-hardening effects. We compared our analytical results with our experimental results using material data from the literature. We found that different materials can be best described by either the Mohr-Coulomb or Drucker-Prager models.

A practical example of double forces is worked out, where the double forces appear due to the shearing of the horizontal flange of the T-section. It is shown that a non-local estimate of the mean value of the vertical deflection of the beam leads to a shear gradient that is energetically consistent with the double force. Therefore, an additional energy term that includes the derivative of the beam\u2019s curvature leads to a consistent non-local beam model, simple enough to be used in structural analysis. Such beam models are useful in micro- and nano-technology. Moreover, this simple example opens the discussion for the importance of non-local differentiation in the averaging theories of Mechanics.",

Problems with dislocations in infinite medium, near free surfaces or bimaterial interfaces are studied. The efficiency of the proposed method is examined in more complex problems such as interactions of dislocations with inclusions, cracks, and multiple dislocation problems. The configurational (Peach\u2013Koehler) force of the dislocations is calculated numerically based on energy considerations (Parks method).

It is shown that the coupling of the mechanical with the electrical problem can be condensed in a single mechanical problem that falls in the area of dynamic couple stress elasticity. Moreover, static and steady state dynamic antiplane problems of flexoelectric and couple stress elastic materials can be modeled as anisotropic plates with a non-equal biaxial pre-stress. This analogy was materialized in a finite element code.

This study aims to extend current knowledge and provide better-substantiated understanding of the mechanics of end-to-end anastomosis through the development of an analytical model governing the dynamic behavior of the anastomotic region of two initially separated arteries. The formulation accounts for the arterial axial-circumferential deformation coupling and suture-artery interaction. The proposed model captures the effects of the most important parameters, including the geometric and mechanical properties of artery and sutures, number of sutures, loading characteristics, longitudinal residual stresses, and suture pre-tensioning. Closed-form expressions are derived for the system response in terms of arterial radial displacement, anastomotic gap, suture tensile force, and embedding stress due to suture-artery contact interaction. Explicit objective functionalities are established to prevent failure at the anastomotic interface. The mathematical formulation reveals useful interrelations among the problem parameters, thus making the proposed model a valuable tool for the optimal selection of materials and improved functionality of the sutures. By virtue of their generality and directness of application, the findings of this study can ultimately form the basis for the development of vascular anastomosis guidelines pertaining to the prevention of post-surgery implications.",

At the same time and in combination with experiments, beam models have been used to estimate material lengths that are necessary for the assessment of non-local elasticity theories. Aside from the particular details of the non-local assumptions used, boundary conditions play a considerable role in such problems, especially the non-classical boundary conditions that are required by the non-local theories.

The proposed diffusion equation requires the classic diffusion coefficient D and a micro structural internal length g that relates directly to the shape of the molecular potential of the NEMD calculations.

The latter is a type of vascular surgery for the treatment of carotid artery disease in which after an arteriotomy and removal of atherosclerotic plaque closure is made with a patch sutured on the artery. Completion of the operation signals the initiation of complex mechanical and hemodynamic phenomena. Fatigue performance of the patch eventually determines the successful outcome of carotid endarterectomy.

The approach followed is based on a thermal analogue and the integral representation of dislocations through stresses. The objective of a variable core defect concept is to eliminate the stress singularity experienced at the dislocation core. This is accomplished assuming that the displacement discontinuity is achieved gradually over some distance. To implement this concept in a finite element scheme, we first model purely rotational crystal defects considering an appropriate pseudo-temperature distribution, which produces a dislocation array of increasing width. Accordingly, we simulate a discrete edge dislocation of linearly increasing width. This description of dislocation core is closer to experimental observations and has a physically anticipated behaviour reproducing the Volterra dislocation away from the core. Further, interactions of variable core dislocations with free boundaries and coupled dislocation partials are investigated. In all cases, we recover the analytical solutions for the stress distributions and the total strain energy",

This paper investigates different modeling techniques for predicting the coupled damage growth. Two modeling approaches were applied; a two-dimensional bridged-crack (BC) model and the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). The VCCT was applied in two and three-dimensional finite element models and the trends were shown to be the same for both cases. However, the trends predicted using the VCCT are significantly different than the BC model. The reasons for the discrepancies are discussed.

It is shown that for confined systems, such as nanochannels, if one of the transport properties is known, then the others can be estimated. The simulation results reveal that all properties approach bulk values at relatively small channel widths, at about 6-7nm. Below this critical point, the wall effect on fluid atoms is strong and the transport properties change dramatically.

Parameters which are not taken into account at the classical theory continuum theory at the macroscale, should be taken into account at the nano or even micro-scale where the surface to volume ratio increases significantly. Such property is the wall/fluid interaction which determines the wetting (hydrophilic behavior) or not (hydrophobic behavior) of a surface. We first investigate the effect of wall/fluid interaction on fluid atom distribution near the wall through the radial distribution function and, next, we calculate the three most important fluid transport properties, i.e., the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity and thermal conductivity. Transport properties seem to be affected significantly in the channel region adjacent to the wall.",

            "Abstract": "The antiplane dynamic flexoelectric problem is stated as a dielectric solid that incorporates gradients of electric polarization and flexoelectricity due to strain gradients. It is shown that the coupling of the mechanical with the electrical problem can be condensed in a single mechanical problem that falls in the area of dynamic couple stress elasticity. Moreover, static and steady state dynamic antiplane problems of flexoelectric and couple stress elastic materials can be modeled as anisotropic plates with a non-equal biaxial pre-stress. This analogy was materialized in a finite element code. In this work we solved the steady-state problem of a semi-infinite antiplane crack located in the middle of an infinite flexoelectric material, with its crack-tip moving with constant velocity. The particular type of loading investigated serves to relate the present solutions with known results from classic elasto-dynamics. We investigated the \u2026",

Instrumented indentation of hyperelastic materials such as rubbers, bio-materials, tissues etc has not been examined in depth, especially the inverse problem of material characterization from instrumented indentation response. The difficulty of the inverse problem for such materials is that the unknown property is a function, the elastic energy density function. There are several such functions and each function is often characterized by more than one parameter. If the maximum indentation depth is low, we have shown that instrumented indentation of initially unstretched hyperelastic materials can only resolve a combination of the material parameters. If the maximum indentation depth is high, the indentation can provide independent material properties, however not in a unique \u2026",

In passing, we prove the path independency of the Ic-Integral.

A non-local estimate of the mean value of the angle of twist of the beam leads to a shear gradient that is energetically consistent with a bi-moment, in the spirit of the averaging theory of Vardoulakis and Giannakopoulos (2006). The geometric details of the cross section play the role of the microstructure of the beam, introducing a size effect in the torsion problem. The appropriate boundary conditions are derived from the variational formulation of the problem. The proposed gradient elasticity theory is identical to Vlasov\u2019s torsion theory of thin walled elastic beams. The tension of pre-twisted DNA is analyzed at high axial loads, where enthalpic elasticity prevails. A size effect is naturally introduced, indicating that shorter DNA lengths lead to stiffer response in torsion.

The loading of a cable is applied through body-type forces and through appropriate boundary conditions at its ends. The classic cable constitutive law is easily implemented by assuming small strains and a coordinate system that follows the rigid-body motion. This approach was selected in the present analysis in the context of micropolar elasticity. The analysis is two-dimensional (2D) and static. The results indicate the important role of the couple-type body forces in the cable\u2019s deformation. This, in turn, is very advantageous in the design of smart cables and textiles that can utilize electromagnetic fields to actuate couple body forces and in this way exert control on their deformation.",

The analysis is performed in the context of second-order hyperelasticity and is accompanied by finite element computations and an extensive experimental program with spherical indentors of different radii. Uniaxial tensile tests were also performed and it was found that the initial elastic modulus correlates well with the indentation response. The experiments suggest stiffer indentation response than that predicted by linear elasticity, which is somehow counter-intuitive, if the uniaxial material response is to be considered.

This becomes possible since flexoelectricity predicts a new aspect that was not observed in the classical analysis: subsonic super \u2026",

The mechanical response of arteries depends, among others, on their topology along the arterial tree. Viscoelasticity of arterial tissues, which is the topic investigated in this study, is mainly a characteristic mechanical response of arteries that are located away from the heart and have increased smooth muscle cells content.The arterial wall viscosity is simulated by adopting a generalized Maxwell model and the method of internal variables, as proposed by Bonet and Holzapfel et al. The total stresses consist of elastic long-term stresses and viscoelastic stresses, requiring an iterative procedure for their calculation. The cross-section of the artery is modeled as a circular ring, consisting of a single homogenized layer, under a time-varying blood pressure. Two \u2026",

We used non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of liquid argon flowing in a nanochannel formed by krypton walls, macroscopically equivalent to the planar Poiseuille flow, at constant temperature. All properties approach bulk values as the channel width increases. As the channel width decreases, the transport properties change dramatically: the diffusion coefficient decreases with the channel width, the shear viscosity increases with the channel width and the thermal conductivity increases with the channel width. The novel result of this work is that, if the size effect of one of the transport properties (say the diffusion coefficient) is known, then all the others can be estimated from results that apply to classic fluid mechanics.",

The results include explicit relations between the normal applied load and the depth of penetration, details of the contact area shapes, the surface stresses and the contact pressure distributions. The standard shapes of the Vickers, Berkovich and Knoop pyramids were examined in particular. Certain aspects of geometrical imperfections, transverse isotropy and adhesion were considered.

Various wall/fluid interaction strength ratios are considered for the simulations, covering typical hydrophilic and hydrophobic channels. We show that groove orientation (ribs and grooves) has a primitive effect on flow mainly due to slip length increase in a ribbed-wall channel. The transport properties of the fluid are significantly affected by wall wettability, as, in flows past an hydrophobic wall, the diffusion coefficient presents anisotropy, shear viscosity attains a minimum value and thermal conductivity increases.",

In addition, small scale beams and bars can be used as test specimens for measuring the lengths that enter the constitutive equations of gradient elasticity. It is then useful to be able to apply approximate solutions for the extension, shear and flexure of slender bodies. Such approach requires the existence of some form of the Saint-Venant principle.

The mechanical response of arteries depends on the health of tissues that comprise the artery walls.

In reality, arterial dynamics is the dynamics of a propagating pulse, originating in heart ventricle, propagating along aorta, bifurcating, etc. Artery as a whole cannot be simulated as a lump ring, however its cross section can be simulated as a vibrating ring having a phase lag with respect to the other sections, creating a running pressure wave.

The results show that the power law elastic gradation can be very advantageous in the design of strong and wear resistance sliding surfaces.",

            "Abstract": "Suture line stress concentration and intimal hyperplasia are related to the long-term complications of end-toside and side-to-side anastomosis. Several factors, such as hemodynamic effects, biological activities and the mechanical properties of the blood vessels, are identified to influence the problem. Yet, it is not completely clear which are the factors that influence most the long-term complications and in what specific way. This study aims to examine if elastic (compliance) mismatch increases the stress concentration and intimal thickening at the suture line. Better compliance may be obtained by using grafts with similar mechanical properties to the host artery or by anastomosis techniques that utilize vein patches and cuffs (Taylor-patch and Miller-cuff anastomosis). The anastomosis model used in this study is a circular cylindrical system consisting of two semi-cylinders, interconnected by two hinges. The internal \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The present work gives a systematic and rigorous implementation of (edge type) circular Volterra dislocation loops in ordinary axisymmetric finite elements using the thermal analogue and the integral representation of dislocations through stresses. The accuracy of the proposed method is studied in problems where analytical solutions exist. The full fields are given for loop dislocations in isotropic and anisotropic crystals and the Peach-Koehler forces are calculated for loops approaching free surfaces and bimaterial interfaces. The results are expected to be very important in the analysis of plastic yield strength, giving quantitative results regarding the influence of grain boundaries, interstitial particles, microvoids, thin film constraints and nano-indentation phenomena. The interaction of few dislocations with various inhomogeneities gives rise to size effects in the yield strength which are of great importance in nano-mechanics.",

The aim of this work is to explore the theoretical foundation of Knoop test and shed light to the interesting details that make the Knoop test so useful and simple. Our study builds upon the preliminary analyses of Knoop indentation by Giannakopoulos and Zisis (2011). We present a finite element study, in the frame of large elasto-plastic deformations, on the adhesionless contact of between a Knoop indenter and flat surfaces that exhibit strain hardening behavior. The material of the contacting solid is modeled as homogeneous and isotropic while frictionless contact conditions are assumed throughout.

            "Abstract": "In recent years, strain gradient elasticity has been used to capture size effects in stiffness and toughness that appear in structures of different sizes. An important aspect of such theories, often taken of little notice, is the non-classical boundary conditions that appear as couple-stress tractions. Such tractions can provide deformation of the body they are acting on, without the need for classic type of supports that are usually needed when classic tractions are applied. Moreover such tractions seem to be \"invisible\", since no external pressure is acting and they can be related to non-mechanical sources, like electricity. The human heart seems to stand without support (bones etc), floating in the human body and electric pulses applied to its surface make it vibrate, inflating periodically the various chambers that circulate the blood in the body. We propose a model for the muscle tissues of the heart, in the context of gradient \u2026",

            "Abstract": "During the last decades, pyramid micro and nano-indentation tests such as Vickers, Berkovich and Knoop have been used on cohesive-frictional (pressure sensitive) materials, such as hard metals, glasses and ceramics, and were found to give valuable mechanical and other physical information which may be otherwise difficult to obtain. Indentation experiments are attractive because they require only a small flat area of specimen and are relatively easy to perform on materials of high stiffness and brittleness. More important, at least in principle, a wide load range can be used, so that many mechanical properties can be inferred by recording continuously the force-depth response at loading and unloading. Despite of the broad use of the indentation experiments, and the theoretical analysis of the response of the first two indenters (Vickers and Berkovich), the Knoop indentation response has never been analysed on \u2026",

Substrates made of graded materials are often encountered in nature or are artificially produced. The variation of the plastic properties depends on micro-structural or compositional changes of the material with depth. The introduction of certain controlled gradients in plastic properties can minimize plasticity and promote resistance to the onset of damage at contact surfaces during tribological applications. Contact analysis of plastically graded surfaces can be particularly useful in the design of load-bearing devices such as gears, rollers and electric contacts found in many macro- and micro-electro-mechanical systems. A comprehensive parametric finite element study of the mechanics of indentation of plastically graded materials by a rigid wedge is presented in the present paper.

A one-dimensional model is developed by assuming that the variation of indentation load as a function of depth under dynamic conditions has the same parabolic form (Kick's Law) as under static conditions. The motion of the indenter as it indents and rebounds from the target is described. Predictions are made of the peak indentation depth, residual indentation depth, contact time, and rebound velocity as functions of the impact velocity, indenter mass and target properties. Finite element simulations were carried out to assess the validity of the model for elastoplastic materials. For rate-independent materials agreement with the model was good provided the impact velocity did not exceed certain critical values. For rate-dependent materials the relationship between load and depth in the impact problem is no longer parabolic and the \u2026",

The substrate is incompressible and has an elastic energy density which is isotropic in the reference frame. The analysis focuses on spherical indentation, but the results can be extended to all axisymmetric indenters. The substrate is prestretched biaxially, but it is not necessarily equal-biaxial. Due to the non-equal biaxial stretching, the contact region may obtain an elliptical form with principal axes along the stretching directions with the larger axis along the smallest surface stretch. The problem resembles that of the linear contact of an orthotropic substrate; however the problem under investigation is different. Based on the theoretical analysis we propose a methodology that can be used to solve the inverse problem of material characterization using instrumented indentation of a prestretched surface when the \u2026",

While different sets of experiments were conducted to examine the influence of the bulk stress, the tangential load, and the normal load, respectively, on fretting fatigue response, the effect of microstructure on fretting fatigue was explored with experiments on the acicular, Widmanst\u00e4tten, and martensitic microstructures as well. In experiments where the contact loads were maintained constant and the bulk stress was varied, fretting reduced the fatigue strength of Ti-6Al-4V. For this case, the \u201cstrength \u2026",
