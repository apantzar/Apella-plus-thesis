            "Abstract": "Commandaria is considered one of the oldest types of wines and it has been ranked as one of the best wines of the last millennium. Production of Commandaria in Cyprus is associated with historical and political events that took place at the island, especially during the last millennium, hence studies related to Commandaria are heavily related to the culture and history of Cyprus. Unfortunately up to now the issue of preserving the history and traditions related to the production of Commandaria over the years did not receive adequate attention and as result the danger of losing important aspects of the relevant Cypriot cultural heritage is obvious. With our work we aim to develop an interactive system through which the history of the production of Commandaria at different areas in Cyprus and different time periods will be presented along with historical events that took place in the island and can be related with Commandaria production. As part of the project we will establish a multimedia digital library that will contain items related to the history and production of Commandaria in Cyprus. All multimedia database entries will be sorted according to various criteria, including the chronological period, the geographical location they refer to and the actual contents of the item, and could be searched via semantic-based queries with the aid of an ontology. In addition, an interactive application will be created where users will have the opportunity to explore the history of Commandaria in Cyprus at different geographical locations and different time periods. The final system will operate both as a web application and as a stand alone application in information \u2026",

We attempt a short review of current implementations and present our first thoughts on extending the classical saliency-based model by using motion and prior knowledge.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, more and more users are witnessing the impact of Hypermedia/Multimedia as well as the penetration of social applications in their life. Parallel to the evolution of the Internet and Web, several Hypermedia/Multimedia schemes and technologies bring semantic-based intelligent, personalized and adaptive services to the end users. More and more techniques are applied in media systems in order to be user/group-centric, adapting to different content and context features of a single or a community user. In respect to all the above, researchers need to explore and study the plethora of challenges that emergent personalisation and adaptation technologies bring to the new era. This edited volume aims to increase the awareness of researchers in this area. All contributions provide an in-depth investigation on research and deployment issues, regarding already introduced schemes and applications in Semantic Hyper/Multimedia and Social Media Adaptation. Moreover, the authors provide survey-based articles, so as potential readers can use it for catching up the recent trends and applications in respect to the relevant literature. Finally, the authors discuss and present their approach in the respective field or problem addressed.",

As a result of ageing effects the false rejection rate usually increases and the long-term performance of a biometric system decreases.",

            "Publication url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8890460/",
            "Abstract": "The central community of social networks, usually represented through the highest degree k-core of the corresponding graph, is proposed here as a compact representation of large social networks. We show that the central community of egocentric social media networks, such as the ego networks on Twitter and Instagram, tell us much more about the actual influence of the ego than the whole egocentric network itself. We also propose a novel genetic algorithm for the identification of central community of egocentric social networks and we examine the importance of the proper initialisation of this algorithm. The actual Twitter ego networks we used in our experiments along with the corresponding Python code are made publicly available for anyone who wishes to use them.",

            "Abstract": "Two channels have been distinguished in human interaction: one transmits explicit messages, which may be about anything or nothing; the other transmits implicit messages about the speakers themselves. Both linguistics and technology have invested enormous efforts in understanding the first, explicit channel, but the second is not as well understood. Understanding the other party's emotions is one of the key tasks associated with the second, implicit channel. To tackle that task, signal processing and analysis techniques have to be developed, while, at the same time, consolidating psychological and linguistic analyses of emotion. This article examines basic issues in those areas. It is motivated by the PKYSTA project, in which we aim to develop a hybrid system capable of using information from faces and voices to recognize people's emotions.",

The effectiveness of biometric systems is directly linked with aging that causes modifications on biometric features. For example the long term performance of person identification systems decreases as biometric templates derived from aged subjects may display substantial differences when compared to reference templates whereas in age estimation, aging variation allows the age of a subject to be estimated. In this paper we attempt to quantify the effects of aging for different biometric modalities facilitating in that way the design of systems that use biometric features. In this context the homogeneity of statistical distributions of biometric features belonging to certain age classes is quantified enabling in that way the definition of age sensitive and \u2026",

In face detection, humans perform conscious search; therefore, bottom up approaches are not so efficient. In this paper we introduce the inclusion of two channels in the VA architecture proposed by Itti et al. (1998) to account for motion and conscious search in a scene. Increasing the channels in the architecture requires an efficient way of combining the various maps that are produced. We solve this problem by using an innovative committee machine scheme which allows for dynamically changing the committee members (maps) and weighting the maps according to the confidence level of their estimation. The overall VA architecture achieves significantly better results compared with the simple skin based face detection as shown in the experimental results",

According to socialbakers.com [1], four of the top twenty Facebook pages focus on sports. These particles can be processed and automatically annotated with events, entities etc. Furthermore, several annotated particles referring to a different time interval of the same sports event, could be synchronized to accomplish annotation of full sports games. Towards this direction, in this paper an innovative scheme is proposed that performs unsupervised annotation of sports video particles, posted on social media. The scheme is based on an intelligent wrapper architecture that automatically gathers and segments content and on the newly introduced Social Latent Semantic Analysis. This paper forms an initial study of automatic sports video particles annotation and experiments indicate its promising performance.",

Instead it has been established as an important tool in the framework of many multimedia applications like indexing, scene classification and news summarization. Many face detection algorithms based on skin color characteristics have appeared in the literature. Most of them face generalization problems due to the skin color model they use. Moreover, their verification stage exclusively depends on simple shape features limiting the reliability of detection. In this work we present a Gaussian model of the skin color distribution whose parameters are re-estimated based on the current image I frame. In this way the generalization problem is limited. Furthermore the verification stage, applied in the detected skin segments, is based on a template matching variation providing a robust detection.",

New approaches started evolving, employing knowledge-based processing, though transforming a priori knowledge to low-level models and rules are far from being straightforward. In this paper, we examine one of the most popular active contour models, snakes, and propose a snake model, modifying terms and introducing a model-based one that eliminates basic problems through the usage of prior shape knowledge in the model. A probabilistic rule-driven utilization of the proposed model follows, being able to handle (or cope with) objects of different shapes, contour complexities and motions; different environments, indoor and outdoor; cluttered sequences; and cases where background is complex (not smooth) and when moving objects get partially occluded. The proposed method has been tested in a variety of sequences and the experimental results verify its efficiency.",

However, a key question that arises is whether biometric-based techniques could be used in real identity verification of age separated faces with the same effectiveness as other identity verification tests or at least as a soft filtering approach before applying more reliable but intrusive tests such as DNA tests. Towards this end we apply biometric-based techniques in an attempt to verify the identity of a missing child, using real data.

A possible way to alleviate these problems and improve the annotation quality is to obtain multiple annotations per image by assigning several annotators into the task. In the current work we present an approach to model the view of several annotators using four MPEG-7 descriptors and a well known data classifier. We apply keywords modelling to the annotation data collected in the framework of Commandaria project where sixteen non-expert users annotated a set of a hundred images using a predefined set of keywords. The images sharing a common keyword are grouped together and used for the creation of the visual model corresponds to this keyword. Finally, the created models used to classify the images into the keyword classes in terms of 2-classes combinations using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. The experimental results are examined under two perspectives: First, in terms of the separation ability of the various keyword classes and second, in terms of the efficiency of the four visual descriptors as far as the image classification task is concerned",

            "Abstract": "In supervised learning it is assumed that it is straightforward to obtain labeled data. However, in reality labeled data 10 can be scarce or expensive to obtain. Active learning (AL) is a way to deal with the above problem by asking for the labels 11 of the most \u2018\u2018informative\u2019\u2019 data points. We propose an AL method based on a metric of classification confidence computed 12 on a feature subset of the original feature space which pertains especially to the large number of dimensions (i.e. examined 13 genes) of microarray experiments. DNA microarray expression experiments permit the systematic study of the correlation 14 of the expression of thousands of genes. 15 Feature selection is critical in the algorithm because it enables faster and more robust retraining of the classifier. The 16 approach that is followed for feature selection is a combination of a variance measure and a genetic algorithm. 17 We have applied the proposed method on DNA microarray data sets with encouraging results. In particular we studied 18 data sets concerning: small round blue cell tumours (four types), Leukemia (two types), lung cancer (two types) and pros- 19 tate cancer (healthy, unhealthy).",

            "Abstract": "Recent advances in digital video technology have resulted in an explosion of digital video data which are available through the Web or in private repositories. Efficient searching in these repositories created the need of semantic labeling of video data at various levels of granularity, ie, movie, scene, shot, keyframe, video object, etc. Through multilevel labeling video content is appropriately indexed, allowing access from various modalities and for a variety of applications. However, despite the huge efforts for automatic video annotation human intervention is the only way for reliable semantic video annotation. Manual video annotation is an extremely laborious process and efficient tools developed for this purpose can make, in many cases, the true difference. In this paper we present a video annotation tool, which uses structured knowledge, in the form of XML dictionaries, for semantic labeling, and an efficient shot detection algorithm for automatic video segmentation. Furthermore, it allows hierarchical semantic annotation from the highest to the lowest level of granularity through a properly designed graphical user interface. Finally, XML dictionary creation and editing tools are available during annotation allowing the user to always use the semantic label she/he wishes.",

The proposed approach is expected to add significant value to hundreds of billions of non-annotated or inadequately annotated video streams existing in the Web, file servers, databases etc. Furthermore expert annotators can gain important knowledge relevant to user preferences, selections, styles of searching and perception",

            "Abstract": "Voting Advice Application (VAA) is a web application that recommends a candidate or a party to a voter. From an online questionnaire, which voters and candidates are called to answer, the VAA proposes to each individual voter the candidate who replied like him/her. It is very important the voters to reply in all questions of the questionnaire, because every question has its meaning and is responding to the political position of a each party. Missing values might mislead the VAA and impede it to have complete knowledge about the voter, as a result to offer him/her the wrong candidate. In this paper we quantitatively investigate the effect of missing values in VAAs by examining the impact of the number of missing values to different methods of voting prediction. For our experiment we have used the data obtained from the May parliamentary elections in Greece in 2012. The corresponding dataset is made freely \u2026",

We propose a hierarchical classification scheme which is based on predefined XML-dictionaries of tree form. Every node of such a tree defines a particular classification task while the children of the node correspond to classification categories. The winning class (subnode) defines the subsequent classification task and the process continues until the leafs of the tree are reached. The final classification task is performed at image segment level; that is every image segment is assigned a particular keyword corresponding to a tree leaf. The path followed from the root of the XML tree to the leafs \u2026",

Several methods have been exploited and web image information is extracted from textual sources such as image file names, anchor texts, existing keywords and, of course, surrounding text. However, the systems that attempt to mine information for images using surrounding text suffer from several problems, such as the inability to correctly assign all relevant text to an image and discard the irrelevant text as well. A novel method for extracting web image information is discussed in the present paper. The proposed system uses visual cues in order to cluster a web page into several regions and assign to each hosted image the text that most possibly refers to it. Three different approaches to the problem of text to image assignment are discussed and evaluated. The \u2026",

In this work, we combine skin colour and shape features with template matching in an efficient way for the purpose of facial image indexing. We propose an adaptive two-dimensional Gaussian model of the skin colour distribution whose parameters are re-estimated based on the current image or frame, reducing generalisation problems. Masked areas obtained from skin colour detection are processed using morphological tools and assessed using global shape features. The verification stage is based on a template matching variation providing robust detection. Facial images and video sequences are indexed \u2026",

The sensors together with a mobile device form a personal area network that monitors the patient\u2019s health status. It gives advice to the patient, adjusts the environmental conditions according to the patient\u2019s needs, and in the case of an emergency, notifies the patient\u2019s doctor or the corresponding medical center. In the current work the authors present a new attention-based architecture for health monitoring emphasizing on the identification of attention seeking and dangerous health states. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture responses very fast to the changes of the patient\u2019s biosignals and accurately in decisions concerning the patient\u2019s health status.",

Web image indexing is traditionally approached, by commercial search engines, using text-based information such as image file names, anchor text, web-page keywords and, of course, surrounding text. In the latter case, for effective indexing, two requirements should be met: Correct identification of the related text, known as image context, and extraction of the right terms from this text. Usually, researchers working in the field of web image indexing consider that once the image context is identified extraction of indexing terms is trivial. However, we have shown in our previous work that this is not the rule of thumb \u2026",

The proposed performance evaluation framework can form the basis of implementing comprehensive comparative performance evaluation between different age progression methodologies, allowing in that way the evolution of the best algorithms.",

The proposed architecture gets advantage of: (1) the increased widespread and power of mobile computing devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs, which allows for intelligent health status estimation methods to be implemented and run on them, (2) the development of biosensors capable of both collecting important biomedical data and communicating them wirelessly, through a Personal Area Network, to mobile computing devices, and (3) the existing GSM infrastructure which makes the communication of mobile computing devices and medical centers easy and secure. This communication involves sending to the medical center only the necessary information for successful monitoring as well as any indications of emergency incidents.",

            "Abstract": "The human visual system (HVS) has the ability to fixate quickly on the most informative (salient) regions of a scene and therefore reducing the inherent visual uncertainty. Computational visual attention (VA) schemes have been proposed to account for this important characteristic of the HVS. A video analysis framework based on a spatiotemporal VA model is presented. A novel scheme has been proposed for generating saliency in video sequences by taking into account both the spatial extent and dynamic evolution of regions. To achieve this goal, a common, image-oriented computational model of saliency-based visual attention is extended to handle spatiotemporal analysis of video in a volumetric framework. The main claim is that attention acts as an efficient preprocessing step to obtain a compact representation of the visual content in the form of salient events/objects. The model has been implemented, and \u2026",

However, the non fixed and huge dimensionality of the extracted SIFT feature vector cause certain limitations when it is used in machine learning frameworks. In this paper, we introduce Spatial Histogram of Keypoints (SHiK), which keeps the spatial information of localized keypoints, on an effort to overcome this limitation. The proposed technique partitions the image into a fixed number of ordered sub-regions based on the Hilbert space filling curve and counts the localized keypoints found inside each sub-region. The resulting spatial histogram is a compact and discriminative low-level feature vector that shows significantly improved performance on classification tasks. The proposed method achieves high accuracy on different datasets and performs significantly \u2026",

Aging variation causes modifications on biometric features that affect the matching between stored and captured biometric templates causing in that way deterioration in the performance of biometric authentication systems. In this study the authors attempt to quantify the effects of aging for different biometric modalities, so that it is possible to draw conclusions related to the effect of aging on different types of biometric templates. In this context variations between distributions containing biometric features from different age groups are quantified, allowing in that way the definition of age-sensitive and age-invariant biometric features. An important aspect of the proposed approach is the standardised and generic nature of the approach that allows the derivation of comparative results between different modalities and different feature vectors. The work presented in this study provides a valuable tool for selecting, either age-invariant features for use in identity authentication applications, or for selecting age-sensitive features for age-estimation-related applications.",

The widespread of deep learning and the availability of ResNet-50 model, which was trained on VGGFace2 dataset, allowed us to apply transfer learning for face verification purposes. At the same time an alternative technique which is based on facial points matching was applied. The main aim of the paper is to show that despite the progress made in the fields of face recognition and face verification, actual systems that can be used by non-experts for examining real world cases, like the one we deal in the current paper, remain impractical.

In this work we form a description of the six universal facial expressions, using the MPEG-4 Facial Definition Parameter Set (FDP) [1]. According to the MPEG-4 Standard, this is a set of tokens that describe minimal perceptible actions in the facial area. Groups of such actions in different magnitudes produce the perception of expression [2]. A systematic approach towards the recognition and classification of such an expression is based on characteristic points in the facial area that can be automatically detected \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a novel method for indexing web images which is based on textual descriptors. The web document is segmented into visual blocks of text and then each block of text is assigned to the closet image. The text extraction is improved by assigning the text to an image following the intuitive understanding of how close two visual blocks are. The evaluation confirms the validity of the proposed method and demonstrates its possible extensions.",

Every user is presented with a set of important issues and she is asked to submit her opinion by selecting one of a predefined set of answers (e.g. agree/disagree). The VAA gathers the same information for all candidates that are about to compete in the elections. Hence, it can provide recommendation to users: the candidates that agree with the user on these selected issues. In this paper, we propose a collaborating filtering approach for providing such suggestions. Like-minded users are clustered together based on their profiles (views on the selected issues) and voting recommendation is provided to a user by the members of the nearest (to her profile) cluster. We observe that this method produces more effective recommendations by utilizing two different measures: accuracy and weighted mean \u2026",

Human faces may act as visual interfaces that help users feel at home when interacting with a computer because they are accepted as the most expressive means for communicating and recognizing emotions. Thus, a lifelike human face can enhance interactive applications by providing straightforward feedback to and from the users and stimulating emotional responses from them. Thus, virtual environments can employ believable, expressive characters since such features significantly enhance the atmosphere of a virtual world and Communicate messages far more vividly than any textual or speech information. In this paper, we present an abstract means of description of facial expressions, by utilizing concepts included in the MPEG-4 standard. Furthermore, we exploit these concepts to synthesize a wide variety of expressions using a reduced representation, suitable for networked and lightweight applications.",

The ARANFIS (Adaptive Resource Allocating Neural Fuzzy Inference System) has an adaptive structure, which is formed during the training process. We show that the resource allocating methodology enables both online adaptation and rule extraction; the latter differentiates it from the majority of Neurofuzzy systems with fixed structure which perform mainly rule modification/ adaptation rather that rule extraction.

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes an innovative relevance feedback algorithm for wall-content selection in social media. The procedure results in an iterative loop, which recursively updates a weighted distance. The distance is then used for finding multimedia items that are relevant to a user's preferences. To do so, the activity log of the user under investigation is considered and his/her attention at previous intervals is analyzed. Another novel point of the proposed approach is the incorporation of friends' attention into the relevance feedback scheme. In particular, interactions among users and posted multimedia items are considered as an explicit crowdsourcing activity. By this way some multimedia items receive more attention, while some others receive less or no attention. By analyzing these social interactions, a social computing framework is formed, which affects the evolution of the content selection process. Overall, the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A Voting Advice Application (VAA) is a web application that recommends to a voter the party or the candidate, who replied like him/her in an online questionnaire. Every question is responding to the political positions of each party. If the voter fails to answer some questions, it is likely the VAA to offer him/her the wrong candidate. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the missing data (not answered questions) and try to estimate them. In this paper we formulate the VAA missing value problem and investigate several different approaches of collaborative filtering to tackle it. The evaluation of the proposed approaches was done by using the data obtained from the Cypriot presidential elections of February 2013 and the parliamentary elections in Greece in May, 2012. The corresponding datasets are made freely available to other researchers working in the areas of VAA and recommender systems through the Web.",

This interest is motivated by important real life applications where accurate age progression algorithms can be used. However, age progression methodologies may only be used in real applications provided that they have the ability to produce accurate age progressed images. Therefore it is of utmost importance to encourage the development of accurate age progression algorithms through the formulation of performance evaluation protocols that can be used for obtaining accurate performance evaluation results for different algorithms reported in the literature. In this paper we describe the organization of the, first ever, pilot independent age progression competition that aims to provide the basis of a robust framework for assessing age progression methodologies. The evaluation carried out involves the use of several machine-based and human-based indicators that were used for assessing eight age progression methods.",

Existing systems that attempt to mine information for images using surrounding text suffer from several problems, such as the inability to correctly assign all relevant text to an image and discard the irrelevant. In this paper, we propose a novel method for indexing web images which is based on textual descriptors. The web document is segmented into visual blocks of text and then each block of text is assigned to the closet image. The text extraction is improved by assigning the text to an image following the intuitive understanding of how close two visual blocks are. The evaluation confirms the validity of the proposed method and demonstrates its possible extensions.",

A popular approach for increasing the scalability and decreasing the time complexity of recommender systems, involves user clustering, based on their profiles and similarities. Cluster representatives make successful recommendations for the other cluster members; this way the complexity of recommendation depends only on cluster size. Although classic clustering methods have been often used, the requirements of user clustering in recommender systems, are quite different from the typical ones.

Apart from the existence of noise and environmental changes, many problems are also concerned, due to background texture, complicated object motion, and deformable and/or articulated objects, changing their shape while moving along time. Another phenomenon in natural sequences is the appearance of occlusions between different objects, whose handling requires motion information and, in some cases, additional constraints.

            "Abstract": "The success of contemporary surveillance systems depends on their cost and their ability to automatically and correctly interpret events that take place in an observed environment. Correct decisions enhance the situation awareness of an operator, while wrong ones lead to false or no alarms, damaging the system's credibility. In this paper a low-cost, secure, cloud-based surveillance system is described for monitoring wide dynamic environments. The focus of our current work is to present the system's overall architecture and discuss in detail the design and functionalities of its main modules: (a) the multiocular network of multispectral cameras for visual information gathering, (b) the intelligent segmentation, event modeling and anomaly detection module and (c) the end-to-end power-aware data encryption infrastructure. By following the proposed approach, different geographic areas can be successfully covered \u2026",

In the experiment we use the topics mined from Instagram hashtags of a set of Instagram images corresponding to 30 different subjects. By subject we mean the research hashtag we use to gather pairs of Instagram images and hashtags. With the aid of an innovative topic modelling method, developed in a previous work, we constructed word clouds for the visualisation of each topic. Then we used a popular crowdsourcing platform (Appen) to let users identify the topic they believe each word cloud represents. The results show some interesting \u2026",

Furthermore, a relation between FAPs and the activation parameter proposed in some classic psychological studies is established. In this way we try to get advantage of the extended work that have been done from psychologists and which covers much more expressions than the archetypal ones the computer society concentrated on. The overall scheme leads to a parameterized approach of synthesizing facial and can be used for the creation of MPEG-4 compatible synthetic video sequences.",

Considerable research has been carried out into salient region detection methods based either on models emulating human visual attention (VA) mechanisms or on computational approximations. Most of the proposed methods are bottom-up and their major goal is to filter out redundant visual information. In this paper, we propose and elaborate on a saliency detection model that treats a video sequence as a spatiotemporal volume and generates a local saliency measure for each visual unit (voxel). This computation involves an optimization process incorporating inter- and intra-feature competition at the voxel level. Perceptual decomposition of the input, spatiotemporal center-surround interactions and the integration of heterogeneous feature conspicuity values are described and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are Web tools that inform citizens about the political stances of parties (and/or candidates) that participate in upcoming elections. The traditional process that they follow is to call the users and the parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, usually grouped into meaningful categories (eg, external policy, economy, society, etc). Having the aforementioned information, VAA can provide recommendation to users regarding the proximity/distance that a user has to each participating party. A social recommendation approach of VAAs (so-called SVAAs) calculates the closeness between each party\u2019s devoted users and the current user and ranks parties according the estimated \u2018party users\u2019-user similarity. In our paper we stand on this approach and we assume that \u2018typical\u2019voters of particular parties can be characterized by answer patterns (sequences of choices for all policy statements included in the VAA) and that the answer choice in each policy statement can be \u2018predicted\u2019from previous answer choices. Thus, we resort to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are proved to be effective machine learning tools for sequential and correlated data. Based on the principles of collaborative filtering we try to model \u2018party users\u2019 using HMMs and then exploit these models to recommend each VAA user the party whose model best fits their answer pattern. For our experiments we use three datasets based on the 2014 elections to the European Parliament1.",

Tweets are limited to 140 characters; thus, the conveyed message is compressed and often context-dependent.

Thus, alternative ways for automatically creating training examples, i.e., pairs of images and tags, are pursued. In this work, we investigate whether tags accompanying photos in the Instagram can be considered as image annotation metadata. If such a claim is proved then Instagram could be used as a very rich, easy to collect automatically, source of training data for the development of AIA techniques.

Topographic feature maps are then combined through a sigmoid function to produce the final saliency map.

Despite most current approaches that are just based on automatic spatiotemporal analysis of sequences, the proposed method introduces the implicit user-in-the-loop concept for dynamically mining semantics and annotating video streams. This work sets a new and ambitious goal: to recognize, model and properly use \u201caverage user\u2019s\u201d selections, preferences and perception, for dynamically extracting content semantics. The proposed approach is expected to add significant value to hundreds of billions of non-annotated or inadequately annotated video streams existing in the Web, file servers, databases etc. Furthermore expert annotators can gain important knowledge relevant to user preferences, selections, styles of searching and perception.",

Traditional feature vector based retrieval methods cannot provide semantically meaningful results. Additionally manual annotation is both time/money consuming and user-dependent. To address these problems in this paper we present an approach to automatically annotate multimedia files by incorporating clickthrough data of search engines. In particular the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking, are analyzed in order to assign keywords to selected content. A query extension method is also proposed in order to agitate the pool of files and bring content with similar visual features to the surface. This is very important since users typically select only the first files of the ranking by clicking on them. The proposed method is feasible even for large sets of queries and features and theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment, which shows that the method can effectively annotate multimedia files and significantly enhance the performance of multimedia search engines.",

Biometric systems aim to extract information about attributes such as identity, emotional state and age or to interpret human actions such as speech, handwritten text and behaviour.The endless possibilities in embedding biometric modules in existing systems along with the great potential of developing contemporary applications involving biometric units have caused a dramatic rise in the market share of biometric systems. At the same time, the general topic of biometrics has attracted a considerable amount of interest by researchers who aim to develop new methods for extending the effectiveness, accuracy and scope of application of biometric systems. Among different possible applications of biometric systems the problem of secure access is regarded as a major problem and as a result on many occasions biometric systems are associated with identity recognition and/or verification. Indeed the increased need for fast, secure and automatic access to real and electronic sites has prompted the development of biometric systems that can replace traditional identity verification methods. The major difficulty in developing biometric systems is the variability encountered in biometric traits that causes variation in biometric features belonging to the same class, a situation known as intra-class variation. A successful biometric system should be able to isolate and use the right type of variability for a particular application while other types of variation, which impede the process of correct interpretation \u2026",

On the other hand, when humans are looking for faces in a scene they perform an implicit conscious search. Therefore, using simple bottom up approaches for identifying visually salient areas in scenes containing humans are not so efficient. In this paper we introduce the inclusion of a top-down channel in the VA architecture proposed in the past (i.e., Itti et al) to account for conscious search in video telephony applications. In such kind of applications the existence of human faces is almost always guaranteed. The regions, in the video-telephony stream, identified by the proposed algorithm as being visually salient are encoded with higher precision compared to the remaining ones. This procedure leads to a significant bit-rate reduction while the visual quality of the VA based encoded video stream is only slightly deteriorated, as the visual trial tests show. Furthermore, extended experiments concerning both static images as well as low-quality video show the efficiency of the proposed method, as far as the compression ratios achieved is concerned. The comparisons are made against standard JPEG and MPEG-1 encoding respectively.",

QSWTs provide both invisibility and significant resistance against lossy transmission and compression, conditions that are typical in error prone networks.

Instances of particular object classes are detected combining bottom-up (learn-able models based on simple features) and top-down information (object models consisting of primitive geometric shapes such as lines). The rule-based system acts as a model for the spatial configuration of objects, also providing a human interpretable justification of image classification. Experimental results in the athletic domain show that despite inefficiencies in object detection, spatial relations allow for efficient discrimination between visually similar images classes.",

            "Abstract": "Recent advances in digital video technology have resulted in an explosion of digital video data which are available through the Web or in private repositories. Efficient searching in these repositories created the need of semantic labeling of video data at various levels of granularity, i.e., movie, scene, shot, keyframe, video object, etc. Through multilevel labeling video content is appropriately indexed, allowing access from various modalities and for a variety of applications. However, despite the huge efforts for automatic video annotation human intervention is the only way for reliable semantic video annotation. Manual video annotation is an extremely laborious process and efficient tools developed for this purpose can make, in many cases, the true difference. In this paper we present a video annotation tool, which uses structured knowledge, in the form of XML dictionaries, combined with a hierarchical classification scheme to attach semantic labels to video segments at various level of granularity. Video segmentation is supported through the use of an efficient shot detection algorithm; while shots are combined into scenes through clustering with the aid of a Genetic Algorithm scheme. Finally, XML dictionary creation and editing tools are available during annotation allowing the user to always use the semantic label she/he wishes instead of the automatically created ones",

According to US officials, art crime is the third-highest grossing criminal enterprise worldwide. As a result, art forensics is a rising research field dealing with the identification of stolen or looted art and their collection and repatriation. Photographs of artwork provide, in several cases, the only way to locate stolen and looted items. However, it is quite common these items to be damaged as a result of excavation and illegal movement. Digital processing of photographs of damaged artwork is therefore of high importance in art forensics. This processing emphasizes on \u201cobject restoration\u201d and although techniques from the field of image restoration can be applied it is of high importance to take into account the semantics of the artwork scene and especially the structure of objects appeared therein. In this paper, we assess the application of face image restoration techniques, applied on damaged faces appearing in Byzantine icons, in an attempt to identify the actual icons. Several biometric measurements and facial features along with a set of rules related to the design of Byzantine faces are utilized for this purpose. Preliminary investigation, applied on 25 icons, shows promising results.",

We then use these to examine the dynamics of facial expressions. The system's inputs are the relative variations of distances defined by salient facial points from one frame to the next. For maximum compatibility, these facial points (eyebrows, eyes, mouth) were chosen from the set of points defined in the standard MPEG-4 specifications, so that their automatic extraction is tractable.

In particular, the similarity measure is expressed in a parametric form of functional components. Another innovative point has to do with the estimation of MCP, which measures the influence of files over social media users. Toward this direction, user interactions (e.g., comments, likes, and shares) indicate that the file is influencing to them. The algorithm takes into consideration both the visual characteristics of multimedia files and their influence to retrieve information.

In most of them the ROI definition is highly subjective, i.e., lacks scientific evidence in supporting the claim that the areas defined as ROIs are indeed perceptually interesting. In this paper we attempt to model ROIs as the visually attended areas indicated by a saliency map in order to lower as much as possible the subjectivity of selection. For evaluation purposes we follow a ROI-based video compression setup and present comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of perceived visual quality and video compression improvement. Extended experiments concerning both MPEG-1 as well as low bit-rate MPEG-4 video encoding were conducted showing significant improvement in video compression efficiency without perceived deterioration in visual quality.",

One of the major impediments in extending the static VA architecture proposed by Itti et al.

We propose an innovative committee machine scheme that allows for dynamically changing the committee members (maps) and weighting them according to the confidence level of their estimation. Through this machine we handle the extensions on Itti's model; we add a motion channel and a prior knowledge channel which accounts for the conscious search performed by humans when looking for faces in a scene. The experimental results, obtained when considering face detection, show that the map fusion, through the proposed committee machine, leads to significantly better statistical results when compared with the \u2026",

Moreover, text based systems that retrieve information from textual sources such as image file names, anchor texts, existing keywords and, of course, surrounding text often share the inability to correctly assign all relevant text to an image and discard the irrelevant. A novel method for indexing web images is discussed in the present paper. The main concern of the proposed system is to overcome the obstacle of correctly assigning textual information to web images, while disregarding text that is unrelated to them. The proposed system uses visual cues in order to cluster a web page into several regions and compares this method to the use of semantic information and the realization of a k-means clustering. The evaluation reveals the advantages and disadvantages of the different clustering techniques and confirms the validity of the proposed method for web image indexing",

In order to develop automated user profiling applications facial features are often used for providing the required information related to the user.

The nodes of the proposed tree structure contain viewing elements and in this paper we focus on the extraction of viewing elements for layers 0, and 1. Towards this direction the viewing elements of layer 1 are optimally extracted using an interpolation method, while the viewing element of layer 0 is estimated from the viewing elements of layer 1.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we investigate the utilization of visual saliency maps for ROI-based video coding of video-telephony applications. Visually salient areas indicated in the saliency map are considered as ROIs. These areas are automatically detected using an algorithm for visual attention (VA) which builds on the bottom-up approach proposed by Itti et al. A top-down channel emulating the visual search for human faces performed by humans has been added, while orientation, intensity and color conspicuity maps are computed within a unified multi-resolution framework based on wavelet subband analysis. Priority encoding, for experimentation purposes, is utilized in a simple manner: Frame areas outside the priority regions are blurred using a smoothing filter and then passed to the video encoder. This leads to better compression of both Intra-coded (I) frames (more DCT coefficients are zeroed in the DCT-quantization step) and Inter coded (P,B) frames (lower prediction error). In more sophisticated approaches, priority encoding could be incorporated by varying the quality factor of the DCT quantization table. Extended experiments concerning both static images as well as low-quality video show the compression efficiency of the proposed method. The comparisons are made against standard JPEG and MPEG-1 encoding respectively.",

Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are used to inform citizens about the political stances of the parties that involved in the upcoming elections, in an effort to facilitate their decision making process and increase their participation in this democratic process. VAA is a Web application that calls the users and parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, which are based on the current affairs of their country and then it recommends to each user the party that better fits their political views. SVAAs, a social recommendation approach of VAAs, on the other hand, base their recommendation on the VAA community of users in a collaborative filtering manner.

The degree of consensus and homogeneity in judgements among annotators is very important in semantic image and video retrieval.

A set of 100 images were annotated by 16 annotators using vocabulary keywords and free keywords. The results indicate that combination of annotation methods may lead to increased annotation consistency compared to a single method but this is not a general fact. As expected the use of free keywords and images require tagging that is not directly related to their content, lead to increase the annotators inconsistency.",

Influencer marketing is considered more effective than traditional marketing.

This marketing trend has played an important role in the rise of fake influencers in Twitter. Fake influencers inflate their follower counts by buying fake Twitter accounts from vendors and they manage to partner with companies.

Several methods have been exploited and web image information is extracted from textual sources such as image file names, anchor texts, existing keywords and, of course, surrounding text. However, the systems that attempt to mine information for images using surrounding text suffer from several problems, such as the inability to correctly assign all relevant text to an image and discard the irrelevant text as well. A novel method for extracting web image information is discussed in the present paper. The proposed system uses visual cues in order to cluster a web page into several regions and assign to each hosted image the text that most possibly refers to it. Three different approaches to the problem of text to image assignment are discussed and evaluated. The evaluation procedure indicates the advantages of using visual cues and two dimensional euclidean measures for extracting information for web images",

To achieve this goal, an adaptive two-dimensional Gaussian model of skin color distribution is initially used in order to detect face regions within the initial image. Next each face region is decomposed into three levels with ten subbands, using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and three pairs of subbands are formed (HL3, HL2),(LH3, LH2) and (HH3, HH2). Afterwards Qualified Significant Wavelet Trees (QSWTs), which are derived from the Embedded Zerotree Wavelet (EZW) algorithm and they are high-energy coefficient paths, are estimated for a pair of subbands. Finally visually recognizable watermark patterns are redundantly embedded to the coefficients of the highest energy QSWTs and the IDWT is applied to provide the watermarked face area. Performance of the proposed face region watermarking system is tested under various signal distortions such as JPEG lossy compression, sharpening and blurring. Experimental results on real life images indicate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme.",

On the other hand, opinion mining in social media is nowadays an important parameter of social media marketing. Digital media giants such as Google and Facebook developed and employed their own tools for that purpose. These tools are based on publicly available software libraries and tools such as Word2Vec (or Doc2Vec) and fasttext which, basically, emphasise on topic modelling and extract low level features using deep learning approaches. So far, researchers have focused their efforts on opinion mining and especially sentiment analysis of tweets. This trend reflects the availability of Twitter API that simplifies automatic data (tweet) collection and testing of the proposed algorithms in real situations. However, if we really interested in realistic opinion mining we should consider mining opinions form social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram which are far more popular among everyday people. The basic purpose of this paper is to compare various kind of low-level features, including those extracted through deep learning, as in fasttext and Doc2Vec, and keywords suggested by the crowd, called crowd lexicon herein, through a crowdsourcing platform. The application area is sentiment analysis of tweets and facebook comments on commercial products. We also compare several machine learning methods for the creation of sentiment analysis \u2026",

Sadness, anger, joy, fear, disgust and surprise are categories of expressions that are recognizable across cultures. In this work we form a relation between the description of the universal expressions and the MPEG-4 Facial Definition Parameter Set (FDP). We also investigate the relation between the movement of basic FDPs and the parameters that describe emotion-related words according to some classical psychological studies. In particular Whissel suggested that emotions are points in a space, which seem to occupy two dimensions: activation and evaluation. We show that some of the MPEG-4 Facial Animation Parameters (FAPs), approximated by the motion of the corresponding FDPs, can be combined by means of a fuzzy rule system to estimate the activation parameter. In this way variations of the six archetypal emotions can be achieved. Moreover, Plutchik concluded that emotion terms are unevenly distributed through the space defined by dimensions like Whissel's; instead they tend to form an approximately circular pattern, called 'emotion wheel,' modeled using an angular measure. The 'emotion wheel' can be defined as a reference for creating intermediate expressions from the universal ones, by interpolating the movement of dominant FDP points between neighboring basic expressions. By exploiting the relation between the movement of the basic FDP point and the activation and angular parameters we can model more emotions than the primary ones and achieve efficient \u2026",

However, because this measurement method requires great skill, and has poor reproducibility and objectivity, the development of automatic counting methods has been long anticipated. In this paper we proposed an automated fibers detection method based on a variational formulation of geometric active contours that forces the level set function to be close to signed distance function and therefore completely eliminates the need of the costly re-initialization procedure. The method was evaluated using a ground truth of 29 manually annotated images. The results were encouraging for the further development of the proposed method.",

Considerable research has been carried out into salient region detection methods based either on models emulating human visual attention (VA) mechanisms or on computational approximations. Most of the proposed methods are bottom-up and their major goal is to filter out redundant visual information. In this paper, we propose and elaborate on a saliency detection model that treats a video sequence as a spatiotemporal volume and generates a local saliency measure for each visual unit (voxel). This computation involves an optimization process incorporating inter- and intra-feature competition at the voxel level. Perceptual decomposition of the input, spatiotemporal center-surround interactions and the integration of heterogeneous feature conspicuity values are described and an experimental framework for video classification is set up. This framework consists of a series of experiments that shows the effect of saliency in classification performance and let us draw conclusions on how well the detected salient regions represent the visual input. A comparison is attempted that shows the potential of the proposed method.",

Designed to enhance the political competence of citizens, VAAs have become increasingly popular and institutionally embedded in a growing number of European countries. While the traditional VAA relied on the stated position or academically coded position of parties/candidates, a recent innovation has been to introduce a social vote recommendation borrowing the basic principles of collaborative filtering. The latter takes advantage of the community of VAA users to provide a vote recommendation. This paper provides an overview of the social vote recommendation scheme and tackles three problems related to its optimal implementation in a real\u2013world setting: (1) the number of samples required to train party models; (2) whether this number is affected by \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In many Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) a supplementary question concerning the voting intention of a VAA user is included. The data that are collected through this question can serve a variety of purposes; election forecast being one of them. However, it appears that the majority of VAA users who answer this question select safe choices such as \u201cI prefer not to say\u201d and \u201cI am undecided\u201d. In this study we investigate: (i) at what degree we can predict, with the aid of machine learning techniques, the voting intention of the above-mentioned users using as input their choices in the VAA policy statements, and (ii) whether there is any difference between the population of users who select \u201cI prefer not to say\u201d and those who select \u201cI am undecided\u201d. The results of our study show that we can predict voting intention with accuracy higher than 60%, supposed that sufficient training examples for each party that participates in the elections exist so as to model each party users. Also, it appears that there is significant difference on the distribution per party for the users who select \u201cI prefer not to say\u201d and those who select \u201cI am undecided\u201d. As a consequence of these findings one would suggest that for effective election forecast it is required to (a) distribute the VAA users who select the previously mentioned choices in the voting intention question in a more sophisticated and intelligent way than that followed in traditional poll methods, and (b) the VAA users who select each one of those choices should handled separately.",

Through the analysis and quantification of age progression accuracy in the presence of different conditions, we extract a number of conclusions that take the form of a set of guidelines related to factors that forensic artists and age progression researchers should focus their attention in order to produce improved age progression methodologies.",

Traditional approaches are based on some standard vector space distance metrics (e.g. Euclidean Distance), that measure the distance between the political profile of a voter - expressed by her/his answers on a series of policy statements - against those (answers) of parties / candidates. A new paradigm, the so-called Social Vote Recommendation (SVR), extends traditional VAAs with a peer (i.e., voter to voter) opinion matching based on the principles of collaborative filtering. The problem of vote recommendation in that case is equivalent to the problem of matching a multidimensional vector (profile of the current voter) to a set of vectors (profiles of voters that support a particular political party).

We propose a hierarchical classification scheme which is based on predefined XML-dictionaries of tree form. Every node of such a tree defines a particular classification task while the childs of the node correspond to classification categories. The winning class (subnode) defines the subsequent classification task and the process continues until the leafs of the tree are reached. The final classification task is performed at image segment level; that is every image segment is assigned a particular keyword corresponding to a tree leaf. The path followed from the root of the XML tree to the leafs along with the union of labels assigned to the image segments compose the list of annotation",

Facial animation has gained much interest within the MPEG-4 framework; with implementation details being an open research area (Tekalp, 1999). In this paper, we describe a method for enriching human computer interaction, focusing on analysis and synthesis of primary and intermediate facial expressions (Ekman and Friesen (1978)). To achieve this goal, we utilize facial animation parameters (FAPs) to model primary expressions and describe a rule-based technique for handling intermediate ones. A relation between FAPs and the activation parameter proposed in classical psychological studies is established, leading to parameterized facial expression analysis and synthesis notions, compatible with the MPEG-4 standard.",

A total number of 500 manually annotated images related to athletics domain are used to build and test 8 visual models.

Most emotion-related facial and body gestures are considered to be universal, in the sense that they are recognized along different cultures; therefore, the introduction of an \u201cemotional dictionary\u201d that includes descriptions and perceived meanings of facial expressions and body gestures, so as to help infer the likely emotional state of a specific user, can enhance the affective nature of MMI applications (Picard, 2000).",

            "Abstract": "The topic of face-aging received increased attention by the computer vision community during the recent years. This interest is motivated by important real life applications where accurate age progression algorithms can be used. However, age progression methodologies may only be used in real applications provided that they have the ability to produce accurate age progressed images. Therefore it is of utmost importance to encourage the development of accurate age progression algorithms through the formulation of performance evaluation protocols that can be used for obtaining accurate performance evaluation results for different algorithms reported in the literature. In this paper we describe the organization of the, first ever, pilot independent age progression competition that aims to provide the basis of a robust framework for assessing age progression methodologies. The evaluation carried out involves the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Instagram is a rich source for mining descriptive tags for images and multimedia in general. The tags-image pairs can be used to train automatic image annotation (AIA) systems in accordance with the learning by example paradigm. In previous studies, we had concluded that, on average, 20% of the Instagram hashtags are related to the actual visual content of the image they accompany, i.e., they are descriptive hashtags, while there are many irrelevant hashtags, i.e., stop-hashtags, that are used across totally different images just for gathering clicks and for searchability enhancement. In this paper, we present a novel methodology, based on the principles of collective intelligence that helps in locating those hashtags. In particular, we show that the application of a modified version of the well-known hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm, in a crowdtagging context, provides an effective and consistent way \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A framework that can be used for assessing the suitability of different feature vectors in the task of determining the age similarity between a pair of faces is introduced. This framework involves the use of a dataset containing images displaying compounded types of variation along with the use of an ideal dataset, containing pairs of age-separated face images captured under identical imaging conditions. The use of the ideal dataset in conjunction with deliberate introduction of controlled noise, allows the extraction of conclusions related to the robustness of different feature vectors to different types of noise effects. The ultimate aim of this work is the derivation of comprehensive and accurate set of metrics for evaluating the performance of age progression algorithms in order to support comparative age progression evaluations.",

            "Abstract": "Among a variety of feature extraction approaches, special attention has been given to the SIFT algorithm which delivers good results for many applications. However, the non fixed and huge dimensionality of the extracted SIFT feature vector cause certain limitations when it is used in machine learning frameworks. In this paper, we introduce Spatial Histogram of Keypoints (SHiK), which keeps the spatial information of localized keypoints, on an effort to overcome this limitation. The proposed technique partitions the image into a fixed number of ordered sub-regions based on the Hilbert space- filling curve and counts the localized keypoints found inside each sub-region. The resulting spatial histogram is a compact and discriminative low-level feature vector that shows significantly improved performance on classification tasks. The proposed method achieves high accuracy on different datasets and performs significantly better on scene datasets compared to the Spatial Pyramid Matching method.",

If such entries are significantly present in VAA generated datasets, they can render conclusions drawn from VAA data analysis invalid. In this work we investigate approaches that can be used for automating the process of identifying entries that appear to be suspicious in terms of a users\u2019 answer patterns. We utilize two unsupervised data mining techniques and compare their performance against a well established psychometric approach. Our results suggest that the performance of data mining approaches is comparable to those drawing on psychometric theory with a fraction of the complexity. More specifically, our simulations show that data mining techniques as well as psychometric approaches can be used to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Recommender systems, in the collaborative filtering variation, are popular tools used to drive users out of information clutter, by letting them select \"interesting\" items based on the preferences of similarly minded users. In such a system as more users come in to evaluate items (be they information pieces, products or otherwise), a network of users starts to be formed. In this paper we are interested in the dynamics of such a network, in particular we investigate if there is a hidden law that captures the essence of such networks irrespective of their size. The discovery of such a law would allow, among other usages, generation of synthetic data sets, realistic enough to be used for simulation purposes. Furthermore, it would be useful for information-seeking activities such as locating known experts or influential users on a particular subject. Similar work in related fields suggested the existence of power-laws, which seem to be ubiquitous. However, in our work we did not detect the presence of such a law, instead we discovered an exponential relationship between the nodes of a graph representing users, and edges representing similarity between users. In particular the logarithm of the degree of node is linearly related to the ranking of the node in a decreasing order. The above conclusion is justified by extended experiments on two versions of the movie lens data set (one comprised 100,000 user evaluations, while the other comprised 1,000,0000 evaluations)",

            "Abstract": "Automatic semantic tagging of multimedia is still inefficient due to the difficulties in modelling abstract or complex terms using low level features. The degree of consensus and homogeneity in judgements among annotators is very important in semantic image and video retrieval. In this paper we present a novel method in evaluating the annotators consistency, which uses an innovative database schema and combines two different annotation approaches. A set of 100 images were annotated by 16 annotators using vocabulary keywords and free keywords. The results indicate that combination of annotation methods may lead to increased annotation consistency compared to a single method but this is not a general fact. As expected the use of free keywords and images require tagging that is not directly related to their content, lead to increase the annotators inconsistency",

            "Abstract": "Breathing in asbestos fibers can lead to a number of diseases, the fibers become trapped in the lung and cannot be removed by either coughing or the person's immune system. Atmospheric concentrations of carcinogenic asbestos fibers, have traditionally been measured visually using phase contrast microscopy. However, because this measurement method requires great skill, and has poor reproducibility and objectivity, the development of automatic counting methods has been long anticipated. In this paper we proposed an automated fibers detection method based on a variational formulation of geometric active contours that forces the level set function to be close to signed distance function and therefore completely eliminates the need of the costly re-initialization procedure. The method was evaluated using a ground truth of 29 manually annotated images. The results were encouraging for the further \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, a fully automatic scheme for hiding digital watermarks into face regions is proposed. To achieve this goal, an adaptive two-dimensional Gaussian model of skin color distribution is initially used in order to detect face regions within the initial image. Next each face region is decomposed into three levels with ten subbands, using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and three pairs of subbands are formed (HL3, HL2), (LH3, LH2) and (HH3, HH2). Afterwards Qualified Significant Wavelet Trees (QSWTs), which are derived from the Embedded Zerotree Wavelet (EZW) algorithm and they are high-energy coefficient paths, are estimated for a pair of subbands. Finally visually recognizable watermark patterns are redundantly embedded to the coefficients of the highest energy QSWTs and the IDWT is applied to provide the watermarked face area. Performance of the proposed face region watermarking system is tested under various signal distortions such as JPEG lossy compression, sharpening and blurring. Experimental results on real life images indicate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme.",

The structure of this kind of architectures, which supports clustering of data samples, is favorable for considering clusters as if-then rules. However, in order for real if-then rules to be derived, proper antecedent parts for each cluster need to be constructed by selecting the appropriate subspace of input space that best matches each cluster\u2019s properties. In this paper we address the problem of antecedent part construction by (a) initializing the hidden layer of an RBF-Resource Allocating Network using an unsupervised clustering technique whose metric is based on input dimensions that best relate the data samples in a cluster, and (b) by pruning input connections to hidden nodes in a per node basis, using an innovative Genetic Algorithm optimization scheme.",

In this study we investigate at what degree we can predict, with the aid of machine learning techniques, the voting intention of the above-mentioned users using as input their choices in the VAA policy statements. The results show an accuracy higher than 60%, supposed that sufficient training examples for each party that participates in the elections exist so as to model each party users.
