            "Abstract": "Typically, users interact with database systems by formulating queries. However, many times users do not have a clear understanding of their information needs or the exact content of the database, thus, their queries are of an exploratory nature. In this paper, we propose assisting users in database exploration by recommending to them additional items that are highly related with the items in the result of their original query. Such items are computed based on the most interesting sets of attribute values (or faSets) that appear in the result of the original user query. The interestingness of a faSet is defined based on its frequency both in the query result and in the database instance. Database frequency estimations rely on a novel approach that employs an e-tolerance closed rare faSets representation. We report evaluation results of the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach on both real and synthetic datasets.",

To alleviate these problems, we present a service, the Lockers Rent Service, for keeping the data of mobile users in a secure and safe space in a proxy at the fixed network, thus providing a solution to the device exposure problems. Data stored in data lockers are available even when the mobile device is disconnected.

It is thus in the benefit of both network users and network owners to enforce and maintain this property. In this work, we study the problem of finding a subset of k edges from a set of candidate edges whose addition to a network leads to the greatest reduction in its average shortest path length. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, and show that it is NP-hard and that known approximation techniques are not applicable. We describe an efficient method for computing the exact effect of a single edge insertion on the average shortest path length, as well as several heuristics for efficiently estimating this effect. We perform experiments on real data to study the performance of our algorithms in practice.",

We model the cluster-reformulation problem as a game where peers determine their cluster membership based on potential gains in the recall of their queries. We also define global criteria for the overall quality of the system and propose strategies for peer relocation that consider different behavioral patterns for the peers. Our preliminary experimental evaluation shows that our strategies cope well with changes in the overlay network.",

In this paper, we consider fairness for link analysis and in particular for the celebrated Pagerank algorithm. Given that the nodes in a network belong to groups (for example, based on demographic or other characteristics), we provide a parity-based definition of fairness that imposes constraints on the proportion of Pagerank allocated to the members of each group. We propose two families of fair Pagerank algorithms: the first (Fairness-Sensitive Pagerank) modifies the jump vector of the Pagerank algorithm to enforce fairness; the second (Locally Fair Pagerank) imposes a fair behavior per node. We then define a stronger fairness requirement, termed universal personalized fairness, that asks that the derived personalized pageranks of all nodes are fair. We prove that the locally fair algorithms achieve also universal personalized fairness, and \u2026",

While XML supports expressive query languages such as XPath and XQuery, these languages require the user to know the schema of the data so as to write an appropriate query which may not be feasible in distributed systems with autonomous and dynamic sources. Thus, there is a need for supporting approximate query processing. Furthermore, retrieving the top-fe most relevant results in a distributed system incurs large communication and processing cost, since partial result lists from a number of different sites need to be combined and ranked to assembly the top-fc answers. To address both of these issues, we present an approach for approximate XPath processing over distributed collections of XML documents that relies on the use of a clustered path index, where documents are grouped based on structural \u2026",

The straightforward way of executing such a query is by first reconstructing the whole social graph at the given time instance or interval, and then, evaluating the query on the reconstructed graph. Since social graphs are large, the cost of a complete graph snapshot reconstruction would dominate the cost of historical query execution. Given that many queries are user-centric, ie, node-centric queries that require access only of a targeted subgraph, we propose deploying partial view instead of full snapshot construction and define conditions that determine when a partial view can be used to evaluate a query. We also propose using a cache of partial views to further reduce the query evaluation cost, and show how partial views can be extended to new views \u2026",

Performance results show that the overhead of supporting multiple versions can be kept low while providing a considerable increase in concurrency. Besides increasing the concurrency of client transactions, multiversion broadcast provides clients with the possibility of accessing multiple server states in a single broadcast cycle. Furthermore, multiversioning increases the tolerance of client transactions of disconnections from the broadcast channel.",

In this paper, we assume that we are given the history of a graph in the form of a sequence of graph snapshots. Our goal is to define the different types of queries that one can ask regarding the graph history and present an initial approach to storing graph snapshots and processing historical queries in a native graph database. We define three general types of historical queries, namely, historical graph queries, historical time queries and historical top-k queries. We present two representations of graph snapshots that use either a single or a multi-edge approach. We evaluate the two approaches experimentally for various types of historical reachability queries.",

We study the evolution of such overlays both theoretically and experimentally in terms of stability, optimality, load balance, and the required overhead.

The proposed approach is based on utilizing Web services as interfaces to context sources and dynamically updatable relational views for storing, aggregating and interpreting context. Context rules are employed to provide mappings that specify how to populate context relations, with respect to the different context sources that become dynamically available. An underlying context sources discovery mechanism is utilized to maintain context information up to date as context \u2026",

The patterns that form the rules are selected both from the content of the peers and the query workload of the system according to their popularity.

Each node uses its routing index to route a query towards those of its neighbors that provide the largest number of results. We consider using histograms as routing indexes. We describe a decentralized procedure for clustering similar nodes based on histograms. Similarity between nodes is defined based on the set of queries they match and related with the distance between their histograms.

Often, we consider the interaction between a group and the recommender system as a stand-alone process; the group requests some suggestions from the system and the system answers without any considerations to past interactions. A more realistic scenario is for a system to require access to history logs, and take them into account when recommending items for a group of users. Not only what items the system previously had recommended, but also, how well were these items received by the members of the group. In this work, we propose a sequential group recommender \u2026",

While XML supports expressive query languages such as XPath and XQuery, these languages require schema knowledge so as to write an appropriate query which may not be available in distributed systems with autonomous and dynamic sources. Thus, there is a need for approximate query processing. Furthermore, retrieving the top-k results incurs large communication and processing cost, since partial result lists from numerous sites need to be combined and ranked to assembly the top-k answers. To address both of these issues, we present an approach for approximate XPath processing over distributed collections of XML data based on a clustered path index, where data is grouped based on structural information.

In this work, we aim at studying a mobile computing scenario from the database perspective. Given a global computing environment in which data is kept in a number of small-scale, data-charged, mobile devices that use, eg, wireless networks, for communication, we want to assess the overall data scenario. We use an example to abstract the requirements to such a computing environment and to outline the various existing types of data. Included here are some metadata proposals related to the actual data stored in the device (content data) as well as to the data necessary to the functioning of the device within the computing environment (profile data). The metadata proposals are based on well-known languages and tools such as XML, RDF, UML \u2026",

Most previous work assumes that the underlying network is a static object that remains unchanged as the diffusion process progresses. However, there are several real-life networks that change dynamically over time. In this paper, we study diffusion on such evolving networks and extend the popular Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models to account for network evolution. In particular, we introduce two natural variations, a persistent and a transient one, to capture diffusions of different types. We consider the problem of influence maximization where the goal is to select a few influential nodes to initiate a diffusion with maximum spread. We show that, surprisingly, when considering evolving networks the diffusion function is no longer submodular for the transient models, and not even monotone for the transient Independent \u2026",

To this end, instead of computing scores for all data items in all potential context states, we exploit the hierarchical nature of context attributes to identify representative context states and compute scores for them.

So, it is very crucial to develop methods that answer them efficiently. In this work, we propose a novel method for classifying multidimensional data using an ANN algorithm in the MapReduce framework. Our approach exploits space decomposition techniques for processing the classification procedure in a parallel and distributed manner. To our knowledge, we are the first to study the classification of multidimensional objects under this perspective. Through an extensive experimental evaluation we prove that our solution is efficient and scalable in processing the given queries. We investigate many different perspectives that can affect the total computational cost, such as different dataset distributions, number of dimensions, growth of  value and granularity of space decomposition and prove that our system is efficient, robust and scalable.",

Typically, in such systems, all subscriptions are considered equally important. However, due to the abundance of information, users may receive overwhelming amounts of events. In this paper, we propose using a ranking mechanism based on user preferences, so that only top-ranked events are delivered to each user. Since many times top-ranked events are similar to each other, we also propose increasing the diversity of delivered events. Furthermore, we examine a number of different delivering policies for forwarding ranked events to users, namely a periodic, a sliding-window and a history-based one. We have fully implemented our approach in SIENA, a popular publish/subscribe middleware system, and report experimental results of its deployment.",

We thus define the troll vulnerability prediction problem, where given a post we aim at predicting whether it is vulnerable to trolling. Towards this end, we define a novel troll vulnerability metric of how likely a post is to be attacked by trolls, and we construct models for predicting troll-vulnerable posts, using features from the content and the history of the post.

In the loosely-coupled sharing approach, each peer stores in its local cache results of its own queries and just publishes the associated queries to the index. In the tightly-coupled approach, each peer is assigned a specific part of the query space and stores in its local cache the results of the corresponding queries. Both approaches result in a dynamic organization of content that evolves over time based on the query load, the number of peers and the overall storage available.

            "Abstract": "Supporting top-k queries over distributed collections of schemaless XML data poses two challenges. While XML supports expressive query languages such as XPath and XQuery, these languages require schema knowledge so as to write an appropriate query which may not be available in distributed systems with autonomous and dynamic sources. Thus, there is a need for approximate query processing. Furthermore, retrieving the top-k results incurs large communication and processing cost, since partial result lists from numerous sites need to be combined and ranked to assembly the top-k answers. To address both of these issues, we present an approach for approximate XPath processing over distributed collections of XML data based on a clustered path index, where data is grouped based on structural information. Our method gradually generalizes a query by applying a set of structural transformations to it and the retrieved results are ranked based on the edit distance between two path expressions. A compact indexing data structure is used to reduce the index construction cost. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces the communication cost for retrieving the top-k results, while maintaining a low construction cost for the clustered index.",

Each of the main days of the conference starts out with a keynote by a distinguished scientist: Serge Abiteboul from INRIA in France on April 2; Surajit Chaudhuri from Microsoft Research in the United States on April 3; and Peter Druschel from the Max- Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany on April 4. We thank all the authors who submitted their work to ICDE for making the conference happen. We received 413 paper submissions for the research track, 22 submissions for the industrial track, and 68 demo proposals. The program committee was organized into fifteen topic-based tracks. Each track was headed by a vice-chair who formed a committee to evaluate the papers assigned to that track. This resulted in a research program committee consisting of 188 members for the research tracks, 12 members for the industrial track, and 30 members for the demo track. The evaluation process consisted of three distinct phases: initial reviews of the papers by PC members, some initial discussions, author responses to these reviews, and then further discussion by the PC and fine-tuning of the reviews. The research program features 100 papers, the industrial program 9 papers, and the demonstration program 28 demos. The conference \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Recently, result diversification has attracted a lot of attention as a means to improve the quality of results retrieved by user queries. In this article, we introduce a novel definition of diversity called DisC diversity. Given a tuning parameter r, which we call radius, we consider two items to be similar if their distance is smaller than or equal to r. A DisC diverse subset of a result contains items such that each item in the result is represented by a similar item in the diverse subset and the items in the diverse subset are dissimilar to each other. We show that locating a minimum DisC diverse subset is an NP-hard problem and provide algorithms for its approximation. We extend our definition to the multiple radii case, where each item is associated with a different radius based on its importance, relevance, or other factors. We also propose adapting DisC diverse subsets to a different degree of diversification by adjusting r, that is \u2026",

In this paper, we deal with the maintenance of such clusters in the presence of updates. We model the evolution of the system as a game, where peers determine their cluster membership based on a utility function of the query recall. Peers are guided either by selfish or altruistic motives: selfish peers aim at improving the recall of their own queries, whereas altruistic peers aim at improving the recall of the queries of other peers. We study the evolution of such clusters both theoretically and experimentally under a variety of conditions. We show that, in general, local decisions made independently by each peer enable the system to adapt to changes and maintain the overall recall of the query workload.",

Besides the overall architecture of the proposed framework, we discuss a particular instance where a GSM-enabled camera with temperature, and motion detection sensors is incorporated into our global computing environment.

Most previous work addresses the influence maximization problem of selecting an appropriate set of seed nodes to initiate the diffusion process so that the largest number of nodes is reached. Since the seed selection problem is NP hard, most solutions are sub-optimal. Furthermore, there may be settings in which the seed nodes are predetermined. Thus, a natural question that arise is: given a set of seed nodes, can we select a small set of nodes such that if we improve their reaction to the diffusion process, the largest increase in diffusion spread is achieved? We call this problem, the boost set selection problem. In this paper, we formalize this problem, study its complexity and propose appropriate algorithms. We also evaluate the effect of boosting in a number of real networks and report the increase of influence spread achieved for different seed sets, time limits in the diffusion process and other diffusion parameters.",

Their success lies in their ability to exploit the collective behavior of users in order to deliver highly targeted, personalized recommendations. Given that recommenders learn from user preferences, they incorporate different biases that users exhibit in the input data. More importantly, there are cases where recommenders may amplify such biases, leading to the phenomenon of bias disparity. In this short paper, we present a preliminary experimental study on synthetic data, where we investigate different conditions under which a recommender exhibits bias disparity, and the long-term effect of recommendations on data bias. We also consider a simple re-ranking algorithm for reducing bias disparity, and present some observations for data disparity on real data.",

We identify two basic multiversion organizations, namely vertical and horizontal broadcasts and propose an efficient compression scheme applicable to both.

A decentralized solution to this problem is based on using routing indexes which are data structures that describe the content of neighboring nodes. Each node uses its routing index to route a query towards those of its neighbors that provide the largest number of results. We consider using histograms as routing indexes. We describe a decentralized procedure for clustering similar nodes based on histograms. Similarity between nodes is defined based on the set of queries they match and related with the distance between their histograms. Our experimental results show that using histograms to cluster similar nodes and to route queries increases the number of results returned for a given number of nodes visited.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we deal with context-aware query processing in ad-hoc peer-to-peer networks. Each peer in such an environment has a database over which users want to execute queries. This database involves (a) relations which are locally stored and (b) relations which are virtual or hybrid. In the case of virtual relations, all the tuples of the relation are collected from peers that are present in the network at the time when the query is posed. Hybrid relations involve both locally stored tuples and tuples collected from the network. The collaboration among peers is performed through web services. The integration of the external data, before they are locally collected to a peer's database is performed through a workflow of web service invocations. Summarizing the problem, due to the transitive nature of the extent of virtual relations, we cannot perform query processing in the traditional way, but rather, we have to involve contextaware query processing techniques that exploit the neighborhood of each peer and the web service infrastructure that deals with the heterogeneity of peers. To deal with the aforementioned problem we provide the following contributions. First, we formally define the system model. Next, we define SQLP, an extension of traditional SQL on the basis of contextual environment requirements that concern the termination of queries, the failure of individual peers and the semantic characteristics of the peers of the network. In addition, we precisely define the semantics of SQLP. We discuss issues of data integration, performed through workflows of web services. Moreover, we present a query execution algorithm as well as the formal \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cyberaggression has been found in various contexts and online social platforms, and modeled on different data using state-of-the-art machine and deep learning algorithms to enable automatic detection and blocking of this behavior. Users can be influenced to act aggressively or even bully others because of elevated toxicity and aggression in their own (online) social circle. In effect, this behavior can propagate from one user and neighborhood to another, and therefore, spread in the network. Interestingly, to our knowledge, no work has modeled the network dynamics of aggressive behavior. In this paper, we take a first step towards this direction, by studying propagation of aggression on social media. We look into various opinion dynamics models widely used to model how opinions propagate through a network. We propose ways to enhance these classical models to accommodate how aggression may propagate from one user to another, depending on how each user is connected to other aggressive or regular users. Through extensive simulations on Twitter data, we study how aggressive behavior could propagate in the network. We validate the models with ground truth crawled and annotated data, reaching up to 80% AUC. We discuss the results and implications of our work.",

In this paper, we are focusing on controlling the data bias in entity resolution (ER) tasks aiming to discover and unify records/descriptions from different data sources that refer to the same real-world entity. We formally define the ER problem with fairness constraints ensuring that all groups of entities have similar chances to be resolved. Then, we introduce FairER, a greedy algorithm for solving this problem for fairness criteria based on equal matching decisions. Our experiments show that FairER achieves similar or higher accuracy against two baseline methods over 7 datasets, while guaranteeing minimal bias.",

            "Abstract": "In distributed computing, the notion of mobility is emerging in many forms and applications. Increasingly, many users are not tied to a fixed access point but instead use mobile hardware such as cellular phones or personal digital assistants. Small devices (eg, sensors) are mounted on moving objects such as vehicles or airplanes. Furthermore, mobile software (ie, code or data that move among network locations) offers a new form of building distributed network-centric applications. In the presence of mobility, the cost of communicating with a mobile object or invoking it is augmented by the cost of locating it (ie, identifying its current location). Often, mobility is related to wireless mobile computing [9, 14, 32], because wireless communications allow the free movement of users. Future personal communication systems (PCSs) will support a huge object population and offer numerous customer services. In such systems, the signaling and directory traffic for locating mobile users is expected to increase dramatically [45]. Thus, deriving efficient strategies for locating mobile users (ie, identifying their current location) is an issue central to wireless mobile computing research.Besides mobility tied to wireless hardware, data, or code may be relocated among different network sites for reasons of performance or availability. Mobile software agents [1, 44] are a popular form of mobile software. Mobile agents are processes that may be dispatched from a source computer and be transported to remote servers for execution. Mobile agents can be launched into an unstructured network and roam around to accomplish their task [2], thus providing an efficient \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Due to the structural heterogeneity of XML, queries are often interpreted approximately. This is achieved by relaxing the query and ranking the results based on their relevance to the original query. Query relaxation over distributed XML repositories may incur large communication costs, since partial result lists from different sites need to be gathered and ranked to assembly the overall top-k results. To process such queries efficiently, we propose using a distributed clustered index to group documents based on their structural similarity. The clustered index proves to be very effective in reducing the sizes of the partial lists that need to be combined. Furthermore, it can be used as the basis of a pay-as-you-go approach, where clusters of documents are accessed gradually providing the user with increasingly improving results. To reduce the cost of constructing and maintaining the clustered index, we use a compact data \u2026",

While there has been a variety of context middleware infrastructures and context\u2010aware applications, little work has been done on integrating context into database management systems. The purpose of this paper is to consider a preference database system that supports context\u2010aware queries, that is, queries whose results depend on the context at the time of their submission.The paper proposes using data cubes to store the dependencies between context\u2010dependent preferences and database relations and on\u2010line analytical processing techniques for processing context\u2010aware queries. This allows for the manipulation of the captured context data at various levels of abstraction, for instance, in the case of a context parameter representing location, preferences \u2026",

By collecting and indexing the state of a graph at various time instances we are able to perform queries on its entire history and thus gain insight into its fundamental features and attributes. This calls for advanced solutions for graph history storing and indexing that are capable of supporting application queries efficiently while coping with the aggravated space requirements. To this end, we advocate a purely vertex-centric storage model that is asymptotically space-optimal and more space efficient than any other proposal to date. In addition to space efficiency, the model\u2019s purely vertex-centric approach shows great promise with respect to the efficiency and functionality of update and query operations. Furthermore, we make a qualitative comparison with other general methods for graph history storage identifying the pros \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Location-based social sites, such as Foursquare or Yelp, are gaining increasing popularity. These sites allow users to check in at venues and leave a short commentary in the form of a micro-review. Micro-reviews are rich in content as they offer a distilled and concise account of user experience. In this paper we consider the problem of predicting the topic of a micro-review by a user who visits a new venue. Such a prediction can help users make informed decisions, and also help venue owners personalize users\u2019 experiences. However, topic modeling for micro-reviews is particularly difficult, due to their short and fragmented nature. We address this issue using pooling strategies, which aggregate micro-reviews at the venue or user level, and we propose novel probabilistic models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for extracting the topics related to a user-venue pair. Our best topic model integrates influences from both venue inherent properties and user preferences, considering at the same the sentiment orientation of the users. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model compared to simpler models and previous work; they also show that venue-inherent properties have higher influences on the topics of micro-reviews.",

            "Abstract": "All e-government plans have the main goal to simplify interaction among citizens and the Public Administration by means of the development of interorganizational network services where all involved Public Administrations cooperate to initiate, synchronize and monitor all processes needed for a given service, and to guarantee the global coherency of data related to a given service in several Public Administrations. There is now a big general effort to define common standards and protocols to represent and communicate structured information and services (XML, UDDI, SOAP) that simplify the definition of integrated network services. It is important however to observe that the problem to define inter-organizational services is primarily an organizational one, that is, even a complete solution to the problem of accessing services and exchanging information would not help the deployment of inter-organizational services unless we also consider problems like how such services are currently handled by the organizations, how the responsibilities for the services are assigned, how the organizations keeps track of the status of the services.",

            "Abstract": "Social media and online social networks are playing an increasingly important role in our lives, as they attract millions of users around the world. Twitter, one of the most popular micro-blogging services, holds a special position among them, since information shared through this service spreads faster than it would have been possible with traditional sources. There are many interesting works analyzing the information that flows through Twitter. Most of such research focuses on trending topic detection, ie what are the people talking about right now. We propose a new method to detect topics using a graph, where nodes correspond to terms and edges correspond to co-occurrence of the two terms in the tweet stream. Dense subgraphs, of this graph, pose special interest, as the nodes that are highly connected share a special relation. Thus, the corresponding terms potentially share a relation too. To explore this fact, we apply a community detection algorithm on the graph. The resulting communities correspond to topics related to various real world events. Experimental evaluation of the results of this technique is also provided on both synthetic and real data.",

CoWSAMI balances the trend between the resource limitations of available context sources and the resource requirements introduced by the aforementioned standard, by employing WSAMI, a lightweight middleware infrastructure for the development of mobile Web services. CoWSAMI provides a dynamic and highly scalable service discovery mechanism that deals with the increased behavioral mobility of available context sources. CoWSAMI further handles the behavioral heterogeneity of available context sources through a mechanism that gathers contextual information while adapting its proper behavior to the interfaces of context sources. Finally, CoWSAMI allows querying for contextual information with respect to the aforementioned organization, though a classical SQL-based interface.",

Our performance results indicate that in certain cases, our service discovery mechanism outperforms even the case in which service indexes are fully replicated at all system sites.",

Given this sequence, we seek to find the top-  most durable matches  of an input graph pattern query, that is, the matches that exist for the longest period of time. The straightforward way to address this problem is to apply a state-of-the-art graph pattern matching algorithm at each snapshot and then aggregate the results. However, for large networks and long sequences, this approach is computationally expensive, since all matches have to be generated at each snapshot, including those appearing only once. We \u2026",

Each agent A maintains a limited size local cache in which it keeps information about k different resources, that is, for each of the k resources, it stores the contact information of one agent that provides it. The agents in the cache of agent A are called A\u2019s neighbors. An agent searching for a resource contacts its local cache and if there is no information for the resource, it contacts its neighbors, which in turn contact their neighbors and so on until the resource is found in some cache.

We consider keyword queries and support Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) semantics for defining query results, where the relevance of each document to a query is determined by properties of the LCA of those nodes in the XML document that contain the query keywords. To avoid evaluating queries against each document in a collection, we propose maintaining in a preprocessing phase, information about the LCAs of all pairs of keywords in a document and use it to approximate the properties of the LCA-based results of a query.

Recently, they have attracted the attention of researchers in other fields, such as databases where they capture soft criteria for queries. Databases bring a whole fresh perspective to the study of preferences, both computational and representational. From a representational perspective, the central question is how we can effectively represent preferences and incorporate them in database querying. From a computational perspective, we can look at how we can efficiently process preferences in the context of database queries. Several approaches have been proposed but a systematic study of these works is missing.

Most often, users have different preferences depending on context. In this paper, we introduce a model for expressing such contextual preferences. Context is modeled as a set of multidimensional attributes. We formulate the context resolution problem as the problem of (a) identifying those preferences that qualify to encompass the context state of a query and (b) selecting the most appropriate among them. We also propose an algorithm for context resolution that uses a data structure, called the profile tree, that indexes preferences based on their associated context.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we consider large graphs that evolve over time, such as graphs that model social networks. Given two instances of the graph at two points in time, we ask to identify the top pairs of nodes whose shortest path distance has decreased the most. We call these pairs converging. The straightforward way to address this problem is by computing the shortest path distances of all pairs at both instances and keeping the ones with the largest differences. Since for large networks this is computationally infeasible, we consider a budgeted version of the problem, where given a fixed budget of single-source shortest path computations, we seek to identify nodes that participate in as many converging pairs as possible. We evaluate a number of different approaches for our problem, that employ centrality-based, dispersion-based, and landmark-based distance estimation metrics. We also consider a classification-based approach that builds a classifier that combines the above features for predicting whether a node participates in one of the top converging pairs. We present experimental results using realworld datasets that show that we are able to identify the large majority of the top converging pairs on a very small budget.",

Each peer in such an environment has a database over which users execute queries. This database involves (a) relations which are locally stored and (b) virtual relations, all the tuples of which are collected from peers that are present in the network at the time when a query is posed. The objective of our work is to perform query processing in such an environment and, to this end, we start with a formal definition of the system model. Next, we formally define SQLP, an extension of SQL that covers the termination of queries, the failure of individual peers and the semantic characteristics of the peers of such a network. Moreover, we present a query execution algorithm as well as the formal definition of all the operators that take place in a query execution plan.",

The cornerstone of the proposed infrastructure is the fact that we replace the traditional treatment of databases as persistent collections of records by the assumption that a database relation is a collection of records dynamically compiled from such ad-hoc sets of peers. Each peer offers data to the relations through a workflow of Web services. Another aspect of our approach is that we confine query processing over specific sets of peers that we call communities.

            "Abstract": "Many real-world phenomena are best represented as interaction networks with dynamic structures (e.g., transaction networks, social networks, traffic networks). Interaction networks capture flow of data which is transferred between their vertices along a timeline. Analyzing such networks is crucial toward comprehend- ing processes in them. A typical analysis task is the finding of motifs, which are small subgraph patterns that repeat themselves in the network. In this paper, we introduce network flow motifs, a novel type of motifs that model significant flow transfer among a set of vertices within a constrained time window. We design an algorithm for identifying flow motif instances in a large graph. Our algorithm can be easily adapted to find the top-k instances of maximal flow. In addition, we design a dynamic programming module that finds the instance with the maximum flow. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on three real datasets and identify flow motifs which are significant for these graphs. Our results show that our algorithm is scalable and that the real networks indeed include interesting motifs, which appear much more frequently than in randomly generated networks having similar characteristics.",

Our proposed filters, called multi-level Bloom filters, are based on extending Bloom filters so that they maintain information about the structure of the documents. In addition, we advocate building a hierarchical organization of nodes by clustering together nodes with similar content.

Multiversion (MV) data broadcast, i.e., data broadcast in which more than one value is broadcast per data item, has the advantage of allowing more client transactions to read consistent data and complete their operation successfully. Naturally, the MV broadcast can satisfy both historical queries in which a client accesses many versions of the same data item and snapshot queries in which a client accesses different data items of the same version. Furthermore, multiple versions increase clients' tolerance to network disconnections that are common in wireless communications. In this paper, we expand our previous work on MV broadcasts to support efficient selective tuning. Selective tuning is important for energy constraint mobile devices since it enables the client to be active \u2026",

In such systems, users subscribe to the dissemination ser-vice by providing interest profiles. These profiles are then used to determine which information should be delivered to which users, whenever new information is entered into the system. A main shortcoming of existing dissemination systems is the lack of any access control mechanisms, en-abling selective information dissemination based for example on security or other regulatory policies. In this paper, we present an access control model suitable for dissemi-nation systems. The model is based on user profiles containing both user interests and user credentials (ie, a set of attributes characterizing users for access control purposes). Information is then filtered before being delivered to users on the basis of both the user interests and creden-tials. To make authorization manageable when dealing with very large information systems, our model supports autho-rization domains, that allow one to group together information objects to which the same access control policies apply.",

We also propose algorithms for context resolution based on data structures that index preferences by exploiting the hierarchical nature of the context attributes.

However, in a real-life scenario, it is expected that the history of previous recommendations is exploited to tailor the recommendations towards meeting the needs of the group members. Such history should include not only which items the system suggested, but also the reaction of the members to these items. This work introduces the problem of sequential group recommendations, by exploiting the concept of satisfaction and disagreement. Satisfaction describes how well the group received the suggested items. Disagreement describes the satisfaction bias among the group members.

            "Abstract": "The problem of team formation in a social network asks for a set of individuals who not only have the required skills to perform a task but who can also communicate effectively with each other. Existing work assumes that all links in a social network are positive, that is, they indicate friendship or collaboration between individuals. However, it is often the case that the network is signed, that is, it contains both positive and negative links, corresponding to friend and foe relationships. Building on the concept of structural balance, we provide definitions of compatibility between pairs of users in a signed network, and algorithms for computing it. We then define the team formation problem in signed networks, where we ask for a compatible team of individuals that can perform a task with small communication cost. We show that the problem is NP-hard even when there are no communication cost constraints, and we provide heuristic algorithms for solving it. We present experimental results with real data to investigate the properties of the different compatibility definitions, and the effectiveness of our algorithms.",

The key requirement is to maintain all transaction properties as far as possible. We discuss three scenarios for databases on mobile clients, summarize typical applications and requirements for each of the three scenarios, and outline open research issues within each of the three scenarios. While the first scenario consists of mobile clients that are connected to a wired network, the second scenario consists of a network of mobile clients with a single-hop distance to each other but without a wired network, and the third scenario considers a network of mobile clients some of which are in multi-hop distance. The focus of our contribution is on distinguishing open problems from known solutions for each of the three scenarios. As the scenarios are increasingly challenging, we have identified additional requirements that occur within each new scenario compared to the previously discussed scenario.",

We have reached a point where the promise of information access anywhere and anytime is close to realization. The enabling technology, wireless networks, exists; what remains to be achieved is providing the infrastructure and the software to support the promise. Universal access and management of information has been one of the driving forces in the evolution of computer technology. Central computing gave the ability to perform large and complex computations and advanced information manipulation. Advances in networking connected computers together and led to distributed computing.

In this paper, we specifically address cache management, an issue that has been a main source of criticism for the applicability of such protocols.

This not only saves both the restrictive resources of the wireless devices such as computational power and energy but also improves the overall protocol performance. We use Bloom filters as summaries. Our experimental results using the ns simulator show that both resource savings and performance improvements are attained when such filters are integrated within the DSR protocol which is one the most widely used instance of an on demand protocol",

We identify two basic multiversion organizations, namely Vertical and Horizontal broadcasts, and propose an efficient compression scheme applicable to both. The compression can significantly reduce the size of the broadcast and consequently, the average access time, while it does not require costly decompression. Both organizations and the compression scheme were evaluated using simulation.",

Given a sequence of graph snapshots representing the state of the graph at different time instants, we seek to find the most durable matches of an input graph pattern query, that is, the matches that exist for the longest period of time. The straightforward way to address this problem is by running a state-of-the-art graph pattern algorithm at each snapshot and aggregating the results. However, for large networks this approach is computationally expensive, since all matches have to be generated at each snapshot, including those appearing only once. We propose a new approach that uses a compact representation of the sequence of graph snapshots, appropriate time indexes to prune the search space and a threshold on the duration of the pattern to determine the search order.

This creates a directed network of caches.

Peers are guided either by selfish or altruistic motives: selfish peers aim at improving the recall of their own queries, whereas altruistic peers aim at improving the recall of the queries of other peers. We study the evolution of such clusters both theoretically and experimentally under a variety of conditions. We show that, in general, local decisions made independently by each peer enable the system to adapt to changes and maintain the overall recall of the query workload.",

We provide analytical results for the performance of a number of flooding-based approaches that differ in the set of neighbors contacted at each step. The performance metrics we are interested in are the probability of locating a resource and the average number of steps and messages for doing so. We study both uniformly random resource requests and requests in the presence of popular (hot) resources. Our analysis is also extended to take \u2026",

We start by proposing measures for identifying bias in the dataset (i.e., in the KG) and then present two methods for testing whether any bias in the dataset is amplified by the embeddings. First, we look for gender-specific occupation analogies in the embeddings. Second, we test whether link prediction (i.e., occupation prediction in our case) aggregates gender bias by proposing gender-dominated occupations to people of the corresponding gender more often than expected. Then, we use a debiasing approach based on projections on the gender subspace. We present experimental results using the Wikidata dataset and pretrained TransE embeddings. Our results show that there exists gender bias in the dataset and that such bias is amplified by the \u2026",

However, this new freedom of movement does not come without new challenges. The mobile computing environment is constrained in many ways. Mobile elements are resource-poor and unreliable. Their network connectivity is often achieved through low-bandwidth wireless links. Furthermore, connectivity is frequently lost for variant periods of time. The difficulties raised by these constraints are compounded by mobility that induces variability in the availability of both communication and computational resources. These severe restrictions have a great impact on the design and structure of mobile computing applications and motivate the development of new software models.

In this paper, we propose a new, intuitive definition of diversity called DisC diversity. A DisC diverse subset of a query result contains objects such that each object in the result is represented by a similar object in the diverse subset and the objects in the diverse subset are dissimilar to each other. We show that locating a minimum DisC diverse subset is an NP-hard problem and provide heuristics for its approximation. We also propose adapting DisC diverse subsets to a different degree of diversification. We call this operation zooming.

Users can be influenced to act aggressively or even bully others because of elevated toxicity and aggression in their own (online) social circle. In effect, this behavior can propagate from one user and neighborhood to another, and therefore, spread in the network. Interestingly, to our knowledge, no work has modeled the network dynamics of aggressive behavior. In this paper, we take a first step towards this direction by studying propagation of aggression on social media using opinion dynamics. We propose ways to model how aggression may propagate from one user to another, depending on how each user is connected to other aggressive or regular users. Through extensive \u2026",

Creating personalized views provides a more efficient way of data processing than directly issuing complex queries to the data sources especially in the case of lightweight and wireless clients that suffer from scarce local resources, limited bandwidth and high communication costs.

Most previous approaches focus on suggesting links that are highly likely to be adopted. In this paper, we add a different perspective to the problem by aiming at recommending links that also improve specific properties of the network. In particular, our goal is to recommend to users links that if adopted would improve their centrality in the network. Specifically, we introduce the centrality-aware link recommendation problem as the problem of recommending to a user u, k links from a pool of recommended links so as to maximize the expected decrease of the sum of the shortest path distances of  to all other nodes in the network. We show that the problem is NP-hard, but our optimization function is monotone and sub-modular which guarantees a constant approximation ratio for the greedy algorithm. We present \u2026",

By placing copies of data items closer to their requesters, the response time of queries can be improved. An additional reason for replication is load balancing. For instance, by allocating many copies to popular data items, the query load can be evenly distributed among the servers that hold these copies. Similarly, by eliminating hotspots, replication can lead to a better distribution of the communication load over the network links. Besides performance-related reasons, replication improves system availability, since the larger the number of copies of an item, the more site failures can be tolerated.

To alleviate these problems, we present a service, the Lockers Rent Service, for keeping the data of mobile users in a secure and safe space in a proxy at the fixed network, thus providing a solution to the device exposure problems. Data stored in data lockers are available even when the mobile device is disconnected.

Context includes lighting, noise level, network connectivity, communication costs, communication bandwidth, and even the social situation; eg, whether you are with your manager or with a co-worker.Context has been tied to ubiquitous computing, although the term has had several meanings that differ subtly. One challenge of mobile distributed computing is to exploit the changing environment with a new class of applications that are aware of the context in which they are run. Such context-aware software adapts according to the location of use, the collection of nearby people, hosts, and accessible devices, as well as to changes to such things over time.

Tracking mobile objects, i.e. identifying their current location, is central to such settings. In this paper, we exploit the use of hierarchical distributed location databases, where each database site covers a specific geographical region and contains location information about all objects residing in it.

We define the Continuous k-Diversity Problem along with appropriate constraints that enforce continuity requirements on the diversified results. Our proposed approach is based on cover trees and supports dynamic item insertion and deletion.

            "Abstract": "In peer-to-peer systems, replication is an important issue as it improves search performance and data availability. It has been shown that optimal replication is attained when the number of replicas per item is proportional to the square root of their popularity. In this paper, we focus on updates in the case of optimal replication. In particular, we propose a new practical strategy for achieving square root replication called pull-then-push replication (PtP). With PtP, after a successful search, the requesting node enters a replicate-push phase where it transmits copies of the item to its neighbors. We show that updating the replicas can be significantly improved through an update-push phase where the node that created the copies propagates any updates it has received using similar parameters as in replicate-push. Our experimental results show that replicate-push coupled with an update-push strategy achieves \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The growth of online services has created the need for duplicate elimination in high-volume streams of events. The sheer volume of data in applications such as pay-per-click clickstream processing, RSS feed syndication and notification services in social sites such Twitter and Facebook makes traditional centralized solutions hard to scale. In this paper, we propose an approach based on distributed filtering. To this end, we introduce a suite of distributed Bloom filters that exploit different ways of partitioning the event space. To address the continuous nature of event delivery, the filters are extended to support sliding window semantics. Moreover, we examine locality-related tradeoffs and propose a tree-based architecture to allow for duplicate elimination across geographic locations. We cast the design space and present experimental results that demonstrate the pros and cons of our various solutions in different \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Temporal graphs represent relationships and interactions among entities over time, such as those occurring among users in social, transaction, and telecommunication networks. The analysis of their temporal structure help us understand, and predict the behavior of their entities. A typical analysis task in graph networks is the finding of all appearances of an input graph pattern query. Such appearances are called matches. In this paper, we are interested in finding all matches of an interaction pattern query within temporal graphs. To this end, we propose a hybrid approach that achieves effective filtering of potential matches based both on structure and time. Our approach exploits a graph representation where edges are ordered by time. We present experiments with real datasets that illustrate the efficiency of our approach.",

            "Abstract": "Since most graphs evolve over time, it is useful to be able to query their history. We consider historical reachability queries that ask for the existence of a path in some time interval in the past, either in the whole duration of the interval (conjunctive queries), or in at least one time instant in the interval (disjunctive queries). We study both alternatives of storing the full transitive closure of the evolving graph and of performing an online traversal. Then, we propose an appropriate reachability index, termed TimeReach index, that exploits the fact that most real-world graphs contain large strongly connected components. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of all approaches, for different graph sizes, historical query types and time granularities.",

            "Abstract": "The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massive research effort in both industry and academia. Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggest packages of items to single users, or single items to groups of users. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications, such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups, entertainment packages to groups of friends, or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we formulate the P2G problem, and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a group towards a package, incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We also investigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises in our setting \u2026",

Compared to traditional techniques, such as dimensionality reduction, our method exhibits better behavior in that it maintains the average topology of shapes independently of the number of points used to represent them and is more resilient to noise. An efficient algorithm is presented based on an incremental \"fattening,\" of the query shape until the best match is discovered. The algorithm uses simplex range search techniques and fractional cascading to provide an average polylogarithmic time complexity on the total number of shape vertices. The algorithm is extended to perform additional fast approximate matching, when there is no image sufficiently similar to the query image. We present techniques for the efficient external storage of the shape base and of the \u2026",

We build concept hierarchies based on the location data. These hierarchies define mapping among different granularities of locations. One such hierarchy is to generate domain knowledge about the cities that belong to a state. The hierarchies are used as distributed directories to assist in finding the database or relation that contains the values of the location-dependent attribute in a particular location. We extend concept hierarchies to include spatial indexes on the location-dependent attributes. Finally, we discuss how to partition and replicate relations based on the location to process the queries \u2026",

In this paper, we consider a database system that supports context-aware preference queries, that is, preference queries whose result depends on the context at the time of their submission. We use data cubes to store the associations between context-dependent preferences and database relations and OLAP techniques for processing context-aware queries, thus allowing the manipulation of the captured context data at different levels of abstractions. To improve query performance, we use an auxiliary data structure, called context tree, which indexes the results of previously computed preference-aware queries based on their associated context. We show how these cached results can be used to process both exact and approximate context-aware preference queries.",
