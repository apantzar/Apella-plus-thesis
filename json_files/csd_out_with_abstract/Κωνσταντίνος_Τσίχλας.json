            "Abstract": "The top-k dominating query returns the k database objects with the highest score with respect to their dominance score. The dominance score of an object p is simply the number of objects dominated by p, based on minimization or maximization preferences on the attribute values. Each object (tuple) is represented as a point in a multidimensional space, and therefore, the number of attributes equals the number of dimensions. The top-k dominating query combines the dominance concept of skyline queries with the ranking function of top-k queries and can be used as an important tool in multi-criteria decision making systems. In this work, we focus on the 2-dimensional space and present, for the first time, novel algorithms for top-k dominating query processing in main memory with non-trivial asymptotic guarantees. In particular, we focus on both the semi-dynamic case (only insertions are allowed) and the fully-dynamic case (insertions and deletions are supported). We perform a detailed cost analysis regarding the worst-case complexity of preprocessing, the worst-case complexity for the query cost and the worst-case and amortized complexity for updates (insertions and deletions) focusing on the RAM computation model. Our solutions require space linear with the number of points, which is very important especially for modern applications which manipulate massive datasets. In addition, we discuss the case of the word-RAM computation model, where slightly better results are obtained.",

The second algorithm extracts common motifs from a set of N \u2265 2 weighted sequences with hamming distance e.

As in the case of clustering, the application of different criteria leads to different definitions for an outlier. In this work, we focus on distance-based outliers: an object x is an outlier if there are less than k objects lying at distance at most R from x. The problem offers significant challenges when a stream-based environment is considered, where data arrive continuously and outliers must be detected on-the-fly. There are a few research works studying the problem of continuous outlier detection.

            "Abstract": "The polygon retrieval problem on points is the problem of preprocessing a set of  points on the plane, so that given a polygon query, the subset of points lying inside it can be reported efficiently. It is of great interest in areas such as Computer Graphics, CAD applications, Spatial Databases and GIS developing tasks. In this paper we study the problem of canonical -vertex polygon queries on the plane. A canonical -vertex polygon query always meets the following specific property: a point retrieval query can be transformed into a linear number (with respect to the number of vertices) of point retrievals for orthogonal objects such as rectangles and triangles (throughout this work we call a triangle orthogonal iff two of its edges are axis-parallel). We present two new algorithms for this problem. The first one requires  space and  query time. A simple modification scheme on first algorithm lead us to a second solution, which consumes  space and  query time, where  denotes the size of the answer and  is the number of vertices. The best previous solution for the general polygon retrieval problem uses  space and answers a query in  time, where  is the number of vertices. It is also very complicated and difficult to be implemented in a standard imperative programming language such as C or C++.",

We wish to develop an architecture that can support range queries in such large-scale decentralized environments and can scale in terms of the number of nodes as well as in terms of the data items stored.

One of the most widely employed criteria for determining whether an element is an outlier is based on the number of neighboring elements within a fixed distance (R), against a fixed threshold (k). Such outliers are referred to as distance-based outliers and are the focus of this work. In this demo, we show both an extendible framework for outlier detection algorithms and specific outlier detection algorithms for the demanding case where outlier detection is continuously performed over a data stream. More specifically: i) first we demonstrate a novel flavor of an open-source publicly available tool for Massive Online Analysis (MOA) that is endowed with capabilities to encapsulate algorithms that continuously detect outliers and ii) second \u2026",

Although the problem is intractable, we propose practical anytime solutions that are capable of outperforming those simple heuristics and yielding allocation plans in seconds even when optimizing large flows on ordinary machines.

A canonical k-vertex polygon query always meets the following specific property: a point retrieval query can be transformed into a linear number (with respect to the number of vertices) of point retrievals for orthogonal objects such as rectangles and triangles (throughout this work we call a triangle orthogonal iff two of its edges are axis-parallel).

We present in brief the theoretical algorithmic analysis, in which our proposed structure is based on, and we describe thoroughly the key aspects of the implementation. Conducting experiments, we verify that the implemented structure outperforms other well-known hierarchical tree-based structures, since it provides better complexities regarding load-balancing operations. More specifically, the structure achieves a logarithmic amortized bound, using an efficient deterministic load-balancing mechanism, which is general enough to be applied to other hierarchical tree-based structures. Moreover, we investigate the structure's fault tolerance, which hasn't been sufficiently tackled in previous work, both theoretically and through rigorous experimentation. We prove that D3-Tree is highly fault tolerant, since, even for massive node failures, it achieves a significant success rate in element queries. Afterwards we go one step further, in order to achieve sub-logarithmic complexity and propose the ART+ structure (Autonomous Range Tree), exploiting the excellent performance of D3-Tree. ART+ is a fully dynamic and fault-tolerant structure, which achieves sub-logarithmic performance for query and update operations and performs load-balancing in sub-logarithmic amortized cost.",

            "Abstract": "Complex networks constitute a recurring issue in the analysis of neuroimaging data. Recently, network motifs have been identified as patterns of interconnections since they appear in a significantly higher number than in randomized networks, in a given ensemble of anatomical or functional connectivity graphs. The current approach for detecting and enumerating motifs in brain networks requires a predetermined motif repertoire and can operate only with motifs of small size (consisting of few nodes).There is a growing interest in methodologies for frequent graph-based pattern mining in large graph datasets that can facilitate adaptive design of motifs. The results presented in this paper are based on the graph-based Substructure pattern mining (gSpan) algorithm and introduce a manifold of ways to exploit it for data-driven motif extraction in connectomics research.Functional connectivity graphs from \u2026",

This problem asks for the design of a data structure, maintaining a set of stored elements and supporting the following two operations: insert  and precedes . The operation insert (a)  introduces a new element a  in the structure, while the operation  precedes  (a,b)  returns true iff element a  was inserted before element b  temporally. In [11] a solution was provided to the problem with worst-case time complexity O (log log n ) per operation and O(n  log log n)  space, where n  is the number of elements inserted. It was also demonstrated that the precedes  operation has a lower bound of \u03a9 (log log n ) for the Pure Pointer Machine  model of computation.

To this extend, we study the convergence of repeatedly applying local rules on a network, and touch on the expressive power of this model. We look at network systems and study their behavior when different types of local rules are applied on them. For a very general class of local rules, we prove convergence and provide a certain member of this class that, when applied on a graph, efficiently computes its k-core and its (k-1)-crust giving hints on the expressive power of such a model. Furthermore, we provide guarantees on the speed of convergence for an important subclass of the aforementioned class. We also study more general rules, and show that they do not converge. Our counterexamples resolve an open question of (Zhang, Wang, Wang, Zhou, KDD- 2009) as well, concerning whether a certain process converges. Finally, we show the universality of our network system, by providing a local rule under which it is Turing-Complete.",

While there has been a number of works that index the historical data in a time-centric manner (i.e. according to the time instance an update event occurs), in this work, we focus on the less-explored vertex-centric storage approach (i.e. according to the entity in which an update event occurs).

This is useful, since the goal of energy efficiency at the household level can be achieved through energy-saving policies towards changing the behavior of the consumers. This requires as a prerequisite to be able to measure the energy consumption at the appliance level. The purpose of this study is to present some initial results towards this goal by making heavy use of the characteristics of a particular din-rail meter, which is provided by Meazon S.A. Our thinking is that meter-specific energy disaggregation solutions may yield better results than general-purpose methods, especially for sophisticated meters. This meter has a 50 Hz sampling rate over 3 different lines and provides a rather rich set of measurements with respect to the extracted features. In this paper we aim at evaluating the set of features generated by the smart meter. To this end, we use well-known supervised machine learning models and test their effectiveness on certain appliances when selecting specific subsets of features. Three algorithms are used for this purpose: the Decision Tree Classifier, the Random Forest Classifier, and the Multilayer Perceptron Classifier. Our experimental study shows that by using a specific set of features one can enhance the classification performance of these algorithms.",

Taking into consideration that most of the \u201ckiller\u201d applications require a graph-based representation (eg, the Web, social network management, protein-protein interaction networks), efficient query processing and analysis techniques are required, not only because these graphs are massive but also because the operations that must be supported are complex, requiring significant computational resources. In many cases, each graph edge e is annotated by a probability value p (e), expressing its existential uncertainty. This means that with probability p (e) the edge will be present in the graph and with probability 1\u2212 p (e) the edge will be absent. This gives rise to the concept of probabilistic graphs (also known as uncertain graphs). Formally, a probabilistic graph G is a triplet (V, E, p) where V is the set of nodes, E is the set of edges and p: E\u2192(0, 1]. The main challenge posed by this formulation is that problems that are relatively easy to solve in exact graphs become very difficult (or even intractable) in probabilistic graphs. In this paper, we perform an overview of the algorithmic techniques proposed in the literature for uncertain graph analysis. In particular, we center our focus on the following graph mining tasks: clustering, maximal cliques, k-nearest neighbors and core decomposition. We conclude the paper with a short discussion related to distributed mining of uncertain graphs which is expected to achieve significant performance improvements.",

When the gap is bounded in a small range              c             , we propose an algorithm with              O             ((             c2              +              \u03c32             )             mN2n              log(             Nn             ) +              \u03b1             ) time complexity. Here,              N              is the number of strings,              n              the mean length of each string,              m              the multiplicity of the multirepeat and              \u03b1              the number of reported occurrences.

Weighted sequences are used extensively as profiles for protein families, in the representation of binding sites and often for the representation of sequences produced by a shotgun sequencing strategy. We present various fundamental pattern matching problems on weighted sequences and their respective algorithms. In addition, we define two matching probabilistic measures and we give algorithms for each of these measures. The uncertainty introduced in weighed sequences can also be used as a means to perform approximate string matching. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these problems are tackled in this setting.",

Second, the methods applied in this structure can be easily used to transform ordinary priority queues into min-max priority queues. Third, when considering only the setting of min-max priority queues, we support merging in constant worst-case time which is a clear improvement over the best worst-case bounds achieved by H\u00f8yer.",

Weighted sequences are an extension of classical strings, where in each position every letter of the alphabet may occur with some probability. Previous results presented a PTAS and noticed that no FPTAS is possible unless P=NP. In this paper we essentially close the gap between upper and lower bounds by improving both. First of all, we provide an EPTAS for bounded alphabets (which is the most natural case), and prove that there does not exist any EPTAS for unbounded alphabets unless FPT=W[1]. Furthermore, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, we provide a lower bound which shows that no significantly better PTAS can exist for unbounded alphabets. As a side note, we prove that it is sufficient to work with only one threshold in the general variant of the problem.",

Therefore, no matter how big memories become, there is always the need to store data in secondary or even tertiary storage to facilitate access. Even if the data set can fit in main memory, there is still a need to organize data to enable efficient processing. In this chapter, we discuss the most important issues related to the design of efficient access methods (ie, indexing schemes), which are the fundamental tools in database systems for efficient query processing. For the rest of the discussion, we are going to use the terms access method and index interchangeably. Take, for example, a large data set containing information about millions of astronomical objects (eg, stars, planets, comets). An astronomer may require some information out of this data set. Therefore, the most natural way to proceed is to store the data set in a database management system (DBMS) in order to enjoy SQL-like query formulation. For example, a possible query in natural language is:\u201cshow me all stars which are at most 1000 light-years away from the sun.\u201d To answer such a query efficiently, one should avoid the exhaustive examination of the whole data set. Otherwise, the execution of each query will occupy the system for a long period of time, which is not practical and leads to performance degradation.For the rest of the discussion, we are mainly interested in disk-based access methods, where the data set as well as the auxiliary data structures to facilitate access reside on magnetic disks.
