Vertical Handover (VHO) operations play a central role in such a setting, enabling the dynamic association of wireless users with the most appropriate wireless networks among those available, towards improved effectiveness according to a host of relevant criteria. At the same time, the efficiency of executing the VHO operations themselves is also a factor affecting the overall system effectiveness. Although several aspects of VHO operations have been investigated in the literature, energy efficiency has not received so much attention yet. Towards closing this gap, the paper investigates the energy requirements associated with the execution of the VHO, by expressing the relevant operations as a \u2026",

The proposed analysis is applied to the random access procedure within LTE-A for the calculation of the average overall delay, by considering multiple classes of M2M devices with diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. The QoS differentiation is expressed through different Access Class Barring (ACB) parameters and backoff times for the various QoS classes. For the packet arrival process of M2M devices we consider an ON-OFF arrival process, which is a realistic approach, especially for M2M communications in Smart Grid environments. Furthermore, the proposed analysis is suitable for smart grid communication networks, where multiple M2M gateways are installed in different points of the network. The comparison of analytical results with simulations reveals the high accuracy \u2026",

End-to-End delivery of services over heterogeneous environments with quality of service guarantees is a major challenge for research community with no apparent unified solution. In this paper, the perspective for End-to-End (E2E) QoS is outlined in the view of ENTHRONE (End-to-End QoS through Integrated Management of Content, Networks and Terminals) project. The aim is to develop an integrated network management solution that will handle in a homogeneous manner a number of network segments, including wired (IP based core network) and wireless (DVB, WLAN, UMTS), segments. Apart from implementing the management functions, enforcing policies and making provisioning decisions for optimising the usage of network resources, the solution will also provide service level monitoring functions for in-service verification of offered services by verifying whether the committed QoS performance guarantees are in fact being met. The overall network architecture, certain operational scenarios alongside remedial actions to QoS degradation are focal points of this paper.",

At the same time taking into account the heterogeneity of the systems included in the IIoT ecosystem and the non-institutionalized interoperability in terms of hardware and software, serious issues arise as to how to secure these systems. In this framework, given that the protection of industrial equipment is a requirement inextricably linked to technological developments and the use of the IoT, it is important to identify the major vulnerabilities and the associated risks and threats and to suggest the most appropriate countermeasures. In this context, this study provides a description of the attacks against IIoT systems, as well as a thorough analysis of the solutions for these attacks, as they have been proposed in the most recent literature.",

Towards these, we firstly describe the deployment of AWM and Traffic Shaping software modules in each intermediate node (Cell Main Node-CMN) of the broadcasting network and secondly we proceed with the experimental evaluation. The experimental results showed not only AWM's efficiency to achieve the set fairness goal but also revealed AWM's capacity, when compared to Traffic Shaping, to provide for much lower TCP Round Trip Times (88% less) and zero retransmissions; a result which could, in principle, lead to less TCP rate variations and thus less \u2026",

More specifically, we aim to (a) control the local environment where the femtocell is placed within, by efficiently managing the total incoming traffic load and by continuously adjusting the distribution of the backhaul capacity among the coexisting networks and (b) control the macro\u2013femto interference caused by macrocell users transmitting close to the femtocell by investigating the \u201cfemtocell as a relay\u201d concept. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated via simulation results showing that the overall performance of a HetNet environment can be leveraged in terms of QoS requirements, energy saving and data rate enhancement.",

In order to avoid proprietary and custom implementation solutions, an initial and generic active services reference architecture that can be followed by potential active services developers is presented.

We propose a relay selection policy that, by exploiting the benefits of buffering at the relays, decouples the receiving relay at the previous time slot to be the transmitting relay at the next slot. Furthermore, we impose an interference cancellation threshold allowing the relay that is selected for reception to decode and subtract the inter\u2010relay interference. The proposed relaying scheme selects the relaying pair that maximises the average capacity of the relay network.

When using omnidirectional antennas, this information is difficult to be calculated in order to find the Blind Node's (BLN or BN) position. Also, the combination of Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) systems with angle-based techniques is not the best option when tracking down an unknown target, especially indoors, due to the large bandwidth of the UWB signals and the huge number of paths. This paper proposes a geometrical angle-based positioning approach for UWB omnidirectional systems which also combines Fingerprint (FP) and Time-of-Flight (ToF), aiming to calculate the BN's position with the minimum positioning error.

            "Abstract": "The content delivery chain encompasses content creation, delivery and consumption. To support this, the content has to be identified, described, generated, delivered, managed and protected. Furthermore, content/services of different format will be distributed over heterogeneous networks and delivered on a variety of user terminals. The scarce resource of bandwidth needs to be dynamically managed and the QoS should remain within predefined limits, accepted by the end users. This will enable the provision of network and terminal resources on demand to form user communities, where the content can be created, protected and shared, always with the agreed/contracted quality, reliability and flexibility. It is therefore imperative to develop an integrated solution that is able to manage the functionality of various entities in the digital information distribution chain, from content/service generation to user terminals, using heterogeneous networks, comprised of wired (IP based core network) and wireless (DVB, WLAN, UMTS) segments, and based on the end-to-end QoS approach. The aim of this work is to propose and to build a suitable testbed environment where such a solution, namely the approach of ENTHRONE (End-to-End QoS through Integrated Management of Content, Networks and Terminals), can be tested and demonstrated. In this respect, an operational networking infrastructure is outlined which can be used as a test bed to demonstrate, in real conditions, the functionalities and the performance of ENTHRONE approach to E2E QoS provisioning.",

The data communication system is based on wireless personal area networks that support IP technology for connecting all nodes and network entities with a sink node which is the gateway to the remote management and monitoring service. The proposed system maintains lighting at a low level until vehicle or pedestrian motion is detected by a set of proximity sensors. In this case, the level of lighting is increased in order to provide better visibility while the area is occupied and dims to a lower level when the area is clear again. At the same time, data regarding lamp parameters like status and operation dimming level are transferred to the management system via a bidirectional channel that may receive feedback based on a certain system operation \u2026",

Network traffic analysis products have emerged in response to attackers\u2019 relentless innovation, offering organizations a realistic path forward for combatting creative attackers. Additionally, thanks to the widespread adoption of cloud computing, Device Operators (DevOps) processes, and the Internet of Things (IoT), maintaining effective network visibility has become a highly complex and overwhelming process. What makes network traffic analysis technology particularly meaningful is its ability to combine its core capabilities to deliver malicious intent detection. In this paper, we propose a novel darknet traffic analysis and network management framework to real-time automating the malicious intent detection process, using a weight agnostic neural networks architecture. It is an effective and accurate computational intelligent forensics tool for network traffic analysis, the demystification of malware traffic, and encrypted traffic identification in real time. Based on a weight agnostic neural networks (WANNs) methodology, we propose an automated searching neural net architecture strategy that can perform various tasks such as identifying zero-day attacks. By automating the malicious intent detection process from the darknet, the advanced proposed solution is reducing the skills and effort barrier that prevents many organizations from effectively protecting their most critical assets.

The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via simulations and comparisons with another state-of-the-art DPS selection scheme, in terms of UE transitions between Transmission Points (TPs) and throughput. The results show that LOCH achieves significantly less transitions, while having the same or better throughput performance. Thus, the current work can be the base for other future works that will aim to the reduction of the CoMP signaling load, as well as to the reduction of the CoMP traffic load at the backhaul network.",

However, current IEEE 802.21 specifications lack the definition of a handover signalling procedure that would drive to optimal handover performance. Therefore, in this paper, an enhanced media independent handover procedure is proposed that goes one step ahead by ensuring that IEEE 802.21 messages are compiled more efficiently.

More specifically, it presents the link between emotional intelligence and six variables, very significant for a better and more effective working environment. Furthermore, it can be a kind of help for managers and researchers to better realize the relationship between EI and the other factors, its effectiveness so to incorporate training programs in courses and in companies based on EI and empathy.",

These results are subsequently employed for optimally tuning the timeout parameters, towards achieving the greatest network coding efficiency (and the corresponding throughput and energy efficiency improvement) that is possible for the given traffic profile, subject to a delay-related QoS requirement.

Cloud infrastructures are typically based on virtualised environments, to allow physical infrastructure to be shared by multiple end users. These infrastructures can be very large and complex, with many end users, making their configuration difficult, error-prone and time-consuming. At the same time, the fact that diverse end users share the same physical infrastructure raises security concerns, and can lead to a significant impact from misconfiguration or being slow to react to attacks.

            "Abstract": "In this work, we propose a buffer-aided successive opportunistic relay scheme where each time a relay-pair is selected with the target of rate maximization. Due to overlapping transmissions by the source and the relay which transmits to the destination, inter-relay interference arises. The efficient mitigation of inter-relay interference either through cancellation or avoidance, requires increased channel state information. Thus, in order to reduce the implementation complexity induced by centralized selection, distributed switch-and-stay combining is combined with buffer-aided successive opportunistic relaying. In this way, by applying a rate threshold we can avoid increased relay-pair switching and channel state information acquisition. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulations and comparisons with other state-of-the-art relay selection policies.",

Plasticity processes operate in both normal development and in the development following early injury. However, as the neural system matures, there is a gradual commitment of neural resources to, maturationally defined functions and a concomitant loss in flexibility and in the capacity of the system to reorganize. Brain plasticity has been intertwined with induced reorganization of local patterns of connectivity in the neural system, whose specification and stabilization relies on dynamic processes that are the product of the multidirectional interaction of genetic processes, contingencies of input and the demands of the learning environment. Moreover, bioenergetic challengesexercise, diet and activity in neuronal circuits-synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, are innately connected to cognitive function, such as learning, memory, attention, emotion regulation and human behavior.",

DPCF extends the operation of the Point Coordination Function (PCF) defined in the IEEE 802.11 Standard to operate over wireless networks without infrastructure. In PCF, a central point coordinator polls the users to get access to the channel and data collisions are completely avoided, thus yielding high performance. In order to extend its high performance to networks without infrastructure, the DPCF is proposed in this paper as a combination of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and the PCF. The general idea is to combine a dynamic, temporary, and spontaneous clustering mechanism based on DCF with the execution of PCF within each cluster.

In addition, all power state levels used by the IEEE 802.11 standard are considered in the analysis. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IEEE 802.11 energy model is more accurate than previous approaches, and it overcomes the modeling limitations of previous works which are becoming more significant in newer versions of IEEE 802.11 standard. Finally, by providing a clearer insight into the backoff factors, the proposed model lends itself to the use of arbitrary (generic) backoff window schemes, allowing the comparison of the energy efficiency of various alternatives for the backoff window growth.",

Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, a user that receives a data packet with unrecoverable errors can request retransmission from any of the other users in the transmission range of the transmitter that overheard the original transmission. These users can act as spontaneous relays and provide the communication with cooperative diversity gains. Upon retransmission request, the relays have to contend for the access to the channel. The DQCOOP protocol has been proposed in the literature as a high-performance MAC protocol for this kind of scenario. In this paper we theoretically evaluate its performance. The analytical results are supported by computer-based simulation that show the accuracy of the analysis.",

In addition, we discuss the level of efficiency exhibited by each relay class, regarding their impact in delay-critical applications and green communications applications, while aiming at a specific security level at the physical layer. Then, relay selection policies are proposed taking into consideration the goals set by each application. Numerical evaluation of the proposed policies in terms of the average secrecy rate, average delay and power reduction show improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art solutions.",

Regardless the fact that radio resource management continues to be a major research problem in coexisting heterogeneous wireless networks, a mentality shift is observed in the research community towards dealing with wired backhaul bottleneck situations, too. Hence, specific small cell network deployments such as the one considered in this paper have to adopt an integrated quality of service provisioning approach. A femtocell utilizing an existing internet protocol (IP) infrastructure has usually to share the backhaul capacity with several IP networks. As these networks do not provide an efficient admission control process, the capacity allocated to the femtocell can fluctuate unpredictably over time.

Compared to the general case where the interworking networks are independent, the case of femtocells interworking with pre-existing wireless networks poses more challenges due to the sharing of the same backhaul capacity. Therefore, while a user is practically able to initiate the same service through multiple network interfaces, he is allocated capacity from the same capacity pool. However, while the femtocell inherits the QoS mechanisms of cellular networks and is able to provide a reliable CAC, this does not apply to the IP-based networks and that may drastically affect the performance of the femtocell.

            "Abstract": "The paper discuses how the imminent transition to the digital terrestrial television in UHF (Digital Switchover) could be employed towards enabling always-on connectivity and triple-play services access even from rural and dispersed locations, ie in areas where no termination/connection exists between the local PSTN exchanger and the optical fibre core backbone. Exploiting the European digital video broadcasting standard in regenerative configurations, the paper introduces an architecture that utilises the television stream as a common broadband infrastructure, capable to deliver not only custom digital television bouquets, but also and most predominant, to provide access to triple-play services. Utilising this television beam in backhaul (middle-mile) configurations it extends the core backbone to reach rural and dispersed locations, enabling therefore the immediate and cost-effective deployment (in these areas) of technologies that provide for always-on connectivity, such as WLAN, xDSL, etc.",

The power saving is accomplished by fixing a predefined Quality of Service (QoS) indicator in the system through the demanded application Symbol Error Rate (SER). The obtained results are encouraging as they show a great decrease in the system power budget. The multiuser system capability is also exploited to achieve larger power saving values, by scheduling the user with the best channel characteristics at each time instant. The system saved power is then presented through a closed form expression and compared its results to computer simulations where a very tight performance is obtained.",

An autonomic system is self-configuring, self-optimizing, self-healing and self-protecting.

On the other hand, numerous Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address the problem of congestion in the Internet. Their performance is highly dependent on parameters\u2019 setting and tuning. Besides that, most of the AQM algorithms focus on throughput optimization and fail to provide bounded transmission delay while providing high link utilization to popular TCP-based radio/video streaming applications.

However, it has been observed that when MPEG-DASH users, sharing the same access network, request, in parallel, the offered video content, QoE unfairness occurs: some users receive video content that corresponds to a high QoE level whereas all others do not. As a reason for this result, literature points out the inter-dynamics between TCP's congestion avoidance mechanism and the on-off operational pattern of MPEG-DASH switching logic. In this paper, we try to shed some more light on this QoE unfairness issue by investigating how the segment duration of the video content can effect the MPEG-DASH users' QoE level.

In our previous work we proved that the central network presents significant gains in terms of throughput, delay and energy efficiency when applying the proposed scheme.

The second subsystem takes as input the output of the data gathering subsystem and triggers optimization decisions on spectral resources.

Therefore, based on models of both CSMA and centralized MAC protocols, a new model is presented to accurately calculate the saturation throughput of DQMAN in single-hop networks. In addition, the model presented can be extended to any MAC protocol based on the spontaneous clustering concept of DQMAN. The accuracy of the overall model has been assessed through link-level computer simulations. A performance evaluation of the protocol under different configurations is also presented together with a performance comparison with the IEEE 802.11 standard.",

A distinction is made between rural and urban areas and how the approach is realized in each case, followed by a performance evaluation of the concept and a vision of how this may be implemented in future fused environments that encompass altenative communication technologies.The next article,\u201cRequirements for an IMS-Based Quadruple Play Service Architecture\u201d by A. Al-Hezmi et al., represents the current effort to utilize the promising IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) as a cooperative service delivery platform to support quadruple play services (voice, video, data, and mobility). The approach suggests using the IMS as an overlay control subsystem over heterogeneous access systems, enabling a convergence of fixed and mobile systems and supporting service mobility. Using a set of scenarios for quadruple play services, the authors propose a delivery platform based on TISPAN and the IMS, and outline the main building blocks (ie, access and core network, control layer, service enabler layer, and application layer). A prototype implementation is described, comprising a subset of these components and considering DVB-H and UMTS access systems. The last two articles focus on important applications delivered over a converged system. In particular,\u201cAffordable Mobile TV Services in Hybrid Cellular and DVB-H Systems\u201d by D. G\u00f3mez-Barquero et al. describes the provision of lowcost mobile TV services over hybrid DVB-H and third-generation (3G) infrastructures.

Trust establishment frameworks provide the means for representing, evaluating, maintaining and distributing trust within the network, and serve as the basis for higher level security services. In this paper, we propose a trust establishment framework targeted sensor networks that can uniformly support the needs of nodes with highly diverse network roles and capabilities, by exploiting the pre-deployment knowledge on the network topology and the information flows. The framework allows for flexibility by combining aspects from alternative approaches on trust establishment on common evaluation metrics, and enables controlled trust evolution based on the network pre-configuration.

Being interested to exploit MPEG-DASH paradigm for transferring video services over interactive digital broadcasting networks, we discuss, in this paper, how these broadcasting networks can provide QoE fairness to their MPEG-DASH users. In more detail, we propose the elevation of the broadcasting networks' edge routers to QoE fairness nodes able to enforce any QoE fairness policy to their MPEG-DASH users. Towards validating our approach, we integrated in each edge router a Traffic Shaper, to be used as a QoE fairness module, and run several experiments that verified the QoE unfairness issue, besides \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The information theoretic principles of Maximum Entropy (ME) and Minimum Relative Entropy (MRE) are employed, as leastbiased methods of inference, towards the analysis of a multihop ad hoc system with bursty arrivals and repetitive service (RS) blocking. The system consists of K MAC layer and R IP layer finite capacity links together with a shared medium which forwards from the MAC layer to higher layer (IP) links in a determined fashion.The traffic at each MAC layer link is assumed to be bursty and is modeled by a compound Poisson process (CPP) with geometrically distributed batches. The shared medium provides generalized exponential (GE) type of service whilst each output link forms a single GE-type server queue under a first-come-first-served (FCFS) rule. To this end, an approximate MRE decomposition algorithm is proposed for the partitioning of the shared medium with its associated MAC layer links into ordinary finite capacity virtual queues with or without server vacations, respectively and modified service times. Consequently, each queue is analysed in isolation by exploiting a stochastic relationship between polling time and server vacation. Moreover, the IP layer links are analysed separately as GE-type finite capacity queues. Finally, the individual sub-systems, as building block queues, are combined together via an iterative process which is based on a MRE solution for arbitrary open queueing network models (QNMs) with RS blocking and GE-type flow formulae.",

In this paper, we propose a Mobile Cloud Resources Provisioning (MCRP) scheme, which is flexible enough to adapt to the various general MCC reference use cases being described.

Consequently, traffic characterization of such video services is essential for efficient traffic control and resource management via the adaptation of the video properties in the design of communication and transmission networks. The new H. 264/AVC standard, proposed by the ITU-T Video Coding Expert Group (VCEG) and ISO/IEC Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG), was designed satisfying two challenging tasks: Considerably higher coding efficiency and improved network adaptation compared to the already widely used standards. Hence, H. 264, featuring slice partitioning, Intra refreshing, separation of picture and sequence data from slice data, provides robustness during transmission, setting it the most appropriate video coding standard for error prone environments. This paper, based on a previously published frame and layer statistical analysis of H. 264 encoded sources, proposes a Markov modified model of H. 264 unconstraint VBR traffic.",

The objective of the proposed mechanism is quality of service (QoS) satisfaction for the scheduled user. The QoS is represented by the application demanded data rate and symbol error rate. The power outage problem is considered and a practical method to minimize the outage probability is proposed. The obtained results are encouraging as they show a great decrease in the system power budget. The multiuser system capability is also exploited to achieve larger power saving values and smaller probability of power outage by scheduling the user with the best channel characteristics at each time instant. The amount of saved power and the power outage probability are both presented through closed-form expressions. These theoretical results are compared to computer simulations, which show very good agreement in performance.",
