            "Abstract": "In this paper, a software-based system for the real-time synchronization of images captured by a low-cost camera framework is presented. It is most well suited for cases where special hardware cannot be utilized (e.g. remote or wireless applications) and when cost efficiency is critical. The proposed method utilizes messages to establish a consensus on the time of image acquisition and NTP synchronization of computer clocks. It also provides with an error signal, in case of failure of the synchronization. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm using a precise LED array system (1ms accuracy) proves the effectiveness of this method.",

            "Abstract": "A fundamental assumption in most contemporary person re-identification research, is that all query persons that need to be re-identified belong to a closed gallery of known persons, ie, they have been observed and a representation of their appearance is available. For several real-world applications, this closed-world assumption does not hold, as image queries may contain people that the re-identification system has never observed before. In this work, we remove this constraining assumption. To do so, we introduce a novelty detection mechanism that decides whether a person in a query image exists in the gallery. The re-identification of persons existing in the gallery is easily achieved based on the persons representation employed by the novelty detection mechanism. The proposed method operates on a hybrid person descriptor that consists of both supervised (learnt) and unsupervised (hand-crafted) components. A series of experiments on public, state of the art datasets and in comparison with state of the art methods shows that the proposed approach is very accurate in identifying persons that have not been observed before and that this has a positive impact on re-identification accuracy.",

This mode of locomotion is comprised of two strokes, with the arms opening slowly and closing rapidly, and generally results in considerable propulsive acceleration. In light of the recent development by our group of an octopus-like eight-arm underwater robot, we are interested to analyze the details of the biological arm swimming motion, in order to understand its kinematics. In this paper, we address methodological aspects of the 3D reconstruction process of octopus arm trajectories, based on computer vision, and present the resulting arm swimming movement of a benthic common octopus. The 3D trajectories of all eight octopus arms were tracked and analyzed, providing information about speed, acceleration and arm elongation. The animal's performance is then used for a direct comparison with our 8-arm robotic swimmer \u2026",

The implementation of this approach exhibits reduced hardware cost, is based on open designs, and can be replicated with ease. The design and implementation of a contactless scanner and its software are proposed. The scanner regards the photographic digitization of planar and approximately planar surfaces and is proposed as a cost-efficient alternative to off-the-shelf solutions. The result is 19.8 Kppi micrometer scans, in the service of several applications. Accurate surface mosaics are obtained based on a novel image acquisition and image registration approach that actively seeks registration cues by acquiring auxiliary images and fusing proprioceptive data in correspondence and registration tasks.

This search is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective function quantifies the discrepancy of the depth measurements between the hypothesized views to the reference view. The method is demonstrated in several data sets including ones with known ground truth and comparatively evaluated with respect to state of the art methods. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in accuracy and tolerance to occlusions.

To this end, our group has been investigating the use of visual information, obtained by the real-time analysis of the images acquired from the capsule's on-board camera, for implementing appropriate such automated behaviours through visual servoing [1-3] techniques. The above concepts are demonstrated here by simulations of a visual servoing scheme for navigating the capsule by aligning its line-of-sight with the GIT, as it is propelled forward, based on the detection of the intestinal lumen in the acquired images. Active locomotion of the capsule is attained by two onboard vibratory motors, generating propulsive and steering forces for planar movement.",

The plane-sweeping approach is reviewed as relevant to the goal of time-efficiency, since its execution can be optimized on a GPU. A method compatible for optimization on the GPU is proposed as a more accurate alternative to plane sweeping and to the derived visibility computation. The method is compared to plane sweeping as to its accuracy, by evaluating the backprojected 3D model against independent views and using n-fold cross validation to estimate the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Finally, the method's output is casted integratable with multicamera stereo reconstruction frameworks.",

The presented algorithm makes no assumption on camera loci and outputs an occupancy voxel grid, with occupied voxels being accompanied by a surface normal. It is correlation-based, however, outperforms the conventional correlation-based approach in reconstruction quality.

We studied 197 newly diagnosed and never-treated individuals with hypertension, intermediate hypertensive phenotypes, and normal BP, classified by use of 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Sodium excretion and microalbuminuria were estimated in 24-hour urine samples, dermal capillary density was estimated from capillaroscopy, and arterial stiffness was estimated with pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx). Sodium excretion correlated with microalbuminuria (p<0.001) and 24-hour and day- and nighttime systolic BP, but not with office blood pressure, arterial stiffness, or capillary density. In the multivariate analysis, the association with microalbuminuria was maintained (p=0.007). In a population free from the long-standing effects of hypertension, increased salt intake appears to be associated with early signs of vascular kidney damage, rather than a diffuse micro- and macrovascular impairment.",

Representation is expected to capture the wide spectrum of knowledge that a HC covers, from objects and their making, to hand gestures and tool uses that define craft motor skills, to the societal value, economic impact, and historical significance of HCs. Presentation is expected to address the need of exploiting Representation to conserve cultural resources, contribute to their accurate interpretation, provide essential and authentic experiences, as well as stimulate revenues of cultural resources through thematic tourism.

This paper presents an approach for accurate and efficient 3D pose estimation from 2.5D range images. Initialized with an approximate pose estimate, the proposed approach refines it so that it accurately accounts for an acquired range image. This is achieved by using a hypothesize-and-test scheme that combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and graphics-based rendering to minimize a cost function of object pose that quantifies the misalignment between the acquired and a hypothesized, rendered range image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the approach compared to the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that is commonly used for pose refinement.",

To this end, this research work underlines the importance of aligning and fine-tuning Virtual Humans\u2019 appearance to their roles and highlights the importance of affective components. Building realistic Virtual Humans was traditionally a great challenge requiring a professional motion capturing studio and heavy resources in 3D animation and design. In this paper, a workflow for their implementation is presented, based on current technological trends in wearable mocap systems and advancements in software technology for their implementation, animation, and visualization. The workflow starts from motion recording and segmentation to avatar implementation, retargeting, animation, lip synchronization, face morphing, and integration to a virtual or physical environment. The testing of the workflow occurs in a use case for the Mastic Museum of Chios and the implementation is validated both in a 3D virtual environment accessed through Virtual Reality and on-site at the museum through an Augmented Reality application. The findings, support the initial hypothesis through a formative evaluation, and lessons learned are transformed into a set of guidelines to support the replication of this work.",

This paper presents a passive approach to the problem of person tracking that is based on a network of conventional color cameras. The proposed approach exhibits robustness to challenging conditions that are encountered in industrial environments due to illumination artifacts, occlusions and the highly dynamic nature of the observed scenes.

            "Abstract": "Being a goal over decades, the extension of television, and visual communications in general, to the third dimension (3DTV) has been almost reached. Currently, 3D motion pictures are shown in theatres and the first 3D broadcasts are being planned to initiate in the next few years. Albeit the progress, state of the art has not yet reached the goal of acquiring a three-dimensional scene in full detail and creating a precise optical duplicate at remote site in real-time. Limitations in reconstruction accuracy and visual quality as well as user acceptance of pertinent technologies have, to date, prevented the creation of infrastructures for the delivery of 3D content to mass markets. Thereby, relevant scientific research is at the center of interest regarding the improvement of current 3DTV technologies. The goal of 3DTV involves the collaboration of researchers in multiple scientific disciplines as well as the integration of pertinent results, in order to provide end-users with a fully functional system. The tasks of \u201ccapture and representation of 3D scene information,\u201d\u201crepresentation of the digital 3DTV signal,\u201d\u201cstorage and transmission of the digital 3DTV signal,\u201d as well as \u201cdisplay of the reproduced 3D scene\u201d constitute a chain of operations that are essential for reaching this goal. In this context, this special issue presents contributions along the whole chain of computational tasks that are required to implement 3DTV. In addition, the last two papers provide with contributions that go beyond the simple presentation of 3D visual data and propose ways of interacting with them.The paper \u201cMulti-view shooting geometry for multiscopic rendering with controlled distortion \u2026",

The most effective strategy for dealing with this challenge is to proceed according to the model-based paradigm, which involves building 3D models of objects and then determining object poses by fitting their models to new images with the aid of detected features. This paper proposes a model-based approach for estimating the full pose of known objects from natural point features. The method employs a projective imaging model and incorporates reliable automatic mechanisms for pose initialization and convergence. Furthermore, it is extendable to multiple cameras without the need to perform multi-view matching and relies on sparse structure from motion techniques for the construction of object models offline. Experimental results demonstrate its accuracy and robustness.",

The proposed approach utilizes templates to increase robustness and an image scale-space to detect bubbles independently of their size. Furthermore, algorithmic optimizations for the proposed approach that target the reduction of computational complexity and user-intervention are proposed and compiled into a software application.

            "Abstract": "The Clean Space initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA) seeks to decrease the environmental impact of space programmes by focusing, among others, on Active Debris Removal (ADR) and eDeorbit. In this direction, one of the main challenges is to autonomously track and approach a big non-cooperative satellite such as ENVISAT. To achieve the high level of autonomy required in this phase of the ADR mission, vision based navigation will guide a chaser spacecraft in real-time based on high-definition images acquired and processed on-board at high frame-rates. The increased complexity of these computer vision algorithms mandates the development and use of high performance avionics to provide one order of magnitude faster execution than today's conventional space-grade processors.

The employed computational infrastructure consists of a network of four PC workstations each of which is connected to a pair of cameras. One of the PCs is equipped with a GPU that is used for parallel computations. The result of the processing is a list of texture mapped triangles representing the reconstructed surfaces. In contrast to previous works, the entire processing pipeline (foreground segmentation, 3D reconstruction, 3D mesh computation, 3D mesh smoothing and texture mapping) has been implemented on the GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that an accurate, high resolution, texture-mapped 3D reconstruction of a scene observed by eight cameras is achievable in real time.",

This method is based on the establishment of correspondences between landmarks on their boundaries and, in turn, on the establishment of correspondences of the boundary pieces in between these landmarks. The method yields more correct correspondences than conventional methods that scale the arc-length descriptions of silhouettes to align them. The selection of landmarks is investigated as to the robustness of their localization and their perceptual relevance. Matching of silhouettes is then achieved by quantifying the dissimilarity of a pair of silhouette boundaries, based on a novel dissimilarity metric. The matching procedure is evaluated, based on retrieval experiments, and it is concluded that the precision of the results is higher than that obtained by conventional pointwise comparison methods.",

In this work, we propose an approach for understanding and articulating human motion recordings into multimodal datasets and VR demonstrations of actions and activities relevant to traditional crafts. To implement the proposed approach, we introduce Animation Studio (AnimIO) that enables visualisation, editing, and semantic annotation of pertinent data. AnimIO is compatible with recordings acquired by Motion Capture (MoCap) and Computer Vision. Using AnimIO, the operator can isolate segments from multiple synchronous recordings and export them in multimodal animation files. AnimIO can be used to isolate motion segments that refer to individual craft actions, as described by practitioners. The proposed approach has been iteratively designed for use by non-experts in the domain of 3D motion digitisation. View Full-Text",

Object shape and location become visible when motion parallax or stereo cues are provided. SNT consists of a great many high luminosity spots, each tiny in size, distributed randomly (using the uniform distribution) on an otherwise dark surface. The spots are indistinguishable from point sources when imaged, yielding a Starry Night Image (SNI). A single number (the \u201cdensintensity\u201d) characterizes the expected number of spots of criterion luminance or brighter, per unit area. To achieve invariance of the image statistics across changes in surface distance, the luminance of the spots is distributed as the square of reciprocal luminance. To achieve invariance across slants, spots are flat on the surface. The resulting Starry Night Image (SNI) is itself an SNT.",

We consider deviations from the ideal that are needed to realize the texture in practice.

The camera pose estimation problem is solved by estimating the relative pose between the views from which the images were acquired. The eye shape estimation problem parameterizes the shape and orientation of an ellipsoidal model for the eye.

The 3D reconstruction of the unknown object is achieved by tracking the known 3D tool and by carving out the space it occupies as a function of time. Due to this indirection, SfI reconstructs rigid objects regardless of their material and appearance properties and proves particularly useful for the cases of textureless, transparent, translucent, refractive and specular objects for which there exists no practical vision-based 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, object concavities that are not directly observable can also be reconstructed.

            "Abstract": "In recent years, research efforts seeking to provide more natural, human-centered means of interacting with computers have gained growing interest. A particularly important direction is that of perceptive user interfaces, where the computer is endowed with perceptive capabilities that allow it to acquire both implicit and explicit information about the user and the environment. Vision has the potential of carrying a wealth of information in a non-intrusive manner and at a low cost, therefore it constitutes a very attractive sensing modality for developing perceptive user interfaces. Proposed approaches for vision-driven interactive user interfaces resort to technologies such as head tracking, face and facial expression recognition, eye tracking and gesture recognition. In this paper, we focus our attention to vision-based recognition of hand gestures. The first part of the paper provides an overview of the current state of the art regarding the recognition of hand gestures as these are observed and recorded by typical video cameras.

In this approach, the whole scene is assumed to be region-wise planar. These planar regions are defined by back-projections of the over-segmented homogenous color regions on the images and the plane parameters are determined by angle-sweeping at different depth levels. The position and rotation of the plane patches are estimated robustly by minimizing a segment-based cost function, which considers occlusions, as well. The quality of depth map estimates is measured via reconstruction quality of the conjugate views, after warping segments into these views by the resulting homographies. Finally, a greedy-search algorithm is applied to refine the reconstruction quality and update the plane equations with visibility constraint. Based on the simulation results, it is observed that the \u2026",

We introduce a new visual stimulus based on a novel texture, the Starry Night Texture (SNT), that is incapable of conveying slant, depth edges, or texture boundaries, in a single view. Changing density and changing intensity are equivalent for SNT, so an instance of the texture is characterized (up to the random locations of the texture elements) by its densintensity. We describe the SNT in its ideal form, consider deviations from the ideal that are needed to realize the texture in practice, and describe a physical device that approximates SNT using backlit metal foil. In three experiments with computer-generated stimuli we examined human perception of SNT, to show that (1) the deviations \u2026",

The proposed approach operates a camera in the near infrared spectrum to filter out the optical projection from the sensory input. However, the monochromaticity of input restricts the use of color for the detection of boards. In this context, two methods are proposed. The first regards the pose estimation of boards which, being computationally demanding and frequently used by the system, is highly parallelized. The second uses this pose estimation method to detect and track boards, being efficient in the use of computational resources so that accurate results are provided in real-time.

This work presents a model-based 3D tracking algorithm based on edges. The proposed tracker maintains a pose hypothesis that is propagated from frame to frame, using it first to render a depth image and then refining it according to partial matches established between depth and intensity edges. Edge matching relies on fast, local linear searches along the depth gradient direction. The tracker does not require any preprocessing of the 3D model nor does it make any assumptions regarding its characteristics, as is often the case for other approaches based on edges. It is also robust to parts of the tracked satellite being out of view, occluded, shadowed or visually undetected. Experimental results evaluating the accuracy of the tracker and comparing it against established techniques are also included.",

Enright argued that increased disparity from the Pulfrich effect causes near objects to appear nearer still, so that size constancy requires they be small, and speed constancy that they be moving slowly. However, it is possible the effect results from solving for absolute distance using mutual constraints provided by structure from motion and shape from relative binocular disparity (Richards, 1985; Kellman & Kaiser, 1995). In this case, the three-dimensional scene would retain its original apparent shape, and, critically, the entire scene (not just the near objects) would appear smaller and closer. Previous studies used small displays of isolated objects and failed to find such an effect (Brenner & Landy, 1999).",

An initial pose estimate computed with the aid of local point features is ameliorated by considering all visible object texture.

A rendered image is compared against the acquired one with the aid of a visual dissimilarity score involving cross-correlation. Population-based stochastic optimization is used to efficiently search the pose space and minimize the dissimilarity between rendered images corresponding to candidate poses and the acquired image. The method is demonstrated with the aid of real and synthetic images.",

Our novel approach is based on a conceptual, twofold decomposition of craft processes into actions, and of the machines used into components. Thus, in the context of this paper, we have developed a pipeline that delivers a Virtual Environment, through which a wide range of users, from museum curators and exhibitors, to everyday users interested by a craft, can experience craft usage scenarios. Via our visualization pipeline, we claim that we deliver an efficient way of visualizing craft processes within Virtual Environments, thus increasing the usability and educational value of craft representation, and opening the way to a variety of new applications for craft presentation, education and thematic tourism. In the scope of this paper, we focus on the Heritage Craft of loom weaving; however, our approach is generic, for representing any craft, after its decomposition according to our technique.",

Nonetheless, accurate dense stereo algorithms are computationally demanding. When executed on the low-performance, radiation-hardened CPUs typically installed on rovers, slow stereo processing severely limits the driving speed and hence the science that can be conducted in situ. Aiming to decrease execution time while increasing the accuracy of stereo vision embedded in future rovers, this article proposes HW/SW co-design and acceleration on resource-constrained, space-grade FPGAs.

Traditional means of documentation include photography and in situ measurements from experts for further analysis. Although 3D reconstruction of pertinent scenes has already been explored as a complementary tool in investigation pipelines, such technology is considered unfamiliar and not yet widely adopted. This is explained by the expensive and specialised digitisation equipment that is available so far. However, the emergence of high-precision but low-cost devices capable of scanning scenes or objects in 3D has been proven as a reliable alternative to their counterparts. This paper summarises and analyses the state-of-the-art technologies in scene documentation using 3D digitisation and assesses the usefulness in typical police-related situations and the forensics domain in general. We present the methodology for acquiring data for 3D reconstruction of various types of scenes. Emphasis is placed on the applicability of each technique in a wide range of situations, ranging in type and size. The application of each reconstruction method is considered in this context and compared with respect to additional constraints, such as time availability and simplicity of operation of the corresponding scanning modality. To further support our findings, we release a multi-modal dataset obtained from a hypothetical indoor crime scene to the public.",

            "Abstract": "A novel approach for segment-based stereo matching problem is presented, based on a modified plane-sweeping strategy. The space is initially divided into planes that are located at different depth levels via plane sweeping by the help of region-wise planarity assumption for the scene. Over-segmented homogenous color regions are utilized for defining planar segment boundaries and plane equations are determined by angle sweeping at different planes. The robustness of depth map estimates is improved by warping segments into the other image via the resulting homographies. In order to refine the reconstruction quality and update segment depths, as well as plane normals, with smoothness and visibility constraints, a greedy search algorithm is applied. Based on the simulation results, the proposed algorithm handles large un-textured regions, depth discontinuities at object boundaries and slanted surfaces \u2026",

Drainage is registered by three simultaneous techniques: (a) electrical conductance measurements for the evolution of the local liquid fraction, (b) close-up photos for the evolution of the local bubble size distribution and (c) volumetric measurements for the evolution of the global liquid fraction in the entire container. Electrical measurements are conducted at different heights along the foam with the aid of several pairs of non-intrusive ring electrodes. Three cylindrical Plexiglas containers of different diameter are used, before and after treatment of their walls to allow tests with hydrophobic and hydrophilic walls, respectively. To resemble the shape of common industrial containers, the lower part of the largest container has a gradually reducing diameter towards its bottom. Foam \u2026",

While the user manipulates the disk, the system uses a projector to visualize a display upon it. A depth camera is used to estimate the pose of the surface and multiple simultaneous fingertip contacts upon it. The estimates are transformed into meaningful user input, availing both fingertip contact and disk pose information. Calibration and real-time implementation issues are studied and evaluated through extensive experimentation. We show that the outcome meets accuracy and usability requirements for employing the approach in human computer interaction.",

            "Abstract": "Arm swimming in the octopus is a mode of locomotion that is used by the animal primarily for hunting, defence, or escape. The motion, in general, is characterized by a fast closing of the arms and a slow opening of the arms, resulting in a considerable propulsive power. The movement has previously been discussed, however the detailed kinematics is still unknown. For that, we investigated in detail the arm swimming movement in the benthic common octopus, by means of image segmentation and motion reconstruction of video data acquired by the authors. The 3D trajectories of all eight arms were tracked in three sequences of octopus arm swimming, revealing a synchronous, albeit complex, pattern of motion. Video acquisition by three high-definition cameras was used on adult octopuses, kept in the aquarium (Octopus vulgaris, 200-400gr of weight). The image sequences were a posteriori deinterlaced, synchronized, and compensated for radial and tangential lens distortion. Using a checkerboard pattern, the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of each camera was performed, with a strong estimation of the camera parameters. To reconstruct an individual arm in 3D, the 2D arm contour was manually segmented from each camera frame, and its medial axis was extracted, thereafter, automatically [Yekutieli, 2007]. Employing epipolar geometry constraints and least-square approximation, between each camera view, the reconstruction of each, corresponding, medial axis in 3D was obtained. A back-projection process, from 3D to 2D, allowed evaluation and verification of the resulting 3D trajectories, via a manually iterative procedure. The 3D \u2026",

The proposed approach aims at developing vision algorithms which are robust with respect to the challenging imaging conditions encountered in the GI tract and the great variability of the acquired images.

These pairs are classified into three categories, according to characteristics that are relevant to indicative registration applications. Such characteristics are the degree of overlap between images and the presence/absence of anatomical differences. Ground truth in the form of corresponding image points and a protocol to evaluate registration performance are provided.Results: The proposed protocol is shown to enable quantitative and comparative evaluation of retinal registration methods under a variety of conditions.Conclusion: This work enables the fair comparison of retinal registration methods.

Future missions, such as the Mars Sample Return or the Lunar Polar Sample Return, already demand longer and faster traversals compared to past missions to maximize their scientific return and reduce operational costs and risks. Autonomous navigation is usually based on computer vision due to the passive mode of operation, simple hardware, small form factor and low power consumption of camera sensors. Computer vision nevertheless entails a rather high computational burden which puts a strain on the limited computational resources available onboard these rovers. This paper describes SPARTAN, an optimized, hardware embedded vision system for autonomous navigation of planetary rovers that meets the high demands of future missions requiring large and fast traversals.",

The detection procedure adopts the sliding window paradigm, with an efficient cascade-style evaluation of each window location. A simple pre-filtering is performed first, rapidly rejecting most locations. For each remaining location, a set of candidate templates (i.e. trained object views) is identified with a voting procedure based on hashing, which makes the method's computational complexity largely unaffected by the total number of known objects. The candidate templates are then verified by matching feature points in different modalities. Finally, the approximate object pose associated with each detected \u2026",

It is shown, and explained why, that performing this modulation results in superior accuracy of the volumetric reconstruction than retaining the patch size constant, as it has been to date practiced. The proposed extension to the hypothetical patch operator is compatible with the existing volumetric approaches to stereo.",

Initialized with a coarsely accurate pose, the proposed approach applies a hypothesize-and-test scheme that combines stochastic optimization and graphics-based rendering to refine the supplied initial pose, so that it accurately accounts for a sensed depth image. Pose refinement employs particle swarm optimization to minimize an objective function that quantifies the misalignment between the acquired depth image and a rendered one that is synthesized from a hypothesized pose with the aid of an object mesh model.

To examine the reproducibility of the method, sequential imaging of melanocytic lesions is carried out.

Certainly, combination with other cues is necessary for maximizing the quality of the reconstruction, since they provide of additional information and since the texture-uniqueness cue exhibits well-known weaknesses; eg at cases where texture is absent or at the so-called \u201cdepth discontinuities\u201d.

Candidate gestures are detected within continuous head motion and recognized, acknowledging that head pose estimates might be inaccurate. The proposed method is evaluated within the context of human-computer dialog.

            "Abstract": "Tele-immersion is a new medium that tries to create the illusion of virtual collocation among physically distant places. To create this sense of copresence, tele-immersion has to be visually compelling and run in real-time, putting, thus, high performance constraints in all three areas of computer vision, graphics, and networking. We describe our newest results in the scene acquisition component of tele-immersion: algorithms for volumetric scene reconstruction from multiple cameras and for calibration of camera clusters. The reconstruction algorithm is volumetric, makes no assumption on camera loci and is based on the detection of local correlation maxima in 3D. It outputs an occupancy voxel grid, with occupied voxels being accompanied by a surface normal; a fact that improves reconstruction quality. The calibration of cameras distributed in a wide area is a challenging task because it is impossible to use reference objects visible to all cameras and because wide field-of-view cameras suffer under radial distortion. Our calibration method uses a reference object to calibrate a minimum of two cameras in order to provide a euclidean world coordinate system. Then, we deliberately move an LED in front of all cameras to obtain correspondances between views. The projection matrices and radial distortion parameters of all cameras are computed using two-step factorization. The combination of the two algorithms alleviates \u201cmisregistration\u201d[8] artifacts, encountered when concatenating reconstructions/calibrations, obtainbed from independent stereos.",

The image registration problem is formulated as a 3D pose estimation problem, solved by estimating the rigid transformation that relates the views from which the two images were acquired. Given this estimate, each image can be warped upon the other so that pixels with the same coordinates image the same retinal point. Extensive experimental evaluation shows improved accuracy over state of the art methods, as well as robustness to noise and spurious keypoint matches. Experiments also indicate the method's applicability to the comparative analysis of images from different examinations that may exhibit changes and its applicability to diagnostic support.",

            "Abstract": "The cue to depth due to the assumption of texture uniqueness has been widely utilized in approaches to shape-from-stereo. Despite the recent growth of methods that utilize spectral information (color) or silhouettes to threedimensionally reconstruct surfaces from images, the depth cue due to the texture uniqueness constraint remains relevant, as being utilized by a significant number of contemporary stereo systems [1, 2]. Certainly, combination with other cues is necessary for maximizing the quality of the reconstruction, since they provide of additional information and since the texture-uniqueness cue exhibits well-known weaknesses; eg at cases where texture is absent or at the so-called \u201cdepth discontinuities\u201d. The goal of this work is to provide of a prolific, in terms of accuracy, precision and efficiency, approach to the utilization of the texture uniqueness constraint which can be, thereafter, combined with other cues to depth.The uniqueness constraint assumes that a given pixel from one image can match to no more than one pixel from the other image [3, 4]. In stereo methods, the uniqueness constraint is extended to assume that, locally, each location on a surface is uniquely textured. The main advantages of the cue derived from the uniqueness constraint over other cues to depth are the following. It is independent from silhouette-extraction, which requires an accurate segmentation (eg [5]). It is also independent of any assumption requiring that cameras occur around the scene (eg [6]) or on the same baseline (eg [7, 8]). Moreover, it does not require that cameras are spectrally calibrated, such as in voxel carving/coloring approaches (eg [9, 10, 11 \u2026",

High curvature points are to be preferred, since they are psychophysically more important and are shown to be computationally more reliable. Using a scale-space of curves such \u2018corners\u2019 are located, and an empirical analysis demonstrates that high curvature points are indeed least sensitive to noise. Using reliable \u2018corners\u2019, a shift invariant and piecewise linear alignment of shapes is defined, and a similarity measure between two curves is defined using lossless compression. The measure is chosen to be proportional to the area between two shapes after piecewise alignment and to the number of data points.

To raise this ambiguity, it is commonly suggested to manually measure an absolute distance in the environment and then use it to scale a reconstruction accordingly. In practice, however, it is often the case that such a measurement cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy, compromising certain uses of a 3D reconstruction that require the acquisition of true Euclidean measurements. This paper studies three alternative techniques for obtaining estimates of the scale pertaining to a reconstruction and compares them experimentally with the aid of real and synthetic data.",
