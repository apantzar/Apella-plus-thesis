            "Abstract": "The environmental challenges the world faces have never been greater or more complex. Global areas that are covered by forests and urban woodlands are threatened by large-scale forest fires that have increased dramatically during the last decades in Europe and worldwide, in terms of both frequency and magnitude. To this end, rapid advances in remote sensing systems including ground-based, unmanned aerial vehicle-based and satellite-based systems have been adopted for effective forest fire surveillance. In this paper, the recently introduced 360-degree sensor cameras are proposed for early fire detection, making it possible to obtain unlimited field of view captures which reduce the number of required sensors and the computational cost and make the systems more efficient. More specifically, once optical 360-degree raw data are obtained using an RGB 360-degree camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle, we convert the equirectangular projection format images to stereographic images. Then, two DeepLab V3+ networks are applied to perform flame and smoke segmentation, respectively. Subsequently, a novel post-validation adaptive method is proposed exploiting the environmental appearance of each test image and reducing the false-positive rates. For evaluating the performance of the proposed system, a dataset, namely the \u201cFire detection 360-degree dataset\u201d, consisting of 150 unlimited field of view images that contain both synthetic and real fire, was created. Experimental results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed system, which has achieved an F-score fire detection rate equal to 94.6%, hence reducing \u2026",

In this paper, we present a new algorithm for video based flame detection, which identifies spatio-temporal features of fire such as colour probability, contour irregularity, spatial energy, flickering and spatio-temporal energy. For each candidate region of an image a feature vector is generated and used as input to an SVM classifier, which discriminates between fire and fire-coloured regions.

Currently, 3D motion pictures are shown in theatres and the first 3D broadcasts are being planned to initiate in the next few years. Albeit the progress, state of the art has not yet reached the goal of acquiring a three-dimensional scene in full detail and creating a precise optical duplicate at remote site in real-time. Limitations in reconstruction accuracy and visual quality as well as user acceptance of pertinent technologies have, to date, prevented the creation of infrastructures for the delivery of 3D content to mass markets. Thereby, relevant scientific research is at the center of interest regarding the improvement of current 3DTV technologies. The goal of 3DTV involves the collaboration of researchers in multiple scientific disciplines as well as the integration of pertinent results, in order to provide end-users with a fully functional system. The tasks of \u201ccapture and representation of 3D scene information,\u201d\u201crepresentation of the digital 3DTV signal,\u201d\u201cstorage and transmission of the digital 3DTV signal,\u201d as well as \u201cdisplay of the reproduced 3D scene\u201d constitute a chain of operations that are essential for reaching this goal. In this context, this special issue presents contributions along the whole chain of computational tasks that are required to implement 3DTV.

To take advantage of the correlation between the different channels of data, we introduce a generalized form of a stabilized higher order linear dynamical system (sh-LDS) and we represent the multidimensional signal as a third-order tensor. In addition, we show that the parameters of the proposed model lie on a Grassmann manifold and we attempt to address the classification problem through study of the geometric properties of the sh-LDS's space. Moreover, to tackle the problem of nonlinearity of the observation data, we represent each multidimensional signal as a cloud of points on the Grassmann manifold and we create a codebook by identifying the most representative points. Finally, each multidimensional signal is classified by applying a bag-of-systems approach having first modeled the variation of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An integral part of the MPEG-4 standard is the definition of face animation parameters (FAPs). This paper presents a method for the determination of FAPs by using three dimensional (3-D) rigid and nonrigid motion of human facial features found from two-dimensional (2-D) image sequences. The proposed method assumes that a 3-D model has been fitted to the first frame of the sequence, tracks the motion of characteristic facial features, calculates the 3-D rigid and nonrigid motion of facial features, and through this, estimates the FAPs as defined by the MPEG-4 coding standard. The 2-D tracking process is based on a novel enhanced version of the algorithm proposed by Kanade, Lucas, and Tomasi (1994, 1991). The nonrigid motion estimation is achieved using the same tracking mechanism guided by the facial motion model implied by the MPEG-4 FAPs.",

In these cases another sensor must step in to fill those gaps.

The tool can be used both as a sign language dictionary as well as a text to sign language translator. It is based on a Sign Language dictionary written in the well-known Sign-Writing system. More specifically, the entries of the dictionary are in SWML (SignWriting Markup Language), an XML-based format, which has recently been developed for the storage, indexing and processing of SignWriting notation. For sign synthesis, each sign box (basic sign) is first converted to a sequence of Body Animation Parameters (BAPs) of the MPEG-4 standard corresponding to the represented gesture. These sequences, which can also be coded and/or reproduced by MPEG-4 BAP players, are then used to animate H-anim compliant VRML avatars, reproducing the exact gestures represented in sign language notation. Envisaged applications include the development of signing avatars for interactive information systems (Web, E-mail, info\u2013kiosks) and TV newscasts for persons with hearing disabilities.",

            "Abstract": "Against the background of aggravated capacity constraints at airports due to increasing air traffic, airports are in need of innovative systems enabling Air Traffic Controllers to precisely determine the position of vehicles moving on the surface, even under reduced visibility conditions. While this demand is addressed by the development and introduction of Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS), technologies currently applied to A-SMGCS feature some weak points regarding coverage, robustness interference and climate conditions. The EC-funded research project ISMAEL targets these weak points by developing an innovative detection solution based on magnetic sensing technology. Thus, ISMAEL will represent a valuable and costefficient complementary contribution to existing and planned A-SMGCS at small and large airports. During the past project stage, magnetic detector prototypes have been designed and tested. Initial field tests on a taxiway have proven that the sensors can be used to detect aircraft on ground within a range of several meters. In the next stage detectors will be integrated with the sensor data fusion (SDF) server, which initially processes the data from detectors to extract target plots and then based on Kalman filtering provides target tracks. Further demonstration activities based on both detector and SDF development are planned this year.",

Traditionally, the recognition process relies almost exclusively on human experts, who are based on various characteristics of wood, such as color, structure and texture. However, there are numerous types of wood species in the nature that are difficult to be identified even by experienced scientists. Towards this end, in this paper we propose a novel approach for automated wood species recognition through multidimensional texture analysis. By taking advantage of the fact that static wood images contain periodic spatially-evolving characteristics, we introduce a new spatial descriptor considering each wood image as a collection of multidimensional signals. More specifically, the proposed methodology enables the representation of wood images as \u2026",

Recent projects, such as EU i-Treasures and TERPSICHORE projects conduct research in this field to improve the capture, analysis and presentation of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) using ICT-based approaches. The final goal is to document these forms of intangible heritage and to capture the associated knowledge in order to safeguard and transmit this information to the next generations. In addition, these approaches can give rise to new services for research, education and cultural tourism. They can also be used by creative industries (eg companies performing film, video, TV or VR applications production), as well as by local communities, creating new local development opportunities by promoting local heritage. This paper first reviews some very recent state of the art approaches based on deep learning which can achieve impressive results in recovering human motion (2D or 3D) and structure (skeleton with joints or realistic 3D model of the human body). Based on such approaches, we then propose a dance analysis approach, currently under development in TERPSICHORE project. Preliminary results are presented and, finally, some conclusions are drawn.",

The same holds for every tourist destination, because, in essence, the gathering of locals and those associated with the area is what gives an identity to each place. Can we transfer such living environments in the digital world? What are the pros and cons? Pop/folk culture constitutes an important part of Intangible Cultural Heritage and is an important factor for social cohesion, tourism, and economic development. Festive practices and traditions entertain, act as a tourist attraction and reflect important information about the cultural, societal and historical background of local regions and communities. In our times, this important ICH genre is endangered by many different factors, including economic crisis, globalization, immigration, urbanization, etc., and thus needs to be protected. Recently, inline with UNESCO\u2019s efforts for safeguarding and transmission of ICH [1], EU projects such as i-Treasures [2], Terpsichore [3] and WhoLoDancE [4] tried to exploit modern ICT technologies to digitize, analyse, visualize and re-use Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), including musical and dance performances.

In this paper a new content generation approach for autostereoscopic 3DTV is proposed, by integrating a state-of-the-art MRF-based depth estimation method with additional pre-and post-processing steps, such as rectification, colour segmentation as well as decomposition of the scene in foreground and background depth maps.

To assess the potential tracking abilities of Kinect nonfrontal views, we compare the tracking results from four views (front, left side, right side, rear) with those from an off-the-self optical motion capture system. The experimental results show that the skeleton tracking accuracy of the rear view is close to the accuracy of the frontal view, although Kinect sensor \u2026",

Inverse Kinematics are also employed for synthesizing complex animation sequences (eg contacts). In addition, if a sign contains facial expressions, then these are converted to a sequence of MPEG-4 Facial Animation Parameters (FAPs), while exact synchronization between facial and body movements is achieved. These sequences, which can also be coded and/or reproduced by MPEG-4 BAP and FAP players, are then used to animate H-anim compliant VRML avatars, reproducing the exact gestures represented in the sign language notation.

In real world conditions it constitutes a complicated problem, considering cluttered backgrounds, gross illumination variations, occlusions, self-occlusions, different clothing and multiple moving objects. These ill-posed problems are usually tackled by making simplifying assumptions regarding the scene or by imposing constraints on the motion. Constraints such as that the contrast between the moving people and the background should be high and that everything in the scene should be static except for the target person are quite often introduced in order to achieve accurate segmentation. Moreover, the motion of the target person is often confined to simple movements with limited occlusions. In addition, assumptions such as known initial position and posture of the person are usually imposed in tracking processes.",

Finally, a stereo image generation algorithm is proposed that uses the camera and structure equations to project the 3-D points in a new virtual stereo view for each frame.

Besides prevention, early intervention is also very important in fire fighting. If the fire-fighters know where the fire will be in some time, it would be easier for them to stop the fire. Therefore a big need for simulating the fire behaviour exists. In this paper we are proposing a system which can simulate the propagation of fire in time. Also this system can visualize the propagation of fire in any 3D-GIS environment that accepts KMZ as a file format. Besides, the system supports the visualization of a large number of output data from the simulations, according to the user needs. This facilitates fire planning by fire-fighters. 3D visualization at 3D screens is also supported. Therefore, a better understanding of the terrain can be obtained.",

In this paper, we focus on technologies related to the motion capture systems of human movement and present a methodology based on the use of multiple depth sensors. Specifically, the proposed method combines motion data from multiple sensors in order to increase the accuracy and address problems such as noisy data, occlusions of parts of a dancer\u2019s body, limited area of coverage, etc. Subsequently, pattern recognition techniques are applied to analyze the motion of the dancer, while for the learning and assessment of performance, fuzzy logic techniques in combination with three-dimensional graphics technologies are employed. The proposed methodology has been developed within the FP7 research project \u201ci-Treasures\u201d, which aims to develop novel methodologies and new technological paradigms for the analysis and modelling of different forms of intangible cultural heritage and knowhow transmission.",

With a blink from the user, the system is then capable of accurately locating a set of characteristic feature points on the front and profile views of the face, which are used for the adaptation of a generic 3D face model.

In real-world conditions it constitutes a complicated problem, considering cluttered backgrounds, gross illumination variations, occlusions, self-occlusions, different clothing, and multiple moving objects. These ill-posed problems are usually tackled by simplifying assumptions regarding the scene or by imposing constraints on the motion. Constraints such as that the contrast between the moving people and the background should be high, and that everything in the scene should be static except for the target person, are quite often introduced in order to achieve accurate segmentation. Moreover, the motion of the target person is often confined to simple movements with limited occlusions. In addition, assumptions such as known initial position and posture of the person are usually imposed in tracking processes.",

To this end, we propose a linear dynamical model (LDS), which is based on the higher order decomposition of the observation data. In this way, we are able to extract a new descriptor for analyzing data of multiple elements coming from of the same or different data sources. Each sequence of data is modeled as a collection of higher order LDS descriptors (h-LDSs), which are estimated in equally sized temporal segments of data. Finally, each sequence is represented as a term frequency histogram following a bag-ofsystems approach, in which h-LDSs are used as feature descriptors. For evaluating the performance of the proposed methodology to extract dynamics from time evolving multidimensional data and using them for classification purposes in various applications, in this paper we consider two different cases: dynamic texture analysis and human motion recognition. Experimental results with two datasets for dynamic texture analysis and two datasets for human action recognition demonstrate the great potential of the proposed method.",

The proposed method considers each image as a set of multidimensional spatially-evolving signals that can be efficiently modeled through a higher-order linear dynamical systems analysis. Subsequently, each H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) stained breast cancer histological image is represented as a cloud of points on the Grassmann manifold, while a vector representation approach is applied aiming to aggregate the Grassmannian points based on a locality criterion on the manifold. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, two datasets with different characteristics were used. More specifically, we created a new medium-sized dataset consisting of 300 annotated images (collected from 21 patients) of grades 1, 2 and 3, while we also provide experimental results using a large dataset, namely BreaKHis, containing 7,909 breast cancer histological images, collected from 82 patients, of both benign and malignant cases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method outperforms a number of state of the art approaches providing average classification rates of 95.8% and 91.38% with our dataset and the BreaKHis dataset, respectively.",

The 3D facial adaptation requires a set of two orthogonal views of the user\u2032s face with a number of feature points located on both views. Based on the correspondences of the feature points\u2032 positions, a generic face model is deformed nonrigidly treating every facial part as a separate entity. A cylindrical texture map is then built from the two image views. The generated head models are compared to corresponding models obtained by the commonly used adaptation method that utilizes 3D radial bases functions. The generated 3D models are integrated into a talking head system, which consists of two distinct parts: a multilingual text to speech sub-system and an MPEG-4 compliant facial animation sub-system.

Global areas covered by forests and urban woodlands are threatened by natural disasters that have increased dramatically during the last decades, in terms of both frequency and magnitude. Large-scale forest fires are one of the most harmful natural hazards affecting climate change and life around the world. Thus, to minimize their impacts on people and nature, the adoption of well-planned and closely coordinated effective prevention, early warning, and response approaches are necessary. This paper presents an overview of the optical remote sensing technologies used in early fire warning systems and provides an extensive survey on both flame and smoke detection algorithms employed by each technology. Three types of systems are identified, namely terrestrial, airborne, and spaceborne-based systems, while various models aiming to detect fire occurrences with high accuracy in challenging environments are studied. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of fire detection systems based on optical remote sensing are discussed aiming to contribute to future research projects for the development of early warning fire systems.

            "Abstract": "An important cue that can assist towards an accurate building detection and segmentation is 3D information. Because of their height, buildings can easily be distinguished from the ground and small objects, allowing for their successful segmentation. Unfortunately, 3D knowledge is not always available, but there are ways to infer 3D information from 2D images. Shape-from-shading techniques extract height and surface normal information from a single 2D image by taking into consideration knowledge about illumination, reflectance and shape. In this paper, a novel feature is proposed that can describe the 3D information of reconstructed images based on a shape-from-shading technique in order to successfully acquire building boundaries. The results are promising and show that such a 3D feature can significantly assist in a correct building boundary detection and segmentation.",

Ferromagnetic objects such as vehicle motors, aircraft engines, and landing gears are detected through their deformation of the Earth's magnetic field. Tests have shown that although the local changes of the Earth's magnetic field are extremely small, the proposed sensing technology is able to detect them reliably. The primary objective of the proposed approach is to provide a complementary surveillance system for existing and future Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS) at large airports or a cost-effective surveillance solution for monitoring critical areas at medium and small airports. Unaffected by weather conditions, interference and shadowing effects, the system provides reliable position, velocity, and direction information without requiring any equipment \u2026",

            "Abstract": "According to UNESCO, cultural heritage does not only include monuments and collections of objects, but also contains traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed to our descendants. Folk dances represent part of cultural heritage and their preservation for the next generations appears of major importance. Digitization and visualization of folk dances form an increasingly active research area in computer science. In parallel to the rapidly advancing technologies, new ways for learning folk dances are explored, making the digitization and visualization of assorted folk dances for learning purposes using different equipment possible. Along with challenges and limitations, solutions that can assist the learning process and provide the user with meaningful feedback are proposed. In this paper, an overview of the techniques used for the recording of dance moves is presented. The different ways of visualization and giving the feedback to the user are reviewed as well as ways of performance evaluation. This paper reviews advances in digitization and visualization of folk dances from 2000 to 2018. View Full-Text",

Video-based systems can be used for this purpose; however, flame detection remains a challenging issue due to the fact that many natural objects have similar characteristics with fire. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for video based flame detection, which employs various spatio-temporal features such as colour probability, contour irregularity, spatial energy, flickering and spatio-temporal energy. Various background subtraction algorithms are tested and comparative results in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy are presented. Experimental results with two classification methods show that the proposed methodology provides high fire detection rates with a reasonable false alarm ratio. Finally, a 3D visualization tool for the estimation of the fire propagation is outlined and simulation results are presented and discussed.",

            "Abstract": "The paper deals with the adoption of Serious Games (SGs) in the specific area of Intangible Cultural Heritage Education (ICH). The transmission of some cultural expressions, like rare traditional singing or dancing, is more related to the acquisition of procedural knowledge (ie how to perform some tasks, like a dance step) rather than to declarative knowledge (ie knowledge that can be declared or stated through words or symbol systems, eg music notation). Coherently, so far knowledge in these areas has been transmitted mainly by observation or imitation of experts/performers in real contexts. Grounded on the research results in Game Based Learning and on the opportunity offered by cutting-edge sensor technologies, the i-Treasures project exploits the interesting potential of Serious Games in the ICH field. As a matter of fact, the capacity of games to train motor skills and to support sensorimotor learning, together with their ability to enhance engagement and motivation, are the main elements at the heart of our choice. In the paper, we discuss in depth the theoretical rationale behind the adoption of Serious Games i-Treasures, also in the light of their current use in Cultural Heritage Education. Furthermore, the paper describes the main game design principles adopted by the i-Treasures project to address the specificities of various artistic expressions and to make the games sound and effective tools to support practice and learning.",

First experimental results confirm that the new video sensor meets the expectations in terms of real-time performance and demonstrates the additional functionalities, according to which it was designed. The final goal is to use this new sensor as an alternative, improved version of embedded motion detection video sensors (like Autoscope\u00ae).",

Use of this error norm is seen to yield improved results, when compared to two alternative error norms, which were also evaluated. Results are presented for the specific application, where six animation parameters of the arm and the palm are estimated. In this application, an initial estimate is obtained by applying an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which identifies three arm parts and two joint positions (elbow, wrist).

In spite of this overlapped interest, there is a considerable difference between CG and CV human body model (HBM) applications. The first one pursues realistic models of both human body geometry and its associated motion.

ISMAEL targets these weak points by developing an innovative detection solution based on magnetic sensing technology.

New autostereoscopic displays, such as the Philips Wowreg 3D display have significant advantages, including improved 3D viewing experience, wider viewing angles, multiple viewers and no need for special glasses. However, due to their content formatting requirements (2D + depth), live-action content is much more difficult to create. In this paper a new approach for 3D content generation is proposed, by integrating an existing state-of-the-art MRF-based disparity estimation method with additional pre- and post-processing steps. The proposed method uses rectification and colour segmentation to solve significant problems in disparity estimation as well as decomposition of the scene in foreground and background depth maps. Tests with different stereo sequences have already produced very promising results.",

However, CNNs have not been widely employed for remote sensing applications. In this paper, we propose a CNN architecture, named Modular-CNN, to improve the performance of building detectors that employ Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) in a remote sensing dataset. Additionally, we propose two improvements to increase the classification accuracy of Modular-CNN. The first improvement combines the power of raw and normalised features, while the second one concerns the Euler transformation of feature vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Modular-CNN and the novel improvements in remote sensing and other datasets in a comparative study with other state-of-the-art \u2026",

In Greece, 30% of the total area is covered by forests, however their contribution to the GDP is almost non-existent. An example is the chestnut production in Thessaly region of Greece, and especially in Mouzaki municipality, which is almost abandoned due to insufficient agricultural policies concerning establishment of alternative crops, and consequently leads to loss of potential income for the rural economy.

Besides prevention, early intervention is also very important in fire fighting. If the firefighters know where the fire will be in some time, it would be easier for them to stop the fire. Therefore a big need for simulating the fire behavior exists. In this paper we are proposing a system which can simulate the propagation of fire in time. Also this system can visualize the propagation of fire in any 3D-GIS environment, that accepts KMZ as a file format. Besides, any user demanded data can be visualized on the map of the system. This gives the chance of fire planning to firefighters. The system can visualize its results on 3D screens in 3D. Therefore, a better understanding of the terrain can be obtained.",

A generic 3-D face model is adapted to a human face of which the frontal and profile views are given. Then, a 3-D ellipsoid approximation technique is used to fit an ellipsoid to the 3-D wireframe model. This ellipsoid is then used to approximate the back of the head, while the the initial 3-D face model provides information for the high-detail front part of the head. The part of the ellipsoid model that corresponds to the back of the head is then identified and an algorithm to merge the front (face) and the back part is proposed. A cylindrical texture map is finally built covering the entire area of the head by exploiting the inherent face symmetry. The final result is a complete, textured model of a specific person's head.",

Using this depth reconstruction, error norm is seen to yield improved results when compared to two alternative choices for the error norms, which were also evaluated. Results are presented for the specific application, where six animation parameters of the arm and the palm are estimated. In this case, an initial estimate is obtained by applying an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which identifies three arm parts and two joint positions (elbow, wrist).

Using this information, initially we partition the dance sequence into periods and subsequently into motion patterns. Partitioning into periods is based on observing the horizontal displacement of the dancer while each period is subsequently partitioned into motion patterns by using an exemplar-based Hidden Markov Model that classifies each frame into an exemplar representing a hidden state of the HMM.

Despite the fact that during the last thirty years numerous algorithms and techniques have been developed in the field and classical methods of DSP technology were established, it is still an extremely skilled work to properly design, build and implement an effective signal processing unit able to meet the requirements of the increasingly demanding and sophisticated modern applications. This is especially true when it is necessary to deal with real-time applications of huge data rates and computational loads. It is the objective of this book chapter to present all the successive steps of such a processs in the framework of an ambitious plan to develop a functional and reliable lidar-based air data measurement instrument, launched by the FP6 Aeronautics and Space NESLIE project. Designed to perform in real-time (onboard the plane) and to provide vital flight parameters to the cockpit of the aircraft, this remote sensing equipment dictates the implementation of a robust, flexible and very fast signal processing unit. This chapter starts by introducing the characteristics of the expected signal as well as the overall requirements of the system. Taking into account the very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a signal resulting from aerosol particles light backscattering and the different flight levels in a non-uniform and unstable environment, at which the measurement unit has to operate, we specify the appropriate algorithms and develop the necessary techniques for an effective signal \u2026",

Most of the methods described in the literature are based on the use of Hematoxilin and Eosin (H&E) stain. However, the automated detection of CBs from H&E stained images remains a challenging issue. To this end, this paper presents a novel approach which is based on the use of both PAX5 and H&E stains in tissue sections sliced at the thickness of 1\u03bcm. The goal of PAX5 is three-fold: to facilitate the segmentation of nuclei, to remove a number of follicular dendritic cells and finally to extract morphological characteristics of nuclei. Furthermore, the use of H&E stain enables us to extract textural information related to histological characteristics used by pathologists in diagnosis of FL grading. In our method we propose a novel algorithm for the separation of overlapped nuclei \u2026",

For this reason, the database system of DATASCOPE (Colorado Univ.) was employed as the basic RDBMS for the seismological data, using the CSS 3.0 schema file for the data manipulation. Additional software to create and check the appropriate tables of the database was implemented. For the waveform processing the Matseis software (Sandia Labs.) was used (based on the MATLAB commercial software) and appropriate interface between DATASCOPE to Matseis was implemented. All developed algorithms were implemented through the interface of Matseis and MATLAB. Expansions and modifications include an overview window of the waveform data, auto phase pickers, easy phase evaluation/characterisation, calculation of earthquake parameters (using HypoellipseY2K) and focal mechanisms (using FPFIT). A significant effort was devoted to the automatic P-and S-phase identification. The finally proposed method uses a wavelet transform-based filtering technique, the WTST-NST filter, combined with High Order Statistics (HOS). The method was applied to real seismic data recorded in Greece from a local experiment. The resulting P-and S-phases indicate that the proposed algorithms provide high identification accuracy.",

The main detection algorithm is composed of four sub-algorithms detecting (i) slow moving objects, (ii) smoke-coloured regions, (iii) rising regions, and (iv) shadow regions. After detecting a wildfire, the main focus should be the estimation of its propagation direction and speed. If the model of the vegetation and other important parameters like wind speed, slope, aspect of the ground surface, etc. are known; the propagation of fire can be estimated.

Video surveillance cameras and computer vision methods are widely used in many security applications. It is also possible to use security cameras and special purpose infrared surveillance cameras for fire detection. This requires intelligent video processing techniques for detection and analysis of uncontrolled fire behavior. VFD may help reduce the detection time compared to the currently available sensors in both indoors and outdoors because cameras can monitor \u201cvolumes\u201d and do not have transport delay that the traditional \u201cpoint\u201d sensors suffer from. It is possible to cover an area of 100 km2 using a single pan-tilt-zoom camera placed on a hilltop for wildfire detection. Another benefit of the VFD systems is that they can provide crucial information about the size and growth of the fire, direction of smoke propagation.",

            "Abstract": "Outdoor large-scale cultural sites are mostly sensitive to environmental, natural and human made factors, implying an imminent need for a spatio-temporal assessment to identify regions of potential cultural interest (material degradation, structuring, conservation). On the other hand, in Cultural Heritage research quite different actors are involved (archaeologists, curators, conservators, simple users) each of diverse needs. All these statements advocate that a 5D modelling (3D geometry plus time plus levels of details) is ideally required for preservation and assessment of outdoor large scale cultural sites, which is currently implemented as a simple aggregation of 3D digital models at different time and levels of details. The main bottleneck of such an approach is its complexity, making 5D modelling impossible to be validated in real life conditions. In this paper, a cost effective and affordable framework for 5D modelling is proposed based on a spatial-temporal dependent aggregation of 3D digital models, by incorporating a predictive assessment procedure to indicate which regions (surfaces) of an object should be reconstructed at higher levels of details at next time instances and which at lower ones. In this way, dynamic change history maps are created, indicating spatial probabilities of regions needed further 3D modelling at forthcoming instances. Using these maps, predictive assessment can be made, that is, to localize surfaces within the objects where a high accuracy reconstruction process needs to be activated at the forthcoming time instances.

The key of the proposed method is the decomposition of the scene in foreground and background. To this end, chroma key technology is used to facilitate the detection of foreground objects and to significantly improve depth estimation for these objects. Then, we can combine the foreground objects with any background, for both color images and depth maps, to generate a new representation of the scene.

            "Abstract": "This paper studies a new method for three-dimensional (3D) facial model adaptation and its integration into a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. The TTS System pronounces, in real time, English or Greek speech and simultaneously animates the adapted face model, thus simulating a natural talking face. The 3D facial adaptation requires a set of two orthogonal views of the user\u2019s face with a number of feature points located on both views. Based on the correspondences of the feature points\u2019 positions a generic face model is deformed non-rigidly treating every facial part (ie nose, mouth, etc) as a separate entity. A cylindrical texture map is then built from the two image views covering the whole area of the head by exploiting the inherent face symmetry. The result is a complete, textured model of a specific person\u2019s head. The generated 3-D models are then integrated into a talking head system, which consists of two distinct parts: a multi-lingual Text To Speech sub-system and a Facial Animation sub-system based on MPEG-4 Facial Animation Parameters (FAPs). Support for the Greek language has been added to both the TTS and the facial animation sub-system while preserving lip and speech synchronization.",

            "Abstract": "This work aims to present an intelligent system for tracking moving targets (such as vehicles, persons etc) based on a network of distributed autonomous units that capture and process images from one or more pre-calibrated visual sensors. The proposed system, which has been developed within the framework of TRAVIS (TRAffic VISual monitoring) project, is flexible, scalable and can be applied in a broad field of applications. Two different pilot installations have been installed for initial evaluation and testing, one for traffic control of aircraft parking areas and one for tunnels at highways. Various computer vision techniques which were implemented and tested during the development of the project, are described and analysed. Multiple background extraction and data fusion algorithms are comparatively evaluated.",
