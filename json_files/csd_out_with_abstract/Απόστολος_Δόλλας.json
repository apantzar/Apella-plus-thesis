The ROTA system is based on the use of directional antennas on-board the ships and stationary antennas on the islands. The stationary antennas on the islands are connected to high-speed commercial computer networks, which are available on practically all inhabited islands at the Aegean sea, thus implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN). This approach is much more cost-effective when compared to current approaches that rely on the usage of satellite communications. This paper presents the concept behind ROTA platform.",

Furthermore, our system offers real-time correlation computation over high-speed streaming data and demonstrates how a batch processing algorithm can be applied to real-time streaming data.

To illustrate, any attempt for a full implementation of TCP/IP in hardware leads to prohibitively expensive solutions for low-cost sensor networks. Therefore, lighter protocols are needed.

Such memory patterns are very useful in stencil computations. The theoretical bandwidth of the memory of the Convey is compared with the results of our measurements. The accurate study of the memory subsystem is particularly useful for users when they are developing their application-specific personality. Experiments were performed to measure the bandwidth between the coprocessor and the memory subsystem. The experiments aimed mainly at measuring the reading access speed of the memory from Application Engines (FPGAs). Different ways of accessing data were used in order to find the most efficient way to access memory. This way was proposed for future work in the Convey HC-x. When performing a series of accesses to memory, non-uniform latencies occur. The Memory Controller of the Convey HC-x in the coprocessor attempts to cover this latency. We measure memory efficiency as a ratio of the number of memory accesses and the number of execution cycles. The result of this measurement converges to one in most cases. In addition, we performed experiments with hand-coded memory accesses. The analysis of the experimental results shows how the memory subsystem and Memory Controllers work. From this work we conclude that the memory controllers do an excellent job, largely because (transparently to the user) they seem to cache large amounts of data, and hence hand \u2026",

As in all algorithms of this category key frames are placed as beginning points for finding the differences with subsequent frames. Frames between key frames are named difference frames and they only contain the information that has changed from the previous frame. The differences between frames are determined using a user-defined threshold value, and therefore in general this type of compression can be lossy. The consequent degradation of picture is controlled by the user via the choice of threshold value. When this threshold is 0 the compression becomes \u2026",

In this paper, an FPGA-based SPWM generator is presented, which is capable to operate at switching frequencies up to 1 MHz (requiring FPGA operation at 100-160 MHz), thus it is capable to support the high switching frequency requirements of modern single-phase dc/ac power converters. The proposed design occupies a small fraction of a medium-sized FPGA and, thus, can be incorporated in larger designs. Additionally, it has a flexible architecture that can be tuned to a variety of single-phase dc/ac inverter applications.

Such systems offer substantial parallelism; however, the communication overhead among nodes for the distribution of the workload places an upper limit to the exploitable parallelism. The contribution of the present work is the integration of a reconfigurable platform with the Apache Storm, which is the main platform of the Big Data streaming processing community. By exploiting the internal bandwidth of FPGAs we show that the computational limits for stream processing are significantly increased vs. conventional distributed processing without compromising on the platform of choice or its seamless operation in a dynamic pipeline. The integration of a Maxeler MPC-C Series platform with the Apache Storm, as presented in detail, yields on the Hayashi-Yoshida correlation algorithm an impressive tenfold increase in real-time streaming input capacity, which corresponds to a hundred-fold computational load. Our methodology is sufficiently general to apply to any class of distributed systems or reconfigurable computers, and this work presents quantitative results of the expected I/O performance, depending on the means of network connection.",

This paper briefly outlines the embedded reconfigurable system architecture, and presents in-depth the 2-D motion detection model, which is directly mapped to reconfigurable hardware. Emphasis is placed on the hardware ability to adapt to individual needs of kinetically challenged persons by altering detection thresholds and delays, thus resulting into an efficient low-cost reconfigurable hardware implementation of the model. This paper also presents how the model detects complex motions through a vocabulary of simple motions, and how the system is trained to individual users' needs. Experimental results and integrated applications of the model for text processing are also presented.",

Its goal is to extract knowledge from massive datasets in a human-understandable structure, for example, the decision trees. In this article we present an innovative, high-performance, system-level architecture for the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) algorithm, one of the most important and widely used algorithms in the data mining area. Our proposed architecture exploits parallelism at the decision variable level, and was fully implemented and evaluated on a modern high-performance reconfigurable platform, the Convey HC-1 server, that features four FPGAs and a multicore processor. Our FPGA-based implementation was integrated with the widely used \u201crpart\u201d software library of the R project in order to provide the first fully functional reconfigurable system that can handle real-world large databases.

In this architecture, 8-mark stubs that are derived on a personal computer are subsequently processed by the FCCM, called GE2, allowing for parallel processing of as many stubs as are the available FPGAs. Actual runs of the new design have been performed on the TOP parallel FPGA machine at Virginia Tech. This paper presents the design improvements over the original architecture, which include single FPGA implementation, hardware/software codesign, FIFO based I/O, design for parallel execution, and performance results from actual runs.",

In this work we demonstrate that with an appropriate reconfigurable architecture, BLAST performance can be improved with a single-chip solution 5 times over a specialized and optimized computer cluster, or 37 times over a single computer. These initial results account for I/O and are very encouraging for the development of a large scale, reconfigurable BLAST engine",

This work presents such a tightly integrated embeddable system, which can be used as a \u201cblack box\u201d in streaming media. In our previous work we had studied and implemented separate modules for SCAN compression and SCAN encryption, using a large Virtex II FPGA for each. There were no implementation of data hiding, no integration of the three aspects of SCAN, and no complete design for decompression/decryption/unhiding. This paper presents a new architecture and a complete design for SCAN compression/encryption/hiding, as well as the corresponding decompression/decryption/data unhiding operations. A recent technology based on an embedded processor with reconfigurable fabric extensions has been used for this design, which was carried out to post place and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Image segmentation is one of the first important and difficult steps of image analysis and computer vision and it is considered as one of the oldest problems in machine vision. Lately, several segmentation algorithms have been developed with features related to thresholding, edge location and region growing to offer an opportunity for the development of faster image/video analysis and recognition systems. In addition, fuzzy-based segmentation algorithms have essentially contributed to synthesis of regions for better representation of objects. These algorithms have minor differences in their performance and they all perform well. Thus, the selection of one algorithm vs. another will be based on subjective criteria, or, driven by the application itself. Here, a low-cost embedded reconfigurable architecture for the Fuzzy-like reasoning segmentation (FRS) method is presented. The FRS method has three stages (smoothing \u2026",

This device is based on solid-state accelerometers to sense motion in space, a microcontroller to sample the data in real time, and an embedded FPGA to distinguish types of motion from programmable lists of motions. The FPGA computational model for the first version, presented in this paper, is an implementation of finite state machines (FSM) running in parallel, one for each type of motion which is detected by the system. The design is modular, allowing for different lists of motions and/or thresholds on input data to be incorporated with reconfiguration of the FPGA. A personal computer is used to determine the appropriate settings for each motion, which are then converted to FSM. The architecture of the system, types of motions it detects, and its performance characteristics are presented in this work.",

            "Abstract": "The development of efficient and robust algorithms for Big Data processing is a demanding task, which has to cope with the characteristics of this type of data (3Vs). Putting such algorithms as processing elements into larger pipelines adds an extra level of complexity, which can be alleviated by relying on a model-based approach including code generation. This allows data analysts to compose such pipelines on a higher level of abstraction, reducing the development effort as well as the risk of errors. In this chapter, we outline a model-based and adaptive approach to the development of data processing pipelines in heterogeneous processing contexts. It relies on a flexible, tool-supported approach to configuration, which embraces three levels:(a) a heterogeneous processing infrastructure-including reconfigurable hardware,(b) the pipelines as well as (c) the stakeholder applications built upon the pipelines \u2026",
