            "Abstract": "At the onset of the ubiquitous computing era, systems need to respond to a variety of challenges, in order to capitalize on the benefits of pervasiveness. One of the pivotal enablers of pervasive computing is the RFID technology which can be successfully applied in numerous applications. However, the interaction of such applications with sensitive personal data renders the need for assuring confidentiality a sine qua non. The native limitations in computing resources, i.e., computational power, memory etc, that characterize nearly all classes of RFID tags make the development of custom-tailored RFID security protocols a troublesome yet challenging task. In this paper we propose a mutual authentication protocol for low cost RFID tags and readers. We also demonstrate that our scheme is more efficient in terms of resource utilization on the backend server, and under identical conditions, more secure when compared \u2026",

In this regard high availability, reliability and redundancy are key factors for any SIP based infrastructure. In an adverse environment, especially the Internet and foreseeable 3GPP IMS, high availability solutions are of major importance for SIP network components to smoothly mitigate call increments, device failures, misconfigurations, physical disasters and throttle active attacks. This paper proposes a practical and transparent failover solution for SIP and RTP-Proxy servers. We demonstrate that both methods work properly and increase stability and availability of such systems. Furthermore, high availability solutions are enhanced through the employment of easy to implement load balancing schemes. All the proposed solutions are technically analyzed and evaluated via properly designed test-beds, showing fine performance in terms of service times.",

DNS amplification attack scenarios utilize DNS servers mainly for performing bandwidth consumption DoS attacks. This kind of attack takes advantage of the fact that DNS response messages may be substantially larger than DNS query messages. In this paper we present a novel, simple and practical scheme that enable administrators to distinguish between genuine and falsified DNS replies. The proposed scheme, acts proactively by monitoring in real time DNS traffic and alerting security supervisors when necessary. It also acts reactively in co-operation with the firewalls by automatically updating rules to ban bogus packets.

Data that reflects user preferences and likings, comprising therefore a user profile, are gathered to an adaptive web site in a non transparent manner. This situation however raises serious privacy concerns to the end user. When browsing aweb site, users are not aware of several important privacy parameters i.e., which behavior will be monitored and logged, how it will be processed, how long it will be kept, and with whom it will be shared in the long run. In this paper we propose an abstract architecture that enhances user privacy during interaction with adaptive web sites. This architecture enables users to create and update their personal privacy preferences for the adaptive web sites they visit by holding their (user) profiles in the client side instead of the server side.

Within this context, knowledge acquisition in this timely and important field has greater chances to be more fruitful when the learner is properly motivated. Also, it is anticipated to be more joyful when knowledge is acquired in the form of a digital game-based activity. The paper at hand discusses the development of a novel mobile app called CyberAware, destined to cybersecurity education and awareness. At present, the game is designed for K-6 children in order to support either or both formal or informal learning. Additionally, due to its mobile characteristics, the game can be experienced as an outdoor or classroom activity. Finally, opposite to similar studies found in the literature so far, our attention is not solely drawn to game\u2019s technological aspects but equally to the educational factor. This is achieved through the consideration and use of the ARCS motivational model already from the game\u2019s design phase.",

Wikipedia has boosted their popularity, but they also keep a significant share in elearning, intranet-based applications such as defect tracking, requirements management, test-case management, and project portals. However, existing wiki systems cannot fully support mobile clients due to several incompatibilities that exist. On the top of that, an effective secure mobile wiki system must be lightweight enough to support low-end mobile devices having several limitations. In this paper we analyze the requirements for a novel multiplatform secure wiki implementation. XML Encryption and Signature specifications are employed to realize endto-end confidentiality and integrity services. Our scheme can be applied selectively and only to sensitive wiki content, thus diminishing by far computational resources needed at both ends; the server and the client. To address authentication of wiki clients a simple one-way authentication and session key agreement protocol is also introduced. The proposed solution can be easily applied to both centralized and forthcoming P2P wiki implementations.",

Thus, the provision of some sort of postauthentication and non-repudiation service in an effort to deter and repel ill-motivated activities may be of particular value in such realms. Compelled by this fact, in this paper, we introduce a dynamic signature-based biometric scheme to enable the offering of both of the aforementioned services in mLearning domains.

Hence, it is straightforward that DNS nameservers are constantly under the threat of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This paper presents a new, stealthy from the attacker's viewpoint, flavor of DNSSEC-powered amplification attack that takes advantage of the vast number of DNS forwarders out there. Specifically, for augmenting the amplification factor, the attacker utilizes only those forwarders that support DNSSEC-related resource records and advertize a large DNS size packet.

Nowadays, digital contact tracing has promptly emerged as an indispensable asset in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The work at hand offers a meticulous study of all the official Android contact tracing apps deployed hitherto by European countries. Each app is closely scrutinized both statically and dynamically by means of dynamic instrumentation. Depending on the level of examination, static analysis results are grouped in two axes. The first encompasses permissions, API calls, and possible connections to external URLs, while the second concentrates on potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, including the use of trackers, in-depth manifest analysis, shared software analysis, and taint analysis. Dynamic analysis on the other hand collects data pertaining to Java classes and network traffic. The results demonstrate that while overall these apps are well-engineered, they are not free of weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations that may ultimately put the user security and privacy at risk.",

            "Abstract": "Social networks are a primary source of news and information that can be steered, distorted, and influenced. Recent scandals such as the one involving Cambridge Analytics proved that social media users are prone to such direct manipulation. Among the weapons available to perform these anti-democracy attacks, Social Bots are beyond question the most powerful one. These autonomous entities constitute coordinated armies that sneakily manipulate and deceive real users. Thus, our research identifies five major challenges that the research community needs to face toward tackling Social Bots activities in four individual but comparable scenarios. To address these key challenges, we propose, elaborate, and evaluate a mix of remedies in the form of a proof-of-concept platform combining the agility of artificial intelligence with the expertise of human analysts to detect and shield against Social Bots interference.",

If knowledge on this topic is delivered in the form of a digital game-based activity, then it has greater chances of being more joyful and efficient. The paper at hand discusses the development of a novel mobile app called Cyber-Aware, destined to cybersecurity education and awareness. At present, the game is designed for K-6 aged children and can be used to support either or both formal or informal learning. Also, due to its mobile nature, it can be experienced as an outdoor or classroom activity. Opposite to similar studies found in the literature so far, our attention is not solely drawn to game's technological aspects but equally to the educational factor.",

            "Abstract": "During the last decade the academic world is continuously capitalizing on the use of Internet and web-based learning solutions, because of the simplicity and immediacy in creating, organizing and managing educational material and student data. However, the delivery of educational content to the end-user is characterized by visual presentation and the requirement of some sort of access either wired or wireless to the Internet, which blocks visually impaired individuals or people who don\u2019t have access to the Internet in one way or another from accessing educational content. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of the Internet Telephony Learning System (TELS). Besides all other, TELS exploits mature Internet/web standards and the most popular communication mean in the world, the telephone, to provide audio interactivity between an otherwise traditional web application and the end-user. Unlike other similar applications, TELS does not need any special software or hardware to be accessed and since it is an open source traditional web application it can be custom-tailored to the individual needs of each institution. Since it is accessible to almost every communication device, we argue that it is useful for visually impaired, technologically uneducated, and underprivileged people for accessing information originally intended to be accessed visually via a Personal Computer.",

After applied in other fields with success SI started to gather the interest of researchers working in the field of intrusion detection. In this paper we explore the reasons that led to the application of SI in intrusion detection, and present SI methods that have been used for constructing IDS.

There is always a possibility that a security incident may happen, mainly as a result of a new or modified attack that the employed countermeasures cannot handle or identify. It is therefore useful to perform a deferred analysis of logged network data, in an attempt to identify abnormal behavior/traffic that flags some type of security incident that has not been detected by the security countermeasures. Such an analysis of logged data for critical real time applications, like VoIP services, is certainly a valuable tool for enhancing the security level of the provided service.

In this context, governments are rushing to devise or embrace novel surveillance mechanisms and monitoring systems to fight the outbreak. The development of digital tracing apps, which among others are aimed at automatising and globalising the prompt alerting of individuals at risk in a privacy-preserving manner, is a prominent example of this ongoing effort. Very promptly, a number of digital contact tracing architectures have been sprouted, followed by relevant app implementations adopted by governments worldwide. Bluetooth, specifically its Low Energy (BLE) power-conserving variant, has emerged as the most promising short-range wireless network technology to implement the contact tracing service. This work offers the first to our knowledge full-fledged review of the most concrete contact tracing architectures proposed so far in a global scale. This endeavour does not only embrace the diverse types of architectures and systems, namely, centralised, decentralised, or hybrid, but also equally addresses the client side, i.e., the apps that have been already deployed in Europe by each country.

One of them is whether touchstroke-based analysis (similar to keylogging) can be a reliable means of profiling the user of a mobile device. Of course, in such a setting, the coin has two sides. First, one can employ the output produced by such a system to feed machine learning classifiers and later on intrusion detection engines. Second, aggressors can install touchloggers to harvest user's private data. This malicious option has been also extensively exploited in the past by legacy keyloggers under various settings, but has been scarcely assessed for soft keyboards. Compelled by these separate but interdependent aspects, we implement the first-known native and fully operational touchlogger for ultramodern smartphones and especially for those employing the proprietary iOS platform.

This paper provides an entropy-driven, privacy preserving, and practical framework for detecting resource consumption attacks in VoIP ecosystems. We extensively evaluate our framework under various attack scenarios involving single and multiple assailants. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is capable of identifying malicious traffic with a false positive alarm rate up to 3.5%.",

Among them, Denial of Service (DoS) is perhaps the most powerful one, as it aims to drain the underlying resources of a service and make it inaccessible to the legitimate users. So far, various detection and prevention schemes have been deployed to detect, deter and eliminate DoS occurrences. However, none of them seems to be complete in assessing in both realtime and offline modes if a system remains free of such types of attacks. To this end, in the context of this paper, we assert that audit trails in VoIP can be a rich source of information toward flushing out DoS incidents and evaluating the security level of a given system.

In order to answer these questions we have calculated the complexity of each protocol and the energy cost it will add to the system.

Unfortunately, the former category of solutions present significant impediments including the requirement for a PKI and the hop-by-hop fashioned protection, while the latter only concentrate on the application layer, thus neglecting sensitive information leaking from lower layers. To remediate this problem, in the context of this paper, we employ the well-known Tor anonymity system to achieve complete SIP traffic obfuscation from an attacker's standpoint. Specifically, we capitalize on Tor for preserving anonymity on network links that are considered mostly untrusted, i.e., those among SIP proxies and the one between the last proxy in the chain and the callee.

As the open source Android platform continues to dominate the market, malware writers consider it as their preferred target.

Nevertheless, our findings clearly indicate that the majority of existing works utilize different metrics and models and employ diverse datasets and classification features stemming from disparate analysis techniques, ie, static, dynamic, or hybrid. This complicates the cross-comparison of the various proposed detection schemes and may also raise doubts about the derived results. To address this problem, spanning a period of the last seven years, this work attempts to schematize the so far ML-powered malware detection approaches and techniques by organizing them under four axes, namely, the age of the selected dataset, the analysis type used, the employed ML techniques, and the chosen performance metrics. Moreover, based on these axes, we introduce a converging scheme which can guide future Android malware detection techniques and provide a solid baseline to machine learning practices in this field.

The usual goal of an attack is to acquire user\u2019s sensitive data or compromise the device so as to use it as a stepping stone (or bot) to unleash a number of attacks to other targets. In this paper, we focus on the popular iPhone device. We create a new stealth and airborne malware namely iSAM able to wirelessly infect and self-propagate to iPhone devices. iSAM incorporates six different malware mechanisms, and is able to connect back to the iSAM bot master server to update its programming logic or to obey commands and unleash a synchronized attack. Our analysis unveils the internal mechanics of iSAM and discusses the way all iSAM components contribute towards achieving its goals. Although iSAM has been specifically designed for iPhone it can be easily modified to attack any iOS-based \u2026",

In this paper we propose a two layer architecture to prevent Denial of Service attacks on VoIP systems based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The architecture is designed to handle different types of attacks, including request flooding, malformed message sending, and attacks on the underlying DNS system. The effectiveness of the prevention mechanisms have been tested both in the laboratory and on a real live VoIP provider network.",

This is done by bridging the mixes in Tor, that is, we control both the traffic leaving the Onion Proxy (OP) and the traffic entering the Exit node. Specifically, from a user's viewpoint, our proposal has been implemented in the popular Android platform as a spyware, having the dual aim to manipulate user traffic before it enters the Tor overlay and explicitly instruct OP to choose an exit node that is controlled by the attacker. When the user traffic is received by the rogue exit node it is filtered, and the sender's IP details become visible. Notably, apart from deobfuscating normal http traffic, say, send via the Tor browser, the proposed scheme is able to manipulate https requests as well.",

While some solutions to this problem do exist, we will show that they are inadequate in a number of situations.

To provide a more complete estimation of this potential, we conduct extensive experimentations involving 5 different classifiers and a plethora of realistically simulated attack scenarios representing a variety of (D)DoS incidents.

            "Abstract": "To establish peer-to-peer connections and achieve real-time web-based communication, the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) framework requires address information of the communicating peers. This means that users behind, say, Network Address Translation (NAT) or firewalls normally rely on the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) framework for the sake of negotiating information about the connection and media transferring. This typically involves Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)/Traversal using Relays around NAT (TURN) servers, which assist the peers with discovering each other\u2019s private and public IP: port, and relay traffic if direct connection fails. Nevertheless, these IP: port pieces of data can be easily captured by anyone who controls the corresponding STUN/TURN server, and even more become readily available to the JavaScript application running on the webpage. While this is acceptable for a user that deliberately initiates a WebRTC connection, it becomes a worrisome privacy issue for those being unaware that such a connection is attempted. Furthermore, the application acquires more information about the local network architecture compared to what is exposed in usual HTTP interactions, where only the public IP is visible. Even though this problem is well-known in the related literature, no practical solution has been proposed so far. To this end, and for the sake of detecting and preventing in real time the execution of STUN/TURN clandestine, privacy-invading requests, we introduce two different kinds of solutions:(a) a browser extension, and (b) an HTTP gateway, implemented in C++ as well as in \u2026",

Starting from a large set of base prominent classifiers, we study how they can be combined to build an accurate ensemble. We propose a simple ensemble aggregated base model of similar feature type as well as a complex ensemble that can use multiple and possibly heterogeneous base models.

This work introduces Androtomist, a novel tool capable of symmetrically applying static and dynamic analysis of applications on the Android platform. Unlike similar hybrid solutions, Androtomist capitalizes on a wealth of features stemming from static analysis along with rigorous dynamic instrumentation to dissect applications and decide if they are benign or not. The focus is on anomaly detection using machine learning, but the system is able to autonomously conduct signature-based detection as well. Furthermore, Androtomist is publicly available as open source software and can be straightforwardly installed as a web application. The application itself is dual mode, that is, fully automated for the novice user and configurable for the expert one. As a proof-of-concept, we meticulously assess the detection accuracy of Androtomist against three different popular malware datasets and a handful of machine learning classifiers. We particularly concentrate on the classification performance achieved when the results of static analysis are combined with dynamic instrumentation vis-\u00e0-vis static analysis only. Our study also introduces an ensemble approach by averaging the output of all base classification models per malware instance separately, and provides a deeper insight on the most influencing features regarding the classification process. Depending on the employed dataset, for hybrid analysis, we report notably promising to excellent results in terms of the accuracy, F1, and AUC metrics. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Until now the IEEE 802.16 technologies, also known as WiMAX, may not have had the adoption rate of 802.11, but will likely be the predominant technology for Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) deployments for the next decade. This is because WiMAX can support all-IP core network architecture, low latency, advanced Quality of Service (QoS) and sophisticated security [1]. The IEEE 802.16 working group on broadband wireless access standards, a unit of the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards committee (http://www/wirelessman. org/), is preparing and revising formal specifications for the global deployment of broadband Wireless MANs. The 802.16 security model was designed initially to support authentication, confidentiality and integrity services. This is in contrast to the key management model used in the original 802.11 specification. The initial 802.16-2001 version of the standards [2] employs X. 509 certificates for the authentication of devices on the network. Every subscriber device has its own certificate that identifies it uniquely to the 802.16 infrastructure. Of course, this allows providers to control which devices are authorized to use their networks. On the other hand, as in GSM networks, authentication is not mutual. Specifically, while the network can authenticate a subscriber device, the subscriber device has no way to authenticate the infrastructure. This leads to several attacks including man-in-the-middle, spoofing or replay attacks against the subscriber device. For link encryption, 802.16 uses",

The main research question posed is whether \u2018touchstroking\u2019 can be effective in building the biometric profile of a user, in terms of typing pattern, for future authentication. To reach this goal, we implemented a touchstroke system in the Android platform and executed different scenarios under disparate methodologies to estimate its effectiveness in authenticating the end\u2010user. Apart from typical classification features used in legacy keystroke systems, we introduce two novel ones, namely, speed and distance.

            "Abstract": "Until the early 1990s telecommunication providers were employing dedicated closed networks, like the Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN), for transmitting voice. By this way the establishment of communication and voice transmission in PSTN was exploiting only 10\u201325% of the total available resources [1]. Even though significant effort has been devoted to improve resource utilization and to minimize the cost of the provided services, very little has been achieved to date. The Internet has supported the revolution in telecommunications and specifically in the provision of voice services, voice is transmitted over the Internet Protocol (VoIP) utilizing the Internet as a backbone network. Despite the fact that a plethora of novel, sophisticated, lowcost services can be offered in this way (eg, conference rooms, click to dial etc), telecommunication providers are now facing security problems that have not been previously encountered.Contrariwise to PSTN, which is based on a closed network architecture and thus it neither experiences a big variety of attacks nor a high attack frequency [2], VoIP utilizes an open network architecture and thus VoIP providers and end users should deal not only with the Internet\u2019s native vulnerabilities and attacks but also with VoIP oriented ones.

Generally, three major challenges are associated with any IDS of this category: identifying patterns of new attacks with high accuracy, ameliorating the human-readability of the detection rules, and rightly designating the category these attacks belong to. To this end, we propose Dendron, a methodology for generating new detection rules which are able to classify both common and rare types of attacks.

In such an environment security is considered a crucial parameter; this is true especially for privacy since not all domains can be considered trusted beforehand in terms of personal data protection. Probably the most promising protocol for multimedia session management is SIP. While SIP is popular and a lot of research has been conducted, it still has some security issues, one of which is related to privacy and more particularly the protection of user identities (IDs). In the general case everybody can reveal the communicating parties IDs by simply eavesdropping on the exchanged SIP messages. In this paper we analyze the lack of user ID protection in SIP and propose two solutions; in the first the ID of the caller is protected while in the second both IDs of the caller and the callee are \u2026",

Attribute Authorities (AA) bind the characteristics of an entity (called attributes) to that entity by signing the appropriate AC. Therefore, ACs can be used for controlling access to system resources and employing role-based authorization and access controls policies accordingly. Although ACs are widely used and standardized, to the best of our knowledge, no mobile infrastructure or service currently utilizes them. In this paper, we first examine how basic Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can be incorporated into mobile networks and especially the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). As a case study, we then experiment with ACs in the GPRS network, using a prototype implementation. In particular, we \u2026",

At the same time, security and privacy concerns regarding IoT technologies are also attracting significant attention given the risks that are inherently associated with the respective devices and their numerous applications, ranging from healthcare, smart homes, and cities, to intelligent transportation systems and industrial automation. Considering the still heterogeneous nature of the majority of IoT protocols, a major concern is to find common references for investigating and analyzing their security and privacy threats. To this end, and on top of the current literature, this work provides a comprehensive, vis-\u00e0-vis comparison of the security aspects of the thus far most widespread IoT Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols, namely BLE, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Thread, and EnOcean.

The first one puts forward the idea of using a continually changing mobile HTTP proxy in front of the botherder, while the other capitalizes on DNS protocol as a covert channel for coordinating the botnet. That is, for the latter, the messages exchanged among the bots and the herder appear as legitimate DNS transactions. Also, a third architecture is described and assessed, which is \u2026",

This paper proposes a novel two-level privacy framework, namely PrivaKERB, to address user privacy in Kerberos. Our solution offers two privacy levels to cope with user anonymity and service access untraceability. We detail how these modes operate in preserving user privacy in both single-realm and cross-realm scenarios.

Via the use of such architectures, the goal of the perpetrator is dual; first to further obfuscate their identity and minimize the botnet\u2019s forensic signal, and second to augment the resilience of their army. The novelty of the introduced architectures is that it does not rely on static C&C servers, but on rotating ones, which can be reached by other botnet members through their (varied) onion address.

Yet, as OT systems progressively become more and more interconnected, they silently have turned into alluring targets for diverse groups of adversaries. Meanwhile, the inherent complexity of these systems, along with their advanced-in-age nature, prevents defenders from fully applying contemporary security controls in a timely manner. Forsooth, the combination of these hindering factors has led to some of the most severe cybersecurity incidents of the past years. This work contributes a full-fledged and up-to-date survey of the most prominent threats against Industrial Control Systems (ICS) along with the communication protocols and devices adopted in these environments. Our study highlights that threats against CI follow an upward spiral due to the mushrooming of commodity tools and techniques that can facilitate either the early or late stages of attacks. Furthermore, our survey exposes that existing vulnerabilities in the design and implementation of several of the OT-specific network protocols may easily grant adversaries the ability to decisively impact physical processes. We provide a categorization of such threats and the corresponding vulnerabilities based on various criteria. As far as we are aware, this is the first time an exhaustive and detailed survey of this kind is attempted.",

As a result, mobile Internet traffic is about to overwhelm landline traffic. Mobile platforms do not only provide end users with services similar to legacy computers but also extend their experiences exploiting the additional hardware features (eg, sensors) incorporated in the mobile device, without the need of supplementary devices. Moreover, mobile devices are becoming the sources and repositories of sensitive information, from running performances to positioning data, from travel information to friendship preferences, from personal photos to financial data, and so on. Data loss, modification, or exposure that a mobile device might face, on one hand, could directly impact end users\u2019 safety and privacy, but, on the other hand, they could seriously damage the trust in the rising mobile economy. A typical example of these threats could be the case in which a mobile application that monitors some end user\u2019s body parameters is exploited by an adversary to gain access to sensitive data and infer the end user\u2019s health status. The possible damages caused by this data breach can impact both the psychological and physical spheres of an end user.

In this paper we elaborate on these privacy issues and propose an alternative context transfer protocol that protects user\u2019 location privacy as well. In addition, assuming that the context carries a user identity in the form of a Network Access Identifier (NAI), we show how the employment of temporary NAIs can further increase the privacy of our scheme.",

To date, efforts have focused on optimizing the authentication process itself, leaving out other relevant but sometimes important aspects like privacy. In this paper we present a solution that provides a lightweight authentication process while preserving user anonymity at the same time. The goal is to define a multi-layered pseudonym architecture that does not affect the fast re-authentication procedure and that allows a user to be untraceable. Taking as reference our previous work in fast re-authentication, we describe the extensions required to support identity privacy.

The results reveal a multitude of issues, ranging from an over-claim of sensitive permissions and the use of possibly privacy-invasive API calls, to numerous potentially exploitable CWE and CVE-identified weaknesses and vulnerabilities, the, in some cases, excessive employment of third-party trackers, and a number of other flaws related to the use of third-party software libraries, unsanitised input, and weak user password policies, to mention just a few.",

Naturally, this is because these devices are more than ever used by criminals of all kinds to perform a variety of offensive actions. The mushrooming of mobile services and the way people use their smartphones in their daily activities results in a plethora of valuable and private data stored in the device, which of course can be extremely helpful towards resolving a criminal case. The automatic or semi-automatic correlation of end-user events as recorded in the mobile device can be of great value to the investigator in their struggle to resolve a case. Unfortunately, existing forensic tools targeted to Android lack of such a functionality. To fill this gap, we propose the Android Forensic Data Analyzer (AFDA), a tool that is able to gather end-user\u2019s data stored in critical system areas and then inter-correlate them in terms of a time and location-based series of events. We argue that this type of analysis not only saves time and effort from an investigator\u2019s viewpoint but also can reveal the interrelationship between artifacts providing a more robust and comprehensive approach. 1.",

The Multicast/Broadcast Service (MBS) is also an integral part of 802.16e destined to deliver next generation services to subscribers. In this paper we concentrate on the Multicast and Broadcast Rekeying Algorithm (MBRA) of 802.16e. This algorithm has been recently criticized for various vulnerabilities and security inefficiencies, as its designers are trying to balance wisely between performance and security. After surveying related work, we extensively discuss MBRA security issues and propose the use of a novel asymmetric group key agreement protocol based on the work in Wu et al. (2009) [3].

One of the most prominent VoIP protocols for multimedia session management is SIP which, despite its popularity, suffers from security and privacy flaws. As SIP messages are sent in plain text, user data are exposed to intermediate proxies and eavesdroppers. As a result, information about users participating in a call can leak from header data, which cannot be omitted since they are needed for the correct routing of SIP messages to their final destination. Even more, traffic analysis attacks can be mounted with data stemming from lower layers. To redress this kind of problems, privacy can be achieved either by the construction of a lower level tunnel (via the use of SSL or IPsec protocols) or by employing a customtailored solution. However, SSL and IPsec are known for leading to undesirable \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The ability of smart objects to stay connected to the Internet for purposes of transmitting and receiving data is referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). As per recent estimates, the number of IoT devices will surpass 50 billion by 2020. Unsurprisingly, this mushrooming of IoT devices has drawn the attention of attackers who seek to exploit them for their own benefit, with the Mirai botnet being perhaps the most prominent example of IoT specific malware [1, 2]. Basically, IoT brings along a plethora of potential security and privacy risks to the end-users, including the unsanctioned access and abuse of private information, the enabling and strengthening of assaults against other systems, and the breeding of risks pertaining to personal safeness [3]. Especially, IoT facilitates the creation of an assortment of privacy risks to the consumer associated with the collection of personal and sensitive information, like their preferences, locations, habits, and so on. In the mid-or long-run these pieces of data can be used to, say, profile or impersonate the user or group of interest. On the other hand, such risks to security, privacy, and trust may significantly diminish end-user\u2019s confidence in IoT and therefore impede its full realization. The feature topic at hand intends to promote the dissemination of the latest methodologies, solutions, and case studies pertaining to IoT security, privacy, and trust issues. Its objective is to publish high-quality articles presenting security algorithms, protocols, policies, frameworks, and solutions for the IoT ecosystem. The goal of this special issue was to attract high-quality contributions from researchers working in the broad area of security \u2026",
