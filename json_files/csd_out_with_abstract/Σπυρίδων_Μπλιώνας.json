            "Abstract": "Wireless communication systems require optimization of different factors including real time performance, area, power, flexibility and time-to-market. Instruction set and custom hardware processors cannot optimize the combination of the above factors while reconfigurable hardware offers a good balance between flexibility and implementation efficiency. Heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip including instruction set processors, reconfigurable blocks and custom hardware are currently the state-of-the-art for the realization of future wireless communication systems. A critical design task in such platforms is the assignment of the target system\u2019s tasks on the different types of processing elements available and especially on reconfigurable hardware. In this paper reconfigurability requirements of wireless communication systems are identified both from a system point of view and from a lower level implementation perspective. Guidelines to drive decisions for the assignment of tasks on reconfigurable hardware are also presented. A dual mode HIPERLAN/2\u2013IEEE 802.11 a partly reconfigurable System-on-Chip is currently being developed. The reconfigurability requirements of HIPERLAN/2 and IEEE 802.11 a wireless LAN systems are analyzed.",

The proposed architecture utilises a combination of sequential and parallel measurements, to enable high performance whilst keeping the system low-cost and compact. The accuracy of the signal readout is maintained by following a special multiplexing approach, which ensures the continuous biasing of all the working electrodes of an array. After sampling the results, a digital calibration technique factors out errors from component inaccuracies. A prototype printed circuit board (PCB) was designed and built using off-the-shelf components for the real-time measurement of the amperometric signal of 48 electrodes. The operation and performance of the PCB was evaluated and characterised through a wide range of testing \u2026",

The UML and its real-time extensions are used to help the development phases of the prototype, mainly in the specification, co-simulation and validation of the design. The target of the development that was carried out with the application of the UML-based methodology is the implementation of an access point for a HIPERLAN/2 wireless network. Apart from the presentation of the UML-based system design methodology the paper also presents the application of the methodology for the implementation of the system prototype, the detailed software development and the results of the development.",

Then, at the implementation level, a new validation framework drives the validation procedure at three different sub-levels of de-sign abstraction (numerical representation, VHDL coding, FPGA-based proto-typing).

However, large ROM storage means higher power consumption, lower reliability, lower speed and increased costs. The novel design and implementation of a DDFS, with reduced memory size, is introduced. Using new technique, the resulting architecture can be realized by smaller number of gates (i.e. less hardware complexity) than existing ones.

Therefore the emphasis of this work is on the hardware-software structure of the developed modem and its processes, in order to offer a good balance of these requirements. In order to efficiently design and validate the behaviour of the modem, a behavioural model was developed in UML (Unified Modelling Language) as a part of the overall HIPERLAN/2 system's model. The processes of the modem were implemented in an instruction-set processor and custom hardware, combining the advantages of both software and hardware implementations.

It is compliant with the HIPERLAN/2 standard, but it also covers critical functionality of the IEEE 802.11a standard. Two embedded processor cores, dedicated hardware, on-chip memory elements, as well as advanced bus architectures and peripheral inter-faces were carefully combined and optimized for the targeted application, leading to a proper trade-off of silicon area, flexibility and power consumption. A system-level low-power design methodology has been used, due to the fact that power consumption is the most critical parameter in electronic portable system design. The 17.5 million-transistor solution was implemented in a 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS pro-cess and performs baseband processing at \u2026",

This method is based on measuring the instantaneous current drawn by the processor during the execution of the instructions. An appropriate instrumentation set up was established for this purpose. According to the proposed method the energy costs (base and inter-instruction costs) are modeled in relation to a reference instruction (eg NOP). These costs incorporate inter-cycle energy components, which cancel each other when they are summed to produce the energy consumption of a program resulting in estimates with high accuracy. This is confirmed by the results. Also the dependencies of the energy consumption on the instruction parameters (eg operands, addresses) are studied and modeled in an efficient way.",

In this case, the entrapped humans in the void, they affect the air composition and temperature into the void. The existence of human (s) creates CO 2 source (s), O 2 sink (s), and heat source (s) as well (from body temperature). The existence of the entrapped humans constantly affect the air composition and temperature into the void and makes gas components' concentrations dynamic. There will be presented the human CO 2 source (s), and O 2 sink (s) inside a cavity. The final goal is to estimate the concentrations of CO 2 and O 2 into the cavity as a function of time, having as parameters the \u2026",

This method is based on measuring the instantaneous current drawn by the processor during the execution of the instructions. An appropriate instrumentation set up was established for this purpose. According to the proposed method the energy costs (base and inter-instruction costs) are modeled in relation to a reference instruction (e.g. NOP). These costs incorporate inter-cycle energy components, which cancel each other when they are summed to produce the energy consumption of a program resulting in estimates with high accuracy. This is confirmed by the results. Also the dependencies of the energy consumption on the instruction parameters (e.g. operands, addresses) are studied and modeled in an efficient way.",

Also small blocks for the implementation of the reconfiguration capabilities, mentioned above, consist of adders, multiplexers, inverters, coders and registers.

            "Abstract": "This work concerns the performance analysis of the sensors contained in a victim detection system. The system is a mobile platform with gas sensors utilized for real time victim localization in urban environments after a disaster has caused the entrapment of people in partially collapsed building structures. The operating principle of the platform is the sampling of air from potential survival spaces (voids) and the measurement of the sampled air\u2019s temperature and concentration of CO 2 and O 2. Humans in a survival space are modelled as sources of CO 2 and heat and sinks of O 2. The physical openings of a survival space are modelled as sources of fresh air and sinks of the internal air. These sources and sinks dynamically affect the monitored properties of the air inside a survival space. In this paper, the effects of fresh air sources and internal air sinks are first examined in relation to local weather conditions. Then, the effect of human sources of CO 2 and sinks of O 2 in the space are examined. A model is formulated in order to reliably estimate the concentration of CO 2 and O 2 as a function of time for given reasonable entrapment scenarios. The input parameters are the local weather conditions, the openings of the survival space, and the number and type of entrapped humans. Three different tests successfully verified the presented theoretical estimations. A detection system with gas sensors of specified or measured capabilities, by utilizing this model and based on the expected concentrations, may inform the operator of the minimum required presence of humans in a survival space that can be detected after \u201csome time\u201d.",
