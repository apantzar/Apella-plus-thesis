            "Abstract": "We study numerically statistical distributions of sums of orbit coordinates, viewed as independent random variables in the spirit of the Central Limit Theorem, in weakly chaotic regimes associated with the excitation of the first (k= 1) and last (k= N) linear normal modes of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-\u03b1 system under fixed boundary conditions. We show that at low energies (E= 0.19), when the k= 1 linear mode is excited, chaotic diffusion occurs characterized by distributions that are well approximated for long times (t> 109) by a q-Gaussian Quasi-Stationary State (QSS) with q\u2248 1.4. On the other hand, when the k= N mode is excited at the same energy, diffusive phenomena are absent and the motion is quasi-periodic. In fact, as the energy increases to E= 0.3, the distributions in the former case pass through shorter q-Gaussian states and tend rapidly to a Gaussian (ie q\u2192 1) where equipartition sets in, while in the latter we need to reach to E= 4 to see a sudden transition to Gaussian statistics, without any passage through an intermediate QSS. This may be explained by different energy localization properties and recurrence phenomena in the two cases, supporting the view that when the energy is placed in the first mode weak chaos and \u201csticky\u201d dynamics lead to a more gradual process of energy sharing, while strong chaos and equipartition appear abruptly when only the last mode is initially excited.",

In particular, first the linearization equation around the solitons is solved by expanding its solution into a set of complete eigenfunctions of the linearization operator. Then, suppression of secular growth in the linearized solution leads to the evolution equations of soliton parameters. The results are applied to a number of case examples motivated by the physics of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, where dark-bright solitons have recently been studied both in theory and in experiments. We thus consider perturbations corresponding to (a) finite temperature-induced thermal losses, and (b) the presence of localized (\u03b4-function) impurities. In these cases, relevant equations of motion for the dark-bright soliton center are in agreement with ones previously obtained via alternative methods, including \u2026",

Introduction. It has been known for sometime that the Melnikov function plays an important role in the study of the phenomenon of the splitting of separatrices associated with hyperbolic fixed points of dynamical systems [1]. A discrete analogue of Melnikov\u2019s first theorem on the existence of separatrix intersections has been introduced for maps to [2],[10]. Very interesting results have also been obtained by Delshams & Ramirez-Ros [6] concerning the homoclinic Melnikov function for near integrable twist maps. The aim of this paper is to study the behavior of the family of periodic orbits around an elliptic fixed point of perturbed twist maps, through the computation of its subharmonic Melnikov function. In order to realise this goal, we use the twist generating function of the perturbed map to introduce the subharmonic Melnikov potential Lp/q. The differential of the subharmonic Melnikov potential Mp/q= dLp/q is the subharmonic Melnikov function for the twist perturbed map and provide the analytical criteria for non\u2013integrability of twist maps under conservative or dissipative perturbations.",

From this we deduce non-persistence for a variety of examples of perturbations. In particular, we show that travelling breathers do not persist under many reversible perturbations unless an additional symmetry is preserved, and we address the case of Hamiltonian perturbations.1. Introduction. The phenomenon of discrete breathers, ie spatially localized periodic oscillations in nonlinear lattices, has attracted much recent interest (see eg the review articles [2, 4, 6, 8]). One largely unresolved topic in this context is the rigorous mathematical status of travelling discrete breathers: although such objects have repeatedly been observed in numerical simulations (eg [3, 5, 10]), their existence has been proved for only a few rather special models ([1, 5]). In search of a better mathematical understanding, a natural first question is whether the known travelling breathers persist under certain perturbations of the respective underlying system. In this note we discuss a necessary condition for smooth persistence of travelling discrete breathers under perturbations of the Ablowitz\u2013Ladik (AL) lattice. Our condition establishes non-persistence for a variety of types of perturbations, but it fails to settle the persistence question for some important examples like the Salerno family, which will require more refined methods of analysis. Although our subsequent discussion of the persistence of travelling breathers applies to a wider class of lattices with hardly any modification, we shall, for the sake of concreteness \u2026",

We take advantage of the weak damping that characterizes these systems to perform a multiple-scales analysis and obtain amplitude equations, describing the slow dynamics of the system. This picture allows us to expose the existence of homoclinic orbits in the dynamics of the integrable part of the slow equations of motion.

Novel soliton packing schemes propose to subdivide information streams into different wavelengths-wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), or into orthogonal polarizations-polarization division multiplexing (PDM). However, a proper modeling of these schemes, especially to address stability properties, requires careful attention to the various perturbations which are present in optical systems. To model the interaction of the orthogonal polarizations of a pulse, the widely studied nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLS) is ex-tended to the integrable Manakov system. However, fiber-optic systems exhibit birefringence, differing phase and group velocities for different polarizations, as well nonlinear interactions between polarizations dependent upon amplitude\u2014cross-phase modulation (XPM) and upon complex phase-four-wave mixing (FWM). The nonlinear terms break the integrability of the Manakov equation and numerical simulations including these nonlin-earities have demonstrated pulse splitting and inelastic collisions.

Then, we introduce a slow-fast partition of the dynamics and average out the main frequency components in order to obtain a reduced system that is studied through the Slow Invariant Manifold (SIM) approach. Depending on the parameters of the system we find different interesting nonlinear dynamical phenomena. With the help of the SIM approach we can study how the parameters of the original problem influence the asymptotic behavior of the orbits of the system. This is accomplished with the application of Tikhonov\u2019s theorem. We classify the different cases of the dynamics according to the values of the parameters and the theoretically predicted asymptotic behavior of the orbits.

            "Abstract": "In the present work, we generalize earlier considerations for intrinsic localized modes consisting of a few excited sites, as developed in the one-component discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation model, to the case of two-component systems. We consider all the different combinations of \u201cup\u201d (zero phase) and \u201cdown\u201d (\u03c0 phase) site excitations and are able to compute not only the corresponding existence curves, but also the eigenvalue dependence of the small eigenvalues potentially responsible for instabilities, as a function of the nonlinear parameters of the model representing the self/cross phase modulation in optics and the scattering length ratios in the case of matter waves in optical lattices. We corroborate these analytical predictions by means of direct numerical computations. We infer that all the modes which bear two adjacent nodes with the same phase are unstable in the two component case and the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An explanation is offered for an observed lower bound on the wave speed of travelling kinks in Frenkel\u2013Kontorova lattices. Kinks exist at discrete wavespeeds within a parameter regime where there is a resonance with linear waves (phonons). However, they fail to exist even in this codimension-one sense whenever there is more than one phonon branch in the dispersion relation; inside such bands only quasi-kinks with nondecaying oscillatory tails are possible. The results are presented for a discrete sine-Gordon lattice with an onsite potential that has a tunable amount of anharmonicity. Novel numerical methods are used to trace kinks with topological charge Q=1 and 2 in three parameters representing the propagation speed, lattice discreteness and anharmonicity. Although none of the analysis is presented as rigorous mathematics, numerical results suggest that the bound on allowable wavespeeds is sharp \u2026",

We illustrate how the continuation of solutions in one-, as well as higher dimensions proceeds from the anti-continuum limit and show how to generalize the results of Pelinovsky et al (2005 Physica D 212 1) for arbitrary nonlinearities. As a case example of particular experimental relevance, we showcase our main findings in the special setting of the lattice with the saturable (photorefractive) nonlinearity in one and two dimensions. Our analytical results are found to be in good agreement with direct numerical computations.",

This approach resembles the dressing method known in the theory of solitons. The pole positions in the dressing factor are given by the complex double points of the Floquet spectrum associated with unstable modes of a seed solution of the nonlinear equation. As an example, we obtain the homoclinic orbit for the modified nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation solvable by the Wadati\u2013Konno\u2013Ichikawa spectral problem.",

            "Abstract": " In this review we try to capture some of the recent excitement induced by a large volume of theoretical and computational studies addressing nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger models (discrete and continuous) and the localized structures that they support. We focus on some prototypical structures, namely the breather solutions and solitary waves. In particular, we investigate the bifurcation of travelling wave solution in Discrete NLS system applying dynamical systems methods. Next, we examine the combined effects of cubic and quintic terms of the long range type in the dynamics of a double well potential. The relevant bifurcations, the stability of the branches and their dynamical implications are examined both in the reduced (ODE) and in the full (PDE) setting. We also offer an outlook on interesting possibilities for future work on this theme. ",

Standing wave solutions are known to exist in the discrete NLS equations outside of the finite spectral band. We study travelling wave solutions which have nonlinear resonances with unbounded linear spectrum. By using center manifold and normal form reductions, we show that a continuous NLS equation with the third-order derivative term is a canonical normal form for the discrete NLS equation near the zero-dispersion limit. Bifurcations of travelling wave solutions near the zero-dispersion limit are analyzed in the framework of the third-order derivative NLS equation.We show that there exists a continuous two-parameter family of single-humped travelling wave solutions in the third-order derivative NLS equation, when it is derived from the integrable \u2026",
