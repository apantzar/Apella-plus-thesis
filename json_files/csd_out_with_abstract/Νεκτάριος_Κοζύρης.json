            "Abstract": "Modern data analytics involve simple and complex computations over enormous numbers of data records. The volume of data and the increasingly stringent response-time requirements place increasing emphasis on the efficiency of approximate query processing. A major challenge over the past years has been the efficient construction of fixed-space synopses that provide a deterministic quality guarantee, often expressed in terms of a maximum error metric. For data reduction, wavelet decomposition has proved to be a very effective tool, as it can successfully approximate sharp discontinuities and provide accurate answers to queries. However, existing polynomial time wavelet thresholding schemes that minimize maximum error metrics are constrained with impractical time and space complexities for large datasets. In order to provide a practical solution to the problem, we develop parallel algorithms that take \u2026",

Range queries in our B+-tree start with an asynchronized traversal and then perform a horizontal scan of leaf nodes, by following sibling pointers, using hardware transactions. Despite its simplicity, our RCU-HTM based B+-tree with range query support greatly outperforms state-of-the-art map data structures for range queries in several execution scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "Near-Data-Processing (NDP) architectures present a promising way to alleviate data movement costs and can provide significant performance and energy benefits to parallel applications. Typically, NDP architectures support several NDP units, each including multiple simple cores placed close to memory. To fully leverage the benefits of NDP and achieve high performance for parallel workloads, efficient synchronization among the NDP cores of a system is necessary. However, supporting synchronization in many NDP systems is challenging because they lack shared caches and hardware cache coherence support, which are commonly used for synchronization in multicore systems, and communication across different NDP units can be expensive.This paper comprehensively examines the synchronization problem in NDP systems, and proposes SynCron, an end-to-end synchronization solution for NDP systems.

The key algorithmic characteristic of the SpM \u00d7 V kernel, that inhibits it from achieving high performance, is its very low flop:byte ratio. In this paper, we present a compressed storage format, called Compressed Sparse eXtended (CSX), that is able to detect and encode simultaneously multiple commonly encountered substructures inside a sparse matrix. Relying on aggressive compression techniques of the sparse matrix's indexing structure, CSX is able to considerably reduce the memory footprint of a sparse matrix, alleviating the pressure to the memory subsystem. In a diverse set of sparse matrices, CSX was able to provide a more than 40 percent average performance improvement over the standard CSR format in SMP architectures and surpassed 20 percent improvement in NUMA \u2026",

Therefore, evaluations are done using real or synthetic data sets that include either only spatio-textual data (e.g. tweets) or plain spatial data (e.g. GPS traces) that are not socially enhanced.

To increase the granularity of parallelism and avoid excessive synchronization, we combine TM with helper threading (HT). Our simulation results demonstrate that the straightforward parallelization of Dijkstra's algorithm with traditional locks and barriers has, as expected, disappointing performance. On the other hand, TM by itself is able to provide some performance improvement in several cases, while the version based on TM and HT exhibits a significant performance improvement that can reach up to a \u2026",

Moreover, IReS can efficiently adapt to the current cluster/engine conditions and recover from failures by effectively monitoring the workflow execution in real-time.

The two key features of our approach are: a) read-only operations require no synchronization or restarts and b) tree modifications are first performed in private copies of subtrees, then HTM is used to validate their consistency, and upon successful validation, the copy is installed back in the shared tree by modifying only a single pointer. Our approach can be applied to any type of balanced BSTs (eg, Red-Black, AVL, B-trees) and for the purpose of this paper we test it in an AVL tree. As our experimental evaluation reveals, the proposed AVL tree implementation achieves higher throughput and scalability compared to previous approaches for parallelizing balanced BSTs with HTM. More specifically on a machine comprising 22 physical cores (44 hardware threads) our tree outperforms other alternatives by 70% and 220%. As shown, this gain is attributed both to the much faster read-only operations and to the reduction in abort ratios thanks to the reduction of transactions\u2019 write-sets.",

In the original Rocket Chip implementation the L1 Data/Instruction TLB is fully-associative and the shared L2 TLB is direct-mapped. We lift these restrictions and design and implement configurable, set-associative L1 and L2 TLB templates that can create any organization from direct-mapped to fully-associative to achieve the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Despite the fact that nowadays there exist unprecedented opportunities to accurately monitor and analyze driving behaviour, the exact amount of the necessary driving data that should be collected for each driver in driving behaviour assessment is not determined yet. The objective of this paper is to quantify the need for driving data collection in driving performance assessment based on data collected through Smartphone devices from a sample of one hundred and seventy one (171) drivers that participated in the 7-months designed experiment. A statistical analysis was conducted to determine the period at which driving behaviour metrics (speed, mobile usage, harsh acceleration/braking events etc.) rate converges to a stable value. The impact of this methodology lies on the fact that it is essential for researchers nowadays. The impact of this methodology is significant since both small and big data samples lurk the risk of leading to doubtable results, by acquiring a sample either biased or computationally expensive to analyze.",

We fine-tune the topology execution to achieve maximum performance and we also apply a set of optimizations both in the HBase storage and the Phoenix SQL execution framework.

Similarly to RCU-based algorithms, we perform the modifications of the tree structure in private copies of the affected parts of the tree rather than in-place. This allows threads that traverse the tree to proceed without any synchronization and without being affected by concurrent modifications. The novelty of RCU-HTM lies at leveraging HTM to permit multiple updating threads to execute concurrently. After appropriately modifying the private copy, we execute an HTM transaction, which atomically validates that all the affected parts of the tree have remained unchanged since they've been read and, only if this validation is successful, installs the copy in the tree structure.We apply RCU-HTM on AVL and Red-Black \u2026",

However, no performance analysis is possible without an efficient monitoring interface and reliable hardware counter data. In this paper, we first address a reliability issue in the Performance Monitoring Unit of recent Intel processors with Hyper-Threading enabled. A published erratum causes cross hyper-thread hardware counter corruption and may produce unreliable results. We propose a cache-coherence style protocol which we implement in the Linux kernel to address the issue by introducing cross hyper-thread dynamic event scheduling.

Prefetching page table entries (PTEs) ahead of demand TLB accesses can mitigate the address translation performance bottleneck, but each prefetch requires traversing the page table, triggering additional accesses to the memory hierarchy. Therefore, TLB prefetching is a costly technique that may undermine performance when the prefetches are not accurate.In this paper we exploit the locality in the last level of the page table to reduce the cost and enhance the effectiveness of TLB prefetching by fetching cache-line adjacent PTEs \"for free\".

To attack this problem, we aim at reducing the overall data volume of the algorithm. Typical sparse matrix representation schemes store only the non-zero elements of the matrix and employ additional indexing information to properly iterate over these elements. In this paper we propose two distinct compression methods targeting index and numerical values respectively. We perform a set of experiments on a large real-world matrix set and demonstrate that the index compression method can be applied successfully to a wide range of matrices. Moreover, the value compression method is able to achieve impressive speedups in a more limited yet important class of sparse matrices that contain a small number of distinct values",

Our method delivers high performance stability for SpMV across different platforms and sparse matrices, due to its application and architecture awareness. Our experimental results demonstrate that a) our approach is able to distinguish and appropriately optimize special matrices in multicore platforms that fall out of the standard class of memory bandwidth bound matrices, and b) lead to a significant performance gain of 29% in a manycore platform compared to an architecture-centric optimization, as a result of the successful selection of the appropriate optimization for the great majority of the matrices.

Despite being very beneficial for the single-threaded execution, not storing the upper or lower triangular part of a symmetric sparse matrix complicates the multithreaded SpMxV version, since it introduces an undesirable dependency on the output vector elements. The most common approach for overcoming this problem is to use local, per-thread vectors, which are reduced to the output vector at the end of the computation.

            "Abstract": "Modern trends in the system architecture of high-performance parallel platforms focus on the clustering of symmetric multi-processing (SMP) nodes. Message-passing (eg with MPI) is necessary for the communication between nodes, but on the other hand it may prove inefficient within an SMP node, where a shared memory model (eg with OpenMP or explicit threading), should prove more efficient. A hybrid parallel programming model using message-passing for inter-node communication and shared memory for intra-node communication seems to better adapt to the underlying architecture, since it enables coarser-grain communication (one message per node), more efficient intra-node communication using the shared memory, and more flexible memory-access schemes by all threads executing on a single node. A competent programming framework for these systems can be constructed by the pairing of MPI and OpenMP, for applications in computational mechanics, where there is usually high demand for communication [1].Large-scale parallel computations favor iterative linear solvers, such as of Krylov type, due to their simple computational kernels (vector-vector products, matrix-vector products) that don\u2019t require either complex or excessive communication. The GMRES method is a Krylov-type solver for nonsymmetric linear systems that originate from a wide variety of problems [2]. GMRES contains a modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process that performs m 2 vector-vector products and m matrix-vector products; when the vectors size is 1.000. 000, typical values of m are around 100.",

In this paper we present a group of efficient allocation and pricing policies that can be used by vendors for their spot price mechanisms. We model the procedure of acquiring virtual machines as a truthful knapsack auction and we deploy dynamic allocation and pricing rules that achieve nearoptimal revenue and social welfare. As the problem is NP-hard our solutions are based on approximate algorithms. First, we propose two solutions that do not use prior knowledge. Then, we enhance them with three learning algorithms. We evaluate them with simulations on the Google Cluster dataset and we benchmark them against the Uniform Price, the Optimal Single Price and the Ex-CORE mechanisms. Our proposed dynamic mechanism is robust, achieves revenue up to 89% of the Optimal Single Price auction, and computes the allocation in polynomial time making our contribution computationally tractable in realtime scenarios.",

We apply a hyperplane-based grouping transformation to the tiled space, so as to group together independent neighboring tiles and assign them to the same SMP node. In this way, intranode (intragroup) communication is annihilated. Groups are atomically executed inside each node. Nodes exchange data between successive group computations. We schedule groups much more efficiently by exploiting the inherent overlapping between communication and computation phases among successive atomic group executions. The applied non-blocking schedule resembles a pipelined datapath, where group computation phases are overlapped with communication ones, instead of being \u2026",

TLBs are essential in terms of performance because they mitigate the overhead of frequent Page Table Walks, but may harm the critical path of the processor due to their size and/or associativity. In the original Rocket Chip implementation the L1 Instruction/Data TLB is fully-associative and the shared L2 TLB is direct-mapped. We lift these restrictions and design and implement configurable, set-associative L1 and L2 TLB templates that can create any organization from direct-mapped to fully-associative to achieve the desired ratio of performance and resource utilization, especially for larger TLBs. We evaluate different TLB configurations and present performance, area, and frequency results of our design using benchmarks from the SPEC2006 suite on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA.",

An important issue in these is the offering of elasticity, i.e., the dynamic allocation of resources to applications to meet fluctuating workload demands. Threshold based approaches are typically employed, yet they are difficult to configure and optimize. Approaches based on reinforcement learning have been proposed, but they require a large number of states in order to model complex application behavior. Methods that adaptively partition the state space have been proposed, but their partitioning criteria and strategies are sub-optimal. In this work we present MDP_DT, a novel full-model based reinforcement learning algorithm for elastic resource management that employs adaptive state space partitioning. We propose two novel statistical criteria and three strategies and we experimentally prove that they correctly decide both where and when to partition, outperforming existing approaches. We experimentally evaluate MDP_DT in a real large scale cluster over variable not-encountered workloads and we show that it takes more informed decisions compared to static and model-free approaches, while requiring a minimal amount of training data.",

A straightforward way is presented to easily translate multi-dimensional indexing of arrays into their blocked memory layout using quick and simple binary-mask operations.

In particular, under advanced scheduling scheme two separate techniques are considered: first, the application of a suitable tiling transformation, and second, the overlapping of computation and communication when executing the parallel program. As far as the choice of a scheduling-efficient tiling transformation is concerned, the data dependencies of the initial algorithm are taken into account and an appropriate transformation matrix is automatically generated according to a well-established theory. On the other hand, overlapping computation with communication partly hides the communication overhead and allows for more efficient processor utilization. The chapter discusses a tool that \u2026",

Previous scientific work reports a number of different factors that may significantly reduce performance. However, the interaction of these factors with the underlying architectural characteristics is not clearly understood, a fact that may lead to misguided and thus unsuccessful attempts for optimization. In order to gain an insight on the details of SpMxV performance, we conduct a suite of experiments on a rich set of matrices for three different commodity hardware platforms. Based on our experiments we extract useful conclusions that can serve as guidelines for the subsequent optimization process of the kernel.",

We will start from the origins of the first IBM machines back in 1960's, where the notion of virtualization was originally introduced to partition the hardware resources more efficiently. This was well before the onset of the majority of the operating systems in the early 1970's, which were initially introduced as a software alternative to partition and expose hardware resources to multiple users. In the late 1980's and 1990's the software hypervisors allowed the multiplexing of PC hardware and enabled the use of virtual machines, which in the 2000's became a commodity that needed to be efficiently orchestrated and provisioned in bulk.

SQL-based big data analytics is a very popular but also challenging domain due to its complexity that requires multiple runtime query optimizations. Popular frameworks, such as Presto and SparkSQL, commonly retrieve data from multiple sources and process them locally using domain-specific optimizers. However, recent work indicates that no single engine offers the optimal all-in-one solution for all types of SQL queries. Taking this into account, we envision building an optimizer to facilitate faster distributed SQL analytics over multiple engines, which will perform operator-level optimization using Machine Learning techniques and will exploit the sophisticated data-driven local engine optimizations.",

To overcome the architectural limitation of a low number of outstanding requests, we focus on overlapping read and network I/O for a single request, in order to improve throughput. To this end, we introduce the concept of synchronized send operations and present an implementation on Myrinet/GM, based on custom modifications to the NIC firmware and associated userspace library. Compared to a network block sharing system over standard GM and the base version of gmblock, our enhanced implementation supporting synchronized sends delivers 81% and 44% higher throughput for streaming block I/O, respectively.",

The ability to dynamically allocate resources and deploy a new application instance based on a user-provided description in a fully automated manner is of great importance for the cloud users as it facilitates the generation of fully reproducible application environments with minimum effort. However, most modern deployment solutions do not consider the error-prone nature of the cloud: Network glitches, bad synchronization between different services and other software or infrastructure related failures with transient characteristics are frequently encountered. Even if these failures may be tolerable during an application\u2019s lifetime, during the deployment phase they can cause severe errors and lead it to failure. In order to tackle this challenge, in this work we propose AURA, an open source system that enables cloud application deployment with transient failure recovery capabilities. AURA formulates the application deployment as a Directed Acyclic Graph. Whenever a transient failure occurs, it traverses the graph, identifies the parts of it that failed and re-executes the respective scripts, based on the fact that when the transient failure disappears the script execution will succeed. Moreover, in order to guarantee that each script execution is idempotent, AURA adopts a lightweight filesystem snapshot mechanism that aims at canceling the side effects of the failed scripts. Our thorough evaluation indicated that AURA is capable of deploying diverse real-world applications to environments exhibiting high error probabilities, introducing a minimal time overhead, proportional to the \u2026",

Hybrid parallel programming models usually suffer from intrinsic load imbalance between threads, mainly because most existing message passing libraries generally provide limited multi-threading support, allowing only the master thread to perform internode message passing communication. In order to mitigate this effect, the authors proposed a generic method for the application of static load balancing on the coarse-grain hybrid model for the appropriate distribution of the computational load to the working threads. The efficiency of the proposed scheme was experimentally evaluated against a micro-kernel benchmark, and demonstrated the potential of such load balancing schemes for the extraction of maximum performance out of hybrid parallel \u2026",

In addition, a lot of work has been done concerning the selection of a communication-minimal and a scheduling-optimal tiling transformation. However, no complete approach has been presented in terms of implementation for non-rectangularly tiled iteration spaces. Code generation in this case can be extremely complex, while parallelization issues such as data distribution and communication are far from being straightforward. In this paper, we propose a complete method to efficiently generate data parallel code for arbitrarily tiled iteration spaces. We assign chains of neighboring tiles to the same processor. Experimental results show that nonrectangular tiling allows better scheduling schemes, thus achieving less overall execution time.",

The enormous increase in both user and machine generated content dictates for scalable solutions in triple data stores. Current systems manage to decentralize some or all the stages of RDF data management, scaling to arbitrarily large numbers of triples. Yet, these systems prove highly inflexible in adjusting their behavior relative to the query in hand. Queries over triple data include multiple joins with varying degrees of selectivity and cost. In many cases, a join performed on a single centralized computer node is highly preferable. Thus, both informed query planning and adaptive join execution are necessary to gain optimal performance in both selective and non selective queries. Towards that direction, we describe H2RDF+, an RDF store that efficiently performs distributed joins over a multiple index scheme. H2RDF \u2026",

To decrease memory contention and improve the performance of the kernel we propose two compression schemes. The first, called CSR-DU, targets the reduction of the matrix structural data by applying coarse grain delta encoding for the column indices. The second scheme, called CSR-VI, targets the reduction of the numerical values using indirect indexing and can only be applied to matrices which contain a small number of unique values. Evaluation of both methods on a rich matrix set showed that they can significantly improve the performance of the multithreaded version of the kernel and achieve good scalability for large matrices.",

While allowing for efficient storing, indexing and querying of the data, our system employs an adaptive scheme that automatically adjusts the level of indexing according to the privacy constrains: Efficient roll-up and drill-down operations take place in order to guarantee k-anonymity while minimizing data distortion and inconsistency. Thus, our system manages to maintain k-anonymity of the published data in a distributed and on-line manner even under frequent updates, without affecting its ability to efficiently answer queries. The initial experimental evaluation of our prototype shows that KANIS manages to preserve k-anonymity while improving the data quality up to 22% compared to a popular centralized global recoding algorithm. It achieves a near-optimal distortion regardless of the network or dataset size, with a reasonable communication overhead, scattered among the participating nodes.",

We explore the potential of BFPC, a recently prosposed software compression algorithm, but by modeling it for hardware compression and comparing it to three state-of-the-art schemes. We find that it can reduce floating-point data traffic by up to 40%, which for memory bound executions translates to significant performance improvement.",

Our approach utilizes oblique Decision Trees in order to recursively partition an application\u2019s configuration space in disjoint regions, choose a set of representative samples from each subregion according to a defined policy and returns a model for the entire configuration space as a composition of linear models over each subregion. An extensive experimental evaluation over real-life applications and synthetic performance functions showcases that our scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art profiling methodologies. It particularly excels at reflecting abnormalities and discontinuities of the performance function, allowing the user to influence the sampling policy based on the modeling accuracy, the space coverage and the deployment cost.",

Thus, simple statistical methods are not able to capture the complexity of cryptocurrency exchange rate, forcing researchers to turn to advanced machine learning techniques. In this work, we present a methodology for building deep learning models to forecast the price of cryptocurrencies and apply it to the prediction of Ether price, resulting in short-and long-term forecasts that achieve an accuracy of up to 84.2%.",

Taking into account the complexity of the design and implementation of a universal scheduler, let alone the probability of being fruitless, we focus on a system with multiple scheduling policies that coexist and service VMs according to their workload characteristics.

One of the most promising optimization techniques for SpMV is blocking, which can reduce the indexing structures for storing a sparse matrix, and therefore alleviate the pressure to the memory subsystem. However, blocking methods can severely degrade performance if not used properly.

            "Abstract": "Structured peer-to-peer overlay networks or Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are distributed systems optimized for storage and retrieval of read-only data. In this paper we elaborate on a method that allows them to manage mutable data. We argue that by altering the retrieval algorithm of DHTs, we can enable them to cope with data updates, without sacrificing their fundamental properties of scalability and fault-tolerance. We describe in detail and analyze an implementation of a Kademlia network capable of handling mutable data. Nevertheless, the corresponding protocol additions can easily be applied to any DHT design. Experimental results show that although the process of managing and propagating data updates throughout the network adds up to the total cost of the lookup operation, the extra network utilization can be exploited in favor of overlay resilience to random node joins and failures.",

The intrinsic load imbalance in hybrid parallelisation derives from the fact that message passing libraries often provide limited multi-threading support, thus allowing only the master thread to perform inter-node message passing communication. In order to mitigate this effect, we propose a generic method for the application of load balancing on the coarse-grain hybrid model for the appropriate load distribution among the working threads. We investigate both static and dynamic load balancing, and experimentally evaluate three balancing variations against kernel benchmarks.",

Architectural diversity among different processors together with structural diversity among different sparse matrices lead to bottleneck diversity. This justifies an SpMV optimizer that is both matrix- and architecture-adaptive through runtime specialization. To this direction, we present an approach that first identifies the performance bottlenecks of SpMV for a given sparse matrix on the target platform either through profiling or by matrix property inspection, and then selects suitable optimizations to tackle those bottlenecks. Our optimization pool is based on the widely used Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) sparse matrix storage format and has low preprocessing overheads, making our overall approach practical even in cases where fast decision making and optimization setup is required.

Adding more threads and keeping the processor frequency high might not attain the expected performance benefits, therefore leading to a waste of energy. In this paper, we explore the performance-energy landscape of the SpMV kernel by examining the impact of frequency scaling and thread placement on the performance and the energy requirements of the SpMV kernel. We use a simple power metric specifically targeted to the streaming nature of SpMV to rank the different execution configurations in terms of power dissipation, and use the notion of Pareto optimality from the theory of multi-objective optimization to analyze and characterize the tradeoffs. Finally, we propose a prediction model based on machine learning, which is capable of accurately predicting the execution configurations leading to the best performanceenergy tradeoffs for SpMV execution.",

In our approach, we are interested not only in tile size and shape according to the required communication to computation ratio, but also in overall completion time. We select a time hyperplane to execute different tiles much more efficiently by exploiting the inherent overlapping between communication and computation phases among successive, atomic tile executions. We assign tiles to processors according to the tile space boundaries, thus considering the iteration space bounds. Our schedule considerably reduces overall completion time under the assumption that some part from every communication phase can be efficiently overlapped with atomic, pure tile computations. The overall schedule resembles a pipelined datapath where computations are not anymore interleaved with \u2026",

Approaches based on reinforcement learning have been proposed but they require a large number of states in order to model complex application behavior.

The idea is to start from one state that represents the entire environment and partition this into finer-grained states adaptively to the observed workload and system behavior following a decision-tree approach. We explore novel statistical criteria and strategies that decide both the correct parameters and the appropriate time to perform the partitioning.",

The sharing of the various types of resources by diverse applications poses a series of challenges in order to optimize resource utilization while avoiding performance degradation caused by application interference. In this paper, we present two scheduling methodologies enforcing consolidation techniques on multicore physical machines. Our resource-aware and interference-aware scheduling schemes aim at improving physical host efficiency while preserving the application performance by taking into account host oversubscription and the resulting workload interference. We validate our fully operational framework through a set of real-life workloads representing a wide class of modern cloud applications. The experimental results prove the efficiency of our system in optimizing resource utilization and thus energy consumption even in the presence of oversubscription. Both methodologies achieve significant reductions of the CPU time consumed, reaching up to 50%, while at the same time maintaining workload performance compared to widely used scheduling schemes under a variety of representative cloud platform scenarios.",

First, the iterations are scheduled in time, according to the hyperplane method, taking into consideration the minimum time displacement. Then, the iteration space is divided into discrete groups of related iterations, which are assigned to different processors, while preserving the optimal completion time. Chain Grouping is based on clustering together neighboring uniform chains of iterations, formed by a particular dependence vector. This vector will be proven as the best among all to reduce the total communication requirements. Inside every group, the optimal hyperplane scheduling is preserved and references to intragroup iterations are considerably increased. The partitioned groups are \u2026",

The main problem of SpMV is its high demands on memory bandwidth, which cannot yet be abundantly offered from modern commodity architectures. One of the most promising optimization techniques for SpMV is blocking, which can reduce the indexing structures for storing a sparse matrix, and therefore alleviate the pressure to the memory subsystem. In this paper, we study and evaluate a number of representative blocking storage formats on a set of modern microarchitectures that can provide up to 64 hardware contexts. The purpose of this paper is to present the merits and drawbacks of each method in relation to the underlying microarchitecture and to provide a consistent overview of the most promising blocking storage methods \u2026",

However, automatic code generation for tiled loops can be a very complex compiler work due to non-rectangular tile shapes and iteration space bounds. Our method considerably enhances previous work on rewriting tiled loops by considering parallelepiped tiles and arbitrary iteration space shapes. The complexity of code generation for tiling transformation is now reduced to the complexity of code generation for any linear transformation. Experimental results which compare all so far presented approaches, show that the proposed approach for generating tiled code is significantly accelerated.",

In general, the selection of the supernode transformation greatly affects the parallel execution time of the transformed algorithm. Since the minimization of the overall parallel execution time via an appropriate supernode transformation is very difficult to accomplish, researchers have focused on scheduling-aware supernode transformations that maximize parallelism during the execution. In this paper we argue that the communication volume of the transformed algorithm is an important criterion, and its minimization should be given high priority. For this reason we define the metric of the per process communication volume and propose a method to minimize this metric by selecting a communication-aware supernode shape. Our approach is equivalent to defining a proper Cartesian process grid with \u2026",

Since data transfers pose a severe bottleneck for GPU offloading, modern GPUs provide the ability to overlap communication with computation by splitting the problem to fine-grained sub-kernels that are executed in a pipelined manner. This optimization is currently underutilized by GPU BLAS libraries, since it requires an approach to select an efficient tiling size, which in turn leads to a challenging problem that needs to consider routine, system, data, and problem-specific characteristics. In this work, we introduce an elaborate 3-way concurrency model for GPU BLAS offload time that considers previously neglected features regarding data access and machine behavior. We then incorporate our model in an automated, end-to-end framework (called CoCoPeLia) that supports overlap \u2026",

Tiling is a widely used loop iteration reordering technique for improving locality of references. Tiled codes modify the instruction stream to exploit cache locality for array accesses. In this paper, we further reduce cache misses, restructuring the memory layout of multidimensional arrays, that are accessed by tiled instruction code. In our method, array elements are stored in a blocked way, exactly as they are swept by the tiled instruction stream. We present a straightforward way to easily translate multidimensional indexing of arrays into their blocked memory layout using simple binary-mask operations. Indices for such array layouts are easily calculated based on the algebra of dilated integers, similarly to morton-order indexing. Actual experimental results, using matrix multiplication and LU-decomposition on various size arrays, illustrate that execution time is greatly improved when combining tiled code with tiled array layouts and binary mask-based index translation functions. Simulations using the Simplescalar tool, verify that enhanced performance is due to the considerable reduction of total cache misses.",

Previous work has suggested using local, per-thread vectors to circumvent this problem, introducing a work-inefficient reduction step that limits the scalability of SpMV. In this paper, we address this issue with Conflict-Free Symmetric (CFS) SpMV, an optimization strategy that organizes the parallel computation into phases of conflict-free execution. We identify such phases through graph coloring and propose heuristics to improve the coloring quality for SpMV in terms of load balancing and locality to the input and output vectors.

These frameworks differentiate significantly in terms of the policies they follow to decompose their workloads into multiple tasks and also on the way they exploit the available computing resources.

Assigning full core capacity to such applications is a clear resource waste. To support efficient and power-aware resource allocation policies, we need a prediction mechanism to provide information about the potential scalability of an application. In this paper we take an initial step towards building a scalability predictor, based on the utilization of information collected both during compile and runtime. Our approach is applied separately to each parallel-for region in the program and calculates an on-chip to off-chip activity ratio Sr, which then is associated to the scalability of the region (maximum speedup) with linear regression. Experimental results on two architectures using the Polybench suite demonstrate that our prediction model exhibits a good accuracy in predicting the scalability of various parallel-for regions.",

While the main objective when replicating data to remote processes is to reduce aggregate network usage and boost end-application performance, replicas can also be exploited in favor of resiliency to network and site failures and increased data transfer throughput. Nevertheless, managing replicas in highly distributed data storage environments can be very complex. The processes involved in creating, locating, retrieving and updating replicas must guarantee both scalability and fault-tolerance. In this paper, we investigate the requirements of a Grid-centric, replica-based data storage and retrieval infrastructure, present the current trends and implementations and elaborate on how future architectures can capitalize on peer-to-peer technologies in order to achieve even higher levels of scale, without the need of deploying special data management servers.",

Brown Dwarf manages to distribute a highly effective centralized structure among peers on-the-fly, reducing cube creation and query times by enforcing parallelization. Both point and aggregate queries as well as updates are naturally performed on-line through cooperating nodes that hold parts of a fully or partially materialized data cube. The system also employs an adaptive replication scheme that expands or shrinks the units of the distributed data structure for minimal storage consumption against failures and load skew. Brown Dwarf collects many of the features of an application to be deployed in the Cloud: It adapts its resources according to demand, allows for on-line, fast and efficient storage/processing of large amounts of data and is cost-effective both over the required hardware and software components. Our system has been evaluated on both actual and simulation-based testbeds. To outline the findings of our extensive experimentations, Brown Dwarf manages to accelerate cube creation up to 5 times and querying up to several tens of times by exploiting the capabilities of the available network nodes working in parallel. Incurring only a small storage overhead compared to the centralized algorithm, it distributes the structure pretty evenly across the overlay nodes. It manages to quickly adapt even after sudden bursts in load and remains unaffected with a considerable fraction of frequent node failures. These advantages are even more \u2026",

In this regard, accelerators, such as GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi, have already started to play a significant role in HPC systems offering a high degree of parallelism to application developers. Furthermore, hardware virtualization is gaining interest in these domains as well, due to thebenefits it offers, such as server consolidation, costs reduction and resourceutilization. In this context, there is a growing potential for integratingaccelerators into the virtualization stacks of the next generation. In this paper we take a first step towards enabling Intel Xeon Phi capabilitiesin virtual machines. We present vPHI, a framework for efficient virtualizationof Intel Xeon Phi resources.

The majority of these frameworks utilize containers, a lightweight operating system virtualization technique, to ensure isolated function execution. Unikernels, which package applications within a single-address space library operating system, have been proposed as an alternative function isolation mechanism, which offers stronger isolation guarantees without suffering the performance penalties of full hardware virtualization. However, due to different storage semantics between containers and unikernels, the state-of-the-art approaches for using unikernels in place of containers result in decreased performance, inefficient resource utilization and limited functionality.",

As a result, we are able to multiplex and prioritize network access per VM. We evaluate our design via a prototype implementation that integrates RDMA semantics into the privileged guest of the Xen virtualization platform. Our framework allows VMs to communicate with the network using a simple user-level RDMA protocol. Preliminary results show that our prototype achieves 681MiB/sec over generic 10GbE hardware and relieves the guest from CPU overheads, while limiting the guest\u2019s CPU utilisation to 34%.",

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that computes single source shortest paths for graphs with non-negative edges and is based on the iterative extraction of nodes from a priority queue. This property limits the explicit parallelism of the algorithm and any attempt to utilize the remaining parallelism results in significant slowdowns due to synchronization overheads. To deal with these problems, we employ the concept of helper threads (HT) to extract parallelism on a non-traditional fashion and transactional memory (TM) to efficiently orchestrate the concurrent threads' accesses to shared data structures. Results demonstrate that the proposed implementation is able to achieve performance speedups (reaching up to 1.84 for 14 threads), indicating that the two paradigms could be efficiently combined.",

Our experimental testbed concerns the parallel execution of tiled nested loops onto a Linux PC cluster with PCI-SCI NICs (Dolphin D330). Tiles are necessarily exchanging data and should also have large computational grain, so that their parallel execution becomes beneficial. We schedule tiles much more efficiently by exploiting the inherent overlapping between communication and computation phases among successive, atomic tile executions. The applied nonblocking schedule resembles a pipelined datapath where computation phases are overlapped with communication ones, instead of being interleaved with them. We are using DMA communication mode, to remote write (send) data to other nodes, while the host CPU is computing all iterations within each tile. We achieve zero-copy communication through pinned-down physical memory regions for DMA (PCI exported segments to SCI global space). Results illustrate that when using enhanced communication features such as DMA transfers, memorymapped interfaces and zero-copy mechanisms, overall performance is considerably enhanced than when typically using conventional, CPU and kernel bounded, communication primitives.",

More specifically, we propose three alternative models for tiled nested loop algorithms, namely a pure message passing paradigm, as well as two hybrid ones, that implement communication both through message passing and shared memory access. The hybrid models adopt an advanced hyperplane scheduling scheme, that allows both for minimal thread synchronization, as well as for pipelined execution with overlapping of computation and communication phases. We focus on the experimental evaluation of all three models, and test their performance against several iteration spaces and parallelization grains with the aid of a typical microkernel benchmark. We conclude that the hybrid models can in some cases be more beneficial compared to the \u2026",

Tiling transformation is an efficient loop transformation to achieve coarse-grain parallelism in such algorithms, while rectangular tile shapes are the only feasible shapes that can be manually applied by program developers. However, rectangular tiling transformations are not always valid due to data dependencies, and thus requiring the application of an appropriate skewing transformation prior to tiling in order to enable rectangular tile shapes. We employ cyclic mapping of tiles to processes and propose a method to determine an efficient rectangular tiling transformation for a fixed number of processes for 2-dimensional, skewed PDE problems.

These devices, together with sensors, regularly produce very high data volumes nowadays. For many real-time applications, storing and indexing an unbounded stream may not be an option. Thus, it is important that we design algorithms and systems that can both work at the edge of the network and be able to answer queries on distributed, streaming data. Moreover, in many streaming scenarios, fresh data tend to be prioritized. A sliding-window model is an important case of stream processing, where only the most recent elements remain active and the rest are discarded.

Therefore, compiler optimizations such as instruction scheduling become relevant once more. At the same time, the increased diversity of processor architectures imposes the requirement of architectureindependence on compiler optimization techniques. The goal of this paper is to improve instruction scheduling by injecting randomness into the list scheduling algorithm used for basic block scheduling. In order for our approach to be practical and architecture-independent, we build upon the existing compiler infrastructure of GCC. We evaluate different methods of exploring the resulting search space of legal instruction schedules. Our approach consists of choosing the best schedule over a number of randomly generated schedules, using profiling on real hardware. We experiment with various processor architectures (XScale, Sun Niagara 2, Cell SPU, Intel Harpertown) and conclude that randomness in instruction scheduling is able to offer significant performance improvement in a noticeable number of cases.",

This feature characterizes the cloud era, where the overhead of early expenditure for infrastructure is eliminated. Innovative services are thus able to enter the market quicker and adopt faster to new challenges and user demand. One of the main aspects of this on-demand nature is the concept of elasticity, i.e., the ability of autonomously provision and de-provision resources by reacting to changes in the incoming load. An elastic service is able to operate with an optimal cost by expanding and contracting its used resources at runtime and according to demand. This does not only minimizes running cost, but also avoids disruptive outages due to spikes in service usage. While the various layers comprising a cloud service can be scaled, this does not happen in a unified manner. The vision of CELAR is to provide a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Graph algorithms are hard to parallelize, as they exhibit varying degrees of parallelism and perform irregular memory accesses. Graph coloring is a well studied problem, that colors the vertices of a graph, such that no adjacent vertices have the same color. This is a necessity for a large number of applications that require a coloring with few colors in near-linear time. In this work, we propose a simple and fast parallel graph coloring algorithm, well suited for shared memory architectures. Our algorithm employs Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) to detect coloring inconsistencies between adjacent vertices, and exploits Read-Copy-Update (RCU) to enable high performance and ensure correctness.We evaluate our algorithm on an Intel Haswell server using large-scale synthetic and real-world graphs, chosen to vary in terms of density and structure. With 14 threads, we achieved a geometric \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Tiling or supernode transformation has been widely used to improve locality in multi-level memory hierarchies, as well as to efficiently execute loops on parallel architectures. However, automatic code generation for tiled loops can be a very complex compiler work due to non-rectangular tile shapes and arbitrary iteration space bounds. In this paper, we first survey code generation methods for nested loops which are transformed using non-unimodular transformations. All methods are based on Fourier-Motzkin (FM) elimination. Next, we consider and enhance previous work on rewriting tiled loops by considering parallelepiped tiles and arbitrary iteration space shapes. In order to generate tiled code, all methods first enumerate the tiles containing points within the iteration space, and second, sweep the points within each tile. For the first, we extend previous work in order to access all tile origins correctly, while for the latter, we propose the transformation of the initial parallelepiped tile iteration space into a rectangular one, so as to generate code efficiently with the aid of a non-unimodular transformation matrix and its Hermite Normal Form (HNF). The resulting systems of inequalities are much simpler than those in bibliography; thus their solutions are determined more efficiently using the FM elimination. Experimental results which compare all presented approaches, show that the proposed method for generating tiled code is significantly faster, and thus rewriting any n-D tiled loop in a much more efficient and direct way.",

The geometric representation of these sets form certain polygonal shapes called patterns, with special attributes and characteristics. In this work, we present a new geometric methodology for predicting the execution propagation of the pattern boundaries.

Recent studies show that the number of stable solutions can be large in practice. Yet the classical solution to the problem, the Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm, assigns an optimal match to each agent on one side, and a pessimal one to each on the other side; such a solution may fare well in terms of equity only in highly asymmetric markets. Finding a stable matching that minimizes the sex equality cost, an equity measure expressing the discrepancy of mean happiness among the two sides, is strongly NP-hard. Extant heuristics either (a) oblige some agents to involuntarily abandon their matches, or (b) bias the outcome in favor of some agents, or (c) need high-polynomial or unbounded time.",

To overcome this challenge, we propose AURA, a framework that formulates an application deployment as a Directed Acyclic Graph traversal and re-executes the parts of the graph that failed. AURA achieves to execute any deployment script that updates filesystem related resources in an idempotent manner through the adoption of a layered filesystem technique.

We explore programming techniques and optimizations which maximize performance for these solver versions. The out-of-place version is straightforward to implement and achieves greater raw performance than the in-place one, but requires more computational steps to converge.

The Brown Dwarf manages to distribute a highly effective centralized structure among peers on-the-fly. Both point and aggregate queries are then naturally answered online through cooperating nodes that hold parts of a fully or partially materialized data cube. Updates are also performed on-line, eliminating the usually costly over-night process. To tackle dynamic shifts in skew as well as network and node failures, our system employs an adaptive replication scheme, by creating copies of various units of the distributed data structure according to the load as well as the churn rate of the network. This process, called mirroring, ensures balanced load distribution, guarantees resilience and allows for smooth query resolution even in the most dynamic environments. Extensive experiments with the current implementation prove that our system achieves fair storage and load distribution with minimum overhead under variable data and query sets. It manages to quickly adapt even after sudden bursts in load and remains unaffected with up to 10% node failures. These measurements clearly identify Brown Dwarf as a robust and efficient system for distributing a data cube.",

This method is based on loop mapping for systolic arrays. The virtual array of cells is derived from the index space, by applying a linear transformation. This array is divided (cut) into a fixed number of clusters, equal to the number of available real processors. The basic idea of our method is that the cutting is performed along properly selected boundary directions, so as to minimize inter-cluster communication and equilibrate the number of virtual cells for every cluster. Each cluster is then assigned to a different processor, which performs in a roughly independent manner, as the communication requirements are now minimized.

We consider the nested loop model with unit dependencies thus having an iteration space with the form of a n-dimensional grid. The exact model is that of generalized grids with diagonal edges, allowing unequal boundaries for each dimension.

These simulations often rely on Finite Element Methods (FEM) and the solution of large linear systems which, in turn, end up in multiple calls of the costly Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpM\u00d7V) kernel. The major\u2014and mostly inherent\u2014performance problem of the this kernel is its very low flop:byte ratio, meaning that the algorithm must retrieve a significant amount of data from the memory hierarchy in order to perform a useful operation.",

            "Abstract": "The adoption of the distributed paradigm has allowed applications to increase their scalability, robustness and fault tolerance, but it has also complicated their structure, leading to an exponential growth of the applications' configuration space and increased difficulty in predicting their performance. In this work, we describe a novel, automated profiling methodology that makes no assumptions on application structure. Our approach utilizes oblique Decision Trees in order to recursively partition an application's configuration space in disjoint regions, choose a set of representative samples from each subregion according to a defined policy and return a model for the entire space as a composition of linear models over each subregion. An extensive evaluation over real-life applications and synthetic performance functions showcases that our scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art profiling methodologies. It particularly excels at reflecting abnormalities and discontinuities of the performance function, allowing the user to influence the sampling policy based on the modeling accuracy and the space coverage.",

            "Abstract": "Research Problem. Virtualization provides enhanced security, consolidation, and efficient resource management. However, the technique itself can harm performance with memory virtualization considered as one of the most dominant factors [14, 15, 25]. Virtualization introduces an additional layer of memory abstraction that magnifies address translation overhead. To improve performance, industry has followed a holistic approach for huge pages [1, 2]. Processor vendors have improved Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) reach by substantially increasing its size for huge pages. To exploit that hardware support, OS/hypervisor vendors have enhanced the memory management algorithms to map memory with huge pages. Motivation. Despite their prominent efficiency [20], huge pages alone still fail to eliminate the address translation performance overhead for modern applications with large working sets and irregular access patterns. For example, in our experiments we observe up to 35% of performance overhead with virtualization due to TLB misses. The root cause is that huge pages are yet another form of fixed size mappings, providing limited TLB reach. As applications needs grow and address spaces are also about to expand [4], we expect memory virtualization overheads to increase further even in the presence of huge pages, following the fate of 4KB pages. Our goal is to provide an address translation scheme that reduces the memory virtualization overhead. Prior works that increase TLB reach use contiguous virtual-to-physical mappings [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 21\u201323, 27] to perform address translation through some form of [base, limit, offset \u2026",

Our system efficiently answers both simple joins and complex multivariate queries and easily scales to 3 billion triples using a small cluster of 9 worker nodes. H2RDF outperforms state-of-the-art distributed solutions in multi-join and nonselective queries while achieving comparable performance to centralized solutions in selective queries.

The system design aims at incorporating two important features, namely large-scale support for partially-structured data and high-performance, distributed query processing including multiple aggregates. To enable the efficient resolution of such queries, LinkedPeers utilizes a conceptual chain of DHT rings that stores data in a hierarchy-preserving manner. Moreover, adaptive mechanisms detect dynamic changes in the query workloads and adjust the granularity of the indexing on a per node basis. The pre-computation of possible future queries is also performed during the resolution of an incoming query. Extensive experiments prove that our system is \u2026",

However, current resource management practices are either statically bound to specific policies or unilaterally favor the needs of Cloud operators. In this paper we argue for a flexible and democratic mechanism to map virtual to physical resources, trying to balance satisfaction on both sides of the involved stakeholders. To that end, VM placement is expressed as an Equitable Stable Matching Problem (ESMP), where each party\u2019s policy is translated to a preference list. A practical approximation for this NP-hard problem, modified accordingly to ensure efficiency and scalability, is applied to provide equitable matchings within a reasonable time frame. Our experimental evaluation shows that, requiring no more memory than what a high-end desktop PC provides and knowing no more than the top 20% more of than the 90% agent\u2019s of large-scale preference ESMP lists, our instances solution within can efficiently N\u221a N rounds resolve of matchmaking.",

Both the vast amount of data and the high complexity of the state-of-the-art neural networks have led to perform the network training in a distributed manner accross clusters. Since synchronization overheads are usually fatal for the training's performance, asynchronous training is usually preferred in such cases. However, this training mode is sensitive to conflicting updates. Such updates most commonly occur when the workers train on a totally different part of the data. To reduce this phenomenon, in this paper, we propose the use of hashing schemes when distributing training data across workers.",
