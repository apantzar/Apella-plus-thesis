For high grafting densities we observed a small decrease in the height of the brush as the solvent quality decreases. The internal stratification in theta solvent was similar to the one we found in good solvent, with two and in some cases three kinds of populations containing short dendrons with weakly extended spacers, intermediate-height dendrons, and tall dendrons with highly stretched spacers. The differences increase as the grafting density decreases and single dendron populations were evident in theta and \u2026",

Next, the displacement fields generated inside and outside the inclusion are expressed in terms of Navier eigenvector expansions. An analytical solution is subsequently recovered for this boundary value problem, which allows for a reconstruction of the harmonic displacement field generated on the outer surfaces of the cylinder.

In this study, we use the simplest form of gradient theory (Mindlin FormII) to theoretically derive the velocity dispersion curves for free isotropic bone-mimicking plates and we investigate whether that theory can characterize the modes propagating in real bones better than the Lamb wave theory. Two additional terms are included in the constitutive equations representing the characteristic length in bone: (a) the gradient coefficient g and (b) the micro-inertia term h whose values were at the order of the osteons size. The velocity dispersion curves of guided waves were numerically obtained for four combinations between g and h and were superimposed on the time-frequency representations of the signals obtained from \u2026",

Also, fractional derivatives are used to account for dissipation and the Dirac delta function is exploited so as the initial velocity can be inherently set into the variational setting.

This turns out to be a demanding inverse problem by itself, serving to establish a realistic implementation for the underlying inversion method. It is proved herein how to determine a specific large class of moments. In addition it is proved that not all the moments are able to be determined purely from the set of data.

This problem is fundamental in solving the inverse elastic scattering transmission problem concerning the reconstruction of the geometric characteristics of the elastic inclusion via the well-known \u201csampling method\u201d. We formulate the governing differential equations of the problem in dyadic form in order to acquire a symmetric and uniform representation for the underlying elastic fields. The corresponding far-field operator is defined in the appropriate space setting. We also establish the interior transmission problem in the weak sense and consider the case where the non-homogeneous boundary data are generated by a dyadic source point located in the interior domain. Assuming that the inclusion has absorbing behaviour, that is the Lam\u00e9 constants are complex, we prove existence and uniqueness of the weak solution of the interior \u2026",

However following exterior calculus methodology, we augment the space of dependent variables, accompanying the initial differential equations with suitable adjoint equations and additional auxiliary \u201cfields\u201d. So the construction of a Lagrangian is now possible along with the realization of Noether's theory for finding conservation laws.

            "Abstract": "As blood circulates through the arterial tree, the flow and pressure pulse distort. Principal factors to this distortion are reflections form arterial bifurcations and the viscous character of the flow of the blood. Both of them are expounded in the literature and included in our analysis. The nonlinearities of inertial effects are usually taken into account in numerical simulations, based on Navier-Stokes like equations. Nevertheless, there isn\u2019t any qualitative, analytical formula, which examines the role of blood\u2019s inertia on the distortion of the pulse. We derive such an analytical nonlinear formula. It emanates from a generalized Bernoulli\u2019s equation for an an-harmonic, linear, viscoelastic, Maxwell fluid flow in a linear, viscoelastic, Kelvin-Voigt, thin, cylindrical vessel. We report that close to the heart, convection effects related to the change in the magnitude of the velocity of blood dominate the alteration of the shape of the pressure pulse, while at remote sites of the vascular tree, convection of vorticity, related to the change in the direction of the velocity of blood with respect to a mean axial flow, prevails. A quantitative comparison between the an-harmonic theory and related pressure measurements is also performed.1. Introduction. Variations in the form of the arterial pressure and flow pulse are often used as clinical indicators of cardiovascular diseases [41]. Therefore, it is important to gain an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that constitute the arterial pulse in normal physiology. Each beat of the heart creates a pressure wave which travels along the arterial network, changing shape as it moves away from the heart. The amplitude of the flow wave, or \u2026",

For linear equations in a convex polygon (Fokas and Kapaev (2000) and (2003), and Fokas (2001)), this method:(a) expresses the solution  in the form of an integral (generalized inverse Fourier transform) in the complex -plane involving a certain function (generalized direct Fourier transform) that is defined as an integral along the boundary of the polygon, and (b) characterizes a generalized Dirichlet-to-Neumann map by analyzing the so-called global relation. For simple polygons and simple boundary conditions, this characterization is explicit.

The neck is approximated by a three-element viscoelastic model, the constants of which are computed by using experimental data.

The plate was assumed free of stresses and of double stresses. Two cases were studied for the characteristic length: h=10\u22124\u2002m and h=10\u22125\u2002m.

To this end, the convolution is used instead of the  inner product so as to eliminate the undesireble end temporal condition of Hamilton's principle. Also, fractional derivatives are used to account for dissipation and the Dirac delta function is exploited so as the initial velocity to be inherently set into the variational setting.

Although the latter technique has received considerable attention in inverse scattering problems dealing with impenetrable scatterers and it has not been elaborated for inverse transmission problems with the only exception being a work by the first two authors and co-workers.

However the general Form II strain gradient theory is characterized by four internal length scale parameters indicating different microstructural effects on longitudinal and transverse waves, which is necessary for realistic modeling of media with microstructural effects.

The penetrable obstacle is assumed to have different physical properties from the surrounding medium in that it is assumed to be energy absorbing.

            "Abstract": "In the present work, the problem of reconstructing the shape of two-dimensional elastic anisotropic inclusions embedded in isotropic media is investigated within the framework of the linear sampling method. It is well known that the latter approach has been extensively used as an inverse solver in acoustic, electromagnetic and elastic scattering problems dealing with isotropic media and only recently in anisotropic acoustics and electromagnetics. The work at hand aims at contributing to the extension of the linear sampling method to anisotropic elastic inverse scattering. As in the previous works referring to the aforementioned reconstruction method, the proposed inversion scheme is based on the unboundedness of the solution of a linear integral equation of the first kind. Numerical results are also presented for several inclusion geometries and a system thereof exhibiting the applicability of the method.",

The simplest possible elastostatic version of Mindlin\u2019s strain gradient elastic (SGE) theory is employed for the solution of a SGE rectangle in bending under plane strain conditions. The equilibrium equations as well as expressions for all types of stresses and boundary conditions appearing in the considered rectangle are explicitly provided. An improved version of Mindlin\u2019s solution procedure via potentials is proposed. Besides, an elegant solution representation that contains the solution of the corresponding classical elastic problem is demonstrated. Results of six plane strain bending problems, which reveal a significant diversification from the classical elasticity theory and specific features of the underlying microstructure, are addressed and discussed.",

The stimulus for the present method has been offered by a recent accomplishment permitting the extraction of the moments from the far-field pattern via a systematic, direct, and stable manner. The aim of the method is to reconstruct polynomial scatterers and to approximate general scatterers by polynomial surfaces. This is accomplished via the formulation of suitable objective functionals involving the unknown coefficients of the Cartesian representation of the sought polynomial surface along with the low-frequency moments.

The global boundary of the analyzed domain is discretized into quadratic line and quadrilateral elements for 2D and 3D problems, respectively.

We formulate the governing differential equations of the problem in dyadic form in order to acquire a symmetric and uniform representation for the underlying elastic fields. The corresponding far-field operator is defined in the appropriate space setting. Assuming that the inclusion has non-absorbing behaviour, we consider this problem as a degenerate case of a non-dissipative anisotropic inclusion. Results for the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution of the interior transmission problem are obtained. In this framework the main theorem for the shape reconstruction for the transmission case is established.

The main outcome is the construction of partial differential systems of second order, which are typically equivalent with the well known fourth order equation of gradient elasticity. Two alternative methodologies are developed and presented in the present work. The first approach is based on the framework of the pseudo-differential calculus and exploits the special characteristics of this approach to deal with the non local behavior of gradient elasticity. The second implementation is purely differential and is based on the augmentation of the independent variables of the problem. Under this concept, the constitutive equations of gradient elasticity become part of the differential system itself and the whole framework is reminiscent of the transformation of the wave equation to a first order differential system. Crucial issues like existence, uniqueness and stability of the corresponding initial boundary value problems are also encountered via the new concepts.",

The direct scattering problem for the penetrable inhomogeneous, anisotropic and nondissipative scatterer is first studied and the existence and uniqueness of its solution are established. In the sequel, the interior transmission problem in its classical and weak form is presented and suitable variational formulations of it are settled. Finally, it is proved that the interior transmission eigenvalues constitute a discrete set.",

The superposition principle is used to derive the near-field operator for scattering from point sources in the appropriate space setting. A factorization of this near field operator is derived. In this framework the main theorem for the shape reconstruction is established. As in the previous works referring to the factorization method, the inversion scheme is based on a characterization of solutions of an integral equation of first kind having as known term a point source.

The magnetization reversal characteristics under different values and directions of the uniaxial anisotropy and different directions of the applied external magnetic field are explored. The simulation results show that a wealth of reversal mechanisms is possible sensitively depending on the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy values and directions which may explain the different Magnetic Force Microscopy patterns obtained in such magnetic systems. In addition, the micromagnetic simulations reveal that interesting vortex-like formations can be produced and stabilized in large field ranges and in sizes that can be tuned by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the material.",

This expansion is then exploited to acquire a semi-analytical solution to the associated elastic transmission scattering problem. Numerical results for several geometric configurations and varying degree of anisotropy are presented revealing the pronounced effect of the specific anisotropic character on the scattering mechanism.",

Although the latter technique has received considerable attention in inverse scattering problems dealing with impenetrable scatterers and it has not been elaborated for inverse transmission problems with the only exception being a work by the first two authors and co-workers. We aim to bridge this gap in the field of acoustic scattering; the paper on one hand focuses on establishing rigorously the necessary theoretical framework for the application of the factorization method to the inverse acoustic transmission problem. The main outcome of the investigation undertaken is the derivation of an explicit formula for the scatterer's characteristic function, which depends solely on the far-field data feeding \u2026",

For bounded scatterers, the well\u2010known Kupradze radiation conditions encode the outgoing character of the elastic waves. For infinite scatterers the situation changes drastically. The boundary of the problem is now in the neighbourhood of the asymptotic region and Kupradze's conditions are proved inadequate. In this work the radiation conditions for the elastic scattering by stress\u2010free rough surfaces are constructed. The elastic scattered field is expressed through the angular spectrum representation, which contains two vector spectral amplitudes expressing the two propagating waves in elasticity. In a properly selected region, the different types of integrals emerging from the application of Betti's formula are estimated \u2026",

In fact, it provides an interior solution of the Helmholtz's equation once an interior harmonic function is given, and conversely, given an interior solution of the Helmhotz's equation an interior harmonic function is constructed. Consequently, it seems that the Vekua connection offers the perfect ground to obtain solutions of boundary value problems connected with Helmholtz operator. Vekua expressed his transformation in spherical coordinates. Nevertheless, when a change of coordinates is applied, the transformation assumes a much more complicated form, but it still remains a very useful technique for dealing with solutions of the equations of Laplace and Helmholtz.

The solution of the problem constitutes the Green's function of the general problem and can be exploited through a straightforward manner.",

            "Abstract": "As Stokes has shown, axisymmetric, incompressible, viscous creeping flow can be studied through the use of a stream function \u03a8 which belongs to the kernel of the fourth-order differential operator E4, where E2\u03a8 measures the vorticity of the flow. In fact, irrotational flows are described by stream functions that belong to the kerE2, while rotational flows are described by stream functions that do not belong to the kerE2. It is shown that a decomposition, of the form \u03a8=\u03a81+r2\u03a82, for any stream function \u03a8 is possible, where \u03a81 and \u03a82 belong to kerE2 and r is the radial spherical variable. Consequently, a stream function that describes a rotational flow can always be divided by a stream function that describes an irrotational flow in a way that renders the ratio always equal to the square of the Euclidean distance. If no singularities are observed on the axis of symmetry then the above decomposition is unique.",

The complexity of the problem is moderated by exploiting general properties of the vector operators, the underlying Helmholtz equation kernel functions as well as the symmetries of the problem. Finally, the proposed analysis is illustrated in the case of electromagnetic and elastic fields.",

Both the theoretical as well as the numerical treatment are presented. The outcome of the analysis is the determination of the scattered field along with its multivariable dependence on the several physical and geometric parameters of the system. A comparison with the simpler case of spherical geometry as well as the plane wave excitation case is realised.",
