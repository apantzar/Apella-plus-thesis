Various KASUMI block cipher hardware implementations have been examined in order to provide information about the required silicon area and throughput. In order to achieve a significant performance improvement, Double Edge Triggered pipeline technique is used. The S-BOXes, which are fundamental elements of the KASUMI cipher, have been implemented by using combinational logic and ROM memories. The proposed GEA3 algorithm hardware implementation achieves throughput up to 837 Mbps, which is much faster comparing to the previous designs.

In today\u2019s \u201cstate of the art\u201d, it is possible to implement all-optical WC quite efficiently using Silicon Optical Amplifiers (SOA). Yet, the high sensitivity of error-performance to the randomly fluctuating relative-polarization of SOA optical-inputs, imposes rigid tuning requirements. In order to relax these requirements, a sufficient performance-margin must be provided to the channel. Obtaining this margin by means of Forward Error Correction (FEC) is commonplace nowadays. Inevitably though, existing/legacy FEC-methods will become insufficient as optical transparency scales. To substantially upgrade the performance of already-deployed SDH/SONET channels at an affordable overall cost, we propose a hybrid FEC-scheme. Specifically, our scheme combines a standard outband-FEC method (ITU-T G. 975) with a novel inband-FEC \u2026",

Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) can be utilized to achieve better performance for these functionalities, where polynomials are needed to be multiplied. NTT simplifies the multiplication overhead allowing point-wise multiplication by transforming the polynomials into the spectral domain and then inversing the result to the original domain. It is important to optimize this technique that is used in a wide range of computing systems. In this paper we study the feasibility of using OpenCL, a portable framework, to implement a parallelized version of NTT which allows deployment on heterogeneous platforms, such as Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

This multi-mode operation is achieved due to the reconfigurable applied design technique in the proposed architecture, which keeps the allocated area resources at a minimized level.

            "Abstract": "High throughput is a crucial factor in bit-serial GF(2m) fields multiplication for a variety of different applications including cryptography, error coding detection and computer algebra. The throughput of a multiplier is dependent on the required number of clock cycles to reach a result and its critical path delay. However, most bit-serial GF(2m) multipliers do not manage to reduce the required number of clock cycles below the threshold of m clock cycles without increasing dramatically their critical path delay. This increase is more evident if a multiplier is designed to be versatile. In this article, a new versatile bit-serial MSB multiplier for GF(2m) fields is proposed that achieves a 50% increase on average in throughput when compared to other designs, with a very small increase in its critical path delay. This is achieved by an average 33.4% reduction in the required number of clock cycles below m. The proposed design can handle arbitrary bit-lengths upper bounded by m and is suitable for applications where the field order may vary. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

However, BEC Scalar multiplication hardware implementations are still lacking in performance when compared to their Weierstrass equivalent. In this paper, a design strategy/methodology is proposed in order to realizeBEC Scalar multipliers with a good trade-off between computation speed and utilized hardware resources.

Over the years, the PATMOS meeting has evolved into an important-ropean event, where industry and academia meet to discuss power and timing aspects in modern integrated circuit and system design. PATMOS provides a forum for researchers to discuss and investigate the emerging challenges in-sign methodologies and tools required to develop the upcoming generations of integrated circuits and systems. We realized this vision this year by providing a technical program that contained state-of-the-art technical contributions, a keynote speech, three invited talks and two embedded tutorials. The technical program focused on timing, performance and power consumption, as well as architectural aspects, with particular emphasis on modelling, design, charac-rization, analysis and optimization in the nanometer era. This year a record 152 contributions were received to be considered for p-sible presentation at PATMOS. Despite the choice for an intense three-day m-ting, only 51 lecture papers and 34 poster papers could be accommodated in the single-track technical program. The Technical Program Committee, with the-sistance of additional expert reviewers, selected the 85 papers to be presented at PATMOS and organized them into 13 technical sessions. As was the case with the PATMOS workshops, the review process was anonymous, full papers were required, and several reviews were received per manuscript.",

Focusing on the need to mitigate their impact on embedded devices, a design model and strategy is proposed that can effectively be used as a backbone for introducing SCA countermeasures on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) scalar multipliers. The proposed design strategy is based on the decomposition of the round calculations of the Montgomery Power Ladder (MPL) algorithm and the Scalar Multiplication (SM) algorithm into the underlined finite field operations, and their restructuring into parallel-processed operation sets. Having as a basis the proposed design strategy, we showcase how advanced SCA countermeasures can be easily introduced, focusing on randomizing the projective coordinates of the MPL round\u2019s ECC point results. To evaluate the design approach and its SCA countermeasures, several simple ML-based SCAs are performed, and an attack roadmap is provided. The proposed roadmap assumes attackers that do not have access to a huge number of leakage traces, and that have limited resources with which to mount Deep Learning attacks. The trained models\u2019 performance reveals a high level of resistance against ML-based SCAs when including SCA countermeasures in the proposed design strategy.",

Mobile users want access to services and information, from both internet and personal devices, from a range of locations without the use of a cable medium. IEEE 802.11 is one of the most widely used wireless standards of our days. The amount of access and mobility into wireless networks requires a security infrastructure that protects communication within that network. The security of this protocol is based on the wired equivalent privacy (WEP) scheme. Currently, all the IEEE 802.11 market products support WEP. But recently, the 802.11 i working group introduced the advanced encryption standard (AES), as the security scheme for the future IEEE 802.11 applications. In this paper, the hardware integrations of WEP and AES are studied. A field programmable gate array \u2026",

This methodology gives many promises for secure communication networks of the next years. DDR transformations have attracted the interest of researchers, and a great number of new ciphers have been developed. These encryption algorithms are intended to be used in all the applications of present and future. The article summarizes the key issues for this new approach and presents both performance and implementation cost of DDR implementations.

The combination of security, and high speed implementation, makes SAFER+ a very good choice for wireless systems. The SAFER+ algorithm is a basic component in the authentication Bluetooth mechanism. The relation between the algorithm properties and the VLSI architecture are described. The whole design was captured entirely in VHDL using a bottom-up design and verification methodology. A FPGA device was used for the hardware implementation of the algorithm. The proposed VLSI implementation of the SAFER+ algorithm reduces the covered area about 25 percent, and achieves a data throughput up to 320 Mbit/s at a clock frequency of 20 MHz.",

            "Abstract": "Using Data-Dependent (DD) Permutations (DDP) as main cryptographic primitive, a new 64-bit block cipher is presented, ten-round DDP-64. Since the sum of all outputs of the conventional DDP is a linear Boolean function, non-linear DDP-based operation F is used additionally in DDP-64. The DDP-64 is a pure DDP-based cipher, ie it uses only permutations and the XOR operation. The designed cipher uses very simple key scheduling that defines high performance, especially in the case of frequent key refreshing. A novel feature of DDP-64 is the use of the switchable operation preventing the weak keys. The offered high level security strength does not sacrifice the implementation performance of DDP-64. Design and hardware implementation architectures of this cipher are presented. The synthesis results for both Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) implementations prove that DDP-64 is very flexible and powerful new cipher, especially for high speed WLANs and WPANs. The achieved hardware performance up to 6.5 Gbps and the implementation area cost of DDP-64 are compared with other ciphers, used in security layers of wireless protocols (Bluetooth, WAP, OMA, UMTS and IEEE 802.11). From these comparisons, it is proven that DDP-64 is a flexible new cipher with better performance in most of the cases, suitable for wireless communications networks of present and future.",

The value m, of the irreducible polynomial degree, can be changed and so, can be configured and programmed. The value of M determines the maximum size that the multiplier can support. The advantages of the proposed architecture are (i) the high order of flexibility, which allows an easy configuration for different field sizes, and (ii) the low hardware complexity, which results in small area. By using the gated clock technique, significant reduction of the total multiplier power consumption is achieved.",

It is an inherently low-cost approach for both the metro and backbone network regions, scalable to any SDH/SONET rate and capable to significantly increase optical channel performance. This paper analyzes the most sophisticated ones from the plethora of optimizations that were employed to minimize the architectural complexity of FOCUS, falling in: a) Arithmetic operator design, b) Resource sharing and c) Redundant logic elimination.

This makes it easier for resources to be discovered and joined up automatically. Because semantic grids represent and reason about knowledge declaratively, additional capabilities of typical agents are then possible including learning, planning, self-repair, memory organisation, meta-reasoning and task-level coordination. Only a convergence of these technologies will provide the ingredients to create fabric for a new generation of distributed intelligent systems. Inspired from the concept of autonomous decentralised systems, we propose that the above-mentioned goals can be achieved by integrating FIPA multiagent systems with the grid service architecture and hence to lay the foundation for semantic grid.

However, the need for low power applications with strict chip covered area constrains is great especially in mobile devices. In this paper low power architectures in limited area resources are proposed for Sbox, the basic cryptographic primitive of AES. Those architectures support encryption and decryption operation modes. In our proposed implementations, retaining a small chip covered area cost, hardware techniques for low power design, such as re-ordering of the components, introduction of redundant hardware (ideal delay line), reducing the driving strength\u2013fan out, and insertion of registers in highly unbalanced points of the circuit are applied. Therefore, our implementations do not only reduce power consumption by a large degree, but they also have good area properties and offer an advantageous power-delay-area product in comparison with other known Sbox implementations. These properties give to our system the advantage to support low power mobile devices in low area system environments.",

The algorithm modulo operation of polynomials was implemented by using Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR). The measured power dissipation at 32 Mbps is only about 1,12 mW. The whole Bluetooth Encryption/Decryption algorithm was captured by using VHDL language. For the synthesis and simulation commercial available tools were used, but for the power measurements a custom design tool developed in our University was used.",

However, as all crypto algorithms, RSA implementations, after the discovery and wide spread of Side Channel Attacks (SCA), are susceptible to a wide variety of different attacks that target the hardware structure rather than the algorithm itself. While there are a wide range of countermeasures that can be applied on the RSA structure in order to protect the algorithm from SCAs, combining several such measures in order to guarantee an SCA resistant RSA design is not an easy job. There are many incompatibility issues among SCA protection methods as well as an extensive performance cost added to an SCA secure RSA implementation.

The performance efficiency of the FOCUS method is evaluated in terms of optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) degradation and chromatic-dispersion degradation associated with the signal transmission over standard single mode fibre. In addition, the system performance is examined using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in order to evaluate the effect of nonlinearities.

Forward error correction (FEC) is one of the key-enabling elements in this long-awaited achievement. Borrowed from the wireless world, FEC was initially introduced in wavelength-division multiplex (WDM) optical-systems to combat amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), a form of noise native in optical amplifiers (OAs). These first generation FEC systems have been associated with a coding-gain of approximately 6 dB. However, as transmission rates gradually scaled towards 10 Gbps, other optical-impairments gained in significance, primarily nonlinear (NL) effects but also chromatic-dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD). FEC turned out to be invaluable in mitigating these impairments as well",

The main focus of widely implemented smart cities' services was the operation of sensors and smart devices across city areas that need low energy consumption and high connectivity. However, as 5G technologies are gradually been adopted in the smart city infrastructure thus solving that problem, the fundamental issue of addressing security becomes dominant. While latest network topologies and standards include security functions thus giving an illusion of security, there is little focus on the fact that many smart city end nodes cannot realize all security specifications without additional help. In this paper, we discuss briefly smart city security issues and focus on problem and security \u2026",

In order to re-pull up the low swing voltage to full swing, innovated high-speed, crosscoupled latch voltage receiver circuits are proposed. In applications having high load capacitance due to long interconnections, novel repeater circuits, based also on low swing voltage technique, are introduced. The difference between the values of threshold voltage of the nMOS transistor and the pMOS transistors is exploited to decrease the power dissipation.

            "Abstract": "Critical infrastructures and associated real time Informational systems need some security protection mechanisms that will be able to detect and respond to possible attacks. For this reason, Anomaly Detection Systems (ADS), as part of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, are needed for constantly monitoring and identifying potential threats inside an Information Technology (IT) system. Typically, ADS collect information from various sources within a CI system using security sensors or agents and correlate that information so as to identify anomaly events. Such sensors though in a CI setting (factories, power plants, remote locations) may be placed in open areas and left unattended, thus becoming targets themselves of security attacks. They can be tampering and malicious manipulated so that they provide false data that may lead an ADS or SIEM system to falsely comprehend the CI current security status. In this paper, we describe existing approaches on security monitoring in critical infrastructures and focus on how to collect security sensor\u2013agent information in a secure and trusted way. We then introduce the concept of hardware assisted security sensor information collection that improves the level of trust (by hardware means) and also increases the responsiveness of the sensor. Thus, we propose a Hardware Security Token (HST) that when connected to a CI host, it acts as a secure anchor for security agent information collection. We describe the HST functionality, its association with a host device, its expected role and its log monitoring mechanism. We also provide information on how security can be established \u2026",

GF (2 k) finite fields defined over optimal normal bases (ONB) can be very advantageous in term of gates number and multiplication time delay. Many ONB multipliers works have been proposed that use the Massey\u2013Omura multiplication pattern. In this paper, a method for designing type I optimal normal basis multipliers and an optimal normal basis (ONB) type I multiplier hardware architecture is proposed that, through parallelism and pairing categorization of the ONB multiplication table matrix, achieves very interesting results in terms of gate number and multiplication time delay.",

However, all those designs are defined over fixed size GF (2 k) fields and sometimes over fixed special form irreducible polynomials (AOL, trinomials, pentanomials). When such architectures are redesigned for arbitrary GF (2 k) fields and generic irreducible polynomials, therefore made versatile, they result in high space complexity (gate\u2013latch number), low frequency (high critical path) and high latency designs. In this paper a Montgomery multiplication element (MME) architecture specially designed for arbitrary GF (2 k) fields defined over general irreducible polynomials, is proposed, based on an optimized version of the Montgomery multiplication (MM) algorithm for GF (2 k) fields.

Full classification of CE with two non-linear outputs is presented. Two subclasses of nonlinear CE, with the best differential characteristics are recommended for the use in the non-linear DDO-boxes synthesis. The non-linear CE boxes are implemented in FPGA modules using the same hardware resources as switching elements. It is shown that the use of the nonlinear DDO, instead of DDP allows one to reduce the number of rounds.

            "Abstract": "Cyber-Physical system devices nowadays constitute a mixture of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems that are meant to operate harmonically under a security critical framework. As security IT countermeasures are gradually been installed in many embedded system nodes, thus securing them from many well-know cyber attacks there is a lurking danger that is still overlooked. Apart from the software vulnerabilities that typical malicious programs use, there are some very interesting hardware vulnerabilities that can be exploited in order to mount devastating software or hardware attacks (typically undetected by software countermeasures) capable of fully compromising any embedded system device. Real-time microarchitecture attacks such as the cache side-channel attacks are such case but also the newly discovered Rowhammer fault injection attack that can be mounted even remotely to gain full access to a device DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). Under the light of the above dangers that are focused on the device hardware structure, in this paper, an overview of this attack field is provided including attacks, threat directives and countermeasures. The goal of this paper is not to exhaustively overview attacks and countermeasures but rather to survey the various, possible, existing attack directions and highlight the security risks that they can pose to security critical embedded systems as well as indicate their strength on compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) such systems are designed to provide.

            "Abstract": "The main applications of the hash functions are met in the fields of communication integrity and signature authentication. A hash function is utilized in the security layer of every communication protocol. However, as protocols evolve and new high-performance applications appear, the throughput of most hash functions seems to reach a limit. Furthermore, due to the tendency of the market to minimize device size and increase autonomy to make them portable, power issues have also to be considered. The existing SHA-1 hash function implementations (SHA-1 is common in many protocols e.g. IPSec) limit throughput to a maximum of 2 Gbit/s. In this paper, a new implementation comes to exceed this limit improving the throughput by 53%. Furthermore, power dissipation is kept low compared to previous works.",

In this paper we propose a locality aware and balanced overlay for p2p live streaming which can adapt to the dynamic behavior of the participating peers and the underlying network. Our overlay is created and maintained through the use of two algorithms, called the placement and the swapping algorithm that we consider as the major contributions in this paper. These are responsible for the insertion of a node and the dynamic and distributed optimization of the overlay in order to reflect the underlying network. The proposed overlay is evaluated through extensive simulations that show that the bandwidth utilization of the peers and the set-up time are significantly improved through locality between peers.",

The implementation of the PANAMA algorithm can be used both as a hash function and a stream cipher. A basic characteristic of PANAMA is a high degree of parallelism which has, as a result, high rates for the overall system throughput. Another profit of PANAMA is that just one architecture supports two cryptographic operations - encryption/decryption and data hashing. The proposed system operates at 96.5 MHz frequency with a maximum data rate of 24.7 Gbps. The proposed system outperforms previous hash function and stream cipher implementations in terms of performance. Additional techniques can increase the achieved throughput by about 90%.",

Detailed analysis is shown, in terms of covered area, frequency, and throughput for DDP VLSI integration. Furthermore, two different architectures for hardware implementation of CIKS-1 and SPECTR-H64 are proposed. The first, based on full rolling technique minimizes the area resources.

They vary from simple communications services to special and sensitive purposed applications such as electronic commerce and digital cash. It is obvious that in future wireless protocols and communications environments (networks), security will play a key role in the transmitted information operations. This paper summarizes key issues that should be solved for achieving the desirable performance in security implementations and focuses alternative integrations approaches for wireless communications security. It gives an overview of the current security layer of wireless protocols and presents the performance characteristics of implementations in both software and hardware. We also propose some efficient methods to implement security schemes in wireless protocols with high performance.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines the best of both worlds. In order to achieve this we developed a scalable mechanism that monitors dynamically the total available bandwidth of the system and a distributed control strategy that dynamically allocates the required bandwidth. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that applies control theory to P2P live streaming systems. Additionally we provide analytical proof of stability properties of our control strategy and we demonstrate some preliminary results.",

The IETF ForCES protocol allows control elements to be connected to logically separated forwarding elements. The FlexiNET IST project relies on dynamic service deployment, which requires router programmability in the control and/or forwarding planes. Moreover, to shorten the implementation and deployment time of control elements, there is a need for simple higher-level APIs that shield such elements from ForCES protocol and model details. This paper proposes a ForCES CE Gateway (ForCEG) architecture that fulfills these requirements and maps Web Service interfaces to ForCES messages while checking the validity of commands to ensure consistency of the router state.",

In addition, the used TDES S-BOXes has been implemented by both look up tables (LUT) and ROM blocks providing useful information regarding the covered area and the design throughput. The ROM approach has better performance than the LUT one but the latter is preferred in the cases where ROM blocks are not available. The proposed TDES implementations achieve high-speed performance.

Furthermore, due to the tendency of the market to minimize device size and increase autonomy to make them portable, power issues have also to be considered. The existing SHA-1 hash function implementations (SHA-1 is common in many protocols e.g. IPSec) limit throughput to a maximum of 2 Gbit/s.
