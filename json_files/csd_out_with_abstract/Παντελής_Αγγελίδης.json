In this paper, our scope was a comparative analysis of the performance of three standard denoising methods like continuous Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Kalman Filter (KF). In order to evaluate the performance of EMD, DWT and KF of noise reduction and to express the quality of the denoised EEG, we calculate several indexes such as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). All the results obtained from noise simulated EEG data show that WT achieved the greatest SNR difference and also the mode mixing issue of EMD affected this method's performance.",

The evaluation of any HIS is, therefore, a very critical issue. After an extended and systematic review of the existing literature, user satisfaction was chosen as the measurement of IS success. The proposed research model of IS success is based on widely validated user satisfaction models. System quality, information quality, service quality and user bac ground were selected to measure user satisfaction. A structured questionnaire has been used to collect data from four Gree state hospitals, in order to empirically test the validity of the proposed model. Structural Equation Modeling is the main statistical technique used to test the fit of the structural model. The main conclusion is that user bac ground, information quality and service quality directly and positively affect user satisfaction confirming three out of four initial hypotheses (H1, H3, and H4). System quality has been found to influence user satisfaction only indirectly, through information quality, but not directly, as it was initially stated.",

WSNs are characterized by special features, like energy constraints and limited computing resources. Latest trends define that sensors should be able to provide Quality of Service (QoS) demanding data transmission. A modern approach in bandwidth sharing considers both the packet queue load as well as the traffic priority. A new QoS aware channel sharing approach is introduced, analyzing the effect of queue load in WSN Medium Access Control (MAC). The analysis reveals that the queue load factor has a great impact on QoS provision in bandwidth sharing, while packet priorities are also considered.",

These problems ranged from improper web designed pages to the improper way of confronting these types of our fellow citizens. This research takes into consideration the need for radical changes into e-learning process and especially the need for breakthrough changes towards e-class design while it introduces a new way for assessing people and especially patients suffering from severe psychological problems. The latter could be accomplished by properly calibrating the innovative e-class environment (by an Artificial Intelligent System) through audiovisual and self-perceived measurements [2]. These measurements could be split into various matrix-based robotic decisions for properly estimating the condition of a person interacting with the e-class environment. This in turn will not only benefit the final user from the aspect of best e-learning but also to properly warn him/her for potential psychological problems that could be addressed with the use of a clinician (Eg Ophthalmologist, Psychiatrist, Psychologist, Speech Language Therapist, etc.). Also, the proposed system could be part of an advanced scheme such as the Reduced Ecological Footprints of Modern Facilities REFF [3].

In this paper, a novel bandwidth allocation technique for cooperative wireless networks is proposed, which is able to satisfy the increased QoS requirements of network users taking into account both traffic priority and packet buffer load. The performance of the proposed scheme is examined by analyzing the impact of buffer load on bandwidth allocation. Moreover, fairness performance in resource sharing is also studied.

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score is used to categorize the severity and evaluate the disease progress. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cost-effective diagnostic tool and lately, new methods have developed for MMSE score correlation with EEG markers. In this paper, EEG recordings acquired from 14 patients with mild and moderate AD and 10 control subjects are analyzed in the five EEG rhythms (\u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). Then, 38 linear and non-linear features are calculated. Multiregression linear analysis showed highly correlation of with MMSE score variation with Permutation Entropy of \u03b4 rhythm, Sample Entropy of \u03b8 rhythm and Relative \u03b8 power. Also, the best statistically significant regression models in terms of R2 are at O2 (0.542) and F4 (0.513) electrodes and at posterior (0.365 \u2026",

The diagnosis of AD and its progression is performed through a variety of clinical procedures including neuropsychological and physical examination, Electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, brain imaging and blood analysis. During the last decades, analysis of the electrophysiological dynamics in AD patients has gained great research interest, as an alternative and cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes recent publications focusing on (a) AD detection and (b) the correlation of quantitative EEG features with AD progression, as it is estimated by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. A total of 49 experimental studies published from 2009 until 2020, which apply machine learning algorithms on resting state EEG recordings from AD patients, are reviewed. Results of each experimental study are presented and compared. The majority of the studies focus on AD detection incorporating Support Vector Machines, while deep learning techniques have not yet been applied on large EEG datasets. Promising conclusions for future studies are presented.",

This can lead to inefficiencies, duplication of resources, and potentially to reduced levels of care quality. Older people are particularly affected by this situation, since they often need both types of services, such as support with daily living activities and chronic disease management. At the same time, the potential of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support integrated service delivery remains largely unexploited. Against this background, many are the technologies that might offer a suitable canvas for integrated care, particularly to more vulnerable social groups.

The expansion of access networks, which constitute the main playground of the Internet backhaul, is accompanied by numerous energy inefficient devices and equipments. Passive optical networks (PONs) is a potential dominant technology on the field of access networking, hence the reduction of the consumed energy of the optical devices forms a critical issue. In this paper, an efficient green PON is introduced, having two main targets: a) to reduce the energy consumption, by allowing optical devices to operate longer in sleep mode, and b) to maintain PON's good performance. Beyond the green provisioning, the proposed scheme is able to increase occasionally the network performance in terms of mean packet delay and packet drop ratio. This is accomplished by reducing the amount of control messages \u2026",

These technologies have been oriented towards the concept of a Reduced Ecological Footprint. Massive structures (such as building complexes and hospitals) have been redesigned and upgraded; many interior designs have been dramatically altered while new electronic devices are constantly being produced in order to revolutionize a long term perspective towards a \u201cGreen Planet\u201d while they exhibit astonishing signal processing. Consequently, an enormous technology already exists which needs to be properly combined to a proposed methodology and to new ideas relevant to systems\u2019 administration through automatic wireless control. This paper intends to reduce the gap between design and realization of the aforementioned research. Consequently, the primary contribution of this research is the proposal of a complete design protocol with minimized defects relevant to Reduced Ecological Footprints of Facilities (REFF) along with its beneficial advantages relevant to providing a healthy and productive work environment. This protocol consists of four main parts which are 1) the main key points-guidelines, 2) its objectives, 3) the know-how methodology for implementation in existing installations and 4) the description of the imminent benefits in workforce/human resources.",

In this paper, the ability of several statistical and spectral features to detect AD from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings is evaluated. For this purpose, clinical EEG recordings from 14 patients with AD (8 with mild AD and 6 with moderate AD) and 10 healthy, age-matched individuals are analyzed. The EEG signals are initially segmented in nonoverlapping epochs of different lengths ranging from 5 s to 12 s. Then, a group of statistical and spectral features calculated for each EEG rhythm (\u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3) are extracted, forming the feature vector that trained and tested a Random Forests classifier. Six classification problems are addressed, including the discrimination from whole-brain dynamics and separately from specific brain regions in order to highlight any alterations of the cortical regions. The results indicated a high accuracy ranging from 88.79% to 96.78% for whole-brain classification. Also, the classification accuracy was higher at the posterior and central regions than at the frontal area and the right side of temporal lobe for all classification problems. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "The integration of information systems represents one of the most urgent priorities of a regional healthcare authority in order to meet its clinical, organizational and managerial needs. Current practice shows that the most promising approach to achieve a regional healthcare information system is to use a health level 7 (HL7) message-based communication system implemented by an asynchronous common communication infrastructure between healthcare sites. The system is a complete and integrated information system at a regional level that comprises all types of healthcare levels, that includes interoperability issues, that covers most of the needed components, and that is able to work efficiently in a secure wide area network to ensure data privacy and confidentiality. Another important feature of the proposed solution is that it creates an interoperability framework that can be replicated from one healthcare institution to another. In that sense, common interoperability messages can be used to interconnect heterogeneous information systems. In response to this strategy, more than 10 different consortiums have submitted proposals to the Greek government and the proposed interoperability framework seems to be widely accepted as a solution to enhance information and communication technologies developments in the healthcare sector in Greece.",

Particularly, the aim of this paper is to present the process of the design, installation and operation of a network initially consisting of three multi-parameter sensor systems, located in the wider lignite mines region of Kozani, in order to monitor the surface and underground water quality of the aquatic resources of the area. The basic physicochemical parameters measured by the multi-parameter sensors system included pH, temperature, conductivity, nitrate ions (NO3-), sulfuric ions (SO4-2), chloride ions (Cl-) for a period of about ten months. Additionally, certain other complementary physicochemical parameters have been measured in selected samples collected from the same areas, in order to deduce an integrated view of water quality. The pH values ranged between 7.6 and 8.3 and remained quite stable in all three monitoring stations. Observed fluctuation in conductivity measured values from 188 to 1082 \u03bcS/cm was related to variations in water quality characteristics especially in the surface water monitoring sites. The wide NO3-content only in Ag. Dimitrios PPC Station was attributed to wastewater discharge. Detailed analysis of recorded measurements on a day-to-day level, especially for SO4-2 and Cl-values, revealed potential pollution incidents.",

The role of the medium access control mechanism becomes even more important nowadays, since the mobile users\u2019 network demands have greatly increased. Initially, the wireless networks were employed as simple extensions of the wired ones, thus, the requirements for this new kind of computer networks were not high. The first wireless computer communications were mainly involving traditional data transmissions of low demands. Modern wireless networks are expected to serve \u201cheavy\u201d multimedia transmissions as well. Now, the medium access control has to efficiently adapt to the different network conditions, the different demands and characteristics of the served transmissions.There is a great number of medium access control methods proposed in the literature. A categorization of these methods is provided in this chapter. Some of the proposed methods are quite generic and can be theoretically employed in a large number of networks, while others are more specialized and target, for example, exclusively on wireless local area networks. The type and the specific features of the used access control mechanism significantly defines the overall network behavior. Modern wireless network access control is expected to efficiently provide QoS.",

Firstly, the artificial structure must resemble to a human not only in the figure but moreover in expressed movements accomplishing a body language very close to that of their owner while this artificial body should include sensors network (BWSN) technology [1]. Secondly, the artificial brain must exhibit seamless decisions and if needed quick responses taking into consideration an empathetic employed nature of behavior. The latter could be accomplished with the use of 5-stage iterative logic which guarantees the best possible result and a unique behavior even when compared between the same robot models. In this point of development all precautions must take into account that the artificial developed characters should conform to a significant standard. Their auto-development should not constitute an abuse towards their owner\u2019s safety and generally towards every other human\u2019s clinical condition.

            "Abstract": "Traffic engineering in networking is defined as the process that incorporates sophisticated methods in order to ensure optimization and high network performance. One of the most constructive tools employed by the traffic engineering concept is the traffic prediction. Having in mind the heterogeneous traffic patterns originated by various modern services and network platforms, the need of a robust, cognitive, and error-free prediction technique becomes even more pressing. This work focuses on the prediction concept as an autonomous, functional, and efficient process, where multiple cutting-edge methods are presented, modeled, and thoroughly assessed. To this purpose, real traffic traces have been captured, including multiple multimedia traffic flows, so as to comparatively assess widely used methods in terms of accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "Secure time synchronization is a paramount service for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) constituted by multiple interconnected body area networks (BANs). We propose a novel approach to securely and efficiently synchronize nodes at BAN level and/or WSN level. Each BAN develops its own notion of time. To this effect, the nodes of a BAN synchronize with their BAN controller node. Moreover, controller nodes of different BANs cooperate to agree on a WSN global and/or to transfer UTC time. To reduce the number of exchanged synchronization messages, we use an environmental-aware time prediction algorithm. The performance analysis in this paper shows that our approach exhibits very advanced security, accuracy, precision, and low-energy trade-off. For comparable precision, our proposal outstands related clock synchronization protocols in energy efficiency and risk of attacks. These results are \u2026",

It is common knowledge that in order to install any type of information system in healthcare, six main groups of issues have to be dealt with: organizational and cultural matters related to healthcare, technological gap between healthcare professionals and information science experts, legal requirements on the confidentiality of personal data, of patient related data and on data privacy, industrial and market position of healthcare informatics and interoperability complexity, lack of vision and leadership of the health care managers and health authorities and user acceptability and usability of the proposed information systems. In order to meet these issues stated above, a special focus group (Z3) performed an assessment of the situation of healthcare informatics in Greece and of the main key points that would lead to success. In that sense it is now common knowledge that Greece is lagging information and communication technology progress in healthcare because almost none of the above mentioned issues were dealt with. This assessment is the result of the interaction of more than 150 decision makers, medical informaticians, healthcare practitioners and other individual involved in healthcare. As a conclusion, this focus group resulted in 4 major propositions that will lead to healthcare informatics introduction with better success chances: focus on terminologies and standards, focus on interoperability and information systems sustainability, focus on clear goals and system \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Undoubtedly, energy consumption in communication networks poses a significant threat to the environmental stability. Access networks contribute to this consumption by being composed of numerous energy inefficient devices and network equipment. Passive Optical Networks (PONs), one of the most promising candidates in the field of access networking, should avoid this bottleneck in the backhaul power consumption by lowering the energy use of the optical devices. In this paper, we move towards that direction by introducing an energy efficient power management scheme that encompasses two major goals: a) to reduce the energy consumption by allowing the optical devices to enter the sleep mode longer, and b) to concurrently maintain the network performance. To this end, we focus on the energy consumed by the optical network units (ONUs). The intelligence of the ONUs is stimulated by enhancing the \u2026",
