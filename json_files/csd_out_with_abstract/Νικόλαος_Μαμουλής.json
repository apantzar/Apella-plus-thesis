            "Abstract": "Recent research studied the problem of publishing microdata without revealing sensitive information, leading to the privacy preserving paradigms of k-anonymity and l-diversity. k-anonymity protects against the identification of an individual\u2019s record. l-diversity, in addition, safeguards against the association of an individual with specific sensitive information. However, existing approaches suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks:(i) The information loss metrics are counter-intuitive and fail to capture data inaccuracies inflicted for the sake of privacy.(ii) l-diversity is solved by techniques developed for the simpler k-anonymity problem, which introduces unnecessary inaccuracies.(iii) The anonymization process is inefficient in terms of computation and I/O cost.In this paper we propose a framework for efficient privacy preservation that addresses these deficiencies. First, we focus on one-dimensional (ie, single attribute) quasiidentifiers, and study the properties of optimal solutions for k-anonymity and l-diversity, based on meaningful information loss metrics. Guided by these properties, we develop efficient heuristics to solve the one-dimensional problems in linear time. Finally, we generalize our solutions to multi-dimensional quasi-identifiers using space-mapping techniques. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that our techniques clearly outperform the state-of-the-art, in terms of execution time and information loss.",

Popular RDF knowledge bases (eg, YAGO2) also include spatial semantics that enable location-based search. In an earlier location-based keyword search paradigm, the user inputs a set of keywords, a query location, and a number of RDF spatial entities to be retrieved. The output entities should be geographically close to the query location and relevant to the query",

Specifically, given two collections R and S of intervals, the objective is to find all pairs (r, s), such that r\u2208 R, s\u2208 S, and the difference gap between r and s is at most equal to a given threshold \u03f5. We first show how this problem can be solved by directly applying the state-of-the-art domain-based partitioning approach for interval joins, after extending the intervals by \u03f5. Then, we propose a novel partitioning strategy for the original intervals, which defines the partitions using the threshold \u03f5 and achieves much better performance, on most datasets, for reasonably large values of \u03f5.",

            "Abstract": "Recently, composite-order bilinear pairing has been shown to be useful in many cryptographic constructions. However, it is time-costly to evaluate. This is because the composite order should be at least 1024bit and, hence, the elliptic curve group order n and base field become too large, rendering the bilinear pairing algorithm itself too slow to be practical (e.g., the Miller loop is \u03a9(n)). Thus, composite-order computation easily becomes the bottleneck of a cryptographic construction, especially, in the case where many pairings need to be evaluated at the same time. The existing solution to this problem that converts composite-order pairings to prime-order ones is only valid for certain constructions. In this paper, we leverage the huge number of threads available on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to speed up composite-order pairing computation. We investigate suitable SIMD algorithms for base \u2026",

The state-of-the-art similarity join methods compare simpler approximations of the objects (e.g., strings), in order to prune pairs that cannot be part of the similarity join result based on distance bounds derived by the approximations. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity join approach, which is based on the dynamic decomposition of the tree objects into subgraphs, according to the similarity threshold. Our technique avoids computing the exact distance between two tree objects, if the objects do not share at least one common subgraph. In order to scale up the join, the computed subgraphs are managed in a two-layer index. Our experimental results on real and synthetic data collections show that our \u2026",

Still, there are limited efforts towards extending RDF stores to efficiently support spatial queries, such as range selections (eg, find entities within a given range) and spatial joins (eg, find pairs of entities whose locations are close to each other). In this paper, we propose an extension for RDF stores that supports efficient spatial data management. Our contributions include an effective encoding scheme for entities having spatial locations, the introduction of on-the-fly spatial filters and spatial join algorithms, and several optimizations that minimize the overhead of geometry and dictionary accesses. We implemented the proposed techniques as an extension to the open-source RDF-3X engine and we experimentally evaluated them using real RDF knowledge bases. The results show that our system offers robust performance for spatial queries, while introducing little overhead to the original query engine.",

Specifically, when we recommend a package to a group of people, we ask that this recommendation is fair in the sense that every group member is satisfied by a sufficient number of items in the package. We explore two definitions of fairness and show that for either definition the problem of finding the most fair package is NP-hard.

To offer the highest quality of service, we wish to minimize the average distance between users and their assigned server. This is an instance of a well-studied problem in operations research, termed optimal assignment. Even though there exist several solutions for the static case (where user locations are fixed), there is currently no method for dynamic settings. In this paper, we consider the continuous assignment problem (CAP), where an optimal assignment must be constantly maintained between mobile users and a set of servers.

This query provides results that they are robust against individual sensor abnormality, and yet precisely summarize the sensors' status in each local region.

First, it achieves higher synopsis quality at the task of summarizing data sets with sharp discontinuities than state-of-the-art histogram and Haar wavelet techniques. Second, thanks to its search space delimitation capacity, Haar+ synopsis construction operates in time linear in the size of the data set for any monotonic distributive error metric.

In this paper, we design a location-aware keyword query suggestion framework.

Each object is defined by a set of observations ((time,location)-tuples) and a Markov chain which describes the objects uncertain motion in space and time. To model similarity - which is an important building block for many applications such as identifying frequent motion patterns or trajectory clustering - we employ the well-known Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) measure, which becomes a distribution on uncertain spatio-temporal data (ULCSS). We show how the aligned version (without time shifting) of the ULCSS can be exactly computed in PTIME, which is also verified by extensive experiments.",

Outsourcing this task to a service provider brings several benefits to the data owner such as cost relief and a less commitment to storage and computational resources. Mining results, however, can be corrupted if the service provider (i) is honest but makes mistakes in the mining process, or (ii) is lazy and reduces costly computation, returning incomplete results, or (iii) is malicious and contaminates the mining results. We address the integrity issue in the outsourcing process, i.e., how the data owner verifies the correctness of the mining results. For this purpose, we propose and develop an audit environment, which consists of a database transformation method and a result verification method. The main component of our audit environment is an artificial itemset planting (AIP) technique. We provide a theoretical foundation on our technique by \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individual objects over time. In many applications however, such as traffic supervision or mobile communication systems, only summarized data, like the average number of cars in an area for a specific period, or phones serviced by a cell each day, is required. Although this information can be obtained from operational databases, its computation is expensive, rendering online processing inapplicable. A vital solution is the construction of a spatiotemporal data warehouse. In this paper, we describe a framework for supporting OLAP operations over spatiotemporal data. We argue that the spatial and temporal dimensions should be modeled as a combined dimension on the data cube and present data structures, which integrate spatiotemporal indexing with pre-aggregation. While the well-known materialization techniques require a-priori knowledge of the grouping hierarchy, we develop methods that utilize the proposed structures for efficient execution of ad-hoc group-bys. Our techniques can be used for both static and dynamic dimensions.",

Despite their importance, top-k dominating queries have not received adequate attention from the research community. In this paper, we design specialized algorithms that apply on indexed multi-dimensional data and fully exploit the characteristics of the problem. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform a previous skyline-based approach, while our results on real datasets show the meaningfulness of top-k dominating queries.",

When no flooding is needed the communication cost overhead for adapting the operator placement is negligible. In addition, our algorithm does not require any extra communication cost while the query is executed.

In addition, the users are organized in a social network, which can be extended to a heterogeneous network if the connections to places via checkins are also considered. The goal of this paper is to analyze the opportunities in clustering this rich form of data. We first present a model for clustering geographic locations, based on GeoSN data. Then, we discuss how this model can be extended to consider temporal information from checkins.

Furthermore, for very large RDF knowledge bases, the partitioning phase becomes prohibitively expensive, leading to high startup costs.In this paper, we propose AdHash, a distributed RDF system which addresses the shortcomings of previous work. First, AdHash initially applies lightweight hash partitioning, which drastically minimizes the startup cost, while favoring the parallel processing of join patterns on subjects, without any data communication.

In this paper we study alternative forms of nearest neighbor queries suitable for spatio-temporal applications. In particular, we first describe time-parameterized queries, where in addition to the current nearest neighbors of a query point, the result contains the expected validity period of the result (given the query and object movement), as well as the change that will occur at the end of the validity period. Then, we discuss continuous NN search where the goal is to retrieve all nearest neighbors of a query trajectory, together with the validity interval of each nearest neighbor.",

In contrast to existing join operators between pointsets (i.e., e-distance joins and fc-closest pairs), CIJ is parameter- free, providing a natural join result that finds application in marketing and decision support. We propose algorithms for the efficient evaluation of CIJ, for pointsets indexed by hierarchical multi-dimensional indexes.

Existing methods for clustering uncertain data compute a single clustering without any indication of its quality and reliability; thus, decisions based on their results are questionable. In this paper, we describe a framework, based on possible-worlds semantics; when applied on an uncertain dataset, it computes a set of representative clusterings, each of which has a probabilistic guarantee not to exceed some maximum distance to the ground truth clustering, ie, the clustering of the actual (but unknown) data. Our framework can be combined with any existing clustering algorithm and it is the first to provide quality guarantees about its result. In addition, our experimental evaluation shows that our representative clusterings have a much smaller deviation from the ground truth clustering than existing approaches, thus reducing the \u2026",

In this paper, we propose studying the problem when much less information or assumptions are available. We model the structural alignment of proteins as a combinatorial problem. In the problem, each protein is simply a set of points in the 3D space, without sequence order information, and the objective is to discover all large enough alignments for any subset of the input. We propose a data-mining approach for this problem. We first perform geometric hashing of the structures such that points with similar locations in the 3D space are hashed into the same bin in the hash table. The novelty is that we consider each bin as a coincidence group and mine for frequent patterns, which is a well-studied technique in data mining. We observe that these frequent patterns are already potentially large alignments. Then \u2026",

Given a set D of spatial objects (e.g., houses and shops), each with a textual description, we aim at finding all combinations of objects from D that match a user-defined spatial pattern P. A pattern P is a graph where vertices represent spatial objects, and edges denote distance relationships between them. The SPM query returns the instances that satisfy P. An example of P can be \"a house within 10-minute walk from a school, which is at least 2km away from a hospital\". The SPM query can benefit users such as house buyers, urban planners, and archaeologists. We prove that answering such queries is computationally intractable, and propose two efficient algorithms for their evaluation. Extensive experimental evaluation and cases studies on four real datasets show that our proposed solutions are highly effective and efficient.",

            "Abstract": "Outsourcing association rule mining to an outside service provider brings several important benefits to the data owner. These include (i) relief from the high mining cost,(ii) minimization of demands in resources, and (iii) effective centralized mining for multiple distributed owners. On the other hand, security is an issue; the service provider should be prevented from accessing the actual data since (i) the data may be associated with private information,(ii) the frequency analysis is meant to be used solely by the owner. This paper proposes substitution cipher techniques in the encryption of transactional data for outsourcing association rule mining. After identifying the non-trivial threats to a straightforward one-to-one item mapping substitution cipher, we propose a more secure encryption scheme based on a one-to-n item mapping that transforms transactions non-deterministically, yet guarantees correct decryption. We develop an effective and efficient encryption algorithm based on this method. Our algorithm performs a single pass over the database and thus is suitable for applications in which data owners send streams of transactions to the service provider. A comprehensive cryptanalysis study is carried out. The results show that our technique is highly secure with a low data transformation cost.",

Most of the previous work on this subject detect news by analyzing propagation patterns of microblogs. This approach has two limitations:(i) many non-news microblogs (eg marketing activities) have propagation patterns similar to news microblogs and therefore they can be falsely reported as news;(ii) using propagation patterns to identify news involves a time delay until the pattern is formed, therefore news are not detected in real time. We propose an alternative approach, which, motivated by the necessity of real-time detection of news, does not rely on propagation of posts. Moreover, we propose a real-time sorting strategy that orders the detected news microblogs using a translational approach. An experimental evaluation on a large-scale microblogging dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",

Each column q (p) of Q (P) holds the latent factors of the corresponding user (item), and q T p is a prediction of the rating to item p by user q. Recommender systems based on MF suggest to a user in q the items with the top-k scores in q T P. For this problem, we propose a Fast and EXact Inner PROduct retrieval (FEXIPRO) framework, based on sequential scan, which includes three elements.

The fact that the lattice points which are close in all coordinate axes are much less, leads to dramatic reduction in detection complexity. Making a few approximations, this paper derives the average-case complexity exponent, e c , for planar detection analytically in a closed form. Numerical results show that for an (n, 1) system, although the expected complexity is still exponential, complexity reduction of 2 exponents, i.e., from e c  to e c  -2, is realized and such advantage is promised irrespective of the size of the signal constellations and the received signal-to \u2026",

Consider a collection of transactional data that contains detailed information about items bought together by individuals. Even after removing all personal characteristics of the buyer, which can serve as links to his identity, the publication of such data is still subject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlike most previous works, we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive, but we consider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data, depending on the point of view of the adversary. We define a new version of the k-anonymity guarantee, the km-anonymity, to limit the effects of the data dimensionality and we propose efficient algorithms to transform the database. Our anonymization model relies on generalization instead of suppression, which is the most common practice in related works on such data. We develop an algorithm which finds the optimal solution, however, at a high cost which makes it inapplicable for large, realistic problems. Then, we propose two greedy heuristics, which scale much better and in most of the cases find a solution close to the optimal. The proposed algorithms are experimentally evaluated using real datasets.",

            "Abstract": "Large text corpora with news, customer mail and reports, or Web 2.0 contributions offer a great potential for enhancing business-intelligence applications. We propose a framework for performing text analytics on such data in a versatile, efficient, and scalable manner. While much of the prior literature has emphasized mining keywords or tags in blogs or social-tagging communities, we emphasize the analysis of interesting phrases. These include named entities, important quotations, market slogans, and other multi-word phrases that are prominent in a dynamically derived ad-hoc subset of the corpus, eg, being frequent in the subset but relatively infrequent in the overall corpus. The ad-hoc subset may be derived by means of a keyword query against the corpus, or by focusing on a particular time period. We investigate alternative definitions of phrase interestingness, based on the probability of phrase occurrences. We develop preprocessing and indexing methods for phrases, paired with new search techniques for the top-k most interesting phrases on ad-hoc subsets of the corpus. Our framework is evaluated using a large-scale",

            "Abstract": "Matrix factorization (MF) is one of the most powerful techniques used in recommender systems. MF models the (user, item) interactions behind historical explicit or implicit ratings. Standard MF does not capture the hierarchical structural correlations, such as publisher and advertiser in advertisement recommender systems, or the taxonomy (e.g., tracks, albums, artists, genres) in music recommender systems. There are a few hierarchical MF approaches, but they require the hierarchical structures to be known beforehand. In this paper, we propose a Hidden Hierarchical Matrix Factorization (HHMF) technique, which learns the hidden hierarchical structure from the user-item rating records. HHMF does not require the prior knowledge of hierarchical structure; hence, as opposed to existing hierarchical MF methods, HHMF can be applied when this information is either explicit or implicit.

We observe that the anonymization error can be reduced if we follow a non-homogeneous generalization approach for groups of size larger than k. Such an approach would allow tuples within a partition to take different generalized quasi-identifier values. Anonymization following this model is not trivial, as its direct application can easily violate k-anonymity. In addition, non-homogeneous generalization allows for additional types of attack, which should be considered in the process. We provide a methodology for verifying whether a non-homogeneous generalization violates k-anonymity.

In a nutshell, the problem to be solved is to compute the PDF of the random variable denoted by the probabilistic domination count: Given an uncertain database object B, an uncertain reference object R and a set D of uncertain database objects in a multi-dimensional space, the probabilistic domination count denotes the number of uncertain objects in D that are closer to R than B. This domination count can be used to answer a wide range of probabilistic similarity queries.

In addition, they do not consider the real dynamic environments (e.g., dynamic tasks, dynamic workers), so they may produce sub-optimal results. To address these issues, we utilize Deep Q-Network (DQN), an RL-based method combined with a neural network to estimate the expected long-term return of recommending a task. DQN inherently considers the immediate and the future rewards and can be updated quickly to deal with evolving data and dynamic changes.

We propose two methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns, as well as uctuations of edge weights. The rst one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets \u2026",

However, this approach relies on a complex data structure and its parallelization has not been adequately studied. In this article, we investigate in-memory interval joins in two directions. First, we explore the applicability of a largely ignored forward scan (FS)-based plane sweep algorithm, for single-threaded join evaluation.

We describe common constraint types occurring in XML queries and show how query evaluation can benefit from methods for preprocessing and solving CSPs. We identify an important non-binary constraint that is a common module of XML queries and describe a generalized arc consistency algorithm with low cost that can ensure polynomial query evaluation. Finally, we demonstrate that maintaining the consistency of such non-binary constraints can greatly accelerate search in intractable queries that include referential relationships.",

Even after removing all personal characteristics of the buyer, which can serve as links to his identity, the publication of such data is still subject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlike most previous works, we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive, but we consider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data, depending on the point of view of the adversary.

This problem is very relevant for in-network query processing over WSN, where query routing trees are decomposed into three sub-components that must be processed at query time, namely operator tree, operator placement assignment scheme and routing scheme. In particular, the operator placement assignment defines on which node of the network each (query) operator will be hosted and executed. Hence, operator placement plays a key role in the context of query optimization issues in WSN research. In line with this main motivation, in this paper we present an optimal distributed algorithm to adapt the placement of a single operator in high communication cost networks, such as a wireless sensor network.

For example, using a real estate agency database of flats for lease, a customer may want to rank the flats with respect to the appropriateness of their location, defined after aggregating the qualities of other features (e.g., restaurants, cafes, hospital, market, etc.) within their spatial neighborhood. Such a neighborhood concept can be specified by the user via different functions. It can be an explicit circular region within a given distance from the flat. Another intuitive definition is to assign higher weights to the features based on their proximity to the flat. In this paper, we formally define spatial preference queries and propose appropriate indexing techniques and search algorithms for them.

Interaction networks capture flow of data which is transferred between their vertices along a timeline. Analyzing such networks is crucial toward comprehend- ing processes in them. A typical analysis task is the finding of motifs, which are small subgraph patterns that repeat themselves in the network. In this paper, we introduce network flow motifs, a novel type of motifs that model significant flow transfer among a set of vertices within a constrained time window. We design an algorithm for identifying flow motif instances in a large graph. Our algorithm can be easily adapted to find the top-k instances of maximal flow. In addition, we design a dynamic programming module that finds the instance with the maximum flow. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on three real datasets and identify flow motifs which are significant for these graphs. Our results show that our algorithm is scalable and that the real networks indeed include interesting motifs, which appear much more frequently than in randomly generated networks having similar characteristics.",

Although individual preference queries can be evaluated by selecting the object in the database with the highest aggregate score, in the case of multiple simultaneous requests, a single object cannot be assigned to more than one users. The challenge is to compute a fair 1-1 matching between the queries and the objects. We model this as a stable-marriage problem and propose an efficient method for its processing. Our algorithm iteratively finds stable query-object pairs and removes them from the problem. At its core lies a novel skyline maintenance technique, which we prove to be I/O optimal.

Based on it, we develop two RNN methods; an eager algorithm that attempts to prune network nodes as soon as they are visited and a lazy technique that prunes the search space when a data point is discovered. We study retrieval of an arbitrary number k of reverse nearest neighbors, investigate the benefits of materialization, cover several query types, and deal with cases where the queries and the data objects reside on nodes or edges of the graph.

            "Abstract": "Distributed RDF systems partition data across multiple computer nodes (workers). Some systems perform cheap hash partitioning, which may result in expensive query evaluation, while others apply heuristics aiming at minimizing inter-node communication during query evaluation. This requires an expensive data preprocessing phase, leading to high startup costs for very large RDF knowledge bases. Apriori knowledge of the query workload has also been used to create partitions, which however are static and do not adapt to workload changes; hence, inter-node communication cannot be consistently avoided for queries that are not favored by the initial data partitioning. In this paper, we propose AdHash, a distributed RDF system, which addresses the shortcomings of previous work. First, AdHash applies lightweight partitioning on the initial data, that distributes triples by hashing on their subjects; this renders its startup overhead low. At the same time, the locality-aware query optimizer of AdHash takes full advantage of the partitioning to (i)support the fully parallel processing of join patterns on subjects and (ii) minimize data communication for general queries by applying hash distribution of intermediate results instead of broadcasting, wherever possible. Second, AdHash monitors the data access patterns and dynamically redistributes and replicates the instances of the most frequent ones among workers. As a result, the communication cost for future queries is drastically reduced or even eliminated. To control replication, AdHash implements an eviction policy for the redistributed patterns.

In this work, we propose and study novel keyword-based search queries with spatial semantics on RDF data, namely kSP queries.

Based on geo-social networks that couple personal location information with personal social context information, such services are facilitated by geo-social queries that extract useful information combining social relationships and current locations of the users. In this paper, we tackle the problem of geo-social skyline queries, a problem that has not been addressed so far. Given a set of persons D connected in a social network SN with information about their current location, a geo-social skyline query reports for a given user U \u03b5 D and a given location P (not necessarily the location of the user) the pareto-optimal set of persons who are close to P \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A growing number of applications require combining SPARQL queries with generic graph search on RDF data. However, the lack of procedural capabilities in SPARQL makes it inappropriate for graph analytics. Moreover, RDF engines focus on SPARQL query evaluation whereas graph management frameworks perform only generic graph computations. In this work, we bridge the gap by introducing SPARTex, an RDF analytics framework based on the vertex-centric computation model. In SPARTex, user-defined vertex centric programs can be invoked from SPARQL as stored procedures. SPARTex allows the execution of a pipeline of graph algorithms without the need for multiple reads/writes of input data and intermediate results. We use a cost-based optimizer for minimizing the communication cost. SPARTex evaluates queries that combine SPARQL and generic graph computations orders of magnitude faster than existing RDF engines. We demonstrate a real system prototype of SPARTex running on a local cluster using real and synthetic datasets. SPARTex has a real-time graphical user interface that allows the participants to write regular SPARQL queries, use our proposed SPARQL extension to declaratively invoke graph algorithms or combine/pipeline both SPARQL querying and generic graph analytics.",

Recent work has considered the realistic case where the trajectories are uncertain; however, only simple uncertainty models have been proposed, which do not allow for accurate probabilistic search. In this paper, we fill this gap by addressing probabilistic nearest neighbor queries in databases with uncertain trajectories modeled by stochastic processes, specifically the Markov chain model. We study three nearest neighbor query semantics that take as input a query state or trajectory  and a time interval. For some queries, we show that no polynomial time solution can be found. For problems that can be solved in PTIME, we present exact query evaluation algorithms, while for the general case, we propose a sophisticated sampling approach, which uses Bayesian inference to guarantee that sampled trajectories conform to the observation data stored in the database. This sampling approach can be used in Monte-Carlo based approximation solutions. We include an extensive experimental study to support our theoretical results.",

The rationale is that 1) the dimensionality might be too high for the result of a regular RNN query to be useful, 2) missing values may implicitly define a meaningful subspace for RNN retrieval, and 3) analysts may be interested in the query results only for a set of (ad hoc) problem dimensions (i.e., object attributes).

The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for several state-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models.

In this paper, we investigate the effective and efficient retrieval of concise and informative OSs. We argue that a good size-l OS should be a stand-alone and meaningful synopsis of the most important information about the particular DS. More precisely, we define a size-l OS as a partial OS composed of l important tuples. We propose three algorithms for the efficient generation of size-l OSs (in addition to the optimal approach which requires exponential time).

Given a join predicate \u03c6 and an integer k, a top-k join query returns the k pairs of objects which have the highest combined score (based on an aggregate scoring function \u03b3) among all object pairs in R\u21e5 S that qualify \u03c6. This query type has been extensively studied in the relational database context where the join predicate is equality, with the main goal of minimizing the number of tuples accessed from relations R and S. However, if the top-k join involves a non-equijoin predicate \u03c6 on complex data types, the computational cost can easily become the bottleneck of query evaluation. In view of this, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm for top-k joins, which aims at minimizing the computations cost, without compromising the access cost. The main idea behind our paradigm is to examine blocks of data from R and S ordered by the object scores; by performing the top-k join in a blockwise fashion, we avoid (i) building expensive indexes incrementally and (ii) comparing pairs of blocks that may not contain results (using appropriate bounds). We show how our paradigm can be applied for the cases of top-k spatial and string joins and conduct an analysis on how to derive the optimal block size for each case. Finally, we evaluate our proposal by extensive experimentation on both real and synthetic data.",

            "Abstract": "In many activities, such as watching movies or having dinner, people prefer to find partners before participation. Therefore, when recommending activity items (e.g., movie tickets) to users, it makes sense to also recommend suitable activity partners. This way, (i) the users save time for finding activity partners, (ii) the effectiveness of the item recommendation is increased (users may prefer activity items more if they can find suitable activity partners), (iii) recommender systems become more interesting and enkindle users\u2019 social enthusiasm. In this paper, we identify the usefulness of suggesting activity partners together with items in recommender systems. In addition, we propose and compare several methods for activity-partner recommendation. Our study includes experiments that test the practical value of activity-partner recommendation and evaluate the effectiveness of all suggested methods as well as \u2026",

The scheme approximates the geometries of the RDF entities inside their (integer) IDs and can be used, along with several operators and optimizations we introduce, to accelerate queries with spatial predicates and to re-encode entities dynamically in case of updates. We implement our ideas in SRX, a system built on top of the popular RDF-3X system. SRX extends RDF-3X with support for three types of spatial queries: range selections (e.g., find entities within a given polygon), spatial joins (e.g., find pairs of entities whose locations are close to each other), and spatial k-nearest neighbors (e.g., find the three closest entities from a given location). We evaluate SRX on spatial queries and updates with real RDF data, and we also compare its performance with the latest versions of three popular RDF stores. The results \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Indexing intervals is a fundamental problem, finding a wide range of applications. Recent work on managing large collections of intervals in main memory focused on overlap joins and temporal aggregation problems. In this paper, we propose novel and efficient in-memory indexing techniques for intervals, with a focus on interval range queries, which are a basic component of many search and analysis tasks. First, we propose an optimized version of a single-level (flat) domain-partitioning approach, which may have large space requirements due to excessive replication. Then, we propose a hierarchical partitioning approach, which assigns each interval to at most two partitions per level and has controlled space requirements. Novel elements of our techniques include the division of the intervals at each partition into groups based on whether they begin inside or before the partition boundaries, reducing the information stored at each partition to the absolutely necessary, and the effective handling of data sparsity and skew. Experimental results on real and synthetic interval sets of different characteristics show that our approaches are typically one order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.",

Consider a database of versioned objects which have different valid instances along a history (e.g., documents in a web archive). Durable top-k search finds the set of objects that are consistently in the top-k results of a query (e.g., a keyword query) throughout a given time interval (e.g., from June 2008 to May 2009). Existing work on temporal top-k queries mainly focuses on finding the most representative top-k elements within a time interval. Such methods are not readily applicable to durable top-k queries. To address this need, we propose two techniques that compute the durable top-k result. The first is adapted from the classic top-k rank aggregation algorithm NRA. The second technique is based on a shared execution paradigm and is more efficient than the first approach. In addition, we propose a special indexing technique for archived data. The index, coupled with a space partitioning technique, improves performance even further.

A major challenge over the past years has been the efficient construction of fixed-space synopses that provide a deterministic quality guarantee, often expressed in terms of a maximum-error metric. Histograms and several hierarchical techniques have been proposed for this problem. However, their time and/or space complexities remain impractically high and depend not only on the data set size n, but also on the space budget B. These handicaps stem from a requirement to tabulate all allocations of synopsis space to different regions of the data. In this paper we develop an alternative methodology that dispels these deficiencies, thanks to a fruitful application of the solution to the dual problem: given a maximum allowed error, determine the minimum-space synopsis that achieves it.

We first show a straightforward solution for answering inverse spatial queries for any query predicate. Then, we propose a filter-and-refinement framework that can be used to improve efficiency. We show how to apply this framework on a variety of inverse queries, using appropriate space pruning strategies. In particular, we propose solutions for inverse epsilon range queries, inverse k-nearest neighbor queries, and inverse skyline queries. Our experiments show that our framework is significantly more efficient than naive approaches.",

However, these approaches may fail in considering microblog-specific features. To alleviate this issue, we propose a methodology that constructs a simulated microblogging corpus rather than directly building a model from the exterior corpus. The performance of our model is better since the microblog-special knowledge of the microblogging corpus is used in the end by the retrieval model.

ConCH employs meta-paths, which are sequences of object types that capture semantic relationships between objects. ConCH co-derives object embeddings and context embeddings via graph convolution.

            "Abstract": "In applications like social networking services and online games, multiple moving users which form a group may wish to be continuously notified about the best meeting point from their locations. A promising technique for reducing the communication frequency of the application server is to employ safe regions, which capture the validity of query results with respect to the users' locations. Unfortunately, the safe regions in our problem exhibit characteristics such as irregular shapes and inter-dependencies, which render existing methods that compute a single safe region inapplicable to our problem. To tackle these challenges, we first examine the shapes of safe regions in our problem's context and propose feasible approximations for them. We design efficient algorithms for computing these safe regions. We also study a variant of the problem called the sum-optimal meeting point and extend our solutions to solve this \u2026",

A task given to a worker typically consists of questions about the missing attribute values (e.g., What is the age of Jet Li?). Although this problem has been studied before, existing work often treats related attributes independently, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present T-Crowd, which is a crowdsourcing system that considers attribute relationships.

We propose a hierarchical algorithm (S-GRACE) for clustering XML documents based on structural information in the data.

In this paper we make a theoretical and empirical investigation of arc consistency and search algorithms for the hidden variable encoding. We analyze the potential benefits of applying arc consistency on the hidden encoding compared to generalized arc consistency on the non-binary representation.

Most of the previous work on this subject detect news by analyzing propagation patterns of microblogs. This approach has two limitations:(i) many non-news microblogs (eg marketing activities) have propagation patterns similar to news microblogs and therefore they can be falsely reported as news;(ii) using propagation patterns to identify news involves a time delay until the pattern is formed, therefore news are not detected in real time. We propose an alternative approach, which, motivated by the necessity of real-time detection of news, does not rely on propagation of posts. Moreover, we propose a real-time sorting strategy that orders the detected news microblogs using a translational approach. An experimental evaluation on a large-scale microblogging dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",

Consider a database of versioned objects which have different valid instances along a history (eg, documents in a web archive). Durable top-k search finds the set of objects that are consistently in the top-k results of a query (eg, a keyword query) throughout a given time interval (eg, from June 2008 to May 2009). Existing work on temporal top-k queries mainly focuses on finding the most representative top-k elements within a time interval. Such methods are not readily applicable to durable top-k queries. To address this need, we propose two techniques that compute the durable top-k result. The first is adapted from the classic top-k rank aggregation algorithm NRA. The second technique is based on a shared execution paradigm and is more efficient than the first approach. In addition, we propose a special indexing technique for archived data. The index, coupled with a space partitioning technique, improves performance even further.

The inverse ranking query retrieves the rank of a given query object according to a given score function. In this paper we present a framework that is able to update the query result very efficiently, as the stream provides new observations of the objects. We will theoretically and experimentally show that the query update can be performed in linear time complexity.

Recently, meeting point queries have been enriched to take as input, besides the locations of users, also some preference criteria (e.g., expressed by some keywords). However, in many applications, a group of users may require a meeting point recommendation without explicitly specifying any preferences. Motivated by this, we study this scenario of group recommendation for such passive users. We use topic modeling to infer the preferences of the group on the different points of interest and combine these preferences with the aggregate spatial distance of the group members to the \u2026",

Nevertheless, this might not be feasible since in practice the development process is confined by some constraints, e.g., limited funding or low target selling price. We model these constraints by a constraint function, which determines the feasible characteristics of a new product. Given such a budget, our task is to decide the best possible features of the new product that maximize its profitability. In general, a product is marketable if it dominates a large set of existing products, while it is not dominated by many. Based on this, we define dominance relationship analysis and use it to measure the profitability of the new product. The decision problem is then modeled as a budget constrained optimization query (BOQ). Computing BOQ is challenging due to the exponential increase in the search space with \u2026",

For time series data, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has been proven a very effective similarity measure, since it minimizes the effects of shifting and distortion in time. However, the quadratic cost of DTW computation to the length of the matched sequences makes its direct application on databases of long time series very expensive. We propose a technique that decomposes the sequences into a number of segments and uses cheap approximations thereof to compute fast lower bounds for their warping distances. We present several, progressively tighter bounds, relying on the existence or not of warping constraints.

We propose and study two models of flow computation, one based on a greedy flow transfer assumption and one that finds the maximum possible flow. We show that the greedy flow computation problem can be easily solved by a single scan of the interactions in time order.

The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for several state-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches compute this probability distribution by applying a dynamic programming approach of quadratic complexity. In this paper we theoretically as well as experimentally show that our framework reduces this to a linear-time complexity while having the same memory requirements, facilitated by incremental accessing of the uncertain vector instances in increasing order of their distance to the reference object. Furthermore, we show how the output of our method can be used to apply probabilistic top-k ranking for the objects, according to different state-of-the-art definitions.

The capacity constrained assignment (CCA) is a matching between the two sets such that (i) each customer is assigned to at most one provider,(ii) every provider serves no more customers than its capacity,(iii) the maximum possible number of customers are served, and (iv) the sum of Euclidean distances within the assigned provider-customer pairs is minimized. Although max-flow algorithms are applicable to this problem, they require the complete distance-based bipartite graph between the customer and provider sets. For large spatial datasets, this graph is expensive to compute and it may be too large to fit in main memory. Motivated by this fact, we propose efficient algorithms for optimal assignment that employ novel edge-pruning strategies, based on the spatial properties of the problem. Additionally, we develop incremental techniques that maintain an optimal assignment (in the presence of updates) with a processing cost several times lower than CCA re-computation from scratch. Finally, we present approximate (ie, suboptimal) CCA solutions that provide a tunable trade-off between result accuracy and computation cost, abiding by theoretical quality guarantees.

            "Abstract": "Given a set of N multi-dimensional points, we study the computation of \u03c6-quantiles according to a ranking function F, which is provided by the user at runtime. Specifically, F computes a score based on the coordinates of each point; our objective is to report the object whose score is the \u03c6N-th smallest in the dataset. \u03c6-quantiles provide a succinct summary about the F-distribution of the underlying data, which is useful for online decision support, data mining, selectivity estimation, query optimization, etc. Assuming that the dataset is indexed by a spatial access method, we propose several algorithms for retrieving a quantile efficiently. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that a branch-and-bound method is highly effective in practice, outperforming alternative approaches by a significant factor.",

            "Abstract": "Fault-tolerant group recommendation systems based on subspace clustering successfully alleviate high-dimensionality and sparsity problems. However, the cost of recommendation grows exponentially with the size of dataset. To address this issue, we model the fault-tolerant subspace clustering problem as a search problem on graphs and present an algorithm, GraphRec, based on the concept of \u03b1-\u00df-core. Moreover, we propose two variants of our approach that use indexes to improve query latency. Our experiments on different datasets demonstrate that our methods are extremely fast compared to the state-of-the-art.",

            "Abstract": "Consider two sets of spatial objects R and S, where each object is assigned a score (e.g., ranking). Given a spatial distance threshold \u03b5 and an integer k, the top-k spatial distance join (k- SDJ) returns the k pairs of objects, which have the highest combined score (based on an aggregate function \u03b3) among all object pairs in R\u00d7S which have spatial distance at most \u03b5. Despite the practical application value of this query, it has not received adequate attention in the past. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing methods that utilize both location and score information from the objects, enabling top-k join computation by accessing a limited number of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a technique which accesses blocks of data from R and S ordered by the object scores and then joins them using an aR-tree based module performs best in practice and outperforms alternative solutions by a wide margin.",

            "Abstract": "Spatial collocation patterns associate the co-existence of non-spatial features in a spatial neighborhood. An example of such a pattern can associate contaminated water reservoirs with certain deceases in their spatial neighborhood. Previous work on discovering collocation patterns converts neighborhoods of feature instances to itemsets and applies mining techniques for transactional data to discover the patterns. We propose a method that combines the discovery of spatial neighborhoods with the mining process. Our technique is an extension of a spatial join algorithm that operates on multiple inputs and counts long pattern instances. As demonstrated by experimentation, it yields significant performance improvements compared to previous approaches.",

This query has been studied in the vector space, however, there is no previous work in the context of graphs. In this paper, we propose a filterand-refinement framework, which prunes the search space while traversing the graph in search for the reverse k-ranks query results. We present an optimized algorithm and an index that apply on this framework and boost its performance. The proposed techniques are evaluated on real data; the experimental results show that our solutions scale well, rendering the query applicable for searching large graphs.",

The output of this query is the subset of the corresponding distance join (e.g., \u201cfind hotels which are within 1km to some restaurant\u201d) that satisfies the additional cardinality constraint. Therefore, it could be processed by using a conventional spatial join algorithm and then filtering-out the non-qualifying pairs. This approach, however, is expensive, especially when the cardinality constraint is highly selective. In this paper, we propose output-sensitive algorithms that prune the search space by integrating the cardinality with the distance constraint.

Existing path-based indexes and query processing algorithms are not efficient for searching complex structures beyond simple paths, even when the queries are high-selective. We introduce the definition of minimal infrequent structures (MIS), which are structures that 1) exist in the data, 2) are not frequent with respect to a support threshold, and 3) all substructures of them are frequent. By indexing the occurrences of MIS, we can efficiently locate the high-selective substructures of a query, improving search performance significantly. An efficient data mining algorithm is proposed, which finds the minimal infrequent structures. Their occurrences in the XML data are then indexed by a lightweight data structure and used as a fast filter step in query evaluation. We validate the efficiency and \u2026",

A well-known problem of frequent pattern mining is the huge number of patterns it produces. This affects not only the efficiency but also the effectiveness of mining. A typical solution to this problem is to summarize frequent patterns through closed and maximal patterns. No previous work addresses the problem of mining closed and/or maximal embedded tree patterns, not even in the framework of mining multiple small trees.We address the problem of summarizing embedded tree patterns extracted from large data trees, by defining and \u2026",

With the proliferation of GPS and tracking technology, huge volumes of trajectories are rapidly generated and collected. Under this, applications such as route recommendation and traveling behavior mining call for efficient trajectory retrieval. In this paper, we first focus on distance-based trajectory search; given a collection of trajectories and a set query points, the goal is to retrieve the top-k trajectories that pass as close as possible to all query points. We advance the state-of-the-art by combining existing approaches to a hybrid method and also proposing an alternative, more efficient range-based approach. Second, we propose and study the practical variant of bounded distance-based search, which takes into account the temporal characteristics of the searched trajectories.

            "Abstract": "Many spatial query problems defined on uncertain data are computationally expensive, in particular, if in addition to spatial attributes, a time component is added. Although there exists a wide range of applications dealing with uncertain spatio-temporal data, there is no solution for efficient management of such data available yet. This paper is the first work to propose general models for spatio-temporal uncertain data that have the potential to allow efficient processing on a wide range of queries. The main challenge here is to unfold this potential by developing new algorithms based on these models. In addition, we give examples of interesting spatio-temporal queries on uncertain data.",

A reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query finds the objects having a given query object as its nearest neighbor. RNN queries find applications in data mining, marketing analysis, and decision making. Most previous research on RNN queries over trajectory databases assume that the data are certain. In realistic scenarios, however, trajectories are inherently uncertain due to measurement errors or time-discretized sampling. In this paper, we study RNN queries in databases of uncertain trajectories. We propose two types of RNN queries based on a well established model for uncertain spatial temporal data based on stochastic processes, namely the Markov model.

To handle such queries, we study the use of entities found in queries to provide recommendations. Specifically, we extract entities from a query, and use these entities to explore new ones by consulting an information source. The discovered entities are then used to suggest new queries to the user. In this article, we examine two information sources: (1) a knowledge base (or KB), such as YAGO and Freebase; and (2) a click log, which contains the URLs accessed by a query user. We study how to use these sources to find new entities useful for query recommendation. We further study a hybrid framework that integrates \u2026",

We argue that the effective thematic ranking of OSs should combine gracefully IR-style properties, authoritative ranking and affinity.

Existing work maps each partially ordered domain to a total order and then adapts algorithms for totally-ordered domains to solve the problem. Nevertheless these methods either use stronger notions of dominance, which generate false positives, or require expensive dominance checks. In this paper, we propose two new methods, which do not have these drawbacks. The first method uses an appropriate mapping of a partial order to a total order, inspired by the lattice theorem and an off-the-shelf skyline algorithm. The second technique uses an appropriate storage and indexing approach, inspired by column stores, which enables efficient verification of whether a pair of objects are \u2026",

Such queries may also be applied in a spatial database context, where objects are augmented with some measures that must be aggregated according to a spatial division. For instance, consider a map of objects (e.g., restaurants), where each object carries some non-spatial measure (e.g., the number of customers served during the last month). Given a partitioning of the space into regions (e.g., by a regular grid), the goal is to find the regions with the highest number of served customers. A straightforward method to evaluate a top-k OLAP query is to compute the aggregate value for each group and then select the groups with the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In content-based retrieval systems, the goal of similarity search is to identify the k most similar images to a given example. Images are represented and queried by high-dimensional feature vectors encoding dominant characteristics like color and texture. We propose an efficient similarity search method that is robust to dimensionality and has optimal space complexity. Our approach fragments the feature vectors vertically, and computes the similarity of all images dimension by dimension. The innovation lies in gradually removing images that cannot participate in the response set. We show how to apply this scheme for two common similarity metrics, namely histogram intersection and euclidean distance. The implementation of our algorithm in Monet illustrates that core database technology supports image retrieval well, without special extensions. Finally, we report the effectiveness of our approach on real and synthetic data sets, and show significant improvements in response time yielded.",

            "Abstract": "We study the modeling and evaluation of a spatio-textual skyline (STS) query, in which the skyline points are selected not only based on their distances to a set of query locations, but also based on their relevance to a set of query keywords. STS is especially relevant to modern applications, where points of interest are typically augmented with textual descriptions. We investigate three models for integrating textual relevance into the spatial skyline. Among them, model STD, which combines spatial distance with textual relevance in a derived dimensional space, is found to be the most effective one. STD computes a skyline which not only satisfies the intent of STS, but also has a small and easy-to-interpret size. We propose an efficient algorithm for computing STD-based skylines, which operates on an IR-tree that indexes the data. The effectiveness of our STD model and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm are \u2026",

There is an increasing interest in parallel and distributed NMF algorithms, due to the high cost of centralized NMF on large matrices.

We design and analyze two different random matrix generation techniques and two subproblem solvers.

These microtasks are passed to a large number of workers and their answers are aggregated to infer the ranking. The number of microtasks depends on the budget allocated for the problem. Intuitively, the higher the number of microtask answers, the more accurate the ranking becomes. However, it is often hard to decide the budget required for an accurate ranking. We study how a ranking process can be terminated early, and yet achieve a high-quality ranking and great savings in the budget. We use statistical tools to estimate the quality of the ranking result at any stage of the crowdsourcing process, and terminate the process as soon as the desired quality is achieved.

Therefore, while selecting top reviews, it has been proposed to also consider their coverage (i.e., how many product aspects are covered by them). The goal of this paper is to further improve the top reviews set, using personalization criteria. This is motivated by the fact that the importance of product aspects to different users may vary and users prefer to focus on the most important aspects to them.

Under this, applications such as route recommendation and traveling behavior mining call for efficient trajectory retrieval. In this paper, we first focus on distance-to-points trajectory search; given a collection of trajectories and a set query points, the goal is to retrieve the top-k trajectories that pass as close as possible to all query points. We advance the state-of-the-art by combining existing approaches to a hybrid nearest neighbor-based method while also proposing an alternative, more efficient spatial range-based approach. Second, we investigate the continuous counterpart of distance-to-points trajectory search where the query is long-standing and the set of returned trajectories needs to be \u2026",

The efficiency of the proposed techniques is evaluated using synthetic datasets, which cover a wide range of data and query distributions. The results show that randomized search methods provide near-optimal solutions in limited time, being robust to data and query skew.

These sites allow users to check in at venues and leave a short commentary in the form of a micro-review. Micro-reviews are rich in content as they offer a distilled and concise account of user experience. In this paper we consider the problem of predicting the topic of a micro-review by a user who visits a new venue. Such a prediction can help users make informed decisions, and also help venue owners personalize users\u2019 experiences. However, topic modeling for micro-reviews is particularly difficult, due to their short and fragmented nature. We address this issue using pooling strategies, which aggregate micro-reviews at the venue or user level, and we propose novel probabilistic models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for extracting the topics related to a user-venue pair. Our best topic model integrates influences from both venue inherent properties and user preferences, considering at the same the sentiment orientation of the users. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model compared to simpler models and previous work; they also show that venue-inherent properties have higher influences on the topics of micro-reviews.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, we focus on protection against identity disclosure in the publication of sparse multidimensional data. Existing multidimensional anonymization techniquesa) protect the privacy of users either by altering the set of quasi-identifiers of the original data (e.g., by generalization or suppression) or by adding noise (e.g., using differential privacy) and/or (b) assume a clear distinction between sensitive and non-sensitive information and sever the possible linkage. In many real world applications the above techniques are not applicable. For instance, consider web search query logs. Suppressing or generalizing anonymization methods would remove the most valuable information in the dataset: the original query terms. Additionally, web search query logs contain millions of query terms which cannot be categorized as sensitive or non-sensitive since a term may be sensitive for a user and non-sensitive for another. Motivated by this observation, we propose an anonymization technique termed disassociation that preserves the original terms but hides the fact that two or more different terms appear in the same record. We protect the users' privacy by disassociating record terms that participate in identifying combinations. This way the adversary cannot associate with high probability a record with a rare combination of terms. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first to employ such a technique to provide protection against identity disclosure.

Relevance measures can be used in various applications, including entity resolution, recommendation, and information retrieval. Several studies have investigated the use of HIN information for relevance computation, however, most of them only utilize simple structure, such as path, to measure the similarity between objects.

In this paper, we propose AdPart, a distributed RDF system, which addresses the shortcomings of previous work. First, AdPart applies lightweight partitioning on the initial data, which distributes triples by hashing on their subjects; this renders its startup overhead low.
