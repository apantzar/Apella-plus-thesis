            "Abstract": "Since their appearance at the dawn of the second millennium, Delay or Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) have gradually evolved, spurring the development of a variety of methods and protocols for making them more secure and resilient. In this context, perhaps, the most challenging problem to deal with is that of cryptographic key management. To the best of our knowledge, the work at hand is the first to survey the relevant literature and classify the various so far proposed key management approaches in such a restricted and harsh environment. Towards this goal, we have grouped the surveyed key management methods into three major categories depending on whether the particular method copes with (a) security initialization,(b) key establishment, and (c) key revocation. We have attempted to provide a concise but fairly complete evaluation of the proposed up-to-date methods in a generalized way with the aim of offering a central reference point for future research.

In an attempt to identify common issues, strengths and limitations we evaluate them both in terms of efficiency and compliance to published forensic principles. Our results show that due to the increased complexity and wide variety of system configurations, the triage tools should be made more adaptable, either dynamically or manually (depending on the case and context) instead of maintaining a monolithic functionality.",

            "Abstract": "Wi-Fi is the dominant way of connecting indoor mobile devices to the Internet. The main reason behind the huge adoption of this technology is the simplicity of the IEEE 802.11 protocols, which offer low-cost ownership and maintenance combined with the ability to provide high data rates to end users. The increasing demand in traffic volumes leads to the continuous deployment of access points (APs), resulting in densification of the IEEE 802.11 networks. This densification, instead of enhancing the efficiency of wireless local area networks (WLANs), degrades their overall performance due to cochannel interference between overlapped basic services sets (OBSSs). One of the main goals of the IEEE 802.11ax amendment now under development is to address the WLAN densification problem by improving spatial reuse (SR).",

These networks consist of highly constrained devices able to communicate wirelessly in an ad-hoc fashion, thus following mesh networks. Current state-of-the-art (IDS) have been developed taking into consideration regular computer networks, and as such they do not efficiently addresses the paradigm of ad-hoc networks. In this work we firstly identify a trade-off between the communication and energy overheads of an IDS (as captured by the number of active IDS agents in the network) and the performance of the system in terms of successfully identifying attacks. In order to fine tune this trade-off, we model such networks as Random Geometric Graphs; a rigorous approach that allows us to capture underlying structural properties of the network. We then introduce a novel IDS architectural approach by having only a subset of the nodes acting as IDS agents. These nodes are able to efficiently detect attacks at the networking layer in a collaborative manner by monitoring locally available network information provided by IoT routing protocols such as RPL. Our detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates significant performance gains in terms of communication overhead and energy dissipation while maintaining high detection rates. We also show that the performance of our IDS in ad-hoc networks does not rely on the size of the network but on fundamental underling network properties, such as the network topology and the average degree of the nodes.",

The challenge is to get consistent and supportive security and privacy policies. In addition, the adoption of a wireless infrastructure will result in richer sets of information flows, requiring additional resources to achieve the same level of security as in a wired infrastructure. Richer sets of information are also likely to have a negative impact on privacy.",

The purpose of the research study was to enhance the level of understanding about the ways illegal internet protocol television (IPTV) is carried out, how the business models around this phenomenon work, and thereby provide a basis for subsequent identification of possible responses to tackle the challenge of the phenomenon more effectively. The research study was commissioned to the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management (CIPPM) of Bournemouth University, which set up a team of researchers in law, economics and computer science (1). The research team was assisted by an expert group including rights holders, law enforcement representatives, regulatory authorities, civil society groups and digital security companies (2).The present report is carried out as an interdisciplinary study, surveying legal, technical and economic aspects of illegal IPTV. It is the first major study that reviews the existing literature, the legislative framework and case-law in the EU and provides structural analysis of existing business models with regard to unauthorised delivery of television content over the internet. In addition, the study provides the first assessment results of the magnitude of illegal PTV across the EU in terms of active users and unlawful revenue obtained from infringing activities.",

To mitigate this, a collaborative circular economy business model is proposed, where the circular economy cycle is materialized by assets transitioning between asset operators on a demanddriven approach. Demand itself is partially based on the asset's state, which is described by its circular properties (location, condition, availability). The asset state and its transition between operators can be monitored by auditors and governmental regulators to ensure asset integrity and compliance with environmental targets. This common view of asset state between all parties can be enabled by \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The concept of product encryption is resident in the majority of symmetric block ciphers. Along with product encryption, two properties were also defined by Shannon, namely diffusion and confusion. In a product cipher such as a Feistel Network (FN), or generally a Substitution Permutation Network (SPN), diffusion is dependent upon two types of primitives, the nonlinear transformation and the swapping scheme. Different approaches to diffusion analysis considered either the topology of a FN, or the nonlinear transformation. This paper describes a metric for diffusion in a way suitable for investigating the behaviour of the underlying primitives of a FN.",

DFR was primarily about logging of security events to be leveraged by the forensic analysis phase. However, the increasing number of security incidents and the overwhelming volumes of data produced mandate the development of more effective and efficient DFR approaches. We propose a DFR framework focusing on the prioritisation, triaging and selection of Indicators of Compromise (IoC) to be used in investigations of security incidents. A core component of the framework is the contextualisation of the IoCs to the underlying organisation, which can be achieved with the use of clustering and classification algoriihms and a local IoC database.",

A typical approach to evade the identification and potential take down of a botnet command and control server is domain fluxing through the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). These algorithms produce a vast amount of domain names that the infected device tries to communicate with to find the C&C server, yet only a small fragment of them is actually registered. This allows the botmaster to pivot the control and make the work of seizing the botnet control rather difficult.Current state of the art and practice considers that the DNS queries performed by a compromised device are transparent to the network administrator and therefore can be monitored, analysed, and blocked. In this work, we showcase that the latter is a strong assumption as malware could efficiently hide \u2026",

The most common features utilized are the time intervals that the keys remain pressed and the time intervals that are required to use two consecutive keys. This paper examines which of these features are the most important and how utilization of these features can lead to better classification results. To achieve this, an existing dataset consisting of 387 logfiles is used, five classifiers are exploited and users are classified by gender and age. The results, while demonstrating the application of these two characteristics jointly on classifiers with high accuracy, answer the question of which keystroke dynamics features are more appropriate for classification with common classifiers.

            "Abstract": "ICT changes continuously and we are used to look at IT in a slightly dif-ferent way every year. Things are developed and manufactured to be smaller and faster but few changes are truly technologically revolutionary. Some changes creep up on us as they arrive under cover of previously known technology. Solid State Disks (SSD) is such a technology. The use of SSD is simple enough and for many purposes it can be used as if it was a normal hard disc but many times faster and with a very much lower power consumption. But, SSD is not an evolution of hard disc technology, it is a completely new technology which imitates the behav-iour of a hard disc. There are major underpinning differences which have serious consequences for security and for digital forensic. Due to how the SSDs work it is not always certain that deleted data are purged from the disc. On the other hand SSD\u201f s can sometimes purge data all by themselves even if they are not connected to any interface with only the power on. This means that normal guidelines aimed at hard discs for how to preserve digital forensic evidence are not just inappropri-ate but could if followed result in potential evidence being lost, destroyed or deemed unvalid as evidence. This paper gives an overview of some of the princi-pal and unexpected challenges that SSDs have brought with them for Digital Fo-rensics investigations.",

Moreover, big data produced by IoT enabling technologies like wireless sensors, RFID tags and mobile phones introduce new challenges in terms of real-time authentication. This work defines one of the neglected challenges in IoT called uncertainty in authentication. Considering this challenge is important because IoT has a number of characteristics that amplify uncertainty in authentication.

At the collective level, they can be used as a mean of communication to support the discussion, comparison and exploration of different understandings. The exploration of multiple perspectives of contextual understanding avoids entrapment in various types of reductionism and eliminates tendencies towards a deterministic reasoning and the pursuit of one optimum solution. A critical challenge is first developing a large spectrum of alternatives and then managing how the differences and similarities between alternatives will be handled to efficiently support decisions in information systems security (ISS).

In this paper, we report on the potential of identifying past pod slurping type of attacks by constructing a synthetic metric based on information contained in filesystem timestamps. More specifically, by inferring the transfer rate of a file from last access timestamps and correlating that to the characteristic transfer rate capabilities of a suspicious USB found in the Windows registry, one could assess the probability of having suffered an unauthorised copy of files. Preliminary findings indicate that file transfer rates can be associated with the make and model of the USB storage device and give supporting information to the forensic analyst to identify file leakages.",

The 1970s was a decade marked by economists and their aspirations to develop an economic model to \u201cdecrypt\u201d the market forces. Although Hirshleifer (1971) introduced the value of information in relation to privacy in the early 1970s, economics tools were ported to the privacy domain in the late 1970s and early 1980s (eg, Posner, 1978; Stigler, 1980). However in the 1980s the concept of information sharing and the Internet were showing signs of potential, only to be interrupted by the Morris Worm in 1988 (Seeley, 1989), and security was added into the agenda. Initially this was done in the expense of privacy. For the following years information security received substantial attention\u2014if the members of the private sector were to invest in electronic communications and technologies, trust needed to be restored.",

            "Abstract": "Traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), which is proposed to provide traffic status in advance for road users to avoid traffic congestion or other traffic incidents and for authorities to optimise the strategies of traffic management. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning framework, based on the Sequence-to-Sequence ar- chitecture with an embedded module, for long-term traffic speed forecasting with missing data and providing high forecasting accuracy. The embedded module uses Graph Convolution Neural Network for the local spatial dependency analysis by conducting convolutional operation on the k \u2212 hop neighbourhood matrix, while utilises Transformer for the global spatial dependency analysis by implementing the attention mechanism that assigns individual weights to neighbour detectors for contributing to the targeted detector. The sequence-to-sequence architecture is built to analyse temporal dependencies of the spatially-fused time series from the embedded module. To evaluate the proposed model against existing well-known ones, the real traffic speed dataset with missing data and frequent traffic incidents is used to train and test the models. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework achieves the most accuracy forecasting, even obtaining more than 80% accuracy for forecasting two hours in advance.",

The purpose of the current study is to predict in-hospital and after-discharge mortality in patients with VTE admitted to ICU using a machine learning (ML) framework. We studied 2,468 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database, admitted to ICU with a diagnosis of VTE.

Access control is preferable over inference control in terms of efficiency, but it fails to offer confidentiality in the presence of inference channels. We argue that during the design phase of a data schema and the definition of user roles, inference channels should be considered. An approach is introduced that can be integrated into a risk assessment exercise to assist in determining the roles and/or attributes that lower the risks associated with information disclosure from inference. The residual risk from the remaining inference channels could be treated by well known inference control mechanisms.",

The underlying epistemology of our research lies in the interpretative paradigm. It explores the patterns of how the contextual use of information systems security is involved according to a business/organizational practice perspective. It elicits the detailed processes and practices that constitute the pragmatic perspective in developing information security activities.",

            "Abstract": "The intelligence being built into modern vehicles significantly improves passenger safety and comfort, and this trend is expected to intensify in the coming years. Smart, eventually self-driving, vehicles are expected to form an important segment of the Internet of Things (IoT)\u2013enabled word, introducing new modes of transportation and new types of services. This merge of the ubiquitous smart systems with the smart vehicle environment is often referred to as Co-operative Intelligent Transportation System (CITS). Nevertheless, the above enhancements give rise to significant security and privacy concerns. Remote attacks have already been reported in production vehicles, even though their capabilities and features are very limited compared to future models. The significantly enlarged attack surface, the complexity of interactions and the variety of threat actors, necessitate the introduction of appropriate mechanisms, to ensure the vehicular platforms and the associated applications are secure enough for users to rely upon. In this chapter, we summarize the threats, requirements and challenges in securing vehicular networks, examining both Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) interactions. Moreover, a holistic approach for intrusion detection, prevention and mitigation for C-ITS ecosystems is presented, considering said deployments as an important part of the cyber-physical systems that are essential to protect. Pointers to important elements that future research should consider are provided, to maximize the effectiveness and benefits of such security frameworks, thus enabling the faster adoption of the future trends that will \u2026",

The popular conception is that security is there to \u201cprotect\u201d us and because of that it is welcomed by most or at worst not resisted. Security systems include those installed to protect us when travelling through to the security systems that protect our credit card transactions. The recent surveillance report suggests that the UK is the most spied upon nation in the world. So what happens to the information collected on each of us and what is it used for? This paper will explore the argument that information is a commodity increasingly controlled for the benefit of those who have power and that security, in its many forms, is an instrument to enable population control. In the paper we propose a means of assessing the optimum level of security which we argue will still provide protection without eroding our privacy and freedom. The proposal is suggested to contribute to the notion of an \u201cinverse\u201d panopticon as a means of protecting privacy and freedom.",

This work proposes a web bot detection framework that comprises two detection modules: (i) a detection module that utilises web logs, and (ii) a detection module that leverages mouse movements. The framework combines the results of each module in a novel way to capture the different temporal characteristics of the web logs and the mouse movements, as well as the spatial characteristics of the mouse movements.

In order to consider a computer based e-learning environment, a roleplaying, problem-based approach to cryptography related scenarios was adopted. A number of scenarios presented in this paper were used for analysing the requirements and for identifying attributes of the specialised e-learning environment that can support simulation of cryptographic activity on a protocol level. These attributes in turn would form the basis of a tool set to role-play different scenarios of communicating within the presence of adversaries. The role-play activity helps to develop an appreciation of the need for cryptography and an understanding of different cryptographic techniques. The role-play activity is particularly appropriate for enabling an understanding of protocol failures.",

The main changes made were the use of a larger dataset, which resulted from a new volunteer recording phase, the exploitation of more keystroke dynamics features, and the use of a procedure for selecting those features that can best distinguish users according to their age. Five machine learning models were used for the classification, and their performance in relation to the number of features involved was tested.

Among various security challenges, Access Control is a crucial concern for all cloud computing-like systems (e.g. Fog computing, Mobile edge computing) in the IoT era. Therefore, assigning the precise level of access in such an inherently scalable, heterogeneous and dynamic environment is not easy to perform. This work defines the uncertainty challenge for authentication phase of the access control in fog computing because on one hand fog has a number of characteristics that amplify uncertainty in authentication and on the other hand applying traditional access control models does not result in a flexible and resilient solution. Therefore, we have proposed a novel prediction model based on the extension of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) model \u2026",

These networks consist of highly constrained devices organised in mesh networks following ad-hoc architectures, and as such carry specific characteristics that are not efficiently addressed by current state-of-the-art. In this work we first identify a trade-off between the communication and energy overhead of an IDS (as captured by the number of active IDS agents in the network) and the performance of the system in terms of successfully identifying attacks. In order to fine tune this trade-off, we first model such networks with the use of Random Geometric Graphs as this is a rigorous approach that allows us to capture underlying structural properties of the network. We then introduce a novel architectural approach for IDS by having only a subset of the nodes acting as IDS agents. These nodes are able to efficiently detect attacks at the networking layer in a collaborative manner by monitoring locally available network information provided by IoT routing protocols such as RPL. Our detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates significant performance gains in terms of communication overhead and energy dissipation while maintaining high detection rates.",

            "Abstract": "Cryptographic key exchange is considered to be a challenging problem in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) operating in deep space environments. The difficulties and challenges are attributed to the peculiarities and constraints of the harsh communication conditions that DTNs typically operate in, rather than the actual features of the underlying key management cryptographic protocols and solutions. In this paper we propose a framework for evaluation of key exchange protocols in a DTN setting. Our contribution is twofold as the proposed framework can be used as a decision making tool for automated evaluation of various communication scenarios with regards to routing decisions and as part of a method for protocol evaluation in DTNs.",

            "Abstract": "An essential problem of \u2018knowledge management\u2019is the impossibility of codifying \u2018knowledge\u2019which is embedded in human agents. It can never be straightforward for members of an organization to share what they know with one another. Such a process might be facilitated, but would be difficult to \u2018manage\u2019. In recognition of this, organizations have sought ways to support knowledge sharing processes, ranging from document-based repositories to on-going mentor/trainee relationships. From day to day, all individuals will need to make choices relating to their organizational roles. A need to recognize the element of choice and judgment available to an individual requires an ability to distinguish and discriminate between different categories of argument or assertion. When attempting to deal with problems, people are capable of using multi-valued logic in a process of creating assertions. It follows, therefore, that any support mechanism based only on bi-valued logic might serve to constrain and inhibit exercise of judgment. Using four-valued logic, it is possible to codify, not knowledge, but categories of argument/assertion. By this means, improved support may be provided for a knowledge-sharing environment, ie with a purpose to support knowledge management processes. In this paper, the authors draw on previous research in contextual analysis, complex methods of inquiry and paraconsistent logic in order to develop these ideas. A model of four-valued logic is described and applied for the purpose of categorising arguments.",

Emphasising on the methodological issues used in IS research, the proposed integrated model is focusing on the mediating variables, or the so-called \u2018black box\u2019, referring to the relationships between the primary independent and dependent variables, in online transactions. As such in this paper we attempt to fuse acknowledged technology acceptance models with information security and privacy models by proposing a general model which will enable the empirical validation and study of the factors that influence the users\u2019 attitudes toward online transactions. The factors are represented in the model by variables (independent or mediating) and the analysis is proposed to be based on statistical techniques such as structural equation modelling. Since at this current stage the model is formed on a theoretical basis, we consider all mediating variables to be contained in a black box. Challenges such as the number of sub-boxes included in the linear causal process in a black box and what should be included in a sub-box are discussed.",

Although all desktop browsers filter rogue websites, their mobile counterparts often do not filter them at all, exposing their users to websites serving malware or hosting phishing attacks. In this paper we revisit the anti-phishing filtering mechanism which is offered in the most popular web browsers of Android, iOS and Windows Phone. Our results show that mobile users are still unprotected against phishing attacks, as most of the browsers are unable to filter phishing URLs. Thus, we implement and evaluate TRAWL (TRAnsparent Web protection for alL), as a cost effective security control that provides DNS and URL filtering using several blacklists.",

To this end, we apply a haircut blacklisting policy and the intelligence collected from various engines to perform a taint analysis on the metadata existing in these blockchains, aiming to identify malicious acts through the merge of identifying information.

In an effort to resume economic activity safely, several Digital Contact Tracing applications and protocols have been introduced with success. However, DCT is a reactive method, as it aims to break existing chains of disease transmission in a population. Therefore DCT is not suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a Health Passport as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free and how it could be used to resume the international tourism sector. Following, we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of Authority for issuing Digital Health Passports. The framework provides a distributed infrastructure supporting the issuance of DHPs by foreign health systems and their verification by relevant stakeholders, such as airline companies and border control authorities. We discuss the attributes of the system in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy.

            "Abstract": "The complication of information technology and the proliferation of heterogeneous security devices that produce increased volumes of data coupled with the ever-changing threat landscape challenges have an adverse impact on the efficiency of information security controls and digital forensics, as well as incident response approaches. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and forensic preparedness are the two parts of the so-called managed security services that defendants can employ to repel, mitigate or investigate security incidents. Despite their success, there is no known effort that has combined these two approaches to enhance Digital Forensic Readiness (DFR) and thus decrease the time and cost of incident response and investigation. This paper builds upon and extends a DFR model that utilises actionable CTI to improve the maturity levels of DFR. The effectiveness and applicability of this model are evaluated through a series of experiments that employ malware-related network data simulating real-world attack scenarios. To this extent, the model manages to identify the root causes of information security incidents with high accuracy (90.73%), precision (96.17%) and recall (93.61%), while managing to decrease significantly the volume of data digital forensic investigators need to examine. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it indicates that CTI can be employed by digital forensics processes. Second, it demonstrates and evaluates an efficient mechanism that enhances operational DFR. View Full-Text",

In addition, the automated and often unconscious and unintentional flow of data, which Brunk (2002) describes as exoinformation, makes the traditional auditing function inadequate to fully capture the security and privacy aspects facing most corporations. This paper draws upon an existing theoretical model of privacy and security, based on the concept of information richness, to develop a practical framework for wider information audit. The proposed information space audit, a supplement to existing information audits, provides guidance on how to manage the rich set of exoinformation data that is typically unplanned and automatically collected. Collating and combining information from different sources provides further scope to reduce information collection \u2026",

In contrast to long-term traffic prediction, accurate prediction of short-term traffic flow facilitates timely traffic management and rapid response. We develop and study a novel ensemble model (EM) based on long short term memory (LSTM), deep autoencoder (DAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Our approach takes into account both temporal and spatial characteristics of the traffic conditions. We evaluate our proposal against well-known existing prediction models.

Mitigating circumstances are conditions which moderate the culpability of an offender of a committed offence. Our argument is based on several observations. The cyberspace introduces a new family of communication and interaction styles and designs which could facilitate, make available, deceive, and in some cases persuade, a user to commit an offence. User's lack of awareness could be a valid mitigation when using software features introduced without a proper management of change and enough precautionary mechanisms, e.g. warning messages. The cyber behaviour of users may not be necessarily a reflection of their real character and intention. Their irrational and unconscious actions may result from their immersed and prolonged presence in a particular cyber context. Hence, the consideration of the cyberspace design \u2026",

Cryptographic strength in the context of this paper is related to the ability of the round function to produce a random output which in turn is defined as the distance between a theoretical calculation and an experimental measure. The measurements are based on the diffusion characteristic of the cipher. Potentially, the test for randomness proposed in this paper could be used as a distinguisher based on diffusion.",

Traditional recycling concepts and methods are not enough to counter such effects. In this context, a circular economy (CE), that is, a restorative and regenerative by-design economy, can reform today's \"take-make-dispose\" economic model. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to gradually transform our everyday lives, allowing for the introduction of novel types of services while enhancing legacy ones. Taking this as our motivation, in this article we analyze the CE/IoT interplay, indicating innovative ways in which this interaction can drastically affect products and services, their underlying business models, and the associated ecosystems. Moreover, we present an IoT architecture that enables smart object integration into the IoT ecosystem \u2026",

This paper presents WARDOG - an awareness and digital forensic system that informs the end-user of the botnet's infection, exposes the botnet infrastructure, and captures verifiable data that can be utilized in a court of law. The responsible authority gathers all information and automatically generates a unitary documentation for the case.

In this paper, we extend the application of our model to a second order. In the first application, individually-created narratives are categorised according to four-valued logic: assertions of positive belief in alternatives, negative belief in alternatives, possibility of alternatives or ignorance of any alternative. A second order is illustrated through an example in which all assertions of positive or optimistic possible belief are considered by participants. The model is applied in order to identify clusters of narratives which appear to have characteristics in common, by creation of diversity networks. In this way, a more focused agenda for debate can be supported to emerge.",

For these reasons, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of unsupervised and hybrid methods for intrusion detection, discussing their potential in the domain.

Taking the human race as a natural system and one which owes its avoidance of entropy to its ability to absorb ideas and information from its environment it can be thought of in systems terms as an open system. The thinking behind security systems, we argue, is based on the assumption that human society is a closed system and by exercising control over its boundaries those within will be protected (or controlled?). The assumption being made here is that there is a relationship between the well-being of the citizen and security. For some this relationship might be described as being synergistic in as much as one gains benefit from the other; there is an unconscious or conscious cooperation in terms of their own goals. But the question we raise in this article is at what happens if that relationship breaks down and is seen as not one of protection but an invasion of privacy? What happens when security is no longer seen as a system of protection but as a control system? In other words at what point does the synergistic relationship based upon shared goals and aspirations become one based not \u2026",

In this context, this work examines the protection that is offered by the private browsing mode of the most popular desktop browsers in Windows (i.e., Chrome, Firefox, IE and Opera). Our experiments uncover occasions in which even if users browse the web with a private session, privacy violations exist contrary to what is documented by the browser.

A number of commercial companies offer a desktop-oriented big data security analysis solution; however, most of them are prohibitive to ordinary desktop users with respect to cost and IT processing power. This paper presents an intuitive and inexpensive big data security analysis approach using Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques for Windows desktop users, where the combination of Windows batch programming, EmEditor and R are used for the security analysis.

The use of Blockchain technology provides an answer to this issue, however, its application raises issues related to the highly-constrained nature of these networks. In this paper, Edge Computing is presented as a solution to this issue, providing a way in which Blockchain and Edge Computing can be used together to address the constrained nature of IoT.

            "Abstract": "We study efficient and lightweight Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for ad-hoc networks via the prism of IPv6-enabled Wireless Sensor Actuator Networks. These networks consist of highly constrained devices able to communicate wirelessly in an ad-hoc fashion, thus following the architecture of ad-hoc networks. Current state-of-the-art (IDS) has been developed taking into consideration the architecture of conventional computer networks, and as such they do not efficiently address the paradigm of ad-hoc networks, that is highly relevant in emergent networks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, the network properties of resilience and redundancy have not been studied yet. In this work, we firstly identify a trade-off between the communication overhead and energy consumption of an IDS (as captured by the number of active IDS agents in the network) and the performance of the system in terms of \u2026",
