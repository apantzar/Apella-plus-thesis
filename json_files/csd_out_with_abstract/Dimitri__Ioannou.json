            "Abstract": "The dimensional scaling of microelectronics to improve the performance of the central process unit (CPU) is facing fundamental and physical challenges. The current solution is to increase the cache memory\u2013static random access memory (SRAM).[1] However, this will decrease CPU information throughput because SRAM is volatile and occupies a large floor space. Therefore, developing high-performance non-volatile memory as local memory in CPU will bring a revolutionary impact to microelectronics which increasingly demands stand-alone and embedded memory for portable electronics.[1] Floating-gate non-volatile memory (NVM) is compatible with CMOS integration. However, the traditional floating gate materials, such as poly-Si/SiO2 and oxynitride, require large Program/Erase (P/E) voltage and endure only 106 P/E cycles [2]. Therefore the conventional floating-gate NVM cannot be used for local memory \u2026",

The Si nanowire devices are fabricated by using a self-aligned technique with standard photolithographic alignment and metal lift-off processes, enabling the large-scale integration of high-performance nanowire devices.

NMOSFETs under positive stress were found to have the smallest VBD, while the V BD  of the PMOSFETs under positive stress were significantly increased due to the well resistance. Compared to that measured using the CVS method, the V BD  from the transmission line pulse method (TLP) was smaller by only less than 10%.

By contrast to previous belief, the simulation results indicated that for the 0.145 \u03bcm technology node, the circuit could be destabilized by the floating body effects enhanced (channel) off current rather than parasitic BJT current. It was observed that current spiking also played a major role in discharging the pre-charge node during operation. It was found that this overall leakage (discharging) limited the number of input transistors on the OR circuit. It was therefore deemed necessary to make the level-restoring transistor stronger and/or limit the number of inputs to keep the circuit robust during operation. Keeping the body grounded was found to be an alternative solution to both of these leakage problems.",

The source/drain electrodes were formed by using photolithographic alignment and metal lift-off processes. The nanowires were then covered with sputtering oxide at room temperature to be isolated from the external environment. We have observed a large threshold voltage shift window (8 V) at 10 V write/erase voltage and non-volatile on/off current states, which is attributed to the small radius (\u0303 10 nm) and intrinsic doping of the Si nanowire. The dynamics of the nanowire/nitride charge exchange, and its effect on threshold voltage and memory retention have been studied.",

The effect of the trapping layer thickness of the nanowire memory cells has been experimentally measured and studied by simulation. As the thickness of HfO{sub 2} increases from 5 to 30 nm, the charge trap density increases as expected, while the program/erase speed and retention remain the same.

We describe two unique approaches to successfully fabricate nanowire devices, one based upon harvesting and positioning nanowires and one based upon the direct growth of nanowires in predefined locations. Test structures are fabricated and electronically characterized to probe the fundamental properties of chemical-vapor-deposition grown silicon nanowires. Important information about current transport and fluctuations in materials and devices can be derived from noise measurements, and low frequency 1/f noise has traditionally been utilized as a quality and reliability indicator for semiconductor devices.

The common materials under study for negative capacitance are ferroelectric thin films. However, the integration of regular ferroelectric materials (eg, PZT) into semiconductor based devices is usually difficult due to the high temperature required for crystallization and precise control of oxygen percentage in ferroelectric materials. In this work, we found that negative capacitance can be achieved by introducing a topological insulator interlayer into a conventional MOS capacitor. Three-dimensional topological insulators inherently contain a insulator/semiconductor bulk and a gapless conducting surface. When an electric field is added to topological insulator interlayer, imbalanced charge carriers (electrons and holes) would be generated and then \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Charge pump circuits are used to produce voltages higher than the regular supply voltage on chip. They are essential for single-power nonvolatile memories such as EEPROMS and Flash memories [1]. However, the pumping gain and efficiency for bulk circuits are severely limited by the threshold voltage drop and the body effect. Due to the pass transistor effect there is a loss of voltage equivalent to V\u012b (threshold voltage) on the output of each stage. This problem is made even more severe by the fact that Vt goes up with increasing Vse (the source to body bias), thus reducing the output voltage of the pump circuit drastically. Various techniques have been proposed in the past to alleviate this problem [1],[2]. One of the obvious solutions to overcome the problem of body effect and the threshold voltage drop is to keep the body floating. However, due to technological reasons, making a floating body in bulk is not trivial. The implementation of the pump circuit on partially depleted (PD) SOI automatically takes care of this problem. This becomes possible due to the fact that SOI is naturally a floating body device. However, leaving the body floating complicates the circuit behavior by introducing various effects unique to PD SOI known as floating body effects (FBE)[4]. These SOI-specific properties such as parasitic BJT current, hysteresis, and unstable threshold voltage etc., can significantly alter the circuit performance, depending on circuit topology (5). Therefore, to have an optimum design one needs to carefully examine the impact of FBE on a given circuit.",

            "Abstract": "Historically, the failure mode of the NMOS/lateral NPN (Lnpn) due to electrostatic discharge (ESD) is source-to-drain filamentation as the temperature exceeds the melting temperature of silicon. However, as the oxide thickness shrinks, the ESD failure is instead due to oxide breakdown. In this paper, transmission line pulse (TLP) testing of the NMOS/Lnpn device is used to characterize the failure mode for a 0.1 /spl mu/m NMOS. The channel length and non-silicided source contact-to-gate spacing (SCG) are the main parameters in determining ESD protection capability. Using Id-Vg measurements, we show how oxide degradation before failure is detected with the leakage current failure criteria used. The latent effects of oxide degradation on the second breakdown current (It2) of the NMOS/Lnpn are identified. As the ultra-thin oxide (15 A) device ages from an oxide perspective, its ESD protection capabilities decrease.",

A concomitant observation is that the drain current (Id)\u2013gate voltage (Vg) hysteresis decreases with temperature, reaching zero at nearly the same temperature at which Jg collapses.

            "Abstract": "This paper presents the latest results from the literature, concerning the performance and reliability of extremely scaled FD transistors. Numerical simulations showed that scalability of FD-SOI is achievable by using exotic gate materials to control the threshold voltage and lowly doped/undoped channels and thinning the silicon film and buried oxide to control the short channel effects. As the film thickness is reduced the effective junction depth is reduced which strengthens the front gate control of the back surface potential and improves the short channel effects. The hot carrier reliability of SOI CMOS was unknown as carriers can get hot at very low voltages and channel coupling and floating body complicates the effects of the induced degradation.",

Here, we report a method to achieve precise gas discrimination of similar chemical vapors (mesitylene, o-xylene, and toluene) by using cross-reactive arrays consisting of metal oxide semiconductor and graphene sensors. It is difficult to identify these three chemicals as they have very similar responses to these sensors. Through a cross-reactive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the sensor response features, however, the discrimination accuracy improved from about 70% with a single gas sensor to almost 100% with the cross-reactive sensor array. Such a precise discrimination and the low-cost planar process make this approach a very attractive candidate for smart gas sensing and for future Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  ",

A pseudo-nMOS gate with a fan-in of N requires only N+1 transistors (as opposed to 2N for standard CMOS), resulting in smaller area as well as smaller parasitic capacitances, whereas each input connects to only one transistor, presenting a smaller load to the preceding gate. Since these advantages come at the expense of static power consumption, pseudo-nMOS circuits have often lost their appeal for large circuits, even though they are frequently used in some critical path elements when speed and area are at a premium (Weste and Eshraghian, 1993). If a weaker pMOS load transistor could be used without sacrificing speed, for example by reducing the load on the dotted node (either due to smaller devices in the \u2026",

With width as a parameter, variations in threshold voltage, mobility, subthreshold swing and drain-induced barrier lowering are analyzed in relationship with the other transistor dimensions (i.e. channel length, and film thickness). For both isolation techniques, a strong dependence of the threshold voltage with the channel width as well as the SOI silicon film thickness are observed while narrow and short-channel effects are not found to be correlated. Following this, it is shown through saturation subthreshold swing, latch-up and breakdown voltage measurements, that the floating-body effects (FBEs) are reduced in narrow-channel devices. Specific experiments (current transients, source\u2013body junction current\u2026) and simulations were conducted to reveal the mechanisms responsible for the observed weakening of \u2026",

Although this new cell resembles the thin-capacitively coupled-thyristor (TCCT) SRAM cell in concept and operation, it is nevertheless characterized by significant advantages. These advantages derive from the fact that the thyristorlike mode of operation of the FED is gate induced, whereas the TCCT is an actual built-in thyristor. The operation of the cell is explained with the help of suitable timing diagrams, and the mechanisms of storing 1 and 0 are analyzed with detailed numerical simulations. In one operation scheme (where the cell could better be termed quasi-SRAM), a sequence of restore pulses is periodically applied after the cell is put on Hold, which ensures that the stored data remain valid for as long as the cell is powered ON.

First, the influence of the floating-body strength on the hot-carrier induced degradation in N-channel 90 nm partially depleted SOI MOSFETs is investigated. Enhanced hot-carrier degradation with increasing floating-body strength is observed and possible physical mechanisms to explain the obtained results are suggested. A channel width dependent degradation mechanism, arising from the SOI nature is observed: lower degradation obtained for the narrower channels is attributed to the weakening of floating-body effect with decreasing channel width. In addition, measured data provide experimental evidence of a shift in the location of the damage in the channel further away from the drain at elevated temperatures which may be responsible for the enhanced saturation current \u2026",

The effect of the trapping layer thickness of the nanowire memory cells has been experimentally measured and studied by simulation. As the thickness of HfO 2 increases from 5 to 30 nm, the charge trap density increases as expected, while the program/erase speed and retention remain the same. These data indicate that the electric field across the tunneling oxide is not affected by HfO 2 thickness, which is in good agreement with simulation results.

It is difficult to identify these three chemicals as they have very similar responses to these sensors. Through cross-reactive Principal Component Analysis of the sensor response features, however, the discrimination accuracy improved from about 70% with a single gas sensor to almost 100% with the cross-reactive sensor array. Such a precise discrimination and the low-cost planar process make this approach a very attractive candidate for smart gas sensing and for future Internet of Things applications.",

Because the Si nanowire field effect transistors exhibit ambipolar characteristics with electron current slightly lower than the hole current, we can select the type of carriers (electrons or holes) flowing through the same contacts and adjust the current by the applied gate voltage. In this way, we are able to measure the characteristics of the same contact with either pure electron or hole flow. In addition, we found that the nanowire contacts behave very differently depending on the current flow directions. This indicates that the source and drain contact resistance can be dramatically different.

In this work we studied the RS of the Ta/Ta 2 O 5 based RRAM devices from the dependences of operation parameters Vse t, IC C, Vrese t, and Irese t on device resistance. From statistical analysis of variation in the threshold parameters, we found that the set process is mainly determined by the voltage stress on the device, instead of current. The first forming process is different from the following set process. The forming voltage exponentially depends on the pristine resistance.

A series of experiments unambiguously demonstrate that this damage is not caused by hot hole injection and that device degradation mechanism at VG = VD stress condition (formation of interface states and positive oxide charges) is in fact due to negative bias temperature instability which is activated because of the self-heating effect. In addition, stress at high temperature is found to result in a shift of the worst case stress condition from maximum gate current to VG = VD.",

First, because of the cylindrical symmetry, for the same value of the control gate voltage the electric \ufb01eld across the tunneling oxide is bigger than in comparable conventional cells, leading to either higher performance (faster program/erase or P/E), or same performance at a lower power operation. Second, the cylindrical symmetry is particularly suitable for sealing NVM cells, where as short a channel length as possible is desired without reducing the gate oxide thickness too \u2026",

On the other hand, in HS PMOSFET devices, HC degradation is shown to be induced by a combination of HCI and NBTI across the whole stress bias voltage range. Additionally, in both I/O and HS devices, higher degradation is observed for floating-body (FB) devices at high stress voltages, which becomes comparable to body-contacted (BC) devices at lower stress voltages. It is also shown that externally applied body bias plays an important role in enhancing the degradation in I/O devices but has little effect on HS devices.",

            "Abstract": "With composite materials being targeted for use in structural applications, concerns have increased about their long-term structural integrity, since conventional sub-critical flaw detection methodologies are generally not effective for composites. Furthermore, concerns about composite failure models that are typically used to predict failure behavior of composites in lieu of testing have also increased due to the 1995 research of Li et al. and the 2004 research of Kim et al. These research results employing micromechanics tests on multi-fiber microcomposites indicate that the underlying shear-lag models typically used to predict composite failure behavior show an increase in fiber-flaw density along the length of a composite fiber rather than the experimentally observed decrease. More recently Kim et al. have shown that the multiple fiber fracture process observed in a single fiber composite can be captured by statistical models based on lifetime analyses. The output parameters from these analyses may provide a basis for quantifying the fiber failure process in different composite materials. To test the validity of this method, the lifetime analyses approach is extended in this report to the fiber-fracture process in multi-fiber microcomposites.",

However, separating ferroelectric effect from many of the factors (such as charge injection/trapping and the presence of mobile ions in the polymer) that confound interpretation is still confusing and controversial. This work presents a methodology to reliably identify the confounding factors which obscure the polarization effect in FeFETs. Careful observation of the Id\u2013Vg curves, as well as monitoring the Id\u2013Vg hysteresis and flat band voltage shift as a function of temperature and sweep frequency, identifies the dominant mechanism.

The devices exhibit sharp subthreshold slopes (as small as 45 mV/dec), well-saturated inversion-mode I DS -V DS  characteristics, and large on/off current ratios. The excellent device properties are attributed to: (i) the enhancement of tunneling through the NW FET S-B by the gate-channel-source coupling which results in sharp subthreshold slope, (ii) the clean, CMOS-compatible fabrication of NW FET leading to a high-quality dielectric/nanowire interface, and (iii) the good quality S/D barriers and low S/D series resistance associated with them. Previous studies have demonstrated high-performance nanowire and nanotube FETs with on/off current ratios \u00bf105 and subthreshold swings (SS's) \u00bf 100 mV/dec. The sharpness of the SS is a critical \u2026",

It is also observed that concurrent HCI-NBTI (hot-carrier injection-negative bias temperature instability) leads to worst case degradation for the I/O and HS SOI p-channel MOSFETs. I/O PMOS devices stressed under HCI conditions at room temperature show NBTI-like behavior at higher stress voltages and combined HCI-NBTI behavior at lower stress voltages. HS PMOS devices stressed under HCI conditions show a combined HCI and NBTI degradation behavior across the entire stress bias range. Both HS and I/O devices degrade more when HCI stressed with FB at high stress voltages; however the degradation becomes comparable to BC devices at lower stress voltages.",

            "Abstract": "One of the most serious technology roadblocks for SiC DMOSFETs is the significant occurrence of early failures in time-dependent-dielectric-breakdown testing. Conventional screening methods have proved ineffective, because the remaining population is still plagued with poor reliability. The traditional local thinning model for extrinsic (early) failures, which guides the screening through burn-in measures, simply does not work. The fact that improved cleanliness control in the fabrication process does little to reduce early failures also suggests that local thinning due to contamination is not the root cause. In this paper, we propose a new lucky defect model where bulk defects in the gate oxide, introduced during growth, are responsible for the early failures. We argue that a local increase in leakage current via trap-assisted tunneling leads to early oxide breakdown. This argument is supported with oxide breakdown \u2026",

The impact of stress on drain saturation current ( I dsat ), threshold voltage ( Vt ), transconductance peak ( gm ), and subthreshold swing (SS) is reported. For ESD stress applied on the drain, little degradation was observed until the device failed by drain-to-source filamentation. In contrast, for stress applied on the gate, positive ESD-like stress decreases  I dsat  and increases  Vt  of the nMOSFETs significantly, and the degradation increases with the effective gate oxide thickness. Different from positive bias temperature instability (PBTI) stress, the  Vt  shift depends on temperature rather weakly, which indicates a new dominant charge-trapping mechanism on the time scale of ESD events.

Finally, the narrow channel effects on device parameters, reliability and leakage current will be considered. These narrow channel effects will be found to depend on the SOI silicon film and buried oxide thickness and the transistor channel length, as well as on whether the body of the transistor is floating or grounded/tied to the source.

From leakage current measurements following ESD stress, it is concluded that the shorter (0.13 /spl mu/m) devices fail because of source/drain filamentation, whereas longer (0.3 /spl mu/m) devices with thin (22 /spl Aring/) oxide gate fail because of oxide breakdown. This conclusion is consistent with and supported by numerical simulations of the electric field. It is also supported by the observed effect of hot carrier stress on I/sub t2/. Hot carrier stress experiments additionally revealed that ESD stress can and does affect subsequent hot carrier degradation of the device.",
