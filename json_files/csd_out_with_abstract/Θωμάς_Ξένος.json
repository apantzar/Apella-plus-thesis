            "Abstract": "The possible adverse effects on human health of exposure to nonionizing electromagnetic fields have led international organizations and several countries to adopt exposure limits regarding public or occupational safety. To ensure compliance with these limits, specifically designed measurements with suitable instruments have to be performed. Since uncertainty is always present even when expensive instrumentation is employed, the final results from computations of the measured data deviate from the respective true values. The divergence depends on the instrumentation employed, the used methodology, or even the random effects, e.g., human factors or environmental conditions. In this paper, a method for evaluating total uncertainty when multiple narrow-band electromagnetic field measurements are performed is proposed. This is very common when exposure in residential areas is assessed.",

The network's quality and generality is assessed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves (AUC), which resulted to a mean value of about 0.86 to 0.90, depending on the observation time. In order to validate the ANN results and to evaluate any further improvement options of the proposed method, the problem was additionally treated using Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifiers, trained and tested with identical data sets for direct performance comparison with the ANN. Furthermore, time series prediction and the effect of surface wind to the presence of tropospheric ducts appearance are discussed.

            "Abstract": "An aperiodic reconfigurable microstrip antenna array is designed to serve as a DVB-T base station antenna operating in a single broadcasting channel. The antenna array is optimized at 698 MHz (center frequency of DVB-T channel 49) to concurrently achieve a particular radiation pattern shaping with high forward gain, main lobe tilting and null filling inside the service area, as well as low sidelobe level outside the service area, and low standing wave ratio at the inputs of all the array elements. To concurrently satisfy all the above requirements, both the geometry dimensions and the array feeding weights (amplitudes and phases) are optimized, thus leading to a complex multi-variable and multi-objective problem. The problem is solved by applying a recently developed particle swarm optimization (PSO) improved variant, called PSO with velocity mutation, in conjunction with the CST software package, which is employed by the PSOvm every time a full-wave analysis is required. Furthermore, all the optimization methods found in the CST environment are compared with the PSOvm. The results show that the PSOvm is capable of producing an antenna array geometry, which is closer to the predefined requirements than the geometries derived by the rest of the optimizers, in the least amount of computational time.

They are propagated in the earth-ionosphere wave-guide mode along great circle propagation paths. So, their propaga-tion is strongly affected by the ionosphere conditions. LF signals lie in 150 - 300 kHz frequency band. They are used for long way broadcasting by the few (this type of broadcasting is going into disuse) transmitters located in the world. These radio signals are characterized by the ground wave and the sky wave propagation modes [1]. The first generates a stable signal that propagates in the channel Earth-troposphere and is affected by the surface ground and troposphere condition. The second instead gives rise to a signal which varies greatly between day and night, and between summer and winter, and which propagates using the lower ionosphere as a reflector; its propagation is mainly affected by the ionosphere condi-tion, particularly in the zone located in the middle of the transmitter-receiver path. The propagation of the VLF/LF radio signals is affected by different factors such as the meteorological condition, the solar bursts and the geo-magnetic activity. At the same time, variations of some parameters in the ground, in the atmosphere and in the ionosphere occurring during the preparatory phase of earthquakes can produce disturbances in the above men-tioned signals.

            "Abstract": "The design and optimization of wideband log-periodic dipole arrays (LPDAs) are presented in this chapter. The LPDAs are expected to simultaneously satisfy several requirements inside a wide operating frequency range. In particular, the optimized LPDA has to provide standing wave ratio (SWR) below a predefined value, gain values as high as possible, gain flatness (GF) below a desired value, both side lobe level (SLL) and front-to-back ratio (FBR) below a desired value, and all these requirements must be satisfied at the same time inside the entire frequency range of operation. Since the design problem is nonlinear and inherently multiobjective, the simultaneous realization of all the above requirements can only be achieved by applying global optimization algorithms. These algorithms are usually based on evolutionary optimization methods and have been proved to be capable of solving complex nonlinear problems with great success. Such an evolutionary method with high potential in antenna design is presented in this chapter. The method is called invasive weed optimization (IWO) and is applied in conjunction with the method of moments (MoM) to optimize LPDAs under the above-mentioned requirements. The MoM is a well-known full-wave analysis method and is utilized here to extract the radiation characteristics of the LPDA required by the IWO algorithm. Several design cases are studied concerning the LPDA geometry and the operating bandwidth. The derived LPDA geometries exhibit a behavior close to the desired one and therefore are able to enhance the performance of a wireless network in practical applications.",

In this paper, the method of Hilbert\u2013Huang transform is applied on non-stationary and non-linear vibration signals obtained via velocity-meters from a mechanical system which contains a shaft rotating on roller bearings. Two time series were used. The first series are obtained at the positions of the roller bearings without using rubber mounting while the second ones are obtained at the same positions using rubber mounting. The experimental study and its results are presented, and finally the conclusions derived from the results are discussed.",

The LPDA optimization is performed under several requirements concerning the standing wave ratio, the forward gain, the gain flatness, the front-to-back ratio, and the sidelobe level, over a wide frequency range. The LPDA geometry that complies with the aforementioned requirements is suitable for efficient multimedia content delivery. The optimization process is accomplished by applying a recently introduced method called invasive weed optimization (IWO). The method has already been compared to other evolutionary methods and has shown superiority in solving complex nonlinear problems in telecommunications and electromagnetics.

The prospect that exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) can have a deleterious effect or any effect on cellular behaviour has been debated in scientific and journalistic circles for some years. The drive to determine whether EMFs were involved in cellular behavioural changes is critical since environmental proximity to high voltage power lines and electric stations or the routine use of household appliances and cellular phones is increasing exponentially. Support for a deleterious effect gained impetus with the report that children whose homes were close to power lines had a higher frequency of leukemia. If cell signalling is influenced by EMF exposure, it provides further impetus to determine whether EMF exposure can cause or alter the propensity to cancer or have other deleterious effects in cells.

In each iteration, the algorithm finds the direction of the peak of the greatest sidelobe, which is considered as direction of arrival (DoA) of a hypothetical interference signal, and the conventional beamformer is then employed to find proper antenna array weights that produce an extra null toward this direction.

These societies protect their cultural resources and preserve their heritage. To promote the use and preservation of historic buildings, attention must be paid when incorporating modern building service systems. These systems must be adapted to functional peculiarities and demands of the building elements. Winter heating and summer cooling of monumental building can be very demanding and energy consuming task. Consequently, the detailed calculation of their envelope is very important. Masonry buildings, tend to regulate the external temperature fluctuations they are subjected to, either by storing heat in their thermal mass or by offering it back to the interior, with a time lag depending on the thermal capacity of the building and characterized mainly by the overall mass of the masonry. This time lag may vary from a few hours when lightweight masonry is concerned to several days for masonry buildings of large mass. The scope of this work is to calculate the thermal capacity of Byzantine (334 \u0153 1453 AD) monuments in Greece and to show how their thermal capacity affects their internal temperature temporal profile. The analysis will be based on a typical 6th AD century Byzantine Church in Thessaloniki Greece, dedicated to the Holy Wisdom of God our Lord (Aghia Sophia).",

            "Abstract": " Ionospheric variability as a result of earthquake events is a confirmed phenomenon as published in various seismo-ionospheric coupling studies. Generally, ionospheric variations resulting from earthquake activity are much weaker than disturbances generated by different sources, e.g. geomagnetic storms. However, geomagnetic storm disturbances exhibit more global behaviour, whereas seismo-ionospheric variations occur only locally in an area that is specified by the magnitude of the earthquake. Cross-correlation coefficient analysis is a technique proposed some years ago, and ensures cancelation of geomagnetic storm variations of the ionospheric plasma, provided that the measurements are taken from stations with similar behaviour in these phenomena. In this paper we will use the aforementioned technique for analyzing data from ionospheric stations in Rome and Athens, and apply it to a series of earthquakes in Greece. Considering the local behaviour of the seismo-ionospheric variations, we expect that the Athens station, which happens to be inside the area affected by the earthquake, will accurately capture the disturbances. Due to its distance from the activity, we also do not expect the Rome station measurements to be affected by the seismic events in Greece. In addition, due to the fact that ionospheric plasma parameters exhibit non-stationary and nonlinear behaviour, we propose a novel signal processing technique known as the Hilbert-Huang transform in order to denoise the data before we calculate the cross-correlation coefficient of the two signals. Results from our analysis are in accordance with previously-conducted \u2026",

The data were analyzed using various interpolation procedures, i.e. in a day-by-day manner for temperature and relative humidity, to transform the data according to a reference height common for the whole dataset and finally for the refractivity N with respect to time, using piece-wise hermite interpolation polynomials for the low and medium altitudes and linear interpolation factors for the high altitudes. Since refractivity varies with time and height, two height independent basic parameters were computed and analyzed: the refractivity at station height N0 and scale height Hs. These parameters can be used to calculate the refractivity profile. Using statistical tools as the moving average, the \u00df0 parameter and the monthly mean values, together with the corresponding standard deviations, useful results were obtained for the variations of the refractivity with respect to observation hour, height, season, month, day and level.",

The adoption of the proposed scheme enables for increasing the reliability in services provision to the mobile users by guaranteeing sufficient resources for the mobile application execution. More specifically, this chapter describes the process to improve the energy consumption of the mobile devices through the exploitation of a social-oriented model and a cooperative partial process offloading scheme. This research approach exploits social centrality, as the connectivity model for the resource offloading, among the interconnected mobile devices to increase the energy usage efficiency, the mobile nodes availability, as well as the process of execution reliability.

            "Abstract": "The design and optimization of wideband log-periodic dipole arrays (LPDAs) are presented in this chapter. The LPDAs are expected to simultaneously satisfy several requirements inside a wide operating frequency range. In particular, the optimized LPDA has to provide standing wave ratio (SWR) below a predefined value, gain values as high as possible, gain flatness (GF) below a desired value, both side lobe level (SLL) and front-to-back ratio (FBR) below a desired value, and all these requirements must be satisfied at the same time inside the entire frequency range of operation. Since the design problem is nonlinear and inherently multiobjective, the simultaneous realization of all the above requirements can only be achieved by applying global optimization algorithms. These algorithms are usually based on evolutionary optimization methods and have been proved to be capable of solving complex nonlinear problems with great success. Such an evolutionary method with high potential in antenna design is presented in this chapter. The method is called invasive weed optimization (IWO) and is applied in conjunction with the method of moments (MoM) to optimize LPDAs under the above-mentioned requirements. The MoM is a well-known full-wave analysis method and is utilized here to extract the radiation characteristics of the LPDA required by the IWO algorithm. Several design cases are studied concerning the LPDA geometry and the operating bandwidth. The derived LPDA geometries exhibit a behavior close to the desired one and therefore are able to enhance the performance of a wireless network in practical applications.2.1 \u2026",

A total of 496 fertilised chicken eggs were used in this study; 380 of diem as experimental material and 116 as controls. The experimental eggs were exposed to a non-thermal power density of 8.8 uW/cm2 (SAR= 1.16 mW/Kg) radiation at 9.152 GHz, from the 3rd to the 10th day of incubation, continuously. 172 eggs were irradiated by CW whereas 208 eggs by PW. The controls were sham-exposed. The foetuses of the experimental eggs and of the controls were macro-and microscopically examined at the end of their incubation. In 62.78% of CW-irradiated, 47.12% of PWirradiated and only in 3.44% of the sham-exposed fetuses abnormalities (development retardation and severe malformations) and embryonic and foetal deaths (embryonic and foetal) were observed. The differences in the effects caused by CW and PW irradiation were statistically evaluated. These results support the aspect that very low power density microwaves applied to the chicken foetuses, in ovo during organogenesis, may cause abnormal development.",

The signals analysed were from 4 VLF and 6 LF European transmitters. This seismic event produced precursory ionospheric disturbances, identified as spectral distortion, before its occurrence, providing a distinct pattern. Although the basis of the ionosphere interaction with seismic phenomena has been well documented in previous studies, the close proximity of the receiver to the seismic event provides a new perspective to this study. The received signals have undergone normalisation and then they have been processed by the application of the Zhao-Atlas-Marks Distribution (ZAMD).

The adaptive nature of EMD allows for removing the geophysical noise from the foF2 signals, and then to calculate the correlation coefficient between them. According to the cross correlation coefficient theory, we expect the stations which located inside the earthquake preparation area, as evaluated using Dobrovolsky equation, to capture the ionospheric disturbances generated by the seismic event. On the other hand the stations outside of this area are expected to remain unaffected. The results of our study are in accordance with the theoretical model, evidencing ionospheric modification prior to L'Aquila earthquake in a certain area around the epicenter. However, it was found that the selection of stations at the limits of the theoretically estimated earthquake preparation area is not the best choice when the cross correlation method is applied, since the modification of the ionosphere over these stations may not be enough for the ionospheric precursors to appear. Our experimental results also show that when a seismic event constitutes the main shock after a series of pre-seismic activity, precursors may appear as early as 22 days prior to the event.",

This formulation enables a robust computational modeling of obstacles of complex shape in a fully automated way.

            "Abstract": "Roller bearings are important elements of high performance mechanical systems, as they support the rotating parts and they reduce the contact friction. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously monitor their performance using non-destructive diagnostic methods. These methods interrogate data signals acquired during the machines operation. In this paper, the method of Hilbert\u2013Huang transform was applied on non-stationary and non-linear vibration signals obtained via accelerometers from a mechanical system which contains a shaft rotating on Roller bearings. Two series of signals were used. The first series obtained from healthy bearings. The second series, obtained from bearings with seeded defects. The experimental study and its results are presented, as well as the conclusions drawn from the results.",

In 2011 the network for LF signals was formed by six receivers located two in Italy and one in Greece, Portugal, Romania, and Turkey. The LF radio data collected during about two years have been analysed. Each radio signal has been split in day-time and night-time data; then, the earthquakes with M\u2265 5.0, occurred in the same period, located in a 300 km radius around each receiver/transmitter and within the 5th Fresnel zone related to each transmitter-receiver path, have been selected. In this study we adopt the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to study the radio signal anomalies possibly related to earthquake activity. A detailed comparison with similar studies that use wavelet analysis is done \u2026",

On the other hand, narrowband measurements using appropriate antennas and spectrum analyzers, make determinable the power level from every single transmitter. However, in this case, and given that the antennas used are directional and linearly polarized, a large number of measurements has to be taken in order to obtain the total electric field strength and consequently to check for compliance with the legislation limits. In this work a method is presented for determining: the total electric field from a particular direction to a specific point of a measurement location (eg from a mobile base station mast), the angle of maximum incident electric field and the total exposure quotient from the sources laying at that particular direction in a given frequency band.",

The LPDA is required to provide low standing wave ratio as well as high-gain radiation pattern with sufficient gain flatness over the entire passband, and concurrently achieve low gain for frequencies above 800 MHz to reject LTE800 signals and thus improve the reception quality in the DVB-T band. All the above requirements are better satisfied by applying a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) variant, called PSO with velocity mutation (PSOvm). PSOvm induces mutation on the velocities of those particles, which are unable to improve their fitness. As shown in this paper, PSOvm comes closer to the above requirements compared to four well-known optimization methods and outperforms the traditional LPDA design method proposed by Carrel.

International organisations and countries have adopted guides and legislation for the public safety. They include reference levels (RLs) regarding field strength electromagnetic quantities. To check for RLs compliance in an environment with multiple transmitters of various types, analytical simulation models may be implemented provided that all the necessary information are available. Since this is not generally the case in the most practical situations, on-site measurements have to be performed. The necessary equipment for measurements of this type usually includes broadband field metres suitable to measure the field strength over the whole bandwidth of the field sensor used. These \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Machinery diagnostics is an important research area that requires inter-disciplinary expertise. Typically, machines operate in complicated, uncertain and varying environments. A good diagnostic methodology is expected to work accurately in such tough conditions. Early and accurate fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings is very important for improving mechanical system reliability and performance. Signals, even from experimental setups, let alone from industrial machinery monitoring and control, can be interfered by environmental noise. A worst-case condition is impulsive noise, caused by external stimulations, eg hydraulic hummers; it can cause very strong and complicated interferences and it can lead to erroneous conclusion concerning the performance of the ball bearing. On the other hand, avoiding external stimulations by employing optimized machinery mounting, although vital, is not always possible in an industrial environment. The aim of this project is to analyze and assess the mounting of the experimental device in order to estimate non-linear signal distortions due to external impulse stimulations. Therefore, two signal processing methods are employed, the Zhao Atlas Marks time-frequency Distribution (ZAMD) and the Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) in order to analyze non-stationary signals obtained from a ball bearing testing setup. Comparative results are provided by applying the two methods on vibration signals derived by the testing setup under an external stimulation.",

            "Abstract": "One of the most common and popular practices on measuring the non-ionising electric and/or magnetic field strength employs field meters and the appropriate electric and/or magnetic field strength sensors. These measurements have to meet several requirements proposed by specific guidelines or standards. On the other hand, performing non-ionising exposure assessment using real measurement data can be a very difficult task due to instrumentation limits and uncertainties. In addition, each measuring technique, practice and recommendation has its own drawbacks. In this paper, a methodology for estimating the overall uncertainty for such measurements, including uncertainty estimation of spatial average values of electric or magnetic field strengths, is proposed. Estimating and reporting measurement uncertainty are of great importance, especially when the measured values are very close to the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In 2008, a radio receiver that works in very low frequency (VLF; 20-60 kHz) and LF (150-300 kHz) bands was developed by an Italian factory. The receiver can monitor 10 frequencies distributed in these bands, with the measurement for each of them of the electric field intensity. Since 2009, to date, six of these radio receivers have been installed throughout Europe to establish a \u2018European VLF/LF Network\u2019. At present, two of these are into operation in Italy, and the remaining four are located in Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Romania. For the present study, the LF radio data collected over about two years were analysed. At first, the day-time data and the night-time data were separated for each radio signal. Taking into account that the LF signals are characterized by ground-wave and sky-wave propagation modes, the day-time data are related to the ground wave and the night-time data to the sky wave. In this framework, the effects of solar activity and storm activity were defined in the different trends. Then, the earthquakes with M \u22655.0 that occurred over the same period were selected, as those located in a 300-km radius around each receiver/transmitter and within the 5th Fresnel zone related to each transmitter-receiver path. Where possible, the wavelet analysis was applied on the time series of the radio signal intensity, and some anomalies related to previous earthquakes were revealed. Except for some doubt in one case, success appears to have been obtained in all of the cases related to the 300 km circles in for the ground waves and the sky waves. For the Fresnel cases, success in two cases and one failure were seen in analysing the sky \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A new full-wave Parabolic---Integral Equation Method (PE-IEM) for the simulation of wave propagation in realistic, highly complex indoor communication environments is proposed, together with an extensive validation via measurements. The method is based on a wide-angle parabolic equation, further enhanced by an integral equation correction and is capable of providing good approximations of the electromagnetic fields and the received power, incorp orating all fundamental propagation mechanisms in a single simulation. For a rigorous validation, it has been applied in a complex twelve-room office space and compared with measurements at the two different frequencies of 1 GHz and 2.5 GHz. The accuracy of the approximation is within reasonably expected margins, while the method retains all the advantages of full wave methods and it also has moderate requirements of computational resources.",

For this purpose hourly daily TEC data from the ionospheric station of Florence and from the period 1979-1982 and 1989-1991 are used. The disturbed days encountered in this period as well as the days before them are analyzed for several of their parameters ie duration, intensity of the phenomenon, ratio of the days between developing and recessing of disturbance etc. In several cases a high correlation between the above parameters is found. In 13 out of 79 cases the ratio of the days between developing and recessing of the disturbance is found above 1 while in 47 cases this ratio is found below 1. In 19 cases the number of developing days and the number of recessing days are equal. The results are grouped by month and by year. The correlation coefficient between the so calculated mean values has taken very high values.",

            "Abstract": "The present study introduces the implementation of antenna array beamforming based on a new neural network (NN) structure. The NN comprises two hidden layers, which use different interconnectivity patterns. The first one is divided in sublayers, which are equal in number to the inputs of the NN. Each sublayer communicates only with the respective input but is fully interconnected with the second hidden layer. The NN training is performed by using data sets derived by a well-known beamforming technique called minimum variance distortionless response. The trained NN is capable of serving as adaptive beamformer that makes a linear antenna array steer the main lobe towards a desired signal and place nulls towards respective interference signals in the presence of additive zero-mean Gaussian noise. The performance of the trained NN is tested by estimating the mean absolute deviation of main lobe and \u2026",

The purpose is to find numerical solutions of the one-dimensional wave equation and study the way that the wave propagates through the ionosphere. The ionospheric medium at heights between 65 to 400 Km, is modeled by its refractive index profile, which is calculated using electron density data from the International Reference Ionosphere model (IRI-95). The frequencies used in this work, in order to illustrate the model are below and above MUF and two slightly different ionospheric profiles have been used in order to evaluate the model response with small variations of the medium characteristics.",

            "Abstract": "A near-optimal base-station antenna array synthesis suitable for broadcasting applications is presented. The array is required to provide a high-gain radiation pattern with a main lobe slightly tilted from the horizontal plane and null filling inside an angular sector under the main lobe. To satisfy the above requirements, a novel invasive weed optimization (IWO) variant called Taguchi initialized IWO (TI-IWO) is proposed in this paper. In TI-IWO, the Taguchi's optimization method is employed to initialize effectively the positions of the weeds used by the IWO method. In this way, the fitness function starts from lower values and, thus, the TI-IWO method finds better near-optimal solutions than the conventional IWO method. The proposed method has been applied to linear arrays. Due to its easy implementation in practice, a uniform-amplitude excitation distribution is considered to be applied on the array elements.

            "Abstract": "Ball bearings are perhaps the most widely used machine elements and a lot of important and expensive mechanic systems are based on them. Thus, it is necessary to establish a method to detect faults in order to keep the systems running properly. Fault identification of rolling element bearings employing condition monitoring techniques has been the subject of extensive research for the last two decades. Vibration signals of machines provide the dynamic information of the machine condition taking into account the fact that whenever the rolling element encounters a defect, a short duration impulse is generated. These signals are very useful for fault diagnosis. In this paper, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is initially employed for an first comparison between healthy and defective bearings. Then, the main signal analysis is performed using the Wavelet Transform Method (WTM) which proves very effective in problems of this type.",
