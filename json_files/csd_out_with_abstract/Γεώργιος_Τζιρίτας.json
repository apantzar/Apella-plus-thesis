            "Abstract": "We present a fully-automatic fast method for heart segmentation in pediatric cardiac MRI. The segmentation algorithm is a two step process. In the first step a 3-D Markov random field (MRF) model is assumed for labeling the MR images into four intensity classes, the two of them corresponding to the blood pool areas. The intensity distribution of the four classes is estimated by an unsupervised method. In the second step the resulting regions are, maybe further segmented and, classified in the three main categories: blood pool, myocardium and background. The classification is obtained by tracking the cardiac substructures that can be clearly distinguished in detected specific slices. The whole process is driven by the data analysis and by generic models on 2-D regions and 3-D volumes, without a deformation model, which eventually might be fitted. The algorithm is evaluated on the HSVMR 2016 data set \u2026",

The approximation nodes of GPA can be selected anywhere on the original polygonal curve, while the \u201cclassical\u201d (usually used) polygonal approximation problem (PA) demands the vertices to be a subset of the original polygon vertices. Although the proposed algorithm does not guarantee global minimum distortion, in many cases almost optimal solutions are achieved. Moreover, it is very flexible on changes of error criteria and on curve dimension yielding an alternative and in many cases approximations with lower error (by relaxing the simplification constraint) than the optimal PA methods with about the same computation cost.",

Motion is restricted along a smooth predefined path and the input to the system is a sparse set of stereoscopic views at certain points (key-positions) along that path (one view per position). An approximate local 3D model is constructed from each view, capable of capturing photometric and geometric properties of the scene only locally. Then during the rendering process, a continuous morphing (both photometric & geometric) takes place between successive local 3D models, using what we call a \"morphable 3D-model\". The morphing proceeds in a physically-valid way. For this reason, a wide-baseline image matching technique is proposed, handling cases where the wide baseline between the two images is mainly due to a looming of the camera.

This approach is able to model elaborate and varying architectural styles, using a tree representation of variable depth and complexity. Towards reconstruction, the parameters of the rules are optimized using image-based and architectural costs. This is done through an efficient MRF formulation based on the shape grammar itself. The resulting framework can produce precise 3D models from single views, can deal with lack of texture and the presence of occlusions and specular reflections, while maintaining the ability to cope with very complex architectural styles.

First, motion-based segmentation is obtained through an initial application of a region growing algorithm. The partition map is sequentially tracked from frame to frame using motion compensation and location prediction. The segmentation map is obtained by the region growing algorithm.

Robust shape and motion features are extracted from human detection and tracking. The features are combined within the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) framework for two levels of recognition. The TBM-based modelling of the fusion process allows to take into account imprecision, uncertainty and conflict inherent to the features. First, in a coarse step, actions are roughly recognized. Then, in a fine step, an action sequence recognition method is used to discriminate activities. Belief on actions are made smooth by a Temporal Credal Filter and action sequences, i.e. activities, are recognized using a state machine, called belief scheduler, based on TBM. The belief scheduler is also exploited for feedback information extraction in order to improve tracking results. The system is tested on real videos of athletics meetings to recognize four types of actions (running, jumping, falling and standing) and four types of activities (high jump, pole vault, triple jump and long jump). Results on actions, activities and feedback demonstrate the relevance of the proposed features and as well the efficiency of the proposed recognition approach based on TBM.",

            "Abstract": "This paper introduces a new rigorous theoretical framework to address discrete MRF-based optimization in computer vision. Such a framework exploits the powerful technique of Dual Decomposition. It is based on a projected subgradient scheme that attempts to solve an MRF optimization problem by first decomposing it into a set of appropriately chosen subproblems, and then combining their solutions in a principled way. In order to determine the limits of this method, we analyze the conditions that these subproblems have to satisfy and demonstrate the extreme generality and flexibility of such an approach. We thus show that by appropriately choosing what subproblems to use, one can design novel and very powerful MRF optimization algorithms. For instance, in this manner we are able to derive algorithms that: 1) generalize and extend state-of-the-art message-passing methods, 2) optimize very tight LP \u2026",

Such a term is defined in the spatiotemporal domain, where the ventricular wall motion is introduced to account for correspondences between the consecutive segmentation maps. The estimation of the deformations is done through a continuous deformation field (FFD) where the displacements of the control points are determined using discrete labeling approach. Principles from linear programming and in particular the Primal/Dual Schema is used to recover the optimal solution in both spaces.

Its efficiency is a result of the fact that Fast-PD exploits information coming not only from the original MRF problem, but also from a dual problem. Furthermore, besides static MRFs, it can also be used for boosting the performance of dynamic MRFs, i.e. MRFs varying over time. On top of that, Fast-PD makes no compromise about the optimality of its solutions: it can compute exactly the same answer as a-expansion, but, unlike that method, it can also guarantee an almost optimal solution for a much wider class of NP-hard MRF problems.

A level set formulation is used to model the boundaries of the image regions and a new Multilabel Fast Marching is introduced for the evolution of the region contours toward the segmentation result. Statistical tests are performed to yield an initial estimate of high-confidence subsets of the image regions. Furthermore, the velocities for the propagation of the region contours are defined in accordance with the a posteriori probability of the respective regions, leading to the Bayesian Level Set methodology described in this paper. Typical segmentation problems are considered and experimental results are given to illustrate the robustness of the method against noise and its performance in precise region boundary localization.",

At first we extract a region where the whole heart is situated, using a new, time-based approach. Then, the segmentation in LV, myocardium and right ventricle (RV) is obtained for a slice in a basal ED slice where both cavities are well distinguished. The extracted regions are tracked for the whole slice sequence backwards and forwards in ED. In all cases the segmentation is based on MRF optimization in four classes, two for the blood areas, and one for the myocardium and the background. Subsequently the segmentation in the ES images is based on the result of ED segmentation. As the epicardium is not well delineated, a smoothing process based on spline curves is used for obtaining the final result. We consider that, with an unsupervised method, we have obtained good results for LV and satisfactory for \u2026",

In such a context, the registration problem is formulated using a discrete Markov random field objective function. First, towards dimensionality reduction on the variables we assume that the dense deformation field can be expressed using a small number of control points (registration grid) and an interpolation strategy. Then, the registration cost is expressed using a discrete sum over image costs (using an arbitrary similarity measure) projected on the control points, and a smoothness term that penalizes local deviations on the deformation field according to a neighborhood system on the grid. Towards a discrete approach, the search space is quantized resulting in a fully discrete model. In order to account for large deformations and produce results on a high \u2026",

To this end, based just on a sparse set of real stereoscopic views from the scene, a set of morphable 3D-mosaics is automatically constructed first, and then, during rendering, a continuous morphing between those 3D-mosaics that are nearby to the current viewpoint is taking place. The morphing is both photometric, as well as geometric, while we also ensure that it proceeds in a physically valid manner, thus remaining transparent to the user. The effectiveness of our framework has been demonstrated in the 3D visual reconstruction of the Samaria Gorge in Crete, which is one of the largest and most beautiful gorges in Europe.",

Such a task is reformulated using a discrete set of deformations and segmentation becomes equivalent to finding the set of local deformations which optimally match the model to the image. We evaluate our method on 56 MRI data sets (28 used for the model and 28 used for evaluation) and obtain a fully automatic segmentation of patella cartilage volume with an overlap ratio of 0.84 with a sensitivity and specificity of 94.06% and 99.92%, respectively.",

We first formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem. This leads to an efficient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well defined LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm\u2019s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efficient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.",
