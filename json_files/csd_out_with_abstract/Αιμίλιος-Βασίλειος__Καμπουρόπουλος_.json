Traditional AI symbolic processing methods, however, can be used effectively for modelling particular analytic and creative aspects of musical structure. In this paper three specific problems of music structure, namely, segmentation and streaming, pattern extraction, harmonic abstraction and generation, will be addressed with a view to highlighting the importance of problem definitions, music representation and multi-parametric hierarchical cognitively-inspired processing methodologies. Existing proof-of-concept models are used as a basis for a theoretical discussion.",

A single \u2018voice\u2019may consist of more than one synchronous notes that are perceived as belonging to the same auditory stream. The algorithm was initially tested against a handful of musical works that were carefully selected so as to contain a steady number of streams (contrapuntal voices or melody with accompaniment). The initial algorithm was successful on this small dataset, but was proven to run into serious problems in cases were the number of streams/voices changed during the course of a musical work. A new version of the algorithm has been developed that attempts to solve this problem; the new version, additionally, includes an improved mechanism for context-dependent breaking of chords and for keeping streams homogeneous. The new algorithm performs equally well on the old dataset, but gives much better results on the new larger and more diverse dataset.",

            "Abstract": "Visual associations with auditory stimuli have been the subject of numerous studies. Colour, shape, size, and several other parameters have been linked to musical elements like timbre and pitch. In this paper we aim to examine the relationship between harmonisations with varying degrees of dissonance and visual roughness. Based on past research in which high sensory dissonance was associated with angular shapes, we argued that non-tonal and highly dissonant harmonisations will be associated with angular and rough images, while more consonant stimuli will be associated with images of low visual roughness. A fixed melody was harmonised in 7 different styles, including highly tonal, non-tonal, and random variations. Through a listening task, musically trained participants rated the stimuli in terms of enjoyment, familiarity, and matched them to images of variable roughness. The overall consonance of the stimuli was calculated using two distinct models (Wang et al., 2013; Harrison & Pearce, 2020) and a variant of the aggregate dyadic consonance index (Huron, 1994). Our results demonstrate that dissonance, as calculated by all models, was highly correlated with visual roughness, and enjoyment and familiarity followed expected patterns compared to tonal and non-tonal stimuli. In addition to sensory dissonance, however, it appears that other factors, such as the typicality of chord progressions and the sense of tonality may also influence this cross-modal interaction.",

In this paper, we focus on conceptual blending in the domain of musical harmony and present primarily computational examples in the following harmonic domains: chord-level blending, chord sequence blending, scale blending, harmonic structure level blending, melody-harmony level blending. Structural blending can be used not only for music analysis and music understanding, but more so it may form the basis for creative/generative music systems; processes of conceptual blending can be incorporated in computational compositional systems, facilitating the creation of original music structures/pieces/styles and contributing to a richer comprehension/experience of music.",

            "Abstract": "Theories of western metrical structure commonly hypothesize an isochronous beat level (tactus) upon which the concept of metre is built. This assumption is challenged by this study. It is proposed that time at the tactus level may be measured by isochronous or asymmetric temporal \u2018scales\u2019 depending on the musical data (just like asymmetric pitch scales are adequate for organizing tonal pitch space). This study examines the performance of beat tracking systems on music that features asymmetric rhythms (eg 5/8, 7/8) and proposes potential improvement of theoretical and practical aspects relating to beat perception that can allow the construction of more general idiom-independent beat trackers. The tactus of asymmetric/complex musical rhythms is non-isochronous; for instance, a 7/8 song is often counted/taped/danced at a level 3+ 2+ 2 (not at a lower or higher level). Two state-of-the-art beat-tracking systems (Dixon 2007; Davies & Plumbley 2007) and a beat/tempo induction system (Pikrakis et al. 2004) are tested on a number of traditional Greek (dance) songs that feature asymmetric rhythms. The beat output of the algorithms is measured against the corresponding beat structures indicated by expert musicians, and the algorithms are compared to each other. As expected, the beat-trackers cannot cope well with asymmetric rhythms. The metre/tempo induction system performs better in processing asymmetric rhythms; it does not always find the correct beat level but this level exists implicitly in the model (in between sub-and super-beat levels).",

            "Abstract": "Musicians make use of the notion of shape in relation to music performance, teaching, composition, improvisation; they often think and talk about the shape of a musical phrase or melody, the shape of a single sound event, the shape of a longer section or piece, the expressive shaping of music during performance. But how can a primarily spatial term such as shape (meaning \u201cthe external form, contour, or outline of someone or something\u201d according to the Oxford dictionary), be applied in the temporal domain of music? How can one talk of shape in regards to a temporally emitted sequence of sound events?Many researchers have studied the correspondence between space and time in human conceptualisation, and more specifically the use of spatial metaphors in temporal reasoning [1, 2]. Johnson and Larson [3] discuss the relation between music motion and space, and, more specifically, the employment of two basic spatialisation metaphors of time in the conceptualisation of musical time and motion. Frequency/pitch is also commonly conceptualised in terms of spatial metaphors, namely along the high/low spatial axis [4, 5]. The combination of the x-axis spatial representation of time with an orthogonal high/low pitch y-axis gives rise to the most common 2D representation of music (standard score notation, piano-roll notation, spectrogram, various graphic scores)\u2013see [6] for a cross-cultural study on visual representation schemes of melodic shape. The correspondence between time and space is so strong that it is difficult to conceptualise music without thinking about shape or pattern.",

Among the most successful are methodologies that incorporate probabilistic mechanisms and statistical learning, since they have the ability to generate harmonies that statistically adhere to the harmonic characteristics of the idiom that the training pieces belong to. The current paper discusses the utilization of a well\u2013studied probabilistic methodology, the hidden Markov model (HMM), in combination with additional constraints that incorporate intermediate fixed\u2013chord constraints. This work is motivated by the fact that some parts of a phrase (like the cadence) or a piece (eg points of modulation, peaks of tension, intermediate cadences etc.) are characteristic about the phrase\u2019s or piece\u2019s idiomatic identity. The presented methodology allows to define and isolate such important parts/functions and include them as constraints in a probabilistic harmonization methodology. To this end, the constrained HMM (CHMM) is developed, harnessed with the novel general chord type (GCT) representation, while the study focuses on examples that highlight the diversity that constraints introduce in harmonizations.",

            "Abstract": "Chords are commonly represented, at a low level, as absolute pitches (or pitch classes) or, at a higher level, as chords types within a given tonal/harmonic context (eg roman numeral analysis). The former is too elementary, whereas, the latter, requires sophisticated harmonic analysis. Is it possible to represent chord transitions at an intermediate level that is transposition-invariant and idiom-independent (analogous to pitch intervals that represent transitions between notes)? In this paper, a novel chord transition representation is proposed. A harmonic transition between two chords can be represented by a Directed Interval Class (DIC) vector. The proposed 12-dimensional vector encodes the number of occurrence of all directional interval classes (from 0 to 6 including+/-for direction) between all the pairs of notes of two successive chords. Apart from octave equivalence and interval inversion equivalence, this representation preserves directionality of intervals (up or down). Interesting properties of this representation include: easy to compute, independent of root finding, independent of key finding, incorporates voice leading qualities, preserves chord transition asymmetry (eg different vector for I\u2192 V and V\u2192 I), transposition invariant, independent of chord type, applicable to tonal/post-tonal/atonal music, and, in most instances, constituent chords from a chord transition can be uniquely derived from a DIC vector. DIC vectors can be organised in different categories depending on their content, and distance between vectors can be used to calculate harmonic similarity between different music passages.

            "Abstract": "In computational creativity, new concepts can be invented through conceptual blending of two independent conceptual spaces. In music, conceptual blending has been primarily used for analysing relations between musical and extra-musical elements in composed music rather than generating new music. This paper presents a probabilistic melodic harmonisation assistant that employs conceptual blending to combine learned, potentially diverse, harmonic idioms and generate new harmonic spaces that can be used to harmonise melodies given by the user. The key feature of this system is the application of creative conceptual blending to the most common chord transitions (pairs of consecutive chords) of two initial harmonic idioms. The proposed methodology integrates newly created blended chords and transitions in a compound probabilistic harmonic space, that preserves combined characteristics from both \u2026",

It is hypothesised that listeners prefer beat sequences that are smoother than beat tracks that are fully aligned with the actual onsets of performed notes. In order to examine this hypothesis, an experiment was designed whereby six different smoothed beat tracks generated are rated by subjects in relation to how well they correspond to a number of performed piano excerpts. It is shown that there is a preference of listeners for beat sequences that are slightly smoother than the onset times of the corresponding musical notes. This outcome was strongly supported by the results obtained from the group of trained musicians whereas it seems to have no bearing for the group of non-musicians.",

            "Abstract": "CHAMELEON is a computational melodic harmonisation assistant. It can harmonise a given melody according to a number of independent harmonic idioms or blends between idioms based on principles of conceptual blending theory. Thus, the system is capable of offering a wealth of possible solutions and viewpoints for melodic harmonisation. This study investigates how human creativity may be influenced by the use of CHAMELEON in a melodic harmonisation task. Professional and novice music composers participated in an experiment where they were asked to harmonise two similar melodies under two different conditions: one with and one without computational support. A control group harmonised both melodies without computational assistance. The influence of the system was examined both behaviourally, by comparing metrics of user-experience, and in terms of the properties of the artifacts (i.e., pitch class distribution and number of chord types characterising each harmonisation) that were created between the two experimental conditions. Results suggest that appreciation of the system was expertise-dependent (i.e., novices appreciated the computational support more than professionals). At the same time, users seemed to adopt more explorative strategies as a result of interaction with CHAMELEON based on the fact that the harmonisations created this way were more complex, diverse and unexpected in comparison to the ones of the control group.",

An assumption made in most models is that a preferred beat track should contain as few empty positions as possible, that is, beats on which no note is played, as in cases of syncopation or rests. A related underlying assumption is that musical events may appear only on or off the beat. However, a musical event may both correspond to a beat but at the same time not coincide precisely with the beat. That is, a nominally on-beat \u2026",

VISA3 builds upon its previous editions by introduction of new characteristics that adhere to previously unused general perceptual principles, address assignment errors that accumulate affecting the precision and tackle more generic musical content. Moreover, a new small dataset with human-expert ground-truth quantised symbolic data annotation is utilised. Experimental results indicate the significant performance amelioration the proposed algorithm achieves in relation to its predecessors. The increase in precision is evident for both the dataset of the previous editions as well as for a new dataset that includes musical content with characteristics such that of non-parallel motion that are common and have not yet been examined.",

This International Workshop brings together researchers from the fields of ethnomusicology, musicology and music information retrieval (MIR). It provides a forum that encourages sharing of ideas, needs, research methods and discoveries, among ethnomusicologists, musicians, librarians, students, museum curators, computer science experts and music information retrieval researchers. The aim is to foster cross-disciplinary collaborative networks and the development of new interdisciplinary tools and techniques that promote an enriched understanding of traditional musics and the preservation/dissemination of world musical cultural heritage. We believe that the discussions we had during this workshop were diverse and encouraging, also thanks to the Analytic Approaches to World Music Conference (AAWM) that was hold at the same venue in parallel to the FMA. We see that the year-long effort to continue the FMA resulted in a highly interdisciplinary community between Humanities and Sciences, and we hope to see a continuation of this throughout the next years. We would like to thank the local team in Thessaloniki, all students and administrative staff who helped us. We would like to thank Emmanouil Benetos for the keynote talk that built bridges to the AAWM community. We would like to thank the musicians who created a great atmosphere during the evenings.

The approach is demonstrated with several examples where jazz cadences are invented by blending chords in cadences from earlier idioms, and where novel chord progressions are generated by inventing transition chords.",

Probabilistic approaches to melodic harmonisation utilise statistical information derived from a training dataset to harmonise a melody.

The proposed bass voice leading (BVL) probabilistic model is part of ongoing work, it is based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) and it determines the bass voice contour by observing the contour of the melodic line. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BVL method indeed efficiently captures (in a statistical sense) the characteristic BVL features of the examined musical idioms.",

This representation allows the encoding of chord transitions at a level higher that individual notes that is transposition-invariant and idiom-independent (analogous to pitch intervals that represent transitions between notes). A harmonic transition between two chords is represented by a Directed Interval Class (DIC) vector. The proposed 12-dimensional vector encodes the number of occurrence of all directional interval classes (from 0 to 6 including+/-for direction) between all the pairs of notes of two successive chords. Apart from octave equivalence and interval inversion equivalence, this representation preserves directionality of intervals (up or down).A small database is constructed comprising of chord sequences derived from diverse music idioms/styles (tonal music, different traditional harmonic idioms, 20th century nontonal harmonic idioms). The proposed DIC representation is evaluated on a harmonic recognition task, ie we examine the accuracy of recognition of harmonic queries in this database. The results of the algorithm are judged by human music analysis experts.",

CHAMELEON can offer a variety of solutions in a melodic harmonisation task by harmonising according to a number of idioms and/or their blends. Comparison between the produced harmonisations by the participants and their selection of favourite CHAMELEON examples indicated that the majority of them were directly influenced by the solutions offered by the system. Three strategies by which participants exploited CHAMELEON were identified: borrowing of full measures or long chord sequences, borrowing of one or more single chords and finally, adoption of general concepts existing in the CHAMELEON examples. We argue that these findings indicate that the system has the potential to stimulate and promote creative thinking.",

This paper provides an overview of the wide computational methodological spectrum that is being developed towards building an automatic melodic harmonization system that employs conceptual blending, yielding harmonizations that inherit characteristics from multiple idioms. Examples of conceptual blending in harmony are presented that exhibit the effectiveness of the developed model in inventing novel harmonic concepts. These examples discuss the invention of well-known jazz cadences through blending the underlying concepts of classical music cadences, as well as the construction of larger chord sequences. Furthermore, examples of a conceptual blending interpretation in human compositions that motivated the goals of the system\u2019s design are given. Finally, conceptual blending between harmonic and non-harmonic domains is discussed, offering tools that allow for intuitive human intervention in the harmonization process.",

This chapter, initially, addresses musicological, perceptual and computational aspects of the harmonic musical surface. Then, two novel general chord representations are presented: the first, the General Chord Type (GCT) representation, is inspired by the standard Roman numeral chord type labelling, but is more general and flexible so as to be applicable to any idiom; the second, the Directed Interval Class (DIC) vector, captures the intervallic content of a transition between two chords in a transposition-invariant idiom-independent manner. Musical examples and preliminary evaluations of both encoding schemes are given, illustrating their potential to form a basis for harmonic \u2026",

Then, formal working definitions are proposed that inextricably bind these concepts together. These definitions readily lend themselves to the development of a formal model for clustering - the Unscramble algorithm - which, given a set of objects and an initial set of properties, generates a range of plausible categorizations for a given context. Finally, as a test case, the clustering algorithm is used to organize a number of melodic segments, taken from a monophonic piece by J. S. Bach, into motivic categories; the algorithm also determines a prototype for each cluster and uses these prototypical descriptions for membership prediction tasks. The results of the computational system are compared with the empirical results obtained for the same \u2026",

The specific task under investigation is pitch spelling, that is, how traditional score notation can be derived from a simple unstructured 12-tone representation (e.g., pitch-class set or MIDI pitch representation). This study provides useful insights both into the domain of pitch perception and into musicological aspects of score notation strategies. A computational model is described that transcribes polyphonic MIDI pitch files into the Western traditional music notation. Input to the proposed algorithm is merely a sequence of MIDI pitch numbers in the order they appear in a MIDI file. No a priori knowledge such as key signature, tonal centers, time signature, chords, or voice separation is required. Output of the algorithm is a sequence of \"correctly\" spelled pitches. The algorithm is based on \u2026",

In order to examine if pitch and timbre influence the synaesthetic visual experience, induced by sound, an experiment with sound-colour synaesthetes (N= 22) was conducted. It was found that a) high pitched sounds conclude to a presence of hue, b) low pitched sounds to an absence of hue, c) single frequencies cause a uni-colour sensation and d) multiple high pitched frequencies induce a multi-colour sensation. Variation of chromatic colour, which is present in the sensation, depends on the timbre of the sound. These findings suggest that the synaesthetic mechanism (in case of sound-colour synaesthesia) maps sound to visual sensations depending on the mechanisms underlying temporal and spectral auditory processing.",

            "Abstract": "Probabilistic methodologies provide successful tools for automated music composition, such as melodic harmonisation, since they capture statistical rules of the music idioms they are trained with. Proposed methodologies focus either on specific aspects of harmony (eg, generating abstract chord symbols) or incorporate the determination of many harmonic characteristics in a single probabilistic generative scheme. This paper addresses the problem of assigning voice leading focussing on the bass voice, ie, the realisation of the actual bass pitches of an abstract chord sequence, under the scope of a modular melodic harmonisation system where different aspects of the generative process are arranged by different modules. The proposed technique defines the motion of the bass voice according to several statistical aspects: melody voice contour, previous bass line motion, bass-to-melody distances and statistics regarding inversions and note doublings in chords. The aforementioned aspects of voicing are modular, ie, each criterion is defined by independent statistical learning tools. Experimental results on diverse music idioms indicate that the proposed methodology captures efficiently the voice layout characteristics of each idiom, whilst additional analyses on separate statistically trained modules reveal distinctive aspects of each idiom. The proposed system is designed to be flexible and adaptable (for instance, for the generation of novel blended melodic harmonisations).",

The model we will define will be based on Goguen\u2019s proposal of a Unified Concept Theory, and will draw from interdisciplinary research results from cognitive science, artificial intelligence, formal methods and computational creativity. To validate our model, we will implement a proof of concept of an autonomous computational creative system that will be evaluated in two testbed scenarios: mathematical reasoning and melodic harmonisation.

Given a specific set of input cadences together with their blends, this paper addresses the following question: are some musical features of cadences more salient than others in defining perceived relations between input and blended cadences? To this end, behavioural data from a pairwise dissimilarity listening test using input and blended cadences as stimuli were collected, thus allowing the construction of a \u2018ground-truth\u2019 human-based perceptual space of cadences.

More specifically, it investigates the ability of the system to produce meaningful blends between harmonic cadences, which arguably constitute the most fundamental harmonic concept. The system creates a variety of blends combining elements of the penultimate chords of two input cadences and it further estimates the expected relationships between the produced blends. Then, a preliminary subjective evaluation of the proposed blending system is presented. A pairwise dissimilarity listening test was conducted using original and blended cadences as stimuli. Subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis produced spatial configurations for both behavioural data and dissimilarity estimations by the algorithm. Comparison of the two configurations showed that the system is capable of making fair predictions of the perceived dissimilarities between the blended cadences. This implies that this conceptual blending approach is able to create perceptually meaningful blends based on self-evaluation of its outcome.",

However, deciding about the importance of property features in the input spaces and evaluating the results of conceptual blending is a nontrivial task. In the specific case of musical harmony, defining the salient features of chord transitions and evaluating invented harmonic spaces requires deep musicological background knowledge. In this paper, we propose a creative tool that helps musicologists to evaluate and to enhance harmonic innovation. This tool allows a music expert to specify arguments over given transition properties. These arguments are then considered by the system when defining combinations of features in an idiom-blending process. A music expert can assess whether the new harmonic idiom makes musicological sense and re-adjust the arguments (selection of features) to explore alternative blends that can potentially produce better harmonic spaces. We conclude with a discussion of future work that would further automate the harmonisation process.",

The proposed model is tested against the punctuation rule system developed by Friberg et al.(1998) at KTH, Stockholm. Secondly, the expressive timing deviations found in a number of expert piano performances are examineded in relation to the local boundaries discovered by LBDM. As a result of a set of preliminary experiments, it is suggested that the assumption of final-note lengthening of a melodic gesture is not always valid and that, in some cases, the end of a melodic group is marked by lengthening the second-to-last note (or, seeing it from a different viewpoint, by delaying the last note).",

Music similarity is a central concept in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), however there exists no comprehensive approach to music similarity yet. As a consequence, MIR faces the challenge on how to relate musical features to the experience of similarity by listeners. Musicologists and studies in music cognition have argued that variation in music leads to the experience of similarity. In this paper we review the concept of variation from three different research strands: MIR, Musicology, and cognitive Science. We show that all of these disciplines have contributed insights to the study of variation that are important for modelling variation as a foundation for similarity. We introduce research steps that need to be taken to model variation as a base for music similarity estimation within a computational approach.",

This analysis will mainly focus on unique harmonic aspects of these songs, which feature, for instance, unresolved dissonances (major second and minor seventh intervals) at structurally stable positions of the pieces (eg cadences). Traditional triadic tonal chord types are inadequate for this corpus\u2019 unconventional harmonic language; pc-set theoretic tools are too general/abstract. A novel chord representation has been devised that adapts to different non-standard tonal harmonic spaces. In the General Chord Type (GCT) representation, the notes of a harmonic simultaneity are re-arranged, depending on a given classification of intervals (that reflects culturallydependent notions of consonance/dissonance), such that abstract idiom-specific types of chords may be derived. Based on these harmonic representations, statistical analyses are performed that provide insights regarding underlying harmony and, especially, on the idiosyncratic use of consonance/dissonance within this idiom. Then, characteristics of harmonic successions are examined via statistical analysis of the common chord transitions in the idiom. Finally, the learned statistical features are used to generate new harmonisations in the Epirus-song style for unseen Epirus-song melodies or for melodies from other distant idioms.",

A new idiomindependent representation is proposed of chord types that is appropriate for encoding tone simultaneities in any harmonic context (such as tonal, modal, jazz, octatonic, atonal). The General Chord Type (GCT) representation, allows the re-arrangement of the notes of a harmonic simultaneity such that abstract idiom-specific types of chords may be derived; this encoding is inspired by the standard roman numeral chord type labeling, but is more general and flexible. Given a consonance-dissonance classification of intervals (that reflects culturallydependent notions of consonance/dissonance), and a scale, the GCT algorithm finds the maximal subset of notes of a given note simultaneity that contains only consonant intervals; this maximal subset forms the base upon which the chord type is built. The proposed representation is ideal for hierarchic harmonic systems such as the tonal system and its many variations, but adjusts to any other harmonic system such as post-tonal, atonal music, or traditional polyphonic systems. The GCT representation is applied to a small set of examples from diverse musical idioms, and its output is illustrated and analysed showing its potential, especially, for computational music analysis & music information retrieval.",

Consolidation and fragmentation are retained, but adapted to the pitch interval domain, i.e., two or more intervals of one string may be matched to an interval from a second string through consolidation or fragmentation. The melodic interval string matching problem consists of finding all occurrences of a given pattern in a melodic sequence that takes into account exact matches, consolidations and fragmentations of intervals in both the sequence and the pattern.

The main problem is that musical parallelism itself is very difficult to formalise. In this paper a computational model will be presented that extracts melodic patterns from a given melodic surface. Following the assumption that the beginning and ending points of'significant'repeating musical patterns influence the segmentation of a musical surface, the discovered patterns are used as a means to determine probable segmentation points of the melody.\u2018Significant\u2019patterns are defined primarily in terms of frequency of occurrence and length of pattern. The special status of non-overlapping immediately-repeating patterns is examined. All the discovered patterns merge into a single \u2018pattern\u2019segmentation profile that signifies points in the surface that are most likely to be perceived as points of segmentation.

Musical analysis focuses primarily on aspects of compositional design, mathematical/formal relations between musical materials or on musical theoretic forms and functions that have been established as musicologically pertinent through the centuries (eg, traditional harmonic analysis, Schenkerian analysis). Listeners\u2019 perception is not usually the explicit goal of analytical methodologies. Background in music psychology. The coherence of a progression of tones or sonorities depends on a number of perceptual factors that have been described in the domain of auditory scene analysis. Principles of musical stream perception may be used to understand of the way a listener \u2018makes sense\u2019of a musical work. The way a musical work is perceived by a listener may be significantly different from the organization of notes suggested by a score, or even from analytic results given by different musical analytic methodologies.

We show that \u2018traditional\u2019music analytic methodologies are insufficient to account for the listening challenges posed by the specific work, and that music perception can shed new light in our understanding of the musical structure of this piece.

Beat tracking is fundamental to the understanding of musical structure, and therefore an essential ability for any system which purports to exhibit musical intelligence or understanding. We present an off-line multiple agent beat tracking system which estimates the locations of musical beats in MIDI performance data. This approach to beat tracking requires no prior information about the input data, such as the tempo or time signature; all required information is derived from the performance data. For constant tempo performances, previous beat tracking systems have proved successful; however, these systems fail when there are large variations in tempo. We examine the role of musical knowledge in guiding the beat tracking process, and show that a system equipped with knowledge of musical salience is able to track the beat of music even in the presence of large tempo variations. Results are presented for a large corpus of expressively performed classical piano music (13 complete sonatas), containing a full range of tempos and much variability in tempo within sections. With the musical knowledge disabled, the beats are tracked about 75% correctly; the inclusion of musical knowledge raises this figure to over 90%.",

            "Abstract": "Melodic harmonisation is a sophisticated creative process that involves deep musical understanding and a specialised knowledge of music relating to melodic structure, harmony, rhythm, texture, and form. In this article a new melodic harmonisation assistant is presented that is adaptive (learns from data), general (can cope with any tonal or non-tonal harmonic idiom) and modular (learns different aspects of harmonic structure such as chord types, chord transitions, cadences, and voice-leading). This melodic harmonisation system can be used not only to mimic given harmonic styles, but to generate novel harmonisations for diverse melodies and create new harmonic spaces, allowing for the imposition of user-defined chord constraints, leading to new unforeseen harmonic realisations. The various components of the proposed model are explained, then, a number of creative harmonisations of different melodies are presented to illustrate the potential of the system.",

            "Abstract": "This chapter investigates some aspects of formalizing semiotic analysis in terms of computational modelling. It focuses on the methodology as it relates to music analysis, rather than on algorithmic and implementation details. The chapter describes that paradigmatic analysis has so far resisted full formalization that may allow the implementation of sophisticated computational musical analytic systems. There have been several reasons for the unpopularity of the paradigmatic analysis among non-computational approaches; one of them may be the rigour in its application, regarding several issues that need to be addressed. The chapter focuses on three problem areas that relate to the selection of salient musical parameters for the description of musical entities, the hierarchic organization of musical structure, and the segmentation of a musical surface. It overviews and discusses analytical issues related to the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper a formal model will be presented that attempts to organise melodic segments into \u2018significant\u2019 musical categories (e.g. motives). Given a segmentation of a melodic surface, the proposed model constructs an appropriate representation for each segment in terms of a number of attributes (these reflect melodic and rhythmic aspects of the segment at the surface and at various abstract levels) and then a clustering algorithm (the Unscramble algorithm) is applied for the organisation of these segments into \u2018meaningful\u2019 categories. The proposed clustering algorithm automatically determines an appropriate number of clusters and also the characteristic (or defining) attributes of each category. As a test case this computational model has been used for obtaining a motivic analysis of Schumann\u2019s Tr\u00e4umerei.",

All the discovered patterns merge into a single \u201cpattern\u201d segmentation profile that signifies points in the surface most likely to be perceived as points of segmentation. The study focuses on a special type of repetition, referred to as formative repetition by D. Lidov (1979), that involves immediately repeating patterns that often diverge toward their endings, contain small variations, and may be transposed; the function of this type of repetition is to \u201cform\u201d motives and phrases.This study does not provide a comprehensive standalone \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Encoding note simultaneities (chords) has been approached in different ways, such as Roman numerals for tonal harmony, or pitch class sets encountered in atonal and non-tonal music. A novel chord representation, the General Chord Type (GCT) representation, was developed to be adaptable to a broad variety of harmonic idioms from tonal to atonal. Given a binary classification of intervals into consonant or dissonant, GCT rearranges the notes of a given simultaneity such that the base of the chord encoding is consonant. This study proposes a refined elegant version of the GCT algorithm that takes into account a graded raking of intervallic consonance, maintains the core characteristics of GCT and resolves known problems such as certain types of chord ambiguities (more than one chord types for a single pitch collection) and orderings of intervals (wrong base/root and chord extensions).",
