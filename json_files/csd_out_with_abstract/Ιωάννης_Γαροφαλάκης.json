In this paper we discuss the implementation of an AR application that acts as a magic lens over printed maps, overlaying POIs and routes. This method expands the information space available to members of groups during navigation, partially mitigating the issue of several group members trying to share a small screen device. Our work complements existing literature by focusing on the navigation tasks and by using self-reporting questionnaires to measure affective state and user experience. We evaluate this system with groups of real tourists in a preliminary field trial and report our findings.",

In this paper, we propose the modelling of Greek legal texts based on the Akoma Ntoso document model, which is a necessary step for their representation as Open Data and we describe use cases that show how these massive legal open datasets could be further exploited.",

Using a computationally efficient Lanczos-based procedure, LLFR builds a low dimensional item similarity model, that can be readily exploited to produce personalized ranking vectors over the item space. A number of experiments on real datasets at different density levels indicate that LLFR outperforms other state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods from a computational as well as a qualitative perspective. Our experimental results also show that its relative performance gains, compared to competing methods, increase as the data get sparser. This is true both when the sparsity is generalized--as in the New Community Problem--and in the very interesting case where the sparsity is localized in a small fraction of the dataset--as in the New Users Problem.",

This vision elaborates on recent developments in smart cities around the world where novel technologies and applications have been introduced in order to provide services and promote economic growth and sustainability. According to our approach a smart city has to also focus on social and cultural aspects, to allow people to interact with their cities in novel ways and to enable them to shape and decide the future of the city. This approach has originated from the large-scale deployment and evaluation of the CLIO urban computing system, which enables people to interact with the collective city memory. Our findings revealed that a system that exploits city infrastructure and both people\u2019s and artificial intelligence in order to empower and engage them in social activities may enhance citizen participation and sense of \u2026",

In this paper we examine to what extent the information from SNSs such as likes, tags, check-ins can influence the visitors or locals of a city in choosing venues to visit. Next, we implement an Android application, Social City, for mobile devices, which collects and evaluates the information from Facebook and Foursquare in order to recommend to users venues to visit in the city of Patras, Greece. Finally, we discuss an evaluation of Social City. Our results indicate that the combination of SNS data from multiple social networking sites into a single rating, appears to lead to more efficient recommendations for the users, helping them choose faster and easier and with more confidence about the \u2026",

Aim of the presented work is to present an integrated approach to support internal processes of the Greek Ministry of Education concerning the control and risk management for schools\u2019 educational excursions. The research included the effort to combine solutions to organizational problems, services and technologies in order to create an efficient, easy to use and expandable system for the processes of Ministry\u2019s activities and procedures in order to effectively program and monitor periodic school excursions. The application developed is used by the Greek Ministry of Education the last three years for the recording and planning of the excursions planned from all units of the secondary Education and for the statistics extraction. Moreover, the presented case can also serve as a basis for identifying further research and potentials concerning this specific area of e-government information systems and their effective application in the day to day operation of administrations, especially in processes involving high level of risks (like schools\u2019 excursions).",

Each concept is associated with a number of LOs. Existing tools for managing DK mainly deal with either LOs or concepts, but not with connecting them. In this paper, we present a tool for managing both types of information in DK: creating and editing a concept network and LO metadata as well as connecting them.

            "Abstract": "In-vehicle route guidance systems are increasingly being used both to provide assistance to drivers and to manage traffic in such a way that allows an increase in road network capacity and therefore a decrease in traffic congestion. A typical route guidance system makes use of current traffic conditions in order to compute the shortest route to the driver\u2019s destination. This paper considers the application of the basic principles of the Constrained System Optimal model, used to solve the traffic assignment problem, in the case of routing a single vehicle. This model is a combination of the two previous approaches, where a global objective is set in order to ensure the effectiveness of the system and at the same time constraints guarantee the fairness of the recommendations for the drivers. The authors outline the idea of equilibrium in transportation systems and the basic principles of the traffic assignment problem, before presenting details of the proposed model for route guidance systems. The authors conclude that, compared to the User Optimal model that provides no traffic improvement guarantees and the System Optimal model that is unrealistic, the Constrained System Optimal solution adopts the goal of reducing congestion and at the same time remaining fair for drivers with respect to the individually shortest route to their destination.",

The proposed analytical framework is anticipated to be a very useful tool in evaluating the performance of semi\u2010layer MINs in designing more efficient QoS networks. Copyright \u00a9 \u2026",

According to research, digital games can support students\u2019 learning and enhance their motivation to learn. Given the central role teachers play in the learning process, their perceptions of DGBL play a significant role in the usage and effectiveness of game-based learning. This paper presents the main findings of an online research on primary school teachers\u2019 attitudes toward DGBL. Furthermore, the research investigates teachers\u2019 opinions about the functionalities provided by the implemented Multiplication Game (MG) and the newly incorporated teacher dashboard. The MG is an assessment and skills improvement tool that integrates an adaptation mechanism that identifies student weaknesses on the multiplication tables and in its latest version also supports a strong social parameter. Students can be informed about their own progress as well as the progress of their peers in an effort to examine if social interaction or competition can increase players\u2019 motivation, which is a subject that raised some concerns in the teaching community. The paper describes the functional options offered by the MG dashboard and documents the outcomes of an online survey conducted with the participation of 182 primary school teachers. The survey indicated the potential usefulness of MG and the benefits it can offer as a learning tool to improve pupil multiplication skills and help teachers identify individual pupil skills and difficulties and adapt their teaching accordingly.

            "Abstract": "The complexity of the power grid, in conjunction with the ever increasing demand for electricity, creates the need for efficient analysis and control of the power system. The evolution of the legacy system towards the new smart grid intensifies this need due to the large number of sensors and actuators that must be monitored and controlled, the new types of distributed energy sources that need to be integrated and the new types of loads that must be supported. At the same time, integration of human-activity awareness into the smart grid is emerging and this will allow the system to monitor, share and manage information and actions on the business, as well as the real world. In this context, modeling and simulation is an invaluable tool for system behavior analysis, energy consumption estimation and future state prediction. In this paper, we review current smart grid simulators and approaches for building and user behavior modeling, and present a federated smart grid simulation framework, in which building, control and user behavior modeling and simulation are decoupled from power or network simulators and implemented as discrete components. This framework enables evaluation of the interactions between the communication infrastructure and the power system taking into account the human activities, which are at the focus of emerging energy-related applications that aim to shape user behavior. Validation of the key functionality of the proposed framework is also presented. View Full-Text",

In this paper, we present a device independent mobile application that enables mobile users to receive route directions to their handheld device. This application is an extension to an existing mobile map delivery system, the m-CHARTIS system. We focus on the main features and we analyse the device independent character of the application. Implementation details are presented and finally directions for future work are proposed.",

Several researchers have focused in the past on predicting the next contact a user is likely to call, a task that could prove useful in designing adaptive context-aware interfaces for the mobile contact list. Most of the researchers propose several contextual dimensions that could be used to predict the next callee, location being one of them. However, none of these research works have ever examined the impact of location on mobile communications and only few have actually incorporated this contextual dimension on their implementations. In this paper, we examine physical location as a contextual cue for adaptive mobile contact lists by analyzing call logs from the Nokia Mobile Data \u2026",

A comprehensive set of experiments on the MovieLens100K, the MovieLens1M and the Yahoo!R2Music datasets indicates that our method is very effective in handling sparsity, even in its most extreme manifestation \u2013 the cold-start problem.

We add to the limited current literature through a qualitative study based on the theory of Reasoned Action Approach, and the longitudinal collection of empirical data from users\u2019 devices. Our findings demonstrate that temporal, spatial and social context are strong determinants for the decision-making process of switching ringer modes. In particular, social context emerges in a much more complex form than described in previous studies, questioning if it can be accurately captured in all its richness. On the other hand, temporal and spatial context are found to explain much of the variation in ringer mode use, enabling prediction of appropriate ringer \u2026",

Until an open by default generation and publication process is employed, ex-post transformation of legal documents into Legal Open Data is required. Since manual transformation is a time-consuming and costly process, automated methods need to be applied. While some research efforts toward the automation of the transformation process exist, the alignment of such approaches with proposed Open Data methodologies in order to promote data exploitation is still an open issue. In this paper, we present a methodology aligned to the Open Data ecosystem approach for the automated transformation of Greek court decisions and legal opinions into Legal Open Data that builds on legal language processing methods and tools. We show that this approach produces Legal Open Data of satisfying quality while highly reducing the need for manual intervention. View Full-Text",

This mechanism, which is called \"partial multicast\", was employed by all SEs using the \"Cell Replication While Routing\" (CRWR) technique. The proposed analysis was applied to various network-size MINs constructed by symmetrical Switching Elements (SEs), supporting mixed traffic patterns such as unicast and multicast, under various offered loads in uniform traffic conditions. The performance of MINs with partial multicasting transmission, which is thoroughly analyzed by our analytical model, can also be useful in performance study and development of \u2026",

The second one is the TMDBE (Title and Multimedia Database Editor) that helps the end-user to manage the multimedia data (video, image, text, audio, etc.). The last module CG (Code Generator) gets as input from the database the title editing information and produces as output a source code for the target multimedia platform, in our case web browsers (Netscape and Internet Explorer).

The widely acknowledged importance of the Web Services\u2019 concept lies in the fact that they provide a platform independent answer to the software component development question. Equally important are the mechanisms that allow for Web Service discovery, especially as the latter has turn to an arduous task. This paper reviews the latest methods, architectures, models and concerns that have arisen in the Web Service Discovery area.",

ORGAN aims to enhance and ease log analysis by using semantic knowledge. It is able to offer typical statistical analysis of Web usage logs taking into consideration at the same time site\u2019s underlying semantics. We evaluated ORGAN using Web site data for different cases to verify and exhibit its promising behavior. The experimental outcomes were encouraging and valuable conclusions for the Web site usage under analysis were reached. Consequently, we believe and show paradigms that ORGAN could become a useful tool for Web log analysts and assist the Web site managers in the decision-making for reorganization tasks. Finally, we discuss open problems to motivate further research efforts towards the incorporation of semantic Web technologies into Web site log mining analysis.",

In this paper, we propose a collaborative fashion recommendation system, called CFRS. Apart from classic features, we propose a new metric, called trend score. Trend score shows how trendy a product is and is calculated taking into account the ratings provided by CFRS users (fashion experts and registered users). In particular, users rate (like/ dislike scale) current trends about colors, prints and materials. Finally, trend score is used a) for sorting products of each category from trendiest options to classic ones and b) to \u2026",

As such we conducted an ecologically valid and carefully designed experiment in a controlled environment that simulates a smart home environment. Our work extends into smart environments, by examining a new modality, implemented by pairing the smartphone to a connected lighting system and replicating mobile notifications to smart light bulbs in the user's field of vision. We derive a set of guidelines for choosing notification modalities and set future research directions.",

The configurations of the under study networks apply a conflict drop resolution mechanism. The proposed architecture's performance is studied under uniform traffic conditions and various offered loads, buffer-lengths and MIN sizes. In this paper, the improvements on semi-layer MIN performance, in terms of throughput and latency, are demonstrated quantitatively. These performance measures can be valuable tools for designers of parallel multiprocessor systems and networks, in order to minimize the overall deployment costs and help deliver efficient systems.",

Aim of this effort was to assist the epidemiology monitoring of H1N1 epidemic evolution in Greece, in the whole country and per Region, leading\u2013in comparative analysis with other factors collected from other sources\u2013to the extraction of important conclusions for taking precautionary measures against the flu (eg temporarily school closures). Such a survey system to collect and analyze the daily students\u2019 absences from Greek schools is very useful due to the fact that it provides a precise view concerning the H1N1 spread in \u201creal time\u201d. The whole system has been integrated to the central Resources Management System of the Greek Ministry of Education and it operated utilizing the backbone of \u2026",

Consequently, they have been widely used on Internet connections such as ATM and gigabit Ethernet switches, terabit routers as well as for interconnecting parallel systems. In this paper a novel analytical method for providing performance evaluation on MINs is presented under multicast environment. The proposed analysis was applied on various network size MINs constructed by variable buffer-length switching elements (SEs) per network stage, supporting mixed traffic patterns such as unicast and multicast, under various offered loads in uniform traffic conditions. The applied multicasting policy, where a packet is copied and transmitted when only both destination buffers are available has not been considered insofar by former models. This mechanism \u2026",

It has been widely studied in lab settings, using primarily transcription tasks, and to a far lesser extent through in-the-wild (field) experiments. So far it remains unknown how well user behaviour during lab transcription tasks approximates real use. In this paper, we present a study that provides evidence that lab text entry behaviour is clearly distinguishable from real world use. Using machine learning techniques, we show that it is possible to accurately identify the type of study in which text entry sessions took place. The implications of our findings relate to the design of future studies in text entry, aiming to support input with virtual smartphone keyboards.",

We demonstrate that the introduced virtual construction keeps the exchanged messages to relatively low levels.

            "Abstract": "Learner motivation to self-improve is a crucial effectiveness factor in all modes and settings of learning. Game-based learning was long used for attracting and maintaining students\u2019 interest especially in small ages, deploying means such as scoring, timing, scores of peers (ie, hall of fame), etc. These techniques can provide recognition for high-scoring players, while also developing a sense of safe \u201cdistance\u201d in the impersonal electronic environment for low-scoring players. In addition, constructive feedback on mistakes a player makes can contribute to avoiding similar mistakes in the future, thus achieving better performance in the game, while constructing valuable new knowledge when a knowledge gap is detected. This paper investigates an integrated approach to designing, implementing, and using an adaptive game for assessing and gradually improving multiplication skills. Student motivation is fostered by incorporating the Open Learner Model approach, which exposes part of the underlying user model to the students in a graphically simplified manner that is easily perceivable and offers a clear picture of student performance. In addition, the Open Learner Model is expanded with visualizations of social comparison information, where students can access the progress of anonymous peers and summative class scores for improving self-reflection and fostering self-regulated learning. This paper also presents the feedback received by the preliminary testing of the game and discusses the effect of assessing multiplication skills of primary school pupils using the adaptive game-based approach on increasing pupil motivation to self-improve \u2026",

Sometimes the term refers only to the most visible service, the internal website. Additionally, the term computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) addresses\" how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems.\"(WIKIPEDIA, 2007). CSCW can be supported from internal website type intranets. Spread collaborating groups are using closed www environments with several collaboration supporting functionalities (file sharing, communication, forum, tasks etc) in order to coordinate their work. This form of online collaboration is highly important for projects involving several types of actors from various regions and countries (interregional collaboration projects). These projects are highly important especially for the case of European Union (EU) where the collaborative spirit between structures coming from different countries has to be supported to assure cohesion (a very important and basic goal for the EC integration). In almost all cases of such projects, light versions of CSCW environments are used in order to support and enhance effective collaboration. With the presented work we examine the case of seven specific interregional European projects and the use of Intranet CSCW environments by their consortia. We present an evaluation of the Intranets usage based on several factors and metrics: functionalities provided, projects and partners\u2019 type, members of the system, files sharing \u2026",

In this paper two distinct metrics are proposed, which aim to quantify the importance of a web page based on the visits it receives by the users and its location within the website. Subsequently, certain guidelines are presented, which can be used to reorganize the website, taking into account the optimization of these metrics.

            "Abstract": "Achieving multiplication table fluency is a major concern during all primary school years and for many pupils it is considered a challenge. `Rote memory' approaches that have been deployed for years in the traditional school curriculum have contributed to the prevailing assumption of pupils that Mathematics is unpleasant and uninviting. This paper presents a game-based approach to assess and gradually improve multiplication skills by combining an adaptive mechanism for identifying and resolving pupil weaknesses, while exposing parts of the learner model to the user through easily perceivable visualizations. Moreover, the game offers social comparison information and pupils can access progress data about their peers or their entire class a feature that is expected to improve self-reflection, allow for self-regulated learning and increase user motivation.

To this goal, we track user's hits and define whether a user specializes or generalizes his navigation through semantics analysis of the pages in his session window. An algorithm of capturing user session orientation based on a concept taxonomy is proposed. Finally, a method is presented which proposes useful recommendation to the user to improve his Web search. The experimental outcomes satisfied the prospective results. We believe that our technique could become a useful tool for navigation refinement.

The design of the system was the result of a project funded by the Greek Secretariat of Research and Technology. A significant operation for the handling of emergency incidents is the routing of ambulances to incident sites and then to the closest appropriate hospitals. The response time of a real-time system like ours to such queries is of vital significance. By using efficient data structures for the implementation of the graph representing the road network, the time performance of the shortest-path algorithm can be enhanced.

            "Abstract": "Multistage Interconnection Networks (MINs) are used to interconnect different processing modules in various parallel systems or on high bandwidth networks. In this paper an integrated performance methodology is presented. A new approximate performance model for self-routing MINs consisting of symmetrical switches which are subject to a backpressure blocking mechanism is analyzed. Based on this, the steady-state distribution of the queue utilization is estimated and then all important performance metrics are calculated. Moreover, a general evaluation factor which helps in choosing a better performance MIN in comparison with other similar MIN architecture specifications is defined. The model was exemplified for the case of symmetrical single-and double-buffered MINs. It provides accurate results and converges very quickly. The obtained results were validated by extensive simulations and were compared to existing related work in the literature.The performance evaluation of a MIN is of crucial importance. Thus, a lot of research has been devoted to the study of how these networks perform under various conditions through analytical or simulation methods [2, 4\u20136, 8, 14, 15]. Detailed results can be found for specific cases of MINs which rely mainly on approximation methods for example [2, 8, 24]. The numerical simulation model is based on an analysis of the discrete time behavior of the system. In this case, a formula was derived from analysis of the formula that was extracted by considering the steady state of the MIN. The steady state describes the MIN situation in which the probability of staying in a particular state will not change. In \u2026",

Due to the fact that many people gather on web sites looking for a solution to their problem, communities of practice (CoPs) were developed. CoPs have become important places for people who seek and share experience. In CoPs area, Argumentative Collaboration is developing between users, so that users can help each other. This paper refers to CoPs and especially to the field that refers to computer programmers. We introduce HelpMe tool that receives questions about a subject that is tagged by the init (or start) user. The start user of a query process is the user that brings the initial question to the community. HelpMe tool automatically selects a group of people according to rules and metrics, in order to supply feedback to the community group who deals with the specific subject (according to label tagging). We introduce two new metrics ULQI (user label query importance) and ULCI (user label communication importance) that are responsible for selecting the appropriate group of people in the community and computing the reputation scores based on the received ratings. HelpMe tool visualizes conversations through graphs, text clouds and statistics.",
