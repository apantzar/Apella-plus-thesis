            "Abstract": "We show how to obtain optical fields possessing superoscillatory features by superposing the evanescent tails of waves undergoing total internal reflection at a plane dielectric interface. In doing so, we essentially extend the definition of superoscillations to functions expressed as a continuum of slowly decaying exponentials, while not necessarily being bandlimited in the standard (Fourier) sense. We obtain such functions by complexifying the argument of standard bandlimited superoscillatory functions with a strictly positive spectrum. Combined with our recent method for superoscillations with arbitrary polynomial shape, the present approach offers flexibility for locally shaping the evanescent field near dielectric interfaces for applications such as particle or atom trapping.",

Only basic information is provided with regard to the MT and the closely related class of Mellin\u2013Barnes (MB) integrals. On this basis, the MT method is applied to several examples of integrals occurring in studies of fading channels and wireless transmission systems.

In this paper, fundamental issues related to the MAS solution of three-dimensional (3-D) scattering problems are analytically and numerically investigated. Two 3-D scattering problems are considered. In both, the respective singularities of the analytic continuation of the scattered field in the scatterer's interior can be explicitly determined; the location of these singularities plays a crucial role to the application of the MAS. The first problem concerns the acoustic scattering by a soft sphere when excited by an exterior point source. The analytic solution of this problem is directly compared with the numerical solution obtained by the MAS for varying locations of the auxiliary sources (AS's). The second problem concerns the plane wave acoustic scattering by a soft ellipsoid. This may \u2026",

Isothermal magnetization measurements at T = 295\u00b0K showed ferrimagnetic behaviour with ferromagnetic saturation magnetic moment which diminishes linearly with x. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements revealed that the mixed compounds exhibit approximately half the losses of pure YIG. The YIG-Al compound was then applied in the design of a tunable notched UWB antenna operating in the 1.7-8 GHz range. The ferrite was biased by small permanent magnets. The biased and unbiased states of the YIG-Al block produce isolated stopbands. Moreover, in these \u2026",

Since physical dimensions are constrained by the size of the mobile terminal, a reconfigurability mechanism based on partial magnetodielectric substrates and superstrates was studied in order to shift the resonance frequency lower while maintaining low system complexity. A printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA) was used to demonstrate continuous tuning, as opposed to the discrete tuning states of other methods, e.g., aperture tuning by means of switched capacitors. The numerical analysis of the PIFA started with lossy, isotropic ferrites, and then it elevated to gyromagnetic anisotropy.

Nevertheless, the same numerical method is often applied to both forms of the integral equation. In this paper, the behavior of the numerical solutions thus obtained is investigated, and the similarities and differences between the two numerical solutions are discussed. The numerical method is Galerkin's method with pulse functions. We first apply this method to the two corresponding forms of the integral equation for the current on a linear antenna of infinite length. In this case, the method yields an infinite Toeplitz system of algebraic equations in which the width of the pulse basis \u2026",

The excitation model is crucial to our discussions, since it determines the behavior of the solution convergence.

Once the basics have been mastered, one quickly realizes that the MT-method is extremely powerful, often yielding closed-form expressions very difficult to come up with other methods or to deduce from the usual tables of integrals. Yet, as opposed to other methods, the MT-method is very straightforward to apply; it usually requires laborious calculations, but little ingenuity. In fact, the MT-method is used by Mathematica to symbolically calculate definite integrals. The first part of this paper is a step-by-step tutorial, proceeding from first principles. It includes basic information on Mellin-Barnes integrals and generalized hypergeometric functions, and summarizes the key ideas of the MT-method. In the \u2026",

Their use has important consequences, one of which is the appearance of oscillations in the computed currents when the number of sub-domain basis functions is sufficiently large. These oscillations are not due to round-off errors. In this paper, a smoothing procedure is used in conjunction with Galerkin's formulation with piecewise sinusoidal functions, which yields non-oscillating current distributions. Special attention is paid to the solutions over a wide range of discretization levels (number of basis/testing functions), in order to examine and illustrate the similarities and differences between results obtained with and without the proposed remedy. Finally, a comparison with results derived with the exact kernel is provided.",

According to the general scheme of MAS, the eigenvalues are obtained by requiring the square impedance matrix to be singular and therefore its determinant to be zero (or its condition number to be large). For large matrices, such computations are complicated and time-consuming. Additionally, these schemes are frequently contaminated with spurious eigenvalues. To overcome the difficulties, an efficient method based on MAS along with an excitation source has been proposed. The eigenvalues are obtained by measuring the physical response of the waveguide's domain to this source; thus, an interior problem is always solved.

To alleviate the oscillations, we employ an appropriate effective current further to the recent remedy of oscillations attained for a perfectly conducting linear cylindrical antenna of finite length for the case where the surrounding medium is free space.

This paper revisits the equivalent-circuit Wheeler cap (EC-WCap) and modifies all steps of the algorithm, thus significantly enhancing its simplicity and speed, while maintaining a wideband measurement capacity. This enhancement of EC-WCap was driven by the need to accurately characterize multiband CP magneto-dielectric antennas built on externally biased ferrimagnetic compounds, which resist characterization by other Wheeler-cap-related post-processing methods.",

Such an unphysical solution can be thought of as an auxiliary,  rapidly oscillating current located on the axis of the linear antenna, while the effective current is the magnetic field due to the oscillating current at a distance equal to the antenna radius (multiplied by a factor equal to the antenna circumference). In the present paper, we focus on the rapid decrease of the aforementioned magnetic field and point out similarities to surface waves, to the well-known phenomenon of superdirectivity, and to the method of auxiliary sources (MAS).

We show that it is possible to concurrently have divergence of the auxiliary currents together with convergence of the scattered field generated by these divergent currents. The divergence manifests itself as rapid, unphysical oscillations in the auxiliary currents. It is stressed that the oscillations are not due to effects such as roundoff, matrix ill-conditioning, or to the well-studied phenomenon of internal resonances. We arrive at our conclusions using a number of means including asymptotic methods and a thorough discussion of the singularities of the analytic continuation of the scattered field.

When the so-called approximate kernel is used, the main difficulty is the appearance of unphysical oscillations near the driving point and/or near the ends of the antenna. Another work has proposed an easy-to-apply, possible remedy to overcome these unnatural oscillations. The basic idea is to define a new current from the near magnetic field produced by the original oscillating current. In the present paper, for the case of an antenna center-driven by a delta-function generator, we place this remedy on a much firmer basis by means of an asymptotic study for the case of the linear antenna of infinite length.

For spheres with constant magnetic permeability \u00b5, but variable dielectric constant \u03b5 (r, \u03b8, \u03d5) a direct, mainly analytical solution can be used even in case when the inhomogeneity in \u03b5 renders separation of variables inapplicable. This approach constitutes a generalization of the hybrid (analytical-numerical) scalar method developed by the authors in two recent papers, for the corresponding acoustic (scalar) field induced in spheres with variable density and/or compressibility. This extension, by no means trivial, owing to the vector and integrodifferential nature of the equation, is based on field-vector expansions using the set of three harmonic surface vectors, orthogonal and complete over the surface of the sphere, for their angular (\u03b8, \u03d5) dependence, and Dini\u2019s expansions of a general type for their radial functions. The use of the latter has been shown to be superior to other possible sets of orthogonal expansions and as far as its convergence is concerned it may further be improved by properly choosing a crucial parameter in their eigenvalue equation. The restriction to the spherical shape is imposed here to allow use of the well-known expansion of Green\u2019s dyadic in spherical eigenvectors of the vector wave equation.",

These functions are obtained as the product of the polynomial with a sufficiently flat, bandlimited envelope function whose Fourier transform has at least  continuous derivatives and an Nth derivative of bounded variation, N being the order of the polynomial. Polynomials of arbitrarily high order can be approximated if the Fourier transform of the envelope is smooth, ie a bump function.",

            "Abstract": "Recent studies of the Method of Auxiliary Sources (MAS) solutions to a simple scattering problem have shown that it is possible to have convergence of the field, which is the finally desired quantity, together with divergence of the MAS currents, which are intermediate quantities. Another recent study has demonstrated that no similar phenomenon occurs when the computational method is a certain discretization of the Extended Integral Equation (EIE); this integral equation is due to Peter C. Waterman. The purpose of the present paper is to extend these findings to a combined MAS/EIE method that can be viewed as one possible 2-D implementation of what is usually called the Null-Field Method with Discrete Sources (NFMDS). We find that, despite the convergence of the field, divergence of currents\u2014manifesting itself as spurious oscillations\u2014can occur within this combined method under certain conditions.

The antenna under investigation is a microstrip patch antenna printed on a 60/40 w/w% YIG-Epoxy composite substrate and controlled by an externally applied DC magnetic field. It is observed that high dielectric losses of the composite substrate can dramatically deteriorate the radiation efficiency of the proposed antenna in the demagnetized state, while in the magnetized state the magnitude of the resonance linewidth (\u0394H) of the composite substrate is the main parameter responsible for the reduction or improvement of the radiation efficiency.

            "Abstract": "This paper deals with two trigonometric sums that are pervasive in the literature dealing with the Gibbs phenomenon. In particular, the two sums often serve as test cases for methods\u2013such as the method of Fej\u00e9r averaging\u2013that aim to overcome the Gibbs phenomenon. Each of the two is the partial sum of a convergent infinite series with a discontinuous limit function. Our starting points are some recently-published results, both exact and asymptotic, for the two sums. For the case of a large number of terms, we proceed from those results to develop simple and revealing asymptotic formulas for the two sums and, also, for their Fej\u00e9r averages. These formulas break down as we approach the point of discontinuity, so we further develop similar formulas that are appropriate near the discontinuity point. We repeat all these tasks for a third sum whose corresponding infinite series exhibits a logarithmic singularity. Our \u2026",

            "Abstract": "When methods employing auxiliary sources are applied to problems involving scatterers that are circular, it has been shown that convergent and correct fields are obtained by divergent and oscillatory amplitudes (currents) of the sources. In this work, we present some preliminary numerical results, which show that the above conclusions remain valid for non-circular scattering cases.",
