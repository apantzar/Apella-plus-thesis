            "Abstract": "Two different systems are introduced, that perform automated audio annotation and segmentation of Cypriot folk songs into meaningful musical information. The first system consists of three artificial neural networks (ANNs) using timbre low-level features. The output of the three networks is classifying an unknown song as \u201cmonophonic\u201d or \u201cpolyphonic\u201d. The second system employs one ANN using the same feature set. This system takes as input a polyphonic song and it identifies the boundaries of the instrumental and vocal parts. For the classification of the \u201cmonophonic\u2013polyphonic\u201d, a precision of 0.88 and a recall of 0.78 has been achieved. For the classification of the \u201cvocal\u2013instrumental\u201d a precision of 0.85 and recall of 0.83 has been achieved. From the obtained results we concluded that the timbre low-level features were able to capture the characteristics of the audio signals. Also, that the specific ANN structures were suitable for the specific classification problem and outperformed classical statistical methods.",

In doing so, some DDSS systems exploit existing crisp medical databases while others take an advantage of human knowledge and experience, by building fuzzy medical databases from scratch. It would be of interest though, as well as time saving, to combine these two together and examine how one can actually use an existing crisp medical dataset to transform it into a new fuzzy medical database with parameters being expressed and defined based on the clinicians\u2019 way of thinking. A methodology implementing this task is proposed in this paper accompanied by the results of its application on a real crisp medical database.",

The data transfer rate achieved with GPRS were in the range of 32 Kbps (while for GSM 9.6 kbps) with the download time for typical images of a file size of 200 Kbytes to the mobile device to be in the region of 60 seconds. Similar performance was also recorded in the case of a moving station (simulating the ambulance).

The automated identification of ornamentations enhances the understanding of music, which can be used as a feature for tasks such as performer identification or mood classification. Existing methods rely on a pre-processing step that performs note segmentation. We propose an alternative method by adapting the existing two-dimensional COSFIRE filter approach to one-dimension (1D) for the automatic identification of ornamentations in monophonic folk songs. We construct a set of 1D COSFIRE filters that are selective for the 12 notes of the Western music theory. The response of a 1D COSFIRE filter is computed as the geometric mean of the differences between the fundamental frequency values in a local neighbourhood and the preferred values at the corresponding positions.

            "Abstract": "Cavitation in marine propellers can be a serious problem that may result in severe deterioration in performance. This is particularly important in heavily loaded propellers, commonly encountered in small craft. Efforts have been made to generate polynomials that fit experimental data on propeller performance and hence to facilitate the propeller selection procedures (Blount and Hubble, 1981). These polynomial fits are not accurate in capturing the performance of propellers, and also do not account for cavitating conditions. In the present work, neural networks have been developed that predict the performance of marine propellers in all tested conditions, including cavitation. The USN-series of experimental data (Denny et al, 1989) were applied on different neural network architectures and learning parameters, aiming at establishing a near optimum setup. The results of the networks are superior to those of the polynomial fit, and give an acceptable accuracy even in the cavitating conditions, thus enabling a naval architect/engineer to improve on the propeller selection process.",

The model was used to simulate the findings of a behavioural experiment conducted by Naccache et al. in Psychol Sci 13:416\u2013424 (2002), which have sparked a debate on the possible links between attention and consciousness.

A pregnant woman is advised by the doctor to perform an amniocentesis test, after the identification of increased risk for fetal aneuploidy. Even though the amniocentesis test is almost perfectly accurate, it has several drawbacks. It is an invasive test with around 1% risk for miscarriage; it is financially expensive and requires laboratories and special equipment. In this work we propose a non-invasive method for aneuploidy detection using a dataset with pre-natal examinations of pregnant women and artificial neural networks. We have used a dataset with 50,517 euploid and 691 aneuploid cases. Biological markers of the mother such as the age, blood proteins and ultrasonographic information from the fetus are used as input to the networks. A training set is used \u2026",

The model successfully simulated the findings from an experiment by Benoni and Tsal (2010) documenting the effects of dilution on distractor interference. In conjunction with previous implementations of the model, we have been able to offer a unifying account that settles the controversy between the Perceptual Load and the Dilution theories of selective attention.",

The politico-economic dynamics involved are related to the interests of both the Greek Cypriot community and the Turkish Cypriot community. Furthermore, there are antagonistic and cooperative interests among other countries involved in the conflict. These are primarily Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The expected entry of Cyprus into the European Union, as well as the recent terrorist events, has made the involvement of Europe, USA, Russia and Israel important influential-dynamical factors. An attempt to model the dynamics of the problem, using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps has been made. The main parameters involved in the interrelated dynamics are nationalism, religiousness, knowledge of history, level of educational development, tourism, prospect of finding crude oil, other natural resources, Anatolian settlers, and the general interests of the countries involved, as well of course the general interests of two communities.",

M-Commerce services and applications can be adopted through different wireless and mobile networks, with the aid of several mobile devices. However, constraints of both mobile networks and devices influence their operational performance; therefore, there is a strong need for taking into consideration those constraints in the design and development phases of m-Commerce services and applications. Another important factor in designing m-Commerce services and applications is the identification of mobile users requirements. Furthermore, m-Commerce services and applications need to be classified based on the functionality they provide to the mobile users. This kind of classification results in two major classes: the directory and the transaction-oriented services and applications. This paper suggests a new approach for designing and developing m-Commerce services and applications. This approach relies on mobile users needs and requirements, the classification of the m-Commerce services and applications, as well as the current technologies for mobile and wireless computing and their constraints.",

We used low-level and mid-level features for our investigations and we applied two unsupervised methods, the so-called kmeans and the self organizing maps for creating cluster maps. From the results we observed that the Greek-Cypriot songs, the Turkish Cypriot songs and the Turkish makams are being clustered from the system in different clusters. Arabic and music from Iran are clustered in the same cluster and music from Syria is clustered together with music of Turkey. Western music is clustered in to two different clusters.",

Its originality comes from the way a neural network is trained in order to get a decent hypothesis out of a dataset that comprises of a huge sized majority class and a tiny size minority class. This situation is especially probable when forming machine learning databases describing rare medical conditions. The algorithm is tested on a large dataset in order to predict the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women. Conventional machine learning algorithms tend to provide poor hypothesis for extremely imbalanced datasets by favoring the majority class. The proposed algorithm is not trained on the basis of the mean squared error objective function and thus avoids the overwhelming effect of the highly asymmetric class sizes. The methodology provides preeclampsia detection \u2026",

A comprehensive example of the role of human attention can be seen by noting that at each instant of conscious life, each person receives millions of external stimulations from his/her sensory systems, while only a limited amount is selected by attention for further processing that leads to conscious perception. If every stimulus was allowed to pass into perception, one would have been soon overflowed and in constant distraction. Adding to external stimulation all internal stimuli (e.g., thoughts), a person would end up in a totally unstable state. Selective attention is thus regarded as the main control mechanism \u2026",

The internal operation of the model is based on recent neurophysiologic evidence emphasizing the importance of neural synchronization between different areas of the brain. Synchronization of neuronal activity has been shown to be involved in several fundamental functions in the brain especially in attention.

The daily loads of nine different building structures have been estimated using the TRNSYS program and a typical meteorological year of Cyprus. This set of data has been used to train a neural network. For each day of the year the maximum and minimum loads were obtained from which heating or cooling loads can be determined. All the buildings considered, had the same areas but different structural characteristics. Single and double walls have been considered as well as a number of different roof insulations. A multislab feedforward architecture having 3 hidden slabs has been employed. Each hidden slab comprised of 36 neurons. For the  training data set  the R2-values obtained were 0.9896 and 0.9918 for the maximum and minimum loads respectively. The method was validated by using actual (modeled) data for one building, for all days of the year, which the network has not seen before. The R2-values obtained in this case are 0.9885 and 0.9905 for the two types of loads respectively. The results indicate that the proposed method can be used for the required predictions for buildings of different constructions. At present the method was used primarily to investigate its suitability for this kind of predictions.",

In this study we have investigated the importance of ethnicity on the classification yield. The database was composed of 6838 cases of pregnant women in UK, provided by the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine in London. For each subject 15 parameters were considered as the most influential at characterizing the risk of preeclampsia occurrence, including information on ethnicity. The same data were applied to the same neural architecture, after excluding the information on ethnicity, in order to study its importance on the correct classification yield. It has been found that the inclusion of information on ethnicity, deteriorates the prediction yield in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Most of the formalisms of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) that had been proposed and applied in the past are relatively simple in the sense that they handle the various interacting and time-varying concepts as zeroth-order dynamical components. That is, they do not accommodate time delays and growth exponential time constants. In modeling real life systems, especially in the general domain of socio-politico-economics, the time delays are often important and need to be accounted. Also, the various sensitivities associating the system concepts may be time dependent. In the present work, a previously proposed FCM has been extended to include time delays, time constants and time-dependent sensitivities. The system has been applied to the Cyprus politico-economic dynamics, with emphasis on possible scenarios involving the finding and exploitation of oil/gas in the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus. The existence of natural gas - estimated at about 7 trillion cubic feet - has recently been preliminarily verified. In the interrelated dynamics, various important dynamical parameters have been taken into account, reflecting the interests of primarily the republic of Cyprus, as well as the interests of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities and other countries involved, such as Greece, Turkey, United Kingdom, USA, Russia, Israel and the European Union. The main parameters that had been considered in the interrelated dynamics are nationalism, religiousness, unemployment, external debt, oil extraction and the general interests of the countries involved and those of the two communities.",

In addition to the financial sustainability entailed by such a trend, other challenges include the long delays in servicing patients, the consequent late detection of serious health issues, and the necessity of hospitalization. Despite certain risks, the majority of elderly people prefer to age in their own homes. As a matter of fact, studies show that elderly people who choose to keep living independently have longer life expectancies than those who join elderly homes. All these put together emphasize the need to develop technological solutions that autonomously monitor and enhance the well-being of the elderly in their homes.The uptake of the Internet of Things (IoT) opens new opportunities for how technology can assist people in improving their health and well-being along with improving the cost-effectiveness and quality of health and social services. These technological advancements result in various low-cost sensory equipment that benefit the healthcare of the aging population. Such technological innovation contributes to the development of applications, such as the administration of medication, voice command technologies, telemedicine, and others based on artificial intelligence. In particular, machine learning and predictive analysis combined with IoT will play an important role in the early detection of suspicious signs that, if left untreated, can lead to mobility, mental, and cognitive issues. Other applications may aggregate the high frequency, messy, and intermittent data. Such data can then be incorporated in the \u2026",

Ambulances, Rural Health Centers (RHC) or other remote health location such as Ships navigating in wide seas are common examples of possible emergency sites, while critical care telemetry and telemedicine home follow-ups are important issues of telemonitoring. In order to support the above different growing application fields we created a combined real-time and store and forward facility that consists of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit. This integrated system: can be used when handling emergency cases in ambulances, RHC or ships by using a mobile telemedicine unit at the emergency site and a base unit at the hospital-expert's site, enhances intensive health care provision by giving a mobile base unit to the ICU doctor while the telemedicine unit remains at the ICU patient site and enables home telemonitoring, by installing the telemedicine unit at the patient's home while the base unit remains at the physician's office or hospital. The system allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3\u201312 lead ECG, SPO2, NIBP, IBP, Temp) and still images of the patient. The transmission is performed through GSM mobile telecommunication network, through satellite links (where GSM is not available) or through Plain Old Telephony Systems (POTS) where available. Using this device a specialist doctor can telematically \"move\" to the patient's site and instruct unspecialized personnel when handling an emergency or telemonitoring case.

Furthermore, attention has been focused on the influence of cervical length (CL) for the prediction of spontaneous preterm delivery. Data for 59,313 cases of pregnant women were collected and processed. The final data used were those that were considered to offer clear indication on the significance of cervical length on the prediction. The cervical length was measured by sonography in the range of 22-24 weeks of gestation. Preliminary results showed a prediction rate of approximately 65% was attained through the application of a variety of neural network topologies. It has been found that if the cervical length is excluded from the input data, this results in an approximately 10% decrease in the prediction yield, as obtained from the neural network predictor, thus the sensitivity to cervical length is quite significant.",

The purpose of the developed fuzzy DDSS is the diagnosis of fetuses with Trisomy 21 (T21). The main reason behind the selection of this diagnosis problem is the need of sonographers to escape the preconditions of having specialized screening systems and being highly precise during prenatal screening tests. With the help of an intelligent fuzzy system, a sonographer can input the states of the prenatal screening tests in linguistic terms (which are based on his experience and knowledge) and get a diagnosis result.Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) has been chosen to be the model of the fuzzy DDSS model for this diagnosis problem.

This interesting phenomenon has attracted much research in the fields of attention and perception but has also inspired the implementation of several computational models. In the present study we have implemented a model of selective attention that is capable of modelling a variety of findings related to the Attentional Blink. Importantly, the model produces synchronization of neural activity to simulate the interaction between a low-level visual system and a high-level goal-maintenance system during the deployment of attention. Synchronization of neural activity within and across brain areas is typically observed when carrying out various tasks that involve the attentional processing of information. Thus, the model provides a neurally and computationally plausible account for the Attentional Blink and potentially other attentional tasks.",

            "Abstract": "Ornamentations in music play a significant role for the emotion which a performer or a composer aims to create. The automated identification of ornamentations enhances the understanding of music, which can be used as a feature for tasks such as performer identification or mood classification. Existing methods rely on a pre-processing step that performs note segmentation. We propose an alternative method by adapting the existing two-dimensional COSFIRE filter approach to onedimension (1D) for the automatic identification of ornamentations in monophonic folk songs. We construct a set of 1D COSFIRE filters that are selective for the 12 notes of the Western music theory. The response of a 1D COSFIRE filter is computed as the geometric mean of the differences between the fundamental frequency values in a local neighbourhood and the preferred values at the corresponding positions. We apply the proposed 1D COSFIRE filters to the pitch tracks of a song at every position along the entire signal, which in turn give response values in the range [0,1]. The 1D COSFIRE filters that we propose are effective to recognize meaningful musical information which can be transformed into symbolic representations and used for further analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in a new data set that we introduce, which comprises five monophonic Cypriot folk tunes consisting of 428 ornamentations. The proposed method is effective for the detection and recognition of ornamentations in singing folk music.",

This work addresses the issue: identifying the learning style of students, following the Kolb\u2019s learning cycle. To this purpose, we propose a three-layers Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with a dynamic Hebbian rule for learning styles recognition. The form of FCMs is designed by humans who determine its weighted interconnections among concepts. But the human factor may not be as reliable as it should be. Thus, a FCM model of the system allowing the adjustment of its weights using additional learners\u2019 characteristics such as the Learning Ability Factors. In this article, two consecutively interconnected FCM (in the form of a three layer FCM) are presented. The schema\u2019s efficiency has been tested and compared to known results after a fine-tuning of the weights of the causal interconnections among concepts. The simulations results of training the process system verify the effectiveness, validity and advantageous characteristics of those learning techniques for FCMs. The online recognition of learning styles by using threelayer Fuzzy Cognitive Map improves the accuracy of recognition obtained using Bayesian Networks that uses quantitative measurements of learning style taken from statistical samples. This improvement is due to the fuzzy nature of qualitative characterizations (such as learning styles), and the presence of intermediate level nodes representing Learning Ability Factors. Such factors are easily recognizable characteristics of a learner to improve \u2026",

Terms such as Medical Informatics, Computer Aided Diagnosis, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Computational Intelligent Medical System, and Machine Learning in Medicine, have been used and are being used in an effort to facilitate the main players with better tools and methods. Cognitive computing is the simulation of human thought processes in a computerized model. Cognitive computing involves self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing to mimic the way the human brain works. Different types of cognitive computing solutions offer various capabilities, such as, Learning and building knowledge from various structured and unstructured sources of information, Understanding natural language and interact with humans, Capturing the expertise of top experts, Improving the cognitive processes for better decision making, and making it more uniform across different professions. The closets attempt to combine efforts is offered by Computational Intelligence (CI) where at least three of the well tested approaches are combined, being Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Systems (FS), and Evolutionary Computing (EC). Therefore one can claim that CI= ANN+ FS+ EC. Our experience in applying the above in many real life environments generated some doubts whether the proposed equation is true because if it was true one could claim that CI is the same as Cognitive Computing (CC) which is not [1 \u2026",

The vessel was equipped with only three thrusters (one on top, a second at port and a third at starboard) for the control of its position, a condition that made the problem very difficult to tackle. Furthermore, the system is highly non-linear. A control system has been simulated for the regulation of the marine thrusters so that they stabilize the vehicle at a desired position, irrespective of external disturbances. The dynamical equations of a model of the vessel, when disturbed by cable forces and manipulated by the thrust forces that are generated by the propellers are described. The various vehicle parameters needed to describe its dynamic behaviour (mass, center of mass, added coefficients) have been estimated. The control schemes that were implemented are the classical PID, a neural control system, and a fuzzy control. It was found that a combination of classical and intelligent control gave the best results.",

The database was composed of 31611 cases of pregnant women. 31135 women did not show any chromosomal abnormalities, while the remaining 476 were confirmed as having a chromosomal anomaly of T21, T18, T13, or Turner Syndrome. From the total of 31611 cases, 8191 were kept as a totally unknown database that was only used for the verification of the predictability of the network. In this set, 7 were of the Turner syndrome, 14 of the Patau syndrome, 42 of the Edwards syndrome and 71 of the Down syndrome. For each subject, 10 parameters were considered to be the most influential at characterizing the risk of occurrence of these types of chromosomal anomalies. The best results were obtained when using a multi-layer neural structure having an input, an output and three hidden layers. For the case of the totally unknown verification set of the 8191 cases, 98.1% were correctly identified. The percentage of abnormal cases correctly predicted was 85.1%.

We investigate the plausibility of this hypothesis by implementing a computational model of visual selective attention that is guided by endogenous and exogenous goals (i.e., what is known as top down and bottom-up attention). The theoretical structure of this model is based on the temporal correlation of neural activity that was initially proposed by Niebur and Koch (1994). While a saliency map is created in the model at the initial stages of processing \u2026",

The main idea is that the operational genome is actually consisting of small computational blocks that tend to be interchanged and reused several times before they complete (or not) their lifecycle. By computing these blocks once and keeping them in memory for future possible reuse, the algorithm is allowed to run up to fifty times faster according experimental results maintaining a general case execution time reduction of four times. The consistency of the cache is maintained through simple rules that validate entries in a very straight forward manner during the genetic operations of cross over and mutation.",

The despeckle filters based on higher order statistics, anisotropic speckle diffusion, and geometric properties gave a slightly higher percentage of correct classifications score than the original images.",

Ambulances, Rural Health Centers (RHC) or other remote health location, Ships navigating in wide seas and Airplanes in flight are common examples of possible emergency sites, while critical care telemetry and telemedicine home follow-ups are important issues of patient monitoring. The telemedicine system is a combined real-time and store and forward facility that consists of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit. The telemedicine unit (patient site) allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3-12 lead ECG, SPO2, NIBP, IBP, Temp) and still images of the patient from the incident place to the base unit (consultation site). The transmission is performed through GSM, Satellite links or POTS. Using this device a specialist doctor can telematically \"move\" to the patient site and instruct medical personnel when handling a patient. The consultation site is equipped with a multimedia database able to store and manage the data collected by the system. The system was validated in four different countries using a standardized medical protocol.",

In this context, the present work suggests a new development framework which aims at estimating the level of complexity a certain e-commerce system encompasses and driving the selection of a long or short software process in terms of time and effort. The proposed framework utilizes a special form of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to define and assess critical business and organizational factors within small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) whishing to go ecommerce. This set of factors is enriched with other critical issues belonging to the quality requirements of the system and to the application type of services it aspires to offer. The set of critical factors identified is used to estimate the average complexity level of the system using numerical values to describe the contribution of each factor to the overall complexity. The level of complexity estimated dictates the adoption of either a short or a long version of the well-known WebE process for analysing, designing and implementing the e-commerce system required by an SME.",

The two domains contain images from the same classes, but these images look different. Recent approaches use generative adversarial networks in various configurations and architectures to perform the translation. By using GANs, they inevitably inherit their problems like training instability and mode collapse. We propose a novel approach to the problem that does not use a GAN. Instead, it relies on an hierarchical architecture that encapsulates information of the target domain by using individually trained networks. This hierarchical architecture is then trained as one unified deep network. Using this approach, we show that images from the original domain are translated to the target domain both for the case when there is a one-to-one correspondence between the images of the two domains \u2026",

This is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome, and is known as the Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, or trisomy G. In the last fifteen years it has become possible to observe these features by ultrasound examination in the third month of intrauterine life. About 75% of trisomy 21 fetuses have absent nasal bone. In the present work, neural network schemes that have been applied to a large data base of findings from ultrasounds of fetuses, aiming at generating a predictor for the risk of Down syndrome are reported. A good number of feed forward neural structures, both standard multilayer and multi-slab, were tried for the prediction. The database was composed of 23513 cases of fetuses in UK, provided by the Fetal Medicine Foundation in London. For each subject, 19 parameters were measured or recorded. Out of these, 19 parameters were considered as the most influential at characterizing the risk for this type of chromosomal defect. The best results obtained were with a multi-slab neural structure. In the training set there was a correct classification of the 98.9% cases of trisomy 21 and in the test set 100%. The prediction for the totally unknown verification test set was 93.3%.",

The term Troika, which comes from the Russian meaning 'group of three', was increasingly used during the recent Eurozone crisis. In February of 2012, the country proceeded to a second bailout package. At the same time a debt restructuring was applied, that included a private sector involvement (PSI) that resulted in 75% overall loss. Due to the strong economic ties between Greece and Cyprus, PSI had a substantial impact on the Cypriot economy. A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) system has been developed and used to study the repercussions of the Greek PSI on the economic dynamics of Cyprus and more specifically on the Cypriot banking sector. A novel FCM methodology has been used as regards to the proper identification, definition and initialization of the concepts and sensitivities, as well as on the updating rule.

Good training/testing classification performance was obtained on all data sets tested. The performance achieved was comparable to that of SVM classifiers.

In this context, the present work suggests a new development framework which aims at estimating the level of complexity a certain e-commerce system encompasses and driving the selection of a long or short software process in terms of time and effort. The proposed framework utilizes a special form of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to define and assess critical business and organizational factors within small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) whishing to go ecommerce. This set of factors is enriched with other critical issues belonging to the quality requirements of the system and to the application type of services it aspires to offer. The set of critical factors identified is used to estimate the average complexity level of the system using numerical values to describe the contribution of each factor to the overall complexity. The level of complexity estimated dictates the adoption of either a short or a long version of the well-known WebE process for analysing, designing and implementing the e-commerce system required by an SME.",

The final data used were those that were considered to offer clear indication on the significance of cervical length on the prediction. The cervical length was measured by sonography in the range of 22-24 weeks of gestation. Preliminary results showed a prediction rate of approximately 65% was attained through the application of a variety of neural network topologies.

Several studies exist that identify similarities between the Cypriot folk music and Byzantine music [Kallinikos, T.(1951), Tobolis S.(1980)]. On the other hand, very little information exists on the possible influence of eastern music such as Arabic and Turkish on Cypriot folk music. The main musical instruments that are used in the Cypriot folk music are the lute, violin, a kind of wooden Cypriot flute called \u201cpithkiavli\u201d and a Cypriot percussion instrument called \u201ctamboucha\u201d. The existence of the lute and violin in the Cypriot folk music creates a complex combination between Greek and Turkish traditional rhythms. In a previous study [Neocleous et. al (2012)], non equal temperament between notes was identified in some of the Cypriot folk songs, using pitch histograms. The present work is focused on the Cypriot flute \u201cpithkiavli\u201d[Michael, E.(2008).]. This is compared to the Turkish\u201cney\u201d[http://compmusic. upf. edu/node/55] as well as to western wood instruments such as flute, saxophone, bassoon and oboe.",

In this sense, any chosen predefined class or characteristic may have a positive or negative effect on the image generation process, meaning that it can be instructed to be present or absent from the generated sample. We argue that allowing discriminative information in the form of feature detectors to be present in the latent representation of the autoencoder can be generally beneficial.

The database was composed of 6838 cases of pregnant women in UK, provided by the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine in London.

These polynomial fits are not accurate in capturing the performance of propellers, and also do not account for cavitating conditions. In the present work, neural networks have been developed that predict the performance of marine propellers in all tested conditions, including cavitation.

            "Abstract": "The USN-series of experimental data on marine propeller performance (Denny et al, 1989) were compared with fitted Wageningen B-series data. A Kohonen network has been used to attempt finding non-obvious similarities between the two data sets. The USN-series has been tested under cavitating conditions, while the available B-series not. A non-linear fit of the USN-series, including information on cavitation number /spl sigma/, has been developed and compared with a neural network function approximation. Using the Kohonen classification results, the non-linear regression was re-applied with slightly improved results. In overall, the feedforward neural network architecture mapping gave the best fit both in a statistical correlation measure and in the maximum percentage deviation measure.",

Is it possible to preserve privacy at all nowadays? Do Member States consider the possibility that the level of data protection may influence whether data becomes open? The session that dealt with these issues during the eHealth Forum held in Riga in May 2015, provided an opportunity to discuss open healthcare systems and the possibilities offered by accumulated data throughout Europe. In a special, Ministerial Track Panel Discussion:\" Privacy and Data Protection in Healthcare\", the related issues were discussed and debated further. The increasing number of accumulated medical records creates not only benefits but also risks. Both privacy and protection of personal data is of value in the European Union and each of its Member States. Maintaining the privacy of sensitive health data is becoming a challenge also for the increasingly used cloud computing. The day when all the information systems will be stored in the cloud is close.

We cross-validated our results using ten different training and test sets and we repeated our experiments using different parameters of GMLVQ. We identified the seven most relevant markers and we found that with these seven markers we obtain results that are comparable with the results that can be achieved with the full set of 18 markers.

            "Abstract": "The objective of this work is to use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the yearly performance prediction of thermosyphonic type solar domestic water heating (SDWH) systems. Twentyseven SDWH systems have been tested and modelled according to the procedures outlined in the standard ISO 9459-2 at three locations in Greece. These data were used for training and testing the networks. Three neural networks were trained to perform different tasks. The first one predicts the system performance characteristics on a daily basis whereas the other two predict the system long-term performance. The collector areas of the considered systems were varying between 1.81 m2 and 4.38 m2. Open and closed thermosyphonic systems have been considered both with horizontal and vertical storage tanks. In this way the networks were trained to accept and handle a number of unusual cases. From the trained networks three dynamic library link (DLL) files were produced and used in different workbooks of the same spreadsheet, using the CALL function. The results from the first workbook, which are produced from the input data described above, are used in the other two to produce the annual results thus reducing drastically the experimental data required. The method was validated by using actual data for one system, which the networks have not seen before. The accuracy obtained indicate that the prediction of the solar energy output of the system for a draw-off equal to the volume of the storage tank is within 3.5% and for the same parameter and the average quantity of the hot water per month for the two demand water temperatures is within 7.8%.

The vessel had only three thrusters for the control of its position, something that made the problem very difficult. Furthermore the system is highly non-linear. A control system has been simulated for the regulation of the marine thrusters so that they stabilize the vehicle at a desired position, irrespective of external disturbances. The dynamical equations of a model of the vessel, when disturbed by cable forces and by the thrusts generated by the propellers, are described. The various vehicle parameters needed to describe its dynamics (mass, center of mass, added coefficients) have been estimated. The control schemes implemented were the classical PID, neural control, and fuzzy control. It was found that a combination of classical and intelligent control gave the best results.",
