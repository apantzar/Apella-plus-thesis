In this study, we demonstrate how ultrasound video noise reduction, employed as a pre-processing step, used in conjunction with High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), can significantly improve diagnostic quality at considerably lower bitrate demands than conventional H.264/AVC source encoding. Three video despeckle filters were investigated, namely: linear filtering (DsFlsmv), hybrid median filtering (DsFhmedian), and speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (DsFsrad). The methods were tested using ten atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound videos. Speckle filtering was applied at a frame-level basis. Experimental results were obtained using both subjective (by two clinical experts) and objective video quality assessment. The best achieving \u2026",

The objective of this work was to develop an automated image retrieval and classification system for the retrieval of similar carotid plaque ultrasound images, which will assist the physician in making his diagnostic decision based on similar previous cases. The neural selforganizing map (SOM) and the statistical K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers were used for the retrieval and the classification of the carotid plaques into symptomatic or asymptomatic. Twenty different feature sets including texture, shape, morphological, histogram and correlogram features were extracted from the carotid plaque images and the classification results were further combined in order to improve the success rate. The results on a dataset of 274 carotid plaque ultrasound images show that image retrieval and classification for carotid plaque image are feasible and that features like multi-region histogram or texture can be used successfully for the identification of cases with similar symptoms output.",

            "Abstract": "Ultrasound medical video has the potential in differentiating between normal and abnormal tissue and structure. Ultrasound imaging is used in border identification and texture characterisation of the atherosclerotic carotid plaque in the common carotid artery (CCA), the identification and measurement of the intima-media thickness (IMT) and the lumen diameter that are very important in the assessment of cardiovascular disease. However, visual perception is reduced by speckle noise affecting the quality of ultrasound B-mode imaging. Noise reduction is therefore essential for increasing the visual quality or as a pre-processing step for further automated analysis, such as the video segmentation of the IMT and the atherosclerotic carotid plaque in ultrasound video sequences. In order to facilitate this analysis, the authors have developed a video analysis software toolbox based on MATLAB\u00ae that uses video despeckling, texture analysis and image quality evaluation techniques to automate the pre-processing and complement the disease evaluation in ultrasound CCA videos. The proposed software, which is based on a graphical user interface (GUI), incorporates video normalisation, 4 different despeckle filtering techniques (DsFlsmv, DsFhmedian, DsFkuwahara and DsFsrad), 65 texture features, 11 quantitative video quality metrics and objective video quality evaluation. The software was validated on 10 ultrasound videos of the CCA, by comparing its results with quantitative visual analysis performed by two medical experts. It was shown that the filters DsFlsmv, and DsFhmedian improved video quality perception (based on the expert\u2019s assessment \u2026",

We compare our approach with phase-based estimation developed by Fleet and Jepson and also the original optical flow method by Horn and Schunck. An advantage of the proposed method is that it provides for dense estimates that remain accurate over the entire video.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of image zooming during ultrasound scanning on textural features and to test whether or not resolution standardisation decreases the variability introduced. Eighteen still B-mode images of carotid plaques were zoomed during carotid scanning (zoom factor 1.3) and both images were transferred to a PC and normalised.

In order to support the above different growing application fields we created a combined real-time and store and forward facility that consists of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit. This integrated system: can be used when handling emergency cases in ambulances, RHC or ships by using a mobile telemedicine unit at the emergency site and a base unit at the hospital-expert's site, enhances intensive health care provision by giving a mobile base unit to the ICU doctor while the telemedicine unit remains at the ICU patient site and enables home telemonitoring, by installing the telemedicine unit at the patient's home while the base unit remains at the physician's office or hospital. The system allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3\u201312 lead ECG, SPO2, NIBP, IBP, Temp) and still images of the patient. The transmission is performed through GSM mobile telecommunication network, through satellite links (where GSM is not available) or through Plain Old Telephony Systems (POTS) where available.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate a semi-automated analysis system for measuring the diaphragmatic motion and estimating the maximum relaxation rate (MRR_SAUS) from ultrasound M-mode images of the diaphragmatic muscle. The system was evaluated on 27 M-mode ultrasound images of the diaphragmatic muscle [20 with no resistance (NRES) and 7 with resistance (RES)]. We computed semi-automated ultrasound MRR measurements on all NRES/RES images, using the proposed system (MRR_SAUS = 3.94 \u00b1 0.91/4.98 \u00b1 1.98 [1/s]), and compared them with the manual measurements made by a clinical expert (MRR_MUS = 2.36 \u00b1 1.19/5.8 \u00b1 2.1 [1/s],) and those made by a reference manual method \u2026",

The accuracy and reproducibility of this method was tested using 35 longitudinal ultrasound images of carotid arteries and the results were compared with the manual delineations of an expert. The comparison showed that the computerized method gives satisfactory results with no manual correction needed in most of the cases.

The purpose of this paper is to review the emerging VR applications developed for the evaluation and treatment of patients with neurological diseases. We start by discussing the impact of novel VR tasks that encourage and facilitate the patient's empowerment and involvement in the rehabilitation process. Then, a systematic review was carried out on six well known electronic libraries using the terms: \u2018Virtual Reality AND Neurorehabilitation\u2019, or \u2018Head Mounted Display AND Neurorehabilitation\u2019. This review focused on fully-immersive VR systems for which 12 relevant studies published in the time span of the last five years (from 2014 to 2019) were identified. Overall, this review paper examined the use of VR in certain neurological conditions such as dementia, stroke, spinal cord injury, parkinson\u2019s and multiple sclerosis. Most of the studies reveal positive results suggesting that VR is a feasible and effective tool in the treatment of neurological disorders. In addition, the finding of this systematic literature review suggested that low-cost, immersive VR technologies can prove to be effective for clinical rehabilitation in healthcare and home-based setting with practical implications and uses. The development of VR technologies in recent years has resulted in more accessible and affordable solutions that can still provide promising results.

Based on the color charts derived, the following observations can be made: (i) the bruise is red for day 1, (ii) there is no dominant color for day 2, whereas for day 3, blue is becoming slightly dominant, (iii) green is becoming dominant for days 4-6, with yellow color emerging, (iv) for day 7, there is coexistence of green and yellow, (v) yellow is highly dominant for days 7 to 14, with brown emerging.

A despeckle-filtering evaluation protocol is proposed, a brief literature review, as well as an image despeckle-filtering (IDF) toolbox [3] and a video despeckle filtering (VDF) [4] software toolbox are presented. Moreover, selected applications for ultrasound image and VDF techniques are illustrated. Speckle is a multiplicative noise [1-4], which degrades ultrasound images and videos and negatively influences the image and video interpretation, diagnosis and visual appearance [5]. Noise speckle reduction is therefore essential for improving the visual observation quality or as a preprocessing step for further automated analysis, such as image/ video segmentation, texture analysis and encoding in ultrasound image and video. On the other hand, speckle can also be used as an information carrier on the underlying tissue properties. As illustrated in the previous chapters in Part I (see also Part IV), this implies it can be used, for example, for tissue classification. Alternatively, assuming that speckle moves in the image in the same way as the underlying tissue, it allows for tissue motion estimation using one of the many speckle tracking approaches presented in literature. A large number of despeckle-filtering techniques have been proposed in the past years for ultrasound images and very few for videos, which is usually applied for improving their visualization and interpretation or as a preprocessing step for further image/video analysis.

Mammographic breast density has been recognized as a very important breast cancer risk and can also mask abnormalities. Information regarding mammographic breast density may be used for planning individualized breast cancer screening and treatment. Thus, breast density is increasingly assessed as the limitations of a onefits-all method of screening and Computer Aided Detection become more apparent. The presented work investigates the use of Amplitude-Modulation Frequency-Modulation (AM-FM) models in the evaluation of multiscale Instantaneous Amplitude (IA) features for the characterization of breast density. AM-FM models provide a meaningful and concise method to model digital images. The IA evaluated at different frequency scales is used to capture the relative variations in the breast tissue characteristic to the different breast density classes. Normalized histograms of the IA across the different frequency scales-estimated using multiscale Dominant Component Analysis-are used to model the breast density classes. Classification of a new mammogram into one of the density categories is achieved using the k-nearest neighbor method and the Euclidean distance metric. The method is evaluated using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System on the Medical Image Analysis Society mammographic database and the results are presented and compared to other methods in the literature. The presented method allows breast density classification accuracy reaching over 80%.",

Motion estimation using optical flow models requires the modification of several parameters to satisfy the optical flow constraint as well as the level of imposed smoothness. Furthermore, except in simulations or mostly unrealistic cases, there is no ground truth to use for validating the velocity estimates. This problem is present in all real video sequences that are used as input to motion estimation algorithms.

For medical video communications, the emerging video compression and network standards support low-delay and high-resolution video transmission, at the clinically acquired resolution and frame rates. Such advances are expected to further promote the adoption of m-health systems for remote diagnosis and emergency incidents in daily clinical practice. This paper compares the performance of the emerging high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard to the current state-of-the-art H.264/AVC standard. The experimental evaluation, based on five atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound videos encoded at QCIF, CIF, and 4CIF resolutions demonstrates that 50% reductions in bitrate requirements is possible for equivalent clinical quality.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we discuss the use of clinical quality criteria in the assessment and design of ultrasound video compression systems. Our goal is to design efficient systems that can be used to transmit quality ultrasound videos at the lowest possible bitrates. This led us to the development of a spatiallyvarying encoding scheme, where quantization levels are spatially varying as a function of the diagnostic significance of the video. Diagnostic Regions of Interest (ROIs) for carotid ultrasound medical video are defined, which are then used as input for Flexible Macroblock Ordering (FMO) slice encoding. Diagnostically relevant FMO slice encoding is attained by enabling variable quality slice encoding, tightly coupled by each region\u2019s diagnostic importance. Redundant Slices (RS) utilization increases compressed video\u2019s resilience over error prone transmission mediums.We present preliminary findings on three carotid ultrasound videos at CIF resolution, for packet loss rates up to 30%. Subjective quality evaluation incorporates a clinical rating system that provides for independent evaluations of the different parts of the video. Experimental results show that encoded videos attain enhanced diagnostic performance under noisy environments, while at the same time achieving significant bandwidth requirements reductions.",

Texture analysis, evaluates the statistical properties of the tissue image quantitatively, therefore, it could detect smaller scale changes of neurodegeneration. Entorhinal cortex is the first region affected and no study has investigated texture analysis on this region before. This study aims to differentiate AD patients from Normal Control (NC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects using entorhinal cortex texture features. Furthermore, it was evaluated whether texture has association to MCI beyond that of volume, to evaluate if may precede atrophy development. Texture features extracted from 194 NC, 200 MCI, 84 MCI who converted to AD (MCIc) and 130 AD subjects. Receiving operating characteristic curves, determined the performance of the various features in discriminating the groups, and a predictive model was used to predict conversion of MCIc subjects to AD. An area under curve of 0.872, 0.710, 0.730 and 0.764 was seen between NC vs AD, NC vs MCI, MCI vs MCIc and MCI vs AD subjects, respectively. Including entorhinal cortex volume improved the AUCs to 0.914, 0.740, 0.756 and 0.780, respectively. For the disease prediction, binary logistic regression was applied on five randomly selected test groups and achieved on average AUC's of 0.760 and 0.764 on the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Entorhinal cortex texture features were significantly different between the four groups and in many cases provided better results compared to \u2026",

As presented until now this can be used to determine cerebrovascular risk stratification. The aim of this study is to continue the effort being done to estimate the risk based on the characteristics from ultrasound carotid images by applying an approach that produces lower and upper bounds for the conditional probability of the risk for a stroke event. The analysis is based on ultrasonic plaque texture features and clinical features in patients that were followed up for eight years and had asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis at the baseline. The important addition of this work is that the proposed approach is much more informative than conventional techniques by providing reliable probabilities instead of a plain yes/no answer.",

This rapid increase in the size of data has generated the need to compress the data in order to reduce the storage capacity requirements and the memory required at run time to perform analysis on the data. The availability of so many markers across the whole genome has created opportunities for new methodologies to be implemented that take advantage of the relatively high density of the markers to perform analyses that take into account the Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), an effect where some combinations of genetic markers are non-randomly associated.

Clouds that backscatter more electromagnetic radiation consist of larger droplets of rain and therefore they produce more rain. The idea is to predict rainfall rate by using weather radar instead of rain-gauges measuring rainfall on the ground. In an experiment during two days in June and August 1997 over the Italian-Swiss Alps, data from a weather radar and surrounding rain-gauges were collected at the same time. The neural SOM and the statistical KNN classifier were implemented for the classification task using the radar data as input and the rain-gauge measurements as output. The rainfall rate on the ground was predicted based on the radar reflections with an average error rate of 23%. The results in this work show that the prediction of rainfall rate based on weather radar measurements is possible.",

            "Abstract": "The use of multiscale AM-FM analysis systems has been recently demonstrated in a variety of applications in medical image analysis. In all of these applications, a fixed filter-bank is used as a preprocessing step for estimating different AM-FM components from different scales. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce the use of an adaptive, multiscale AM-FM approach that searches for the optimal filter-bank specification for use in image classification. We demonstrate an example application in hysteroscopy imaging, for identification of gynaecological cancer, where the optimal filter-bank turns out to be circularly symmetric.",

De novo drug design involves searching an immense space of feasible, druglike molecules to select those with the highest chances of becoming drugs using computational technology. Traditionally, de novo design has focused on designing molecules satisfying a single objective, such as similarity to a known ligand or an interaction score, and ignored the presence of the multiple objectives required for druglike behavior.

The telemedicine system is a combined real-time and store and forward facility that consists of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit. The telemedicine unit (patient site) allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3-12 lead ECG, SPO2, NIBP, IBP, Temp) and still images of the patient from the incident place to the base unit (consultation site). The transmission is performed through GSM, Satellite links or POTS. Using this device a specialist doctor can telematically \"move\" to the patient site and instruct medical personnel when handling a patient. The consultation site is equipped with a multimedia database able to store and manage the data collected by the system. The system was validated in four different countries using a standardized medical protocol.",

Using a compression method based on visualization modes and a reliable method that adapts to the channel conditions, overall performance results are improved compared to classical approaches. The echocardiogram transmission using a compression method based on visualization modes requires lower bandwidth than without considering visualization modes. Furthermore, if the proposed reliability method is also used, the echocardiogram is more often visualized with adequate clinical quality than compressing the echocardiogram without distinguishing the visualization modes and without using a reliability method for the available dataset. The reduction in the bandwidth ranges from 29 kbps to 166 kbps for the simulated scenarios.",

In this work, we evaluate image quality criteria based on mean square error, signal to noise error, and quality and structural similarity indices on ultrasound imaging of the carotid artery. These criteria as well as statistical and texture features were computed on 80 images recorded from two different ultrasound scanners before and after despeckle filtering, and after despeckle filtering and normalization. Results showed that image quality was improved after despeckle filtering and normalization for both scanners. This finding is also in agreement with the optical perception evaluation carried out by two vascular experts.",

Clinically, there is strong interest in identifying how the composition and texture of the media layer (ML) can be associated with the risk of stroke. In this study, we use 2-D amplitude-modulation frequency-modulation (AM-FM) analysis of the intima-media complex (IMC), the ML, and intima layer (IL) of the CCA to detect texture changes as a function of age and sex. The study was performed on 100 ultrasound images acquired from asymptomatic subjects at risk of atherosclerosis. To investigate texture variations associated with age, we separated them into three age groups: 1) patients younger than 50; 2) patients aged between 50 and 60 years old; and 3) patients over 60 years old. We also separated the patients by sex. The IMC, ML, and IL were segmented manually by a \u2026",

In this paper it is investigated whether Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) can generate clusters associated with a disease based on the genetic patterns of subjects. A batch categorical SOM that can handle missing data was used on Genome Wide Association (GWA) data on Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The association of the clusters generated with the disease were initially tested using the Pearson's chi square test and then the weights of the top clusters were used for investigating for SNP patterns. The results of the analyses reveal statistically significant associations between the generated clusters and the disease, indicating that SOMs can be used for multi-loci associations.",

Furthermore, plaque motion exhibited larger deviations and more abrupt changes than arterial wall motion.",

The same stimulus is used in myogenic vestibular evoked potentials which has been shown to evoke potentials in the vestibular division of the vestibulocochlear nerve. METHODS: A whole head recording with surface EEG electrodes was performed using high intensity clicks in one normal volunteer to determine the best recording position for vestibular evoked potentials. The results were compared to responses at moderate click intensities used for brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs). The difference in the location of the two responses on the scalp was assumed to be from the vestibular system. RESULTS: Responses specific to the high intensity clicks were best obtained in the parietal areas, with no reproducible responses obtained in the same area with moderate intensity clicks normally used in BAEPs. Recordings in neurologically normal volunteers showed a consistent response with a negative polarity at around 3 ms, which we therefore called N3. Two case studies are presented. The first case is a patient with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss with NVESTEPs present, suggesting that NVESTEPs is not a cochlear response. The second case is a patient with multiple sclerosis with demyelinating lesions in the pons and an unobtainable NVESTEP response. CONCLUSION: NVESTEPs is a possible new diagnostic technique that may be specific for the vestibular pathway. It has potential use in patients with symptoms of dizziness, subclinical symptoms in multiple sclerosis, and in disorders \u2026",

An analysis of different computerized techniques for CIMT measurement and their clinical impacts on the same patient data set is lacking. Here we compared and assessed five computerized CIMT algorithms against three expert analysts\u2019 manual measurements on a data set of 1088 patients from two centers. Inter- and intra-observer variability was assessed, and the computerized CIMT values were compared with those manually obtained. The CIMT measurements were used to assess the correlation with clinical parameters, cardiovascular event prediction through a generalized linear model and the Kaplan\u2013Meier hazard ratio. CIMT measurements obtained with a skilled analyst's segmentation and the computerized segmentation were comparable in statistical \u2026",

Furthermore, attention has been focused on the influence of cervical length (CL) for the prediction of spontaneous preterm delivery. Data for 59,313 cases of pregnant women were collected and processed. The final data used were those that were considered to offer clear indication on the significance of cervical length on the prediction. The cervical length was measured by sonography in the range of 22-24 weeks of gestation. Preliminary results showed a prediction rate of approximately 65% was attained through the application of a variety of neural network topologies. It has been found that if the cervical length is excluded from the input data, this results in an approximately 10% decrease in the prediction yield, as obtained from the neural network predictor, thus the sensitivity to cervical length is quite significant.",

Amplitude Modulation-Frequency Modulation (AM-FM) models provide effective representations through physically meaningful descriptors of complex non-stationary structures that can differentiate between the different lesions and normal structure. Based on AM-FM models, medical images are decomposed into AM-FM components where the instantaneous frequency provides a descriptor of local texture, the instantaneous amplitude captures slowly-varying brightness variations, while the instantaneous phase provides for a powerful descriptor of location, generalizing the traditionally important role of phase in the Fourier Analysis of images.

We derive our new image processing models based on the International Labor Organization (ILO) standard for assessing opacity shape and profusion. Pattern spectrum analysis is used for opacity shape and profusion measurements. Opacity enhancement is done using a novel AM-FM model. We use radial pattern spectra to detect the presence of opacities within the ROI, and measure opacity density. The opacity shape and profusion measurement results compare favorably with the ILO standards. The AM-FM model appears to be well-suited for single opacity enhancement.",

Despite this momentum towards m-Health systems and especially e-Emergency systems, wireless channels remain error prone, while the absence of objective quality metrics (Wang & Bovik, 2009) limits the ability of providing medical video of adequate diagnostic quality at a required bitrate. Recently, new image and video quality metrics have been proposed, for evaluating the original and transmitted (or despeckled)(Loizou & Pattichis, 2008) video over a communication path, but these have not yet been applied to wireless transmission. The development of effective medical video streaming systems requires the implementation of error-resilient methods that are also diagnostically relevant. Although a plethora of studies has been published in video transmission, very few have focused on the difficulties associated with the wireless transmission of medical ultrasound video.

We compare throughput, fairness and time complexity of GA-BAVP and CCO-BAVP for several node topologies. The results on maximising the throughput obtained with GA-BAVP and CCO-BAVP are in close agreement, however when considering fairness GA-BAVP outperforms CCO-BAVP, especially for more complex topologies, like the 7-node network, without abundant link capacity. Convergence of the two algorithms appears similar, with GA-BAVP outperforming CCO-BAVP in initial stages, and vice-versa for longer time scales. However as the problem complexity increases the solution time for the genetic algorithm does not increase as fast as the classical constrained optimisation algorithm. A hybrid \u2026",

Current AM-FM reconstruction methods are based on Dominant Component Analysis (DCA), multi-scale DCA, and Channel Component Analysis (CCA). The paper introduce a variation on CCA that uses elastic net regression to minimize the number of channels that are used in the reconstruction. The new approach is validated using a family of Gabor filterbanks that is parameterized by an overlap index. The results show that the elastic net regression component selection algorithm performs significantly better than multiscale DCA.",

            "Abstract": "This paper is a work-in-progress report on the instructional design of Virtual Telemedicine, a simulation-based serious game in health-care. The problem that this game addresses is the need to train practicing doctors and medical students for problem-solving in real-life scenarios through a telemedicine system. In medical emergency situations a doctor is asked to make important decisions for the treatment of a patient within minutes or even seconds. His actions result in saving or losing a patient\u2019s life. The importance of the development of this game lies on the opportunities it provides to students for practicing their patient-treatment skills in a safe and controlled e-learning environment that simulates real-life conditions but avoids the risks associated with dealing with real patients. The game makes use of data from an electrocardiogram (ECG) and its overall learning goal is for practicing doctors or medical students to learn how to respond to a medical emergency situation to treat the symptoms of a virtual patient by taking specific actions and examining their results based on immediate feedback provided by both the system and the virtual patient. Three scenarios are currently developed in the game: a) Precordial pain, in which the patient faces an acute coronary syndrome, b) Palpitations, in which the patient experiences cardiac arrhythmias and c) Syncope, in which the patient is diagnosed with an atrioventricular block. The paper reports on the instructional design objectives of the game, describes the prototype scenario and outlines the changes made as part of the game\u2019s redesign and development to increase its pedagogical value.

Images from histopathological biopsy slides are described and these are accessed in terms of the properties of either individual nuclei or groups of cell nuclei present in the slide. Visual similarity of cases is specified in terms of a diagnostic index, commonly known as the H-score, which incorporates the heterogeneity of nuclear staining intensity, as well as the percentage of nuclei staining at specific intensities.

Texture features analysis was carried out in NAWM areas selected from transverse sections of T2-weighted MRI scans acquired from 10 untreated subjects that had developed their first neurological-demyelinating event (CIS). All NAWM areas and demyelinating lesions were manually segmented by an experienced multiple sclerosis (MS) neurologist. The patients were twice scanned with brain MRI with an interval of 6-12 months (time 0, initial MRI and time 6-12, repeated MRI scan).

In the majority of medical conditions common therapeutic approaches are usually effective in only a small percentage of the patient population. Recent scientific discoveries implicate as possible causes of this lack of effect the multifactorial nature of most diseases and the patient variability in disease expression, genetic disposition, and environmental exposures. It has become apparent that in order to improve the response to therapy and long term prognosis, treatment must be specifically tailored to the disease and the patient. Precision medicine is an attempt to maximize effectiveness by taking into account individual variability in clinical presentation, medical history, genes, environment, and lifestyle.

More often than not the graphs to be designed need to satisfy multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives e.g. total length, cost, complexity or other shape and property limitations. In this paper we present our approach to solving the multi-objective graph design problem and obtaining a set of multiple equivalent compromising solutions. Our method uses multi-objective evolutionary graphs, a graph-specific meta-heuristic optimization method that combines evolutionary algorithms with graph theory and local search techniques exploiting domain-specific knowledge.

This study presents a systematic review of the relevant literature between the years 2004 and 2015, focusing on medical teleoperated robotic systems which have witnessed tremendous growth over the examined period. A thorough insight of telerobotics systems discussing design concepts, enabling technologies (namely robotic manipulation, telecommunications, and vision systems), and potential applications in clinical practice is provided, while existing limitations and future trends are also highlighted. A representative paradigm of the short-distance case is the da Vinci Surgical System which is described in order to highlight relevant issues. The long-distance telerobotics concept is exemplified through a case study on diagnostic ultrasound scanning. Moreover, the present review provides a classification into short- and long-distance telerobotic systems, depending on the distance from which they are operated. Telerobotic systems are further categorized with respect to their application field. For the reviewed systems are also examined their engineering characteristics and the employed robotics technology. The current status of the field, its significance, the potential, as well as the challenges that lie ahead are thoroughly discussed.",

Five parameters were obtained, two from the time domain (turns and zero crossings per second), two from the frequency domain (median frequency and total power per second) and one from the bi-frequency domain (bispectrum peak amplitude). The KNN classifier with the leave-one-out method was used for classification whereas the Self Organising Feature Maps (SOFM) was used for cluster analysis and visualization of the group separation. Results have shown that separation of normal subjects from neuromuscular diseased patients is possible with a success rate of the order of 83%, whereas separation of subjects from the two types of patients (myopathy and neuropathy) is again high and of the order of 77%.",

Therefore, image intensity normalization methods should be applied to magnetic resonance (MR) images prior to further image analysis. The objective of this work was to investigate six different MRI intensity normalization methods and propose the most appropriate for the pre-processing of brain T2-weighted MR images acquired from 22 symptomatic untreated multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects and 10 healthy volunteers.

            "Abstract": "The thickness of the intima-media complex (IMC) of the common carotid artery (CCA) wall is important in the evaluation of the risk for the development of atherosclerosis. This paper presents a fully automated algorithm for the segmentation of the IMC. The segmentation of the IMC of the CCA wall is important for the evaluation of the intima media thickness (IMT) on B-mode ultrasound images. The presented algorithm is based on active contours and active contours without edges. It begins with image normalization, followed by speckle removal. The level set formulation of Chan and Vese using random initialization provides a segmentation of the CCA ultrasound (US) images into different distinct regions, one of which corresponds to the carotid wall region above the lumen whilst another corresponds to the carotid wall region below the lumen and includes the IMC.

            "Abstract": "Serious games have the potential to be an important teaching tool for both formal and informal education because of their affordances of interactivity and motivation, engaging users, providing a platform for active learning, being customized to learners, providing immediate feedback and including immersive activities.  Serious games for medical education is a growing domain. Across the healthcare sector, there is growing interest in improving and sustaining interaction and engagement using game technologies. Game environments provide a safe and controlled setting within which players can learn in an engaging way. Health games for practitioners, such as doctors and nurses, tend to be simulation-based and used for training.  This paper is a report on the design and development of the serious game called \u201cVirtual Telemedicine\u201d. The game responds to the need to train doctors for problem-solving in real-life situations of medical care. In the prototype scenario, the user, a practicing doctor, responds to a medical emergency situation to treat the symptoms of a virtual patient by taking specific actions and examining their results based on immediate feedback provided by both the system and the virtual patient. Virtual Telemedicine was created as part of the meducator Best Practice Network. mEducator enables specialized state-of-the-art medical educational content to be discovered, retrieved, shared and re-used across European higher academic institutions. The game makes use of data from an electrocardiogram (ECG), a transthoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, as detected \u2026",

It was proposed but not thoroughly investigated that the media thickness (MT), its composition and texture may be indicative for identifying the risk of stroke and differentiating between patients with high and low risk. In this study we present an automated method for segmentation of the media layer and measurement of its thickness in ultrasound images of the CCA. The snakes segmentation method was used, and was evaluated on 100 images against manual segmentation.

The proposed technique utilizes an improved snake initialization method, and an improved validation of the segmentation method. We have tested and clinically validated the segmentation technique on 100 longitudinal ultrasound images of the carotid artery based on manual measurements by two vascular experts, and a set of different evaluation criteria based on statistical measures and univariate statistical analysis.

The video is segmented for a time period of at least one full cardiac cycle by initializing the algorithm in the first video frame. Human manual assistance may be provided if needed. The atherosclerotic plaque borders are tracked and segmented in the subsequent frames. We also propose an initialization method for positioning the snake as close as possible to the plaque borders, based on morphology operators, where initial contours are estimated every 20 video frames. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on 43 real CCA digitized videos from B-mode longitudinal ultrasound segments and is compared to the manual segmentations of an expert, available every 20 frames in a time span of 3-5 s, covering in general two cardiac cycles. The segmentation results were very promising, according to the expert objective evaluation, with a true-negative fraction (TNF) specificity of 83.7% + 7.6%, a true-positive fraction (TPF) sensitivity of 85.42% + 8.1%, between the ground truth and the proposed segmentation method, a kappa index (KI) of 84.6% and an overlap index (OI) of 74.7%. We also computed the cardiac state identification for the CCA. It is shown that the integrated system presented in this chapter can be used for the video segmentation of the CCA plaque in ultrasound videos.",

The support of primary healthcare, home care and the continuous education of physicians are the three major issues that the proposed platform is trying to facilitate. The proposed system is based on state-of-the-art telemedicine systems and is able to provide the following healthcare services: i) Telecollaboration and teleconsultation services between remotely located healthcare providers, ii) telemedicine services in emergencies, iii) home telecare services for \"at risk\" citizens such as the elderly and patients with chronic diseases, and iv) eLearning services for the continuous training through seminars of both healthcare personnel (physicians, nurses etc) and persons supporting \"at risk\" citizens. These systems support data transmission over simple phone lines, internet connections, integrated services digital network/digital subscriber lines, satellite links, mobile networks (GPRS/3G), and wireless local area networks. The data corresponds, among others, to voice, vital biosignals, still medical images, video, and data used by eLearning applications.

With the use of laparoscopy, patients\u2019 scarring and hospitalization periods have been considerably reduced. Furthermore, computer and robotics technologies have introduced novelties that enhance the surgeons\u2019 skills to accomplish high precision during the complex surgery process. Robotic surgery became reality before the end of last century. Key developments include the Aesop voice-controlled camera-holding device and the Zeus robotic system, both by Computer Motion. A leading role has also been played by the company Intuitive Surgical, that developed the Da Vinci Surgical Robot. A master-slave system architecture was used in relation to both abovementioned robotic systems, where the surgeon is located at a console at the side of the operating table and controls the surgical instruments. The two companies merged in 2003 and the resulting Da Vinci Surgical Robot dominated the market. Other remarkable surgical robots have also been developed for applications including orthopedic surgery, stereotactic brain surgery and urological interventions.  In United States, the development, testing and evaluation of any medical robotic device is controlled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In Europe apply similar regulatory requirements but they are not identical and products are often required to comply with both. This study briefly describes the FDA regulatory approval process and discusses the current status of the medical robotic systems market, as well as the future trends.

Discordant plaques exhibited significant spread in motion orientation at different parts of the cardiac cycle, especially at systole. We developed a real-time motion analysis system that applies Farneback's method to estimate velocities between consecutive video frames. For our purposes, we allow a 100msec time interval between the video frames used in the analysis. This approach allows us to analyze significant motions associated with a larger time interval.

The IA and the IF were calculated in transverse sections of T2- weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired from 38 symptomatic untreated subjects between the first and the second examination scan. The findings suggest that the high-, medium-, and low- frequency scale instantaneous amplitude and frequency can be used to differentiate between normal tissue and lesions at 0 and 6-12 months.

            "Abstract": "Bottom up approaches to Visual Attention (VA) have been applied successfully in a variety of applications, where no domain information exists, e.g. general purpose image and video segmentation. On the other hand, when humans are looking for faces in a scene they perform an implicit conscious search. Therefore, using simple bottom up approaches for identifying visually salient areas in scenes containing humans are not so efficient. In this paper we introduce the inclusion of a top-down channel in the VA architecture proposed in the past (i.e., Itti et al) to account for conscious search in video telephony applications. In such kind of applications the existence of human faces is almost always guaranteed. The regions, in the video-telephony stream, identified by the proposed algorithm as being visually salient are encoded with higher precision compared to the remaining ones. This procedure leads to a significant bit-rate reduction while the visual quality of the VA based encoded video stream is only slightly deteriorated, as the visual trial tests show. Furthermore, extended experiments concerning both static images as well as low-quality video show the efficiency of the proposed method, as far as the compression ratios achieved is concerned. The comparisons are made against standard JPEG and MPEG-1 encoding respectively.",

            "Abstract": "Arrhythmia is one of the most difficult problems in cardiology and especially in pediatric cardiology. In this study, the authors present a mobile health (m-health) system that can be used for continuous monitoring of children (ages 0-16 years) with suspected cardiac arrhythmias. The system is able to carry-out real-time acquisition and transmission of ECG signals, and facilitate an alarm scheme able to identify possible arrhythmias so as to notify the on-call doctor and the relatives of the child that an event or something that denotes malfunction is happening. In general the problem has been divided into two cases. The first case is called \u201cin-house case\u201d, where the subject is located in his/her house. While the second case is called \u201cmoving-patient case\u201d, where the subject might be located anywhere else. The authors\u2019 goal is the continuous 24 hours, monitoring of the child. During the \u201cin house case\u201d, a sensor network \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The degree of stenosis of the common carotid artery (CCA) but also the characteristics of the arterial wall including plaque size, composition and elasticity represent important predictors used in the assessment of the risk for future cardiovascular events. This paper proposes and evaluates an integrated system for the segmentation of atherosclerotic carotid plaque in ultrasound video of the CCA based on normalization, speckle reduction filtering (with the hybrid median filter) and parametric active contours. The algorithm is initialized in the first video frame of the cardiac cycle with human assistance and the moving atherosclerotic plaque borders are tracked and segmented in the subsequent frames. The algorithm is evaluated on 10 real CCA digitized videos from B-mode longitudinal ultrasound segments and is compared with the manual segmentations of an expert, for every 20 frames in a time span of 3-5 seconds, covering in general 2 cardiac cycles. The segmentation results are very satisfactory with a true negative fraction (TNF) of 79.3%, a true-positive fraction (TPF) of 78.12%, a false-positive fraction (FPF) of 6.7% and a false-negative fraction (FNF) of 19.6% between the ground truth and the presented plaque segmentations, a Williams index (KI) of 80.3%, an overlap index of 71.5%, a specificity of 0.88\u00b10.09, a precision of 0.86\u00b10.10 and an effectiveness measure of 0.77\u00b10.09.

Five different force levels were used: 10, 30, 50, 70 and 100% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), with each recording lasting 5 seconds. The amplitude of SEMG recordings was processed using dyadic Haar wavelet and entropy metrics. In each scale, the entropy of transformed SEMG was calculated and a set of 80 features per subject was formed. From existing data, we created five dataset, where subject were labelled based on the type as: normal/abnormal, normal/myopathic, normal/neuropathic, myopathic/neuropathic and normal/myopathic/neuropathic. Five classification techniques from the WEKA machine learning package were used, ie decision trees j48, random trees, random decision forests, support vector machines and ensemble of support vector machine with polynomial kernel. Resulting classifiers were obtained by using 3-fold cross-validation with 50 iterations for every machine learning technique. Classification accuracy and deviation of 150 classifiers for each dataset and machine learning technique were computed. The results show that normal and neuropathic groups are the most distinguishable (79\u00b18%), while myopathic and neuropathic groups are most hardly distinguished (50\u00b115%). Other classifications scored normal/abnormal (64\u00b111%), normal/myopathic (73\u00b17%), normal/neuropathic/myopathic (63\u00b18%). The results are quite promising, taking \u2026",

The Virtual Emergency TeleMedicine (VETM) game is a simulation-based game that was developed in collaboration with the mEducator Best Practice network in response to calls to integrate serious games in medical education and training. The VETM game makes use of data from an electrocardiogram to train practicing doctors, nurses, or medical students for problem-solving in real-life clinical scenarios through a telemedicine system and virtual patients. The study responds to two gaps: the limited number of games in emergency cardiology and the lack of evaluations by professionals.Objective: The objective of this study is a quantitative, professional feedback-informed evaluation of one scenario of VETM, involving cardiovascular complications. The study has the following research question:\u201cWhat are professionals\u2019 perceptions of the potential of the Virtual Emergency Telemedicine game for training people involved in the assessment and management of emergency cases?\u201dMethods: The evaluation of the VETM game was conducted with 90 professional ambulance crew nursing personnel specializing in the assessment and management of emergency cases.

A modular neural network mutli feature/multi classifier diagnostic system including image normalisation, despeckle filtering, plaque segmentation, texture and morphological feature extraction, and neural network classification has been developed for differentiating between asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques in ultrasound imaging of the carotid for the assessment of the risk of stroke. The image normalization and feature extraction modules of this system are in pilot use in several centres in North America and Europe. Furthermore, a standardised protocol for the analysis of endoscopy images in gynaecological cancer has been proposed enabling the differentiation between normal and abnormal endometrium tissue. Given that there is no standardised methodology for the interpretation of endoscopy images in gynaecology; our proposed standardised protocol is at presently discussed for consideration by the European Society for Gynaecological Endosopy (ESGE) and the European Academy of Gynaecological Cancer (EAGC).

            "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) generally and machine learning (ML) specifically demonstrate impressive practical success in many different application domains, e.g. in autonomous driving, speech recognition, or recommender systems. Deep learning approaches, trained on extremely large data sets or using reinforcement learning methods have even exceeded human performance in visual tasks, particularly on playing games such as Atari, or mastering the game of Go. Even in the medical domain there are remarkable results. The central problem of such models is that they are regarded as black-box models and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles, they lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence have difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory structures. This calls for systems enabling to make decisions transparent, understandable and explainable. A huge motivation for our approach are rising legal and privacy aspects. The new European General Data Protection Regulation entering into force on May 25th 2018, will make black-box approaches difficult to use in business. This does not imply a ban on automatic learning approaches or an obligation to explain everything all the time, however, there must be a possibility to make the results re-traceable on demand. In this paper we outline some of our research topics in the context of the relatively new area of explainable-AI with a focus on the application in medicine, which is a very special domain. This is due to the fact that medical professionals are working mostly with distributed heterogeneous and complex sources of data. In this paper we \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In ultrasound imaging and video visual perception is hindered by speckle multiplicative noise that degrades the quality. Noise reduction is therefore essential for improving the visual observation quality or as a pre-processing step for further automated analysis, such as image/video segmentation, texture analysis and encoding in ultrasound imaging and video. The goal of the first book (book 1 of 2 books) was to introduce the problem of speckle in ultrasound image and video as well as the theoretical background, algorithmic steps, and the MatlabTM for the following group of despeckle filters: linear despeckle filtering, non-linear despeckle filtering, diffusion despeckle filtering, and wavelet despeckle filtering. The goal of this book (book 2 of 2 books) is to demonstrate the use of a comparative evaluation framework based on these despeckle filters (introduced on book 1) on cardiovascular ultrasound image and video processing and analysis. More specifically, the despeckle filtering evaluation framework is based on texture analysis, image quality evaluation metrics, and visual evaluation by experts. This framework is applied in cardiovascular ultrasound image/video processing on the tasks of segmentation and structural measurements, texture analysis for differentiating between two classes (i.e. normal vs disease) and for efficient encoding for mobile applications. It is shown that despeckle noise reduction improved segmentation and measurement (of tissue structure investigated), increased the texture feature distance between normal and abnormal tissue, improved image/video quality evaluation and perception and produced significantly lower \u2026",

To assure user\u2019s volitional involvement during the rehabilitation session, residual volitional EMG is used to trigger the onset of a predetermined hand movement sequence applied in an open-loop modality. In particular, a target hand movement for the rehabilitation session is defined (i.e., grasping, pitching, etc.), and the patient is required to start the movement. Only when the muscular activity overcomes a predefined threshold, Gloreha supports the patient-initiated movement. The designed controller has been tested on a \u2026",

One of the main limitations of testing for interaction between genetic loci in large whole genome studies is the high computational cost of performing such analyses. In this study a new methodology for interaction testing (commonly referred to in genetics as the epistatic effect) between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a categorical phenotype is presented. It is shown that it provides reasonable approximations with a significantly shorter run time. The proposed measure based on the Pearson's chi-square additive property is compared to fitting a logistic regression model on a randomly selected subset of 218 SNP loci from a study that included 550,000 SNPs). For each possible pair of SNPs a chi-square test for the epistatic effect on case-control status is estimated by fitting a \u2026",

The objective of this study was to investigate how the degree of stenosis influences the strain characteristics of wall and plaque in the internal carotid artery (ICA). Ultrasound videos of the ICA from 83 subjects with atherosclerotic plaques at the origin of the ICA producing variable degrees of stenosis from 10 % to 85 % were investigated. We estimate for each video a carotid diameter during contraction (CDC), a carotid diameter during distension (CDD) in mm and a % of carotid plaque distension (%CPD). We have also estimated the radial strain at wall and plaque (%RSw, %RSp), the longitudinal strain at wall (%LSw) and the shear strain at wall (%SSw) and plaque (%SSp) respectively. The main findings were the following: 1) The %CPD is linearly related to the percentage of ICA stenosis decreasing \u2026",

The objective of this work was to investigate four different video despeckle filtering techniques and evaluate them using visual assessment by two medical experts, texture features analysis, and video quality evaluation metrics. The four proposed video despeckle filtering techniques were evaluated on 10 ultrasound videos of the common carotid artery (CCA). The filters were applied on the whole video frame and in a selected by the user region of interest (ROI) which included the atherosclerotic carotid plaque. The despeckle filters were based on linear filtering (DsFlsmv), hybrid median filtering (DsFhmedian), nonlinear filtering (DsFkuwahara) and speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (DsFsrad) filtering. Our results showed that, the best video despeckle filtering methods were the linear filter DsFlsmv, followed by the hybrid median filter DsFhmedian. Both filters improved the visual perception evaluation by experts and gave better texture and video quality metrics. Further work on a larger number of videos and by employing additional despeckle filtering techniques is required for the evaluation of video despeckle filtering methods on ultrasound videos of the CCA.",

            "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been the subject of numerous genetic studies in recent years which revealed associations of the disease with a large number of susceptibility loci. We hereby initiate the evaluation of T2D susceptibility loci in the Greek-Cypriot population by performing a replication case-control study. One thousand and eighteen individuals (528 T2D patients, 490 controls) were genotyped at 21 T2D susceptibility loci, using the allelic discrimination method. Statistically significant associations of T2D with five of the tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)(TCF7L2 rs7901695, FTO rs8050136, HHEX rs5015480, SLC30A8 rs13266634 and IGF2BP2 rs4402960) were observed in this study population. Furthermore, 14 of the tested SNPs had odds ratios (ORs) in the same direction as the previously published studies, suggesting that these variants can potentially be used in the Greek-Cypriot population for predictive testing of T2D. In conclusion, our findings expand the genetic assessment of T2D susceptibility loci and reconfirm five of the worldwide established loci in a distinct, relatively small, newly investigated population.

For this application, images were recorded from 137 asymptomatic and 137 symptomatic plaques (symptoms are Stroke, Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), and Amaurosis Fugax (AF)). Two feature sets were extracted from the plaques; the first based on morphological image analysis and the second based on image texture analysis. Both sets were used in order to evaluate the performance of CPs on this problem. Four CPs were constructed using four popular classification methods, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes Classification (NBC), and k-Nearest Neighbours.

            "Abstract": "Medical robotic systems are successfully employed in various surgical specialties today. Yet, a substantial number of remarkable systems that have been developed and piloted, have failed to reach commercialization and thus adoption in clinical practice. This is partly due to the strict regulatory requirements, which typically occupy a significant amount of the development time while incurring additional costs. Pertinent to regulatory approvals is the field of Human Factors, which plays a central role in the design of safe and efficient medical devices. This study briefly introduces the FDA regulatory approval process, discusses the role of human factors in the design process and highlights specific robotic systems that have obtained approval for clinical use. The purpose is to show the status of robotic technologies in relation to the current clinical practice.",

Its aim is to discover and characterize interesting 2D substructures present in chemical datasets. The popularity of the approach owes a lot to the success of the structure-activity relationship practice, which states that biological properties of molecules are a result of molecular structure, and to expert medicinal chemists who tend to view, organize and treat chemical compounds as a collection of their substructural parts. Several substructure mining algorithms have been developed over the years to accommodate the needs of an ever changing drug discovery process. This paper reviews the most important of these algorithms and highlights some of their applications. Emphasis is placed on the recent developments in the field.",

            "Abstract": "Improving the profile of a molecule for the drug-discovery process requires the simultaneous optimization of numerous, often competing objectives. Traditionally, standard chemoinformatics methods ignored this problem and focused on the sequential optimization of each single biological or chemical property (ie, a single objective). This approach, known as singleobjective optimization (SOOP), strives to discover a single optimal solution to the optimization problem. Implicitly, SOOP-based methods assume that the optimal solution for an objective will also be the optimum for any other objectives involved in the profiling of a molecule. However, when these other objectives are conflicting, as is often the case in drug discovery, the individual optima corresponding to the numerous objectives may vary substantially. Multi-objective optimization (MOOP) methods introduce a new approach for gaining optimality based on compromises and trade-offs among the various objectives. MOOP aims to discover a set of satisfactory compromises that can in turn be used to discover the global optimal solution by optimizing numerous dependent properties simultaneously. MOOP methods have only recently been introduced to the field of chemoinformatics. This paper first presents a brief introduction to issues related to MOOP and then surveys the application of MOOP methods in the field of chemoinformatics.",

This decrease in IA maybe attributed to the reduction in calcified, stable plaque components and an increase in stroke risk with age.

This is attributed to the high volume of images reviewed as well as the low-contrast character of mammographic imaging, especially in the case of dense breast, accounting for about 25% of the younger female population [6, 7]. Calcifications are calcium salts produced by processes carried out inside the breast ductal system. They are radiodense, usually appearing lighter than surrounding parenchyma, due to their inherently high attenuation of X-rays. Depending on the X-ray attenuation of surrounding parenchyma (ie, dense breast), they can be lowcontrast entities, with their low-contrast resolution limited by their size. Magnification of mammographic views, characterized by improved signal-to-noise ratio, result in improved visualization of MCs.Masses, which represent a more invasive process, are compact radiodense regions that also appear lighter than their surrounding parenchyma due to higher attenuation of X-rays. The major reason for the low contrast of malignant masses is the minor difference in X-ray attenuation between even large masses and normal dense surrounding parenchyma. The use of complementary mammographic views, craniocaudal (CC) and \u2026",

This necessitates the need for robust despeckling image and video techniques for both routine clinical practice and tele-consultation. The goal for this book (book 1 of 2 books) is to introduce the problem of speckle occurring in ultrasound image and video as well as the theoretical background (equations), the algorithmic steps, and the MATLABTM code for the following group of despeckle filters: linear filtering, nonlinear filtering, anisotropic diffusion filtering, and wavelet filtering. This book proposes a comparative evaluation framework of these despeckle filters based on texture analysis, image quality evaluation metrics, and visual evaluation by medical experts.

A key methodology for increasing statistical power is through the use of as many subjects as possible that match a study's inclusion criteria. Thus many have attempted to merge data from multiple independent sources/sites/studies that contain the same inclusion criteria for subjects as a way of creating a much larger study with significantly more statistical power. For these approaches to work though data from multiple sites need to be made available to a single analysis.

Shape and texture analysis was carried out in normal and diseased lesions in transverse sections of T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired from 10 symptomatic untreated subjects with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) scanned twice, with an interval of 6-12 months. All detected brain lesions were manually segmented by an experienced neurologist and confirmed by a neuro-radiologist, whilst different shape and texture features were extracted from the segmented lesions. The results showed that there was no significance difference between shape features of 0 and 6-12 months. For some texture features there was significance difference between normal tissue \u2026",

We compare throughput, fairness and time complexity of GA-BAVP and CCO-BAVP for several node topologies. The results on maximising the throughput obtained with GA-BAVP and CCOBAVP are in close agreement, however when considering fairness GA-BAVP outperforms CCO-BAVP, especially for more complex topologies, like the 7-node network, without abundant link capacity. Convergence of the two algorithms appears similar, with GA-BAVP outperforming CCO-BAVP in initial stages, and vice-versa for longer time scales. However as the problem complexity increases the solution time for the Genetic Algorithm does not increase as fast as the classical constrained optimisation algorithm. A hybrid scheme is also introduced, combining the benefits of both algorithms. It exhibited better overall convergence rate but the same solution as CCO-BAVP.",

Images were freezed and captured using a laparoscopy camera (CIRCON IP4. 1) and an IEEE 1394 standard PCMCIA card on a laptop PC. The resolution of the images was 720x576 pixels x 24 bits, tiff format. Regions of interest were manually segmented for analysis. Results of ROI texture analysis showed that features like median, entropy and contrast, seem to differentiate normal from abnormal tissue in the above mentioned organs. Also when examining the RGB color histograms for the endometrium, there is a bigger spread and shift towards higher values of abnormal tissue compared to normal tissue for the Red, Green, and Blue channels. It is anticipated that these findings can help the gynaecologist to increase his/hers diagnostic capabilities in difficult cases.",

Video tracking was performed using Farneback's method which relies on frame comparisons which in our study were made at 0.1 second intervals. The maximum angular spread (MAS) of motion vectors at 10-pixel intervals in the plaque area was measured in degrees. Plaques were classified as concordant (MAS< 700), moderately discordant (MAS 70-1200) and discordant (MAS> 1200). RESULTS: Motion was discordant in 89.1% of symptomatic plaques and only in 17.9% of asymptomatic plaques (p< 0.001). The prevalence of symptoms increased with increasing MAS. For MAS> 1200 the hazard ratio for presence of symptoms was 47.7 (95% CI 18.1 to 125.6) compared with the rest of the plaques after adjustment for degree of stenosis and mean pixel motion. The area under the ROC curve for prediction of the presence of symptoms by MAS was 0.876 (95% CI 0.823 to 0.929). The \u2026",

This is clearly a goal directed task but is generic enough to be context independent. Processing in the bottom-up information channel follows the principles set by Itti et al. but it deviates from them by computing the orientation, intensity and color conspicuity maps within a unified multi-resolution framework based on wavelet subband analysis. In particular, we apply a wavelet based approach for efficient computation of the topographic feature maps.

A number of techniques have been developed to address this issue. This paper aims to summarize the most significant approaches for: error resilience, error concealment and joint encoder-decoder error control techniques, and to provide a thorough discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of these error control methods. Furthermore, two case studies of error resilience utilization are presented, namely Ad-hoc networks and Multimedia Broadcast Multiple Services (MBMS).",

Typically, the IMT grows with age and this is used as a sign of increased risk of CVD. Beyond thickness, there is also clinical interest in identifying how the composition and texture of the intima-media complex (IMC) changed and how these textural changes grow into atherosclerotic plaques that can cause stroke. Clearly though texture analysis of ultrasound images can be greatly affected by speckle noise, our goal here is to develop effective despeckle noise methods that can recover image texture associated with increased rates of atherosclerosis disease. In this study, we perform a comparative evaluation of several despeckle filtering methods, on 100 ultrasound images of the CCA, based on the extracted multiscale Amplitude-Modulation Frequency-Modulation (AM-FM) texture features and visual image quality assessment by two clinical experts. Texture features were extracted from the automatically segmented IMC for three different age groups. The despeckle filters hybrid median and the homogeneous mask area filter showed the best performance by improving the class separation between the three age groups and also yielded significantly improved image quality.",

Despite this momentum towards m-Health systems and especially e-Emergency systems, wireless channels remain error prone, while the absence of objective quality metrics limits the ability of providing medical video of adequate diagnostic quality at a required bitrate. In this paper we investigate different encoding schemes and loss rates in medical ultrasound video transmission and come to conclusions involving efficiency, the trade-off between bitrate and quality, while we highlight the relationship linking video quality and the error ratio of corrupted P and B frames.

Redundant slices (RS) utilization increases compressed video's resilience over error prone transmission mediums. We evaluate our scheme on a series of five (5) carotid ultrasound videos at QCIF and CIF resolution, for packet loss rates up to 30%. Quality assessment based on a clinical rating system that provides for independent evaluations of the different parts of the video (subjective), as well as PSNR ratings (objective), shows that encoded videos attain enhanced diagnostic performance under noisy environments, while at the same time achieving significant bandwidth demands reductions.",

The aim of this study is to examine the effect of VR on naturally occurring pain when no pharmacological analgesics nor psychological intervention strategies are applied. The above statement will be validated via physiological responses, such as ECG and a correlation between subjective and objective measurements of pain will be made.

Ultrasound imaging is used in border identification and texture characterisation of the atherosclerotic carotid plaque in the common carotid artery (CCA), the identification and measurement of the intima-media thickness (IMT) and the lumen diameter that are very important in the assessment of cardiovascular disease. However, visual perception is reduced by speckle noise affecting the quality of ultrasound B-mode imaging. Noise reduction is therefore essential for increasing the visual quality or as a pre-processing step for further automated analysis, such as the video segmentation of the IMT and the atherosclerotic carotid plaque in ultrasound video sequences. In order to facilitate this analysis, the authors have developed a video analysis software toolbox based on MATLAB\u00ae that uses video \u2026",

The proposed system is able to retrieve and sort ultrasound images of the atherosclerotic carotid plaques using image texture analysis features and the KNN classification algorithm. The prototype system was evaluated on a database of 274 images of symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques and the results show the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approach. The best percentage success rate of correct retrievals was obtained for the NGTDM, followed by the SGLDM (range) feature sets with the corresponding scorings of 70%, and 68%, respectively. The proposed system can be very useful to physicians who, in order to select the best treatment strategy and therapy for a patient, need to find and analyze related cases.",

Furthermore, attention has been focused on the influence of cervical length (CL) for the prediction of spontaneous preterm delivery. Data for 59,313 cases of pregnant women were collected and processed. The final data used were those that were considered to offer clear indication on the significance of cervical length on the prediction. The cervical length was measured by sonography in the range of 22-24 weeks of gestation. Preliminary results showed a prediction rate of approximately 65% was attained through the application of a variety of neural network topologies. It has been found that if the cervical length is excluded from the input data, this results in an approximately 10% decrease in the prediction yield, as obtained from the neural network predictor \u2026",

Because of its non-invasive nature and continuing improvements in image quality, ultrasound imaging is progressively achieving an important role in the assessment and characterization of cardiovascular imaging. Speckle is inherent in ultrasound imaging giving rise to a granular appearance instead of homogeneous, flat shades of gray, as is visible and as such, speckle can severely compromise interpretation of ultrasound images, particularly in discrimination of small structures. On the other hand, speckle can be used in the detection of time varying phenomena, or tracking tissue motion. The objective of this book is to provide a reference edited volume covering the whole spectrum of speckle phenomena, theoretical background and modelling, algorithms and selected applications in cardiovascular ultrasound imaging and video processing and analysis.

            "Abstract": "The motion characteristics of the diaphragmatic muscle may provide useful information about normal and abnormal diaphragmatic function and indicate diaphragmatic weakness. The objective of this paper was to introduce a simple system for the quantitative analysis of ultrasonic diaphragmatic motion. The measurements routinely carried out by the experts were computed and these include: (i) excursion, (ii) inspiration time (Tinsp) and (iii) cycle duration (Ttot). The system was evaluated on four simulated videos and one real video. Manual and automated measurements were very close. Further work in a larger number of videos is needed for validating the proposed method.",

            "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate differences in intima-media thickness (IMT) and diameter (D) measurements of the common carotid artery (CCA) in ultrasound imaging in normal subjects and renal failure disease (RFD) patients. Manual measurements by two experts and automated segmentation measurements (based on snakes and active contour models (ACM)) were carried out on 73 normal subjects, and 80 RFD patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at p<0.05. Results demonstrated that the mean IMT and D measurements were significantly higher for the RFD group versus the normal group. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the manual and automated measurements. The ACM segmentation was slightly more accurate than segmentation based on snakes. Further work is needed to validate these findings on a larger group of subjects.",

Image quality was evaluated based on statistical and texture features, image quality evaluation metrics, and visual perception evaluation made by two experts. These were computed on 80 longitudinal ultrasound images of the carotid bifurcation recorded from two different ultrasound scanners, the HDI ATL-3000 and the HDI ATL-5000 scanner, before (NF) and after (DS) speckle reduction filtering, after normalization (N), and after \u2026",

This research is proposed for its capability to classify subjects from a clinical dataset in healthy, myopathic and neuropathic cases. The extraction of features with simple morphology but estimated on the signals wavelet domain increases the classification rate of the system drastically. Therefore, a set of features based mainly on energies of the EMG signals along with the Hudgins\u2019 measurements, all estimated on the wavelet domain create a feature space consisted of highly discriminant subspaces for the three classes healthy, neuropathies or patients with myopathies. For the classification task the k-NN algorithm used and the validation performed with k-folds \u2026",

A series of infrared satellite images from the geostationary satellite METEOSAT7 were employed. Nine different texture feature sets (a total of 55 features) were extracted from the segmented cloud images using the following algorithms: first order statistics, spatial gray level dependence matrices, gray level difference statistics, neighborhood gray tone difference matrix, statistical feature matrix, Laws texture energy measures, fractals and Fourier power spectrum. The neural network SOFM (self organising feature map) classifier and the statistical KNN (Kohonen neural network) classifier were used for the classification \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this study we investigate variability of texture features for laparoscopy images of tissue captured under different viewing conditions. In order to perform this test we captured the following sets of images: ten images, where the camera was at a small distance from the tissue (panoramic, 5cm distance), ten images where the camera was close to the tissue (close up, 3cm distance) and twenty images for two consecutive angles (ten for each) with 50 degrees difference. Multiscale analysis was carried out in order to examine image texture at different scales. Images were downsampled and filtered to ten scales (1x1 up to 10x10) for the different distances and six scales (1x1 up to 5x5 and 10x10) for the different angles. Regions of Interest (ROIs) were selected from each image and the following texture features were extracted: the Statistical Features (SF) and the Spatial Gray Level Dependence Matrices (SGLDM). Results indicate that there is significant variability between the panoramic and close up views for multiscale texture features. However, there is some variance (within reasonable bounds) between the multiscale texture features of consecutive angles. It is hoped that the results of this study will prove useful in computer aided diagnosis in laparoscopy imaging. However, more experiments have to be carried out and more images have to be analyzed to support this further.",

            "Abstract": "This paper describes the design and development of an integrated teleconsultation system for the estimation of the annual incidence of stroke related to carotid atherosclerotic plaque and the detection of high risk and low risk subgroups of patients which is a decisive factor for the selection of the therapy, ie medical or surgical. Thus, only patients at high risk will be considered for carotid endarterectomy, while patients at low risk will be spared from unnecessary and expensive surgery which also carries a risk. The system takes into consideration important non-invasive (para-clinical) parameters extracted from high resolution ultrasound images, and stroke related clinical risk factors. The knowledge base of the system concerning ultrasound images was from 274 collected from the department of vascular surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, while the clinical risk factors database was built from a total of 1298 cases collected under the EU BIOMED II ACSRS (Nicolaides et. al 2003) project for the identification of individuals with asymptomatic carotid stenosis at risk of stroke. The proposed system facilitates (a) the identification and standardization of noninvasive tests or combinations of such tests, particularly ultrasonic plaque echodensity and texture analysis that are associated with increased risk of stroke, and (b) determine combinations of such tests as well as appropriate criteria that can achieve the identification of high and low risk subgroups of patients.",

            "Abstract": "Motivation and Objective: Although a plethora of machine learning and deep learning methods were used for the assessment of Alzheimer Disease (AD) MRI structural changes, the main drawback of these models is that they are regarded as black-box models and even though the results obtained are highly satisfactory, they lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, and thus we have difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory imaging structures. The objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of rule extraction in the assessment of AD using decision trees and random forests algorithms. Material and Methods: The decision trees and random forests algorithms were applied on brain MRI images acquired from normal controls (NC)(N= 114), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)(N= 129) and AD (N= 69). These images were downloaded from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. All the subjects had a standardized protocol on 1.5-T MRI units (typically 1.25\u00d7 1.25\u00d7 1.25 mm3 voxels) according to an ADNI protocol. Regions of interest (ROI) segmentation was performed using the Freesurfer v6. 0 software. The following MRI brain features were extracted when a subject was diagnosed from the hippocampus: volume (HipVol) and texture features (Angular Second Moment, Contrast, Correlation, Sum Average, Entropy and Cluster Shade). The KNIME analytics platform was used to compute the decision trees. Results: The overall accuracy achieved for the NC versus AD models was in the region of 90%, whereas the overall accuracy achieved for the NC versus MCI models was in the region of 65 \u2026",
