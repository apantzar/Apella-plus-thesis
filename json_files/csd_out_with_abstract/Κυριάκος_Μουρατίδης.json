            "Abstract": "Research on spatial network databases has so far considered that there is a single cost value associated with each road segment of the network. In most real-world situations, however, there may exist multiple cost types involved in transportation decision making. For example, the different costs of a road segment could be its Euclidean length, the driving time, the walking time, possible toll fee, etc. The relative significance of these cost types may vary from user to user. In this paper we consider such multi-cost transportation networks (MCN), where each edge (road segment) is associated with multiple cost values. We formulate skyline and top-k queries in MCNs and design algorithms for their efficient processing. Our solutions have two important properties in preference-based querying; the skyline methods are progressive and the top-k ones are incremental. The performance of our techniques is evaluated with \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The top-k query is a common means to shortlist a number of options from a set of alternatives, based on the user's preferences. Typically, these preferences are expressed as a vector of query weights, defined over the options' attributes. The query vector implicitly associates each alternative with a numeric score, and thus imposes a ranking among them. The top-k result includes the k options with the highest scores. In this context, we define the maximum rank query (MaxRank). Given a focal option in a set of alternatives, the MaxRank problem is to compute the highest rank this option may achieve under any possible user preference, and furthermore, to report all the regions in the query vector's domain where that rank is achieved. MaxRank finds application in market impact analysis, customer profiling, targeted advertising, etc. We propose a methodology for MaxRank processing and evaluate it with experiments on real and benchmark synthetic datasets.",

            "Abstract": "The two most common paradigms to identify records of preference in a multi-objective setting rely either on dominance (eg, the skyline operator) or on a utility function defined over the records' attributes (typically, using a top-k query). Despite their proliferation, each of them has its own palpable drawbacks. Motivated by these drawbacks, we identify three hard requirements for practical decision support, namely, personalization, controllable output size, and flexibility in preference specification. With these requirements as a guide, we combine elements from both paradigms and propose two new operators, ORD and ORU. We perform a qualitative study to demonstrate how they work, and evaluate their performance against adaptations of previous work that mimic their output.",

            "Abstract": "The concept of k-anonymity has received considerable attention due to the need of several organizations to release microdata without revealing the identity of individuals. Although all previous k-anonymity techniques assume the existence of a public database (PD) that can be used to breach privacy, none utilizes PD during the anonymization process. Specifically, existing generalization algorithms create anonymous tables using only the microdata table (MT) to be published, independently of the external knowledge available. This omission leads to high information loss. Motivated by this observation, we first introduce the concept of k-join-anonymity (KJA), which permits more effective generalization to reduce the information loss. Briefly, KJA anonymizes a superset of MT, which includes selected records from PD. We propose two methodologies for adapting k-anonymity algorithms to their KJA counterparts. The \u2026",

Finding the optimal k medoids is NP hard, and existing algorithms aim at approximate answers, i.e., they compute medoids that achieve a small, yet not minimal, average distance. Similarly in this paper, we also aim at approximate solutions. We consider, however, the continuous version of the problem, where the points in P move and our task is to maintain the medoid set on-the-fly (trying to keep the average distance small). To the best of our knowledge, this work constitutes the first attempt on continuous medoid queries.

A k-stops query retrieves a sequence that contains exactly k intermediate data points. In both cases our aim is to compute the shortest path subject to these constraints. Assuming that the dataset is indexed by a data-partitioning method, the proposed techniques initially compute a sub-optimal path by utilizing the Euclidean distance information provided by the index. The length of the retrieved path is used to prune the search space, filtering out large parts of the input dataset.

Given a source and a destination in G, and a budget (resource constraint) B, the BUP problem is to identify which upgradable edges should be upgraded so that the shortest path distance between source and destination (in the updated network) is minimized, without exceeding the available budget for the upgrade. In addition to transportation networks, the BUP query arises in other domains too, such as telecommunications. We propose a framework for BUP processing and evaluate it with experiments on large, real road networks.",

In a context where users look for available products with top-k queries, mIR identifies the part of the product space that attracts the most user attention. Specifically, mIR determines the kind of attribute values that lead a (new or existing) product to the top-k result for at least a fraction of the user population. mIR has several applications, ranging from effective marketing to product improvement. Importantly, it also leads to (exact and efficient) solutions for standing top-k impact problems, which were previously solved heuristically only, or whose current solutions face serious scalability limitations. We experiment, among others, on data mined from actual user reviews for real products, and demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our algorithms, both for mIR and for standing top-k impact problems.",

Even if the database is encrypted, an adversary who is monitoring the I/O activity on the server may still be able to infer some information about a user query. For the particular case of a B + -tree that has its nodes encrypted, we identify properties that enable the ordering among the leaf nodes to be deduced. These properties allow us to construct adversarial algorithms to recover the B + -tree structure from the I/O traces generated by range queries. Combining this structure with knowledge of the key distribution (or the plaintext database itself), the adversary can infer the selection range of user queries. To counter the threat, we propose a privacy-enhancing PB + -tree index which ensures that there is high uncertainty about what data the user has worked on, even to a \u2026",

The score of an option (data record) is defined as the weighted sum of its individual attributes. The highest-scoring options across a set of alternatives (dataset) are shortlisted for the user as the recommended ones. In that setting, the user input is a vector (equivalently, a point) in a d-dimensional preference space, where d is the number of data attributes. In this paper we study the problem of determining in which regions of the preference space the weight vector should lie so that a given option (focal record) is among the top-k score-wise. In effect, these regions capture all possible user profiles for which the focal record is highly preferable, and are therefore essential in market impact analysis, potential customer identification, profile-based marketing, targeted advertising \u2026",

In the single-pair version of BUP, the input includes a source and a destination in G, and a budget B (resource constraint). The goal is to identify which upgradable edges should be upgraded so that the shortest path distance between source and destination (in the updated network) is minimized, without exceeding the available budget for the upgrade.

Based on this vector, each data record is implicitly mapped to a score value (via a weighted sum function). The records with the k largest scores are reported as the result. In this paper we propose an auxiliary feature to standard top-k query processing. Specifically, we compute the maximal locus within which the query vector incurs no change in the current top-k result. In other words, we compute all possible query weight settings that produce exactly the same top-k result as the user's original query. We call this locus the global immutable region (GIR).

In this paper, we introduce the LRM algorithm that lowers the expected spread in subset sums to one third that of BLDM for uniformly distributed numbers and odd subset cardinalities.

A combination of LRM and Meld leads to a heuristic technique that consistently achieves a narrower spread of subset sums than BLDM.",

The capacity constrained assignment (CCA) is a matching between the two sets such that (i) each customer is assigned to at most one provider,(ii) every provider serves no more customers than its capacity,(iii) the maximum possible number of customers are served, and (iv) the sum of Euclidean distances within the assigned provider-customer pairs is minimized. Although max-flow algorithms are applicable to this problem, they require the complete distance-based bipartite graph between the customer and provider sets. For large spatial datasets, this graph is expensive to compute and it may be too large to fit in main memory. Motivated by this fact, we propose efficient algorithms for optimal assignment that employ novel edge-pruning strategies, based on the spatial properties of the problem. Additionally, we develop incremental techniques that maintain an optimal assignment (in the presence of updates) with a processing cost several times lower than CCA re-computation from scratch. Finally, we present approximate (ie, suboptimal) CCA solutions that provide a tunable trade-off between result accuracy and computation cost, abiding by theoretical quality guarantees.

Consider a set of objects and a set of suppliers, where each object must be assigned to one supplier. Assume that there is a cost associated with every object-supplier pair. If we allocate each object to the server with the smallest cost (for the specific object), the derived overall assignment will have the minimum total cost. In many scenarios, however, runner-up assignments may be required too, like for example when a decision maker needs to make additional considerations, not captured by individual object-supplier costs. In this case, it is necessary to examine several shortlisted assignments before choosing one. This motivates the \u03b1Top-K query, which computes the K best assignments, ie, those achieving the K smallest total costs. Algorithms for the traditional assignment ranking problem could be adapted to process the query, but \u2026",

The use of these services, however, poses privacy issues as the user locations and queries are exposed to untrusted LBSs. Spatial cloaking techniques provide privacy in the form of k-anonymity; i.e., they guarantee that the (location of the) querying user u is indistinguishable from at least k-1 others, where k is a parameter specified by u at query time. To achieve this, they form a group of k users, including u, and forward their minimum bounding rectangle (termed anonymizing spatial region, ASR) to the LBS. The rationale behind sending an ASR instead of the distinct k locations is that exact user positions (querying or not) should not be disclosed to the LBS. This results in large ASRs with considerable dead-space, and leads to unnecessary performance degradation \u2026",

In view of these applications, we propose the k traffic-tolerant paths problem (TTP) on road networks, which takes a source-destination pair and historical traffic information as input, and returns k paths that minimize the aggregate (historical) travel time. Unlike the shortest path problem, the TTP problem has a combinatorial search space that renders the optimal solution expensive to compute. We propose an exact algorithm and a heuristic algorithm for this problem. Experiments on real traffic data demonstrate the effectiveness of TTP paths and the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.",

Typically, these preferences regard a subset of the available dimensions (ie, attributes) whose relative significance is expressed by user-specified weights. Along with the query result, we propose to compute for each involved dimension the maximal deviation to the corresponding weight for which the query result remains valid. The derived weight ranges, called immutable regions, are useful for performing sensitivity analysis, for finetuning the query weights, etc. In this paper, we focus on top-k queries with linear preference functions over the queried dimensions. We codify the conditions under which changes in a dimension\u2019s weight invalidate the query result, and develop algorithms to compute the immutable regions. In general, this entails the examination of numerous non-result tuples. To reduce processing time, we introduce a pruning technique and a thresholding mechanism that allow the immutable regions to be determined correctly after examining only a small number of non-result tuples. We demonstrate empirically that the two techniques combine well to form a robust and highly resource-efficient algorithm. We verify the generality of our findings using real high-dimensional data from different domains (documents, images, etc) and with different characteristics.",

Discovery of hot motion paths is important to applications requiring classification/profiling based on monitored movement patterns, such as targeted advertising, resource allocation, etc. To achieve this goal, we delegate part of the path extraction process to objects, by assigning to them adaptive lightweight filters that dynamically suppress unnecessary location updates and, thus, help reducing the communication overhead.

Although individual preference queries can be evaluated by selecting the object in the database with the highest aggregate score, in the case of multiple simultaneous requests, a single object cannot be assigned to more than one users. The challenge is to compute a fair 1-1 matching between the queries and the objects. We model this as a stable-marriage problem and propose an efficient method for its processing. Our algorithm iteratively finds stable query-object pairs and removes them from the problem. At its core lies a novel skyline maintenance technique, which we prove to be I/O optimal.

Example applications include among others, financial tickers, network traffic monitoring, web and transaction log analysis, and sensor networks. In such environments, data arrive in the form of multiple high-speed data streams that have to be processed online and provide near-real time answers to the queries.A data stream is a continuous, time-varying, unbounded sequence of data-items. Stream items usually take the form of relational tuples that are disposed after they get processed, implying that online stream algorithms are restricted to only one pass over the data. Data arrival rates are arbitrary and cannot be controlled by the processing system. They are unpredictable and fluctuate vastly over time.

Our task is to assign every user to one server subject to the coverage and capacity constraints. To offer the highest quality of service, we wish to minimize the average distance between users and their assigned server. This is an instance of a well-studied problem in operations research, termed optimal assignment. Even though there exist several solutions for the static case (where user locations are fixed), there is currently no method for dynamic settings. In this paper, we consider the continuous assignment problem (CAP), where an optimal assignment must be constantly maintained between mobile users and a set of servers. The fact that the users are mobile necessitates real-time reassignment so that the quality of service remains high (ie, their distance from their assigned servers is minimized). The large scale and the time-critical nature of targeted applications require fast CAP solutions. We propose an algorithm that utilizes the geometric characteristics of the problem and significantly accelerates the initial assignment computation and its subsequent maintenance. Our method applies to different cost functions (eg, average squared distance) and to any Minkowski distance metric (eg, Euclidean, L1 norm, etc).",

            "Abstract": "This paper studies continuous monitoring of nearest neighbor (NN) queries over sliding window streams. According to this model, data points continuously stream in the system, and they are considered valid only while they belong to a sliding window that contains 1) the W most recent arrivals (count-based) or 2) the arrivals within a fixed interval W covering the most recent time stamps (time-based). The task of the query processor is to constantly maintain the result of long-running NN queries among the valid data. We present two processing techniques that apply to both count-based and time-based windows. The first one adapts conceptual partitioning, the best existing method for continuous NN monitoring over update streams, to the sliding window model. The second technique reduces the problem to skyline maintenance in the distance-time space and precomputes the future changes in the NN set. We analyze \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Shortest path computation is one of the most common queries in location-based services (LBSs). Although particularly useful, such queries raise serious privacy concerns. Exposing to a (potentially untrusted) LBS the client's position and her destination may reveal personal information, such as social habits, health condition, shopping preferences, lifestyle choices, etc. The only existing method for privacy-preserving shortest path computation follows the obfuscation paradigm; it prevents the LBS from inferring the source and destination of the query with a probability higher than a threshold. This implies, however, that the LBS still deduces some information (albeit not exact) about the client's location and her destination. In this paper we aim at strong privacy, where the adversary learns nothing about the shortest path query. We achieve this via established private information retrieval techniques, which we treat as black-box building blocks. Experiments on real, large-scale road networks assess the practicality of our schemes.",

            "Abstract": "In the outsourced database model, a data owner publishes her database through a third-party server; i.e., the server hosts the data and answers user queries on behalf of the owner. Since the server may not be trusted, or may be compromised, users need a means to verify that answers received are both authentic and complete, i.e., that the returned data have not been tampered with, and that no qualifying results have been omitted. We propose a result verification approach for one-dimensional queries, called Partially Materialized Digest scheme (PMD), that applies to both static and dynamic databases. PMD uses separate indexes for the data and for their associated verification information, and only partially materializes the latter. In contrast with previous work, PMD avoids unnecessary costs when processing queries that do not request verification, achieving the performance of an ordinary index (e.g., a B \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Given a point set P of customers (eg, WiFi receivers) and a point set Q of service providers (eg, wireless access points), where each q 2 Q has a capacity qk, the capacity constrained assignment (CCA) is a matching MQ\u00d7 P such that (i) each point q 2 Q (p 2 P) appears at most k times (at most nce) in M,(ii) the size of M is maximized (ie, it comprises min {| P|, P q2Q qk} pairs), and (iii) the total assignment cost (ie, the sum of Euclidean distances within all pairs) is minimized. Thus, the CCA problem is to identify the assignment with the optimal overall quality; intuitively, the quality of q\u2019s service to p in a given (q, p) pair is anti-proportional to their distance. Although max-flow algorithms are applicable to this problem, they require the complete distance-based bipartite graph between Q and P. For large spatial datasets, this graph is expensive to compute and it may be too large to fit in main memory. Motivated by this fact, we \u2026",
