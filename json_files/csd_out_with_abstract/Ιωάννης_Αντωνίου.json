            "Abstract": "Gender differences in mathematical thinking is a common concern of scientists from different research fields. Both parents and teachers report that males seem to perform better in complex mathematics compared to females. This study comes to shed light in the different organization of the underlying functional networks, in order to investigate the aforementioned observation, without supporting or rejecting this statement. In this sense, it is generally accepted that females use their both hemispheres to accomplish a certain task, while males use mostly the hemisphere which is properly suited. For the purposes of the current analysis, electroencephalographic recordings were collected from 11 males and 11 females, during a difficult mathematical task. Then a previously proposed model was used in order to pass from the sensor level to the cortical one, in order to examine the networks formed among the cortical dipoles \u2026",

The only sufficient condition known is that of absolutely continuous spectrum which guarantees mixing from the Riemann-Lebesgue Theorem.",

We analyze Hegerfeldt\u2019s theorem using quantum and classical wave packets and investigate the applicability of Hegerfeldts arguments on quantum non-locality in quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate the appearance of non-local effects at the level of quantum states. We show, however that the expectation values of some observables spread causally. Therefore the measurement of the non-locality is questionable. We show that the classical measurement cannot detect the \u201cacausal\u201d effects of the non-locality. The possibility that quantum detectors may measure the effect should be investigated in the future.",

The construction of the canonical variables of the fluid sheds a light of the origin of Clebsh variables, introduced in the previous century. The developed formalism permits to relate the circulation conservation (Tompson theorem) with the invariance of the theory with respect to special diffiomorphisms and establish also the new conservation laws. We discuss also the difference of the Eulerian and Lagrangian description, pointing out the incompleteness of the first. The constructed formalism is also applicable for ideal plasma. We conclude with several remarks on the quantization of the fluid.",

It is the purpose of this paper to construct a time operator in the sense of complex unstable dynamical system theory for the world financial system. As a consequence, we have opened up a new and much wider vista of extraordinarily complex systems possessing many internal times of great dynamic inter-importance. We believe more generally that the complexity of time as emphasized in this paper should become an essential part of future complex dynamical systems theory",

            "Abstract": "Automatic processing of seismic data is today a key element in the efforts to achieve high quality seismic systems. Automated procedures for locating seismic events with a network including arrays and single element seismometers usually incorporate back-azimuth estimates, arrival-time data, and associated uncertainties into a least-squares-inverse location algorithm. Such an algorithm is quite cumbersome and requires expanding a set of non-linear equations in a Taylor series. Second-order terms usually not included in the algorithm can be important if the initial estimate is far from the solution.We propose to use elastic neural nets (ENN) to find the initial estimation in automated procedures of locating seismic events and discuss the results for simulated seismic events. The advantages of ENN are the simplicity of the algorithm, the fast convergence and the high efficiency.",

The brown bear is a wide-ranging predator that moves across large areas, crossing various habitats of different quality. Here, we provide a methodological framework that allowed us to explore the relative importance of habitat quality upon movement patterns and connectivity. First, we developed habitat-suitability models by using telemetry data of eight male brown bears (12,893 radio-locations) collected in Greece. Next, we combined habitat-suitability maps with real movement data to develop graph models that represent movement networks as inter-connected patches of different quality.

For this purpose, we used data from the World Input\u2013Output Database (WIOD) and examined GVCs as weighted directed networks, where countries are the nodes and value added flows are the edges. We compared the in-and out-weighted degree centralization of the sectoral GVC networks in order to detect the most centralized, on the import or export side, respectively (oligopsonies and oligopolies). Moreover, we examined the in-and out-weighted degree centrality and the in-and out-weight entropy in order to determine whether dominant countries are also diversified. The empirical results reveal that diversification (entropy) and dominance (degree) are not correlated. Dominant countries (rich) become more dominant (richer). Diversification is not conditioned by competitiveness. View Full-Text",

We examined the different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution.

Although certification organizations are use integrated production systems at the crop level to make certification determinations for individual farms, the available information is either not shared or exposed in non exploitable formats. In this work a web-3 semantic framework is proposed based on OLD cloud to link available information, related to Integrated Crop Production, to facilitate development and evaluation of current integrated crop production systems in Greece. In the case study, we propose links as relationships anchors in hypertext documents written in HTML, for data between arbitrary things described by RDF. We further proposed URIs to identify any kind of object or concept related to integrated fruit production. Since typical network portals, related to integrated fruit production, do not provide links among available data, nor expose their information in a standard form, the proposed ontology based on Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL, etc.) provides an environment where application can query that data and draw inferences using related vocabulary. By providing those extra links (in terms of RDF triples) several applications for integrated crop production can be developed.

We collected the data from the Open Data API provided by the Greek Ministry of Economy and Finance. Data modeling consist of two ontologies; the Vocabulary of Fiscal Projects, describing the fiscal projects and the National Strategic Reference Framework Greece Vocabulary, illustrating the Greek National Strategic Reference Framework data. We transformed the data into RDF triples and uploaded them onto an OpenLink Virtuoso Server, so that we could retrieve them via SPARQL queries. Performance indicators were defined to assess the state of the project and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise,(DBSCAN) was used to identify Red Flags. User\u2019s demands is that rejected projects should raise Red Flags, to avoid project failure and assist the auditor to organize the monitoring process efficiently, by avoiding to examine most of the non-problematic projects. We performed a use case scenario in which an auditor has to examine NSRF projects, approximately 12 months before the end of the programming period. The system retrieved the fiscal information, calculated the performance indicators and identified the Red Flags. The last update of the projects status after the end of the programming period was retrieved and extracted the number of rejected projects, to test whether \u2026",

We investigate several communication policies in knowledge networks, which reduce the knowledge attainment time without interventions.

Significant decrease of the knowledge attainment time (up to \u221274%) can be achieved by: (1) selecting agents of both high knowledge level and high knowledge transfer efficiency, and (2) implementing \u201cSelection\u201d after \u201cFiltering\u201d in contrast to the converse, implicitly \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The social adoption of change is usually hard because in reality, forces opposing the social adoption of change manifest. This situation of organizational conflict corresponds to the case where two competing groups of influential agents (\u201cpromoters\u201d versus \u201cadversaries\u201d of change) operate concurrently within the same organizational network. We model and explore the co-evolution of interpersonal ties and attitudes in the presence of conflict, taking into account explicitly the microscopic \u201cagent-to-agent\u201d interactions. In this perspective, we propose a new ties-attitudes co-evolution model where the diffusion of attitudes depends on the weights and the evolution of weights is formulated as a \u201clearning mechanism\u201d(weight updates depend on the previous values of both weights and attitudes). As a result, the co-evolution is intrinsic/endogenous. We simulate representative scenarios of conflict in 4 real organizational networks. In order to formulate structural balance in directed networks, we extended Heider\u2019s definition of balance considering directed triangles. The evolution of balance involves two stages: first, negative links pop up disorderly and destroy balance, but after some time, as new negative links are formed, a \u201cnew\u201d balance is re-established. This \u201cnew\u201d balance is emerging concurrently with the polarization of attitudes or domination of one attitude. Moreover, same-minded agents are positively linked and different-minded agents are negatively-linked. This macroscopic self-organization of the system is due only to agent-to-agent interactions, involving feedbacks on weight updates at the local microscopic level.",

At the same time, the Burridge\u2013Knopoff (BK) model of earthquake fault dynamics, one of the basic models of theoretical seismicity, does not possess self-similarity. We present an extension of the BK model, based on the introduction of nonlinear terms for the inter-block springs of the BK model, which results in the self-similarity of earth crust elastic properties being accounted for directly. Phase space analysis of the model reveals the behavior of a system of randomly kicked coupled oscillators. The nonlinear stiffness terms cause synchronization of the collective motion and produce stronger seismic events.",

We discuss the structure and properties of rigged Hilbert spaces and provide examples relevant for the description of resonances under our consideration.

This is moreover a natural framework to study the question whether a Markov process may arise as a projection of deterministic dynamical system. The latter question is closely related to the long standing problem of the relationship between deterministic laws of dynamics and probabilistic description of physical processes, known as the problem of irreversibility. In contrast to the usual coarse graining approach B. Misra, I. Prigogine and M. Courbage (2, 3] formulated the problem of irreversibility taking as a funda-mental physical principle the law of entropy increase. In this theory the problem of reconciling the dynamical evolution with the irreversible thermodynamical evolution is viewed in terms of establishing a non-unitary equivalence between the unitary dynamical group and probabilistic Markov processes. More explicitly, let {U) be a unitary group of evolution, which is induced by point dynamics {S} of the phase space, acting on the Hilbert space H spanned by the square integrable phase space functions. One considers now the possibility of relating the group {U) with a Markovian semigroup {Wi) through a non-unitary positivity preserving intertwining transformation A in such a way that",

We clarified the concept of mixing time by providing analytic formulas for two-state Markov chains. Explicit formulas for mixing times are presented for any two-state regular Markov chain. The mixing time of a Markov chain is determined also by the Time Operator of the Markov chain, within its Age computation. We illustrate these results in terms of two realistic examples: A Markov chain from US GNP data and a Markov chain from Dow Jones closing prices. We propose moreover \u2026",

            "Abstract": " Water buffaloes are considered social animals and perform several activities on pasture, such as grazing, moving, standing, ruminating, wallowing, lying, and drinking. However, the way these animals form their social structure in the herd during each one of these activities is still unknown. Literature for water buffaloes has focused mainly on their productive characteristics, impact of grazing on wetlands and behavior during grazing but failed to address the way these animals form their social organization during their activities on pasture. In this study, the tools of social network analysis are used to analyze, detect, and depict the proximity patterns in water buffaloes' activities on pasture and the effect of their age and gender on them. We describe and interpret a series of global and local network indices, and show that the water buffaloes differentiate their social structure in their activities on pasture and that the animals' age and gender affect their interacting patterns, and provide a framework for the application of social network analysis on grazing animals' social behavioral studies. We expect that this framework could be used in future research to provide information regarding the social structure of other kinds of animals that graze in different forage and climatic environments and help animal breeders to improve their management practices.",

Applying the wavelet transform to traffic measurements, we demonstrate the multiplicative character of traffic series. This result confirms that the scheme, developed by Kolmogorov [Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 31 (1941) 99] for the homogeneous fragmentation of grains, applies also to network traffic.",

            "Abstract": "We extend the agent-based models for knowledge diffusion in networks, restricted to random mindless interactions and to \u201cfrozen\u201d(static) networks, in order to take into account intelligent agents and network co-evolution. Intelligent agents make decisions under bounded rationality. This is the key distinction of intelligent interacting agents compared to mindless colliding molecules, involved in the usual diffusion mechanism resulting from accidental collisions. The co-evolution of link weights and knowledge levels is modeled at the local microscopic level of \u201cagent-to-agent\u201d interaction. Our network co-evolution model is actually a \u201clearning mechanism\u201d, where weight updates depend on the previous values of both weights and knowledge levels. The goal of our work is to explore the impact of (a) the intelligence of the agents, modeled by the selection-decision rule for knowledge acquisition,(b) the innovation rate of the agents,(c) the number of \u201ctop innovators\u201d and (d) the network size. We find that rational intelligent agents transform the network into a \u201ccentralized world\u201d, reducing the entropy of their selections-decisions for knowledge acquisition. In addition, we find that the average knowledge, as well as the \u201cknowledge inequality\u201d, grow exponentially. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "The time operator and internal age are intrinsic features of entropy producing innovation processes. The innovation spaces at each stage are the eigenspaces of the time operator. The internal age is the average innovation time, analogous to lifetime computation. Time operators were originally introduced for quantum systems and highly unstable dynamical systems. Extending the time operator theory to regular Markov chains allows one to relate internal age with norm distances from equilibrium. The goal of this work is to express the evolution of internal age in terms of Lyapunov functionals constructed from entropies. We selected the Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs\u2013Shannon entropy and more general entropy functions, namely the Tsallis entropies and the Kaniadakis entropies. Moreover, we compare the evolution of the distance of initial distributions from equilibrium to the evolution of the Lyapunov functionals constructed from norms with the evolution of Lyapunov functionals constructed from entropies. It is remarkable that the entropy functionals evolve, violating the second law of thermodynamics, while the norm functionals evolve thermodynamically. View Full-Text",

The developed formalism permits relating the circulation conservation law (Thompson theorem) to the invariance of the theory under special diffeomorphisms and also establishing new conservation laws. We also discuss the difference between the Eulerian and the Lagrangian descriptions, pointing out the incompleteness of the former. The constructed formalism is also applicable to an ideal plasma. We conclude with several remarks about quantizing the fluid.",

In this work, two relevant questions are discussed: \u201cHow can the different roles of members of a terrorist organization be recognized?\u201d and \u201care there early signs of impending terrorist acts?\u201d These questions are addressed using the tools of entropy and network theory, more specifically centralities (degree, betweenness, clustering) and their entropies. These tools were applied to data (physical contacts) of four real terrorist networks from different countries. The different roles of the members are clearly recognized from the values of the selected centralities. An early sign of impending terrorist acts is the evolutionary pattern of the values of the entropies of the selected centralities. These results have been confirmed in all four terrorist networks. The conclusion is expected to be useful to law enforcement authorities to identify the roles of the members of terrorist organizations as the members with high centrality and to anticipate when a terrorist attack is imminent, by observing the evolution of the entropies of the centralities.",

            "Abstract": "The adoption of change in organizational networks is conditioned by the engagement of the so-called \u201cchange agents\u201d initiating \u201ccascades of change\u201d, as well as by the internal communication among the members of the network. We investigate how the dynamics of the adoption of change is influenced by the engagement policy of the change agents and by the internal communication. In this perspective, we compare central engagements (high degree, high closeness, high betweenness, high eigen-centrality) with random engagement. We also compare three selection rules for communication, namely: selection by randomness, selection by high link weight, and selection by high link weight and degree centrality. The dynamics of change adoption is modeled by generalizing the discrete diffusion equation in order to incorporate both the engagement policies of the change agents and the internal communication rules \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Chaos was used as a mechanism for Cryptography by Shannon in his classic 1949 paper, without mentioning of course the word chaos. This idea has been extended and realized by Chaotic ie Entropy producing Torus Automorphisms. The corresponding algorithms and the software have been developed for any Torus Automorphism, adapted to be applicable for encryption in real time. We may select and combine in an arbitrary way several chaotic maps, creating in this way an infinite number of keys. Decryption is simply the reverse application of the selected maps. Therefore, the cryptography is effectively symmetric. The novelties of our work are summarized as follows: i) The possibility to design classes of chaotic Torus maps with any desirable Entropy Production. The Torus parameters are computed as functions of the selected Entropy Production. Moreover, we design Torus Automorphisms with integer parameters determined from the Entropy Production, in order to apply the designed Torus Automorphisms to cryptography of images or texts. The general construction is also applied to Torus Automorphisms constructed from the Fibonacci sequence. ii) The Encryption Mechanisms are designed and implemented by selecting and combining the Torus Maps in an arbitrary way. These Encryptions are in fact new classes and examples of MonoBlock Ciphers. iii) The application to content involving text and images.",

            "Abstract": "Topic detection is usually considered as a decision process implemented in some relevant context, for example clustering. In this case, clusters correspond to topics that should be identifed. Density-based clustering, for example, uses only a density level E and a lower bound for the number of points in a cluster. As the density level is hard to be estimated, a stochastic process, called the DBSCANMartingale, is constructed for the combination of several outputs of DBSCAN for various randomly selected values of E in a predefned closed interval [0; Emax] from the uniform distribution. We have observed that most of the clusters are extracted in the interval [0; Emax=2], and moreover in the interval [Emax=2; Emax] the DBSCANMartingale stochastic process is less innovative, i.e. extracts only a few or no clusters. Therefore, non-symmetric skewed distributions are needed to generate density levels for the extraction of all clusters in a fast way. In this work we show that skewed distributions may be used instead of the uniform, so as to extract all clusters as quickly as possible. Experiments on real datasets show that the average innovation time of the DBSCAN-Martingale stochastic process is reduced when skewed distributions are employed, so less time is needed to extract all clusters.",

Moreover, we examine whether the influence of experts is conditioned by the way agents select other agents for knowledge acquisition. In this perspective, we compare the emerging knowledge spread for 5 representative policies for positioning experts, namely: random (at nodes selected with equal probability) and central (at nodes with high centrality: degree, closeness, betweenness, eigen-centrality). Each agent selects an in-neighbor for knowledge acquisition, excluding (filtering out) agents of lower knowledge. As \u201cselections\u201d may be implemented before or after \u201cfiltering\u201d, we also compare the conventional wisdom of \u201cSelection\u201d before \u201cFiltering\u201d with the reverse order of \u201cSelection\u201d after \u201cFiltering\u201d.

The detailed analysis of the traffic measurements has shown that the reason for appearance of this distribution is a simple aggregation of real data. Applying the principal component analysis, the wavelet filtering, Fourier analysis, and statistical criteria we demonstrated that a few leading components form the main part of network traffic, while residual components play the role of small irregular variations that can be interpreted to be a stochastic noise.",

            "Abstract": "Nehamas\u2019 The art of living is a thorough study of philosophy not only as a academic discipline, but also as a way of life, an art of living. Nehamas considered Socrates as the first to have practiced the art of living during all his life, even when he decided to stay in Athens and accept his death sentence. We shall argue that Philosophy as art of living was moreover the keynote of Heraclitus\u2019 thinking. Heraclitus, a hundred years before Socrates, despite known as the philosopher of change, was involved to a great extent with issues concerning the human condition which was inseparable from cosmology, as it is evident from the surviving fragments of his work. After presenting the key ideas of Nehamas on the art of living in section 2, we summarize Heraclitus recommendations for proper apprehension as statements (H1) to (H17) in section 3, and his recommendations for avoiding misapprehension as statements (H18) to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "DIDSON acoustic cameras provide a way to collect temporally dense, high-resolution imaging data, similar to videos. Detection of fish targets on those videos takes place in a manual or semi-automated manner, typically assisted by specialised software. Exploiting the visual nature of the recordings, tools and techniques from the field of computer vision can be applied in order to facilitate the relatively involved workflows. Furthermore, machine learning techniques can be used to minimise user intervention and optimise for specific detection and tracking scenarios. This study explored the feasibility of combining optical flow with a genetic algorithm, with the aim of automating motion detection and optimising target-to-background segmentation (masking) under custom criteria, expressed in terms of the result. A 1000-frame video sequence sample with sparse, smoothly moving targets, reconstructed from a 125 s DIDSON recording, was analysed under two distinct scenarios, and an elementary detection method was used to assess and compare the resulting foreground (target) masks. The results indicate a high sensitivity to motion, as well as to the visual characteristics of targets, with the resulting foreground masks generally capturing fish targets on the majority of frames, potentially with small gaps of undetected targets, lasting for no more than a few frames. Despite the high computational overhead, implementation refinements could increase computational feasibility, while an extension of the algorithms, in order to include the steps of target detection and tracking, could further improve automation and potentially provide an efficient tool for the \u2026",

Such vectors are obtained for example when computer scientists represent unstructured data and then groups them into clusters in an unsupervised way. Another facet of clustering similar artifacts is the detection of densely connected nodes in network structures, where communities of nodes are formulated and need to be identified. To that end, we propose a new DBSCAN algorithm for estimating the number of clusters by optimizing a probabilistic process, namely DBSCAN-Martingale, which involves randomness in the selection of density parameter. We minimize the number of iterations required to extract all clusters by the DBSCAN-Martingale process, by providing an analytic formula. Experiments on spatial, textual and visual \u2026",

In this study we have used graph theory to compare the brain network organization of these two core systems in the cortical layer during difficult calculations. We have examined separately all the EEG frequency bands in healthy young individuals and we found that the network organization at rest, as well as during mathematical tasks has the characteristics of Small World Networks for all the bands, which is the optimum organization required for efficient information processing. The different mathematical stimuli provoked changes in the graph parameters of different frequency bands, especially the low frequency bands. More specific, in Delta band the induced network increases it\u2019s local and global efficiency during the transition from subitizing to retrieval system, while results suggest that difficult mathematics provoke networks with higher cliquish organization due to more specific demands. The network of the Theta band follows the same pattern as before, having high nodal and remote organization during difficult mathematics. Also the spatial distribution of the network\u2019s weights revealed more prominent connections in frontoparietal regions, revealing the working memory load due to the engagement of the retrieval system. The cortical networks of the alpha brainwaves were also more efficient, both locally and globally, during difficult mathematics, while the fact that alpha\u2019s network was more dense on the frontparietal regions as well, reveals the engagement of the retrieval system again.

The science of complexity emerged as a new paradigm and has caught the attention of numerous scientists all over the world in the last few decades. Prigogine led us to an understanding of the physical conditions underlying the emergence of complex structures and self organization. This is the law of order through fluctuations far from equilibrium. Already a Nobel Laureate, he was one of the first to understand and accept the extreme importance of this new field of studies. He proposed revolutionary ideas about discrete time, space, and the new laws of physics underlying self organization and the interdependence of complex systems. It is never easy to be the first and it is always extremely complicated to change the opinions and established views of scientists, especially in physics. However, he succeeded in doing so, and that is why we all appreciate and admire him. He had a unique scientific vision and intuition, which gave him the force to develop the understanding of issues such as deterministic chaos, discrete time and space, irreversibility and nonintegrability. Prigogine took special care to share his knowledge not only with his students and colleagues, but also with the general public. His scientific results and views have been formulated in brilliant papers and books. Until the very moment he passed away, Ilya Prigogine was working on finding new laws of physics, laws which will provide understanding of complex, living and thinking systems \u2026",

A model of changing the underlying asset prices in the form of general Ito stochastic process is developed. The derivative prices can be obtained from the solution of the reverse Cauchy problem for appropriate parabolic equations on the basis of the reverse Kolmogorov equation. We present here the numerical scheme for solving the reverse Cauchy problem for call option and put option prices based on the implicit finite element difference method.",

            "Abstract": "Among the physicists and mathematicians active in the field of\" nonlinear science\" there are three large communities concerned with the study of finite or infinite dimensional dynamical systems. On the one hand there are researchers interested in coherence properties, integrability concepts and solitons. They are concerned with\" integrable\" systems. Physical systems, however, are generally not integrable. Yet, integrable models are important to the physicist as\" building blocks\" around which perturbation theories can be developed. The investigation of discrete integrable systems (nonlinear lattices, difference-difference equations, ultra discrete systems...) has recently become a major research activity within this community. On the other hand there are researchers interested in chaos, decoherence, complexity and irreversibility, which are aspects of nonlinear dynamics associated with the breakdown of integrability \u2026",

In order to extract the regular part from traffic data and to decrease the system's dimension, we filtered out a high-frequency, \u201cnoisy\u201d part, applying the wavelet filtering. Using the principal components analysis (PCA), we estimated the number of feature components in the traffic series.

The data were retrieved from the platform \u201cOpentender\u201d for the period 2009\u20132019 from 33 EU countries and institutions. Graph indicators as network\u2019s density, centrality, entropy and conditional entropy were used to assess the competition on the part of the buyer and the sellers also. Net analysis contributes to the exploration of possible existence of oligopolies at the specific market and focuses on the big buyers\u2019 behavior. The data visualization explains the role that economic operators and hospitals play in the market. This methodology presents for the first time how the oligopsony, the monopsony interacts with the oligopoly, the monopoly or the competition in a specific market sector. Using real data, the whole methodology is presented in order to identify further or lost opportunities for economic operators, or situations in which the public sector should intervene to regulate competition issues. The results revealed heterogeneity in the behavior of contracting authorities and in the behavior of economic operators, which is not proportionally related to the economic value of the products to be supplied. The study of competition, which is the main concern of the present, leads us to a similar conclusion. On the part of sellers, there has been a decrease in weighted entropy in the recent years indicating that companies choose to conclude contracts with less randomness than the contracting \u2026",

This prevents them, nowadays, from being flexible to adapt to the Linked Data standards emergence and the advent of Semantic Web in general, unless they radically change orientation. In contrast, Wikis, followed by Content Management Systems, proved to be more versatile in complying with the Semantic Web and Linked Data standards. These advancements, together with their modular architecture, turn Wikis and CMSs into a decent choice for modern e-learning solutions. MediaWiki and Drupal were customized and deployed in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki to assess their potential in exposing the University\u2019s learning resources on the Web of Linked Data, in accordance with the Linked Universities Initiative. On the occasion of these two deployments, a thorough comparison of their platforms\u2019 potentials to function as Learning Management Systems took place and is presented on this paper.",

Every day brings new evidence of the breakneck pace of the changes that are currently underway. But while broad awareness may be unavoidable, understanding is not so easy. Both the pace of the revolution and its multi-faceted nature make it difficult to gain a clear perspective. But here the new science of complexity can perhaps help. It provides a coherent theory that is directly applicable to the emerging society, potentially providing new insights and new understanding. This paper examines several facets of the current revolution from a complexity perspective, and suggests that the relationship between the emerging science and the emerging society will be a rich one.",

We have demonstrated that nonlinear techniques can be successfully used for a deeper understanding of main features of the traffic data. At the same time, we found that due to a very complicated character of traffic series the traditional algorithms of nonlinear analysis do not give reliable estimations of the analyzed time series. For instance, the Grassberger\u00c4Procaccia algorithm gives a very high dimension for original traffic measurements. However, after filtering out a high-frequency component, which can be considered as a noise, we obtained a more realistic result for the embedding dimension of the underlying process. This result has been confirmed independently by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method [3] in the framework of the\u00ae Caterpillar\u00c4 Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) approach [1, 2]. The Principal Component Analysis is a well-known technique in multivariate data analysis [5\u00c49]. The PCA method consists in applying a linear transformation of the original data",

It was first understood by von Neumann, in 1932 x: while analyzing the thermodynamic features of quantum ensembles, at page 195 of his book on the Mathematical Foundations of QuantumMechanics (page 366 of the English translation), von Neumann proved that any given state \u0444 of a quantum mechanical system can be\" steered\" into any other state \u0444 of the same Hilbert space, by performing a series of very frequent measurements. If \u0444 and \u0444 coincide (modulo a phase factor), the evolution is\" frozen\" and, in modern language, a quantum Zeno effect takes place. This remarkable observation did not trigger much interest, neither in the mathematical, nor in the physical literature. It took 35 years before Beskow and Nilsson 2 applied the same ideas to a rather concrete physical problem (a particle in a bubble chamber) and wondered whether it is possible to influence \u2026",

This provides more accurate determination of the trend component. The methods are based on the M-evaluation with decision functions of Huber and Tukey type. The iterative numerical schemes for determination of trend and chaotic components are briefly presented, resulting in an acceptable solution within a finite number of iterations. The optimal level for extraction of the chaotic component is determined by a new numerical scheme based on the fractal dimension of the chaotic component of the analyzed series. Forecasting from the realized part of the analyzed series and a priori expert information is also discussed.",

We collected the data from the Open Data API provided by the Greek Ministry of Economy and Finance. Data modeling consist of two ontologies; the Vocabulary of Fiscal Projects, describing the fiscal projects and the National Strategic Reference Framework Greece Vocabulary, illustrating the Greek National Strategic Reference Framework data. We transformed the data into RDF triples and uploaded them onto an OpenLink Virtuoso Server, so that we could retrieve them via SPARQL queries. Performance indicators were defined to assess the state of the project and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise,(DBSCAN) was used to identify Red Flags. User\u2019s demands is that rejected projects should raise Red Flags, to avoid project failure and assist the auditor to organize the monitoring process efficiently, by avoiding to examine most of the non-problematic projects. We performed a use case scenario in which an auditor has to examine NSRF projects, approximately 12 months before the end of the programming period. The system retrieved the fiscal information, calculated the performance indicators and identified the Red Flags. The last update of the projects status after the end of the programming period was retrieved and extracted the number of rejected projects, to test whether \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The two core systems of mathematical processing (subitizing and retrieval) as well as their functionality are already known and published. In this study we have used graph theory to compare the brain network organization of these two core systems in the cortical layer during difficult calculations. We have examined separately all the EEG frequency bands in healthy young individuals and we found that the network organization at rest, as well as during mathematical tasks has the characteristics of Small World Networks for all the bands, which is the optimum organization required for efficient information processing. The different mathematical stimuli provoked changes in the graph parameters of different frequency bands, especially the low frequency bands. More specific, in Delta band the induced network increases it\u2019s local and global efficiency during the transition from subitizing to retrieval system, while results suggest that difficult mathematics provoke networks with higher cliquish organization due to more specific demands. The network of the Theta band follows the same pattern as before, having high nodal and remote organization during difficult mathematics. Also the spatial distribution of the network\u2019s weights revealed more prominent connections in frontoparietal regions, revealing the working memory load due to the engagement of the retrieval system. The cortical networks of the alpha brainwaves were also more efficient, both locally and globally, during difficult mathematics, while the fact that alpha\u2019s network was more dense on the frontparietal regions as well, reveals the engagement of the retrieval system again. Concluding, this study \u2026",

For the log-normal desired speed distribution function the solution clearly shows two modes corresponding to individual flow patterns (low-concentration mode) and to collective flow patterns (traffic jam mode). For low-concentration situations we found almost linear dependence of the information flow versus the concentration and that the higher the average speed the lower the concentration at which the optimum flow takes place.

Extension of this result to the continuous parameter case induces a new notion of continuous wavelet multiresolution analysis.

Intelligent agents make decisions under bounded rationality. This is the key distinction of intelligent interacting agents compared to mindless colliding molecules, involved in the usual diffusion mechanism resulting from accidental collisions. The co\u2011evolution of link weights and knowledge levels is modeled at the local microscopic level of \u201cagent\u2011to\u2011agent\u201d interaction. Our network co\u2011evolution model is actually a \u201clearning mechanism\u201d, where weight updates depend on the previ\u2011ous values of both weights and knowledge levels. The goal of our work is to explore the impact of (a) the intelligence of the agents, modeled by the selection\u2011decision rule for knowledge acquisition,(b) the innovation rate of the agents,(c) the number of \u201ctop innovators\u201d and (d) the network size. We find that rational intelligent agents transform the network into a \u201ccentralized world\u201d, reducing the entropy of their selections\u2011decisions for knowledge acquisition. In addition, we find that the average knowledge, as well as the \u201cknowledge inequality\u201d, grow exponentially.",
