Focusing on the particular case of smart homes with multiple occupants, we developed a location-and-movement recognition method using many inexpensive passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors and, a small number of, more costly RFID readers. In our method, PIR sensors, placed throughout the space, recognize movement while RFID readers, placed in key locations, recognize tags worn by individuals as they pass through their coverage area. The RFID readings are used to disambiguate the trajectories constructed based on PIR sensor readings. We evaluate through simulations the effectiveness of our method under different occupancy conditions.",

In this study, we searched through GitHub and found that a relatively small subset of Java-based repositories can be seen to adopt TDD, and an even smaller subset can be confidently identified as rigorously adhering to TDD. For comparison purposes, we created two same-size control sets of repositories. We then compared the repositories in these two sets in terms of number of test files, average commit velocity, number of commits that reference bugs, number of issues recorded, whether they use continuous integration, and the sentiment of their developers\u2019 commits. We found some interesting and significant differences between the two sets, including higher commit velocity and increased likelihood of continuous integration for TDD repositories.",

The key to achieving this goal is being able to recognize the individual's general activities in real-time, without impeding these activities or compromising privacy. Since location and movement constitute meaningful evidence for many everyday tasks (e.g., presence in the bathroom correlates with personal hygiene activities), we are motivated to develop an efficient, accurate, and noninvasive occupant-localization method. To this end, we propose a methodology for planning the deployment of an array of privacy-respecting binary motion sensors. In particular, given the geometric constraints of the deployment space, we generate a model of indoor mobility patterns typical for a single occupant. We then use this model as the basis for a specific optimization \u2026",

In particular, we developed a process for discovering a special type of sequential patterns, called interaction patterns. These are sequences of events with noise, in the form of spurious events that may occur anywhere in a pattern instance. In our case studies, we applied interaction pattern mining to systems with considerably different forms of interaction: Web-based systems and legacy systems. We used the discovered patterns for user interface reengineering, and personalization. The method is promising and generalizable to other systems with different forms of interaction.",

Given the increasing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the design process, automated model checking is a pragmatic approach to expeditiously identifying errors that may otherwise cause issues later in the building phase. A variety of methods have been proposed, but they are opaque regarding the rules they consider, and they do not allow users to edit these rules. In this paper, we describe a simple, yet extendible, language for specifying building rules and a method for evaluating these rules in the context of a BIM instance, in order to assess the compliance of the building with these rules.",

Early identification of AD is essential for managing the ensuing cognitive deficits, which may lead to a better prognostic outcome. Speech data can serve as a window into cognitive functioning and can be used to screen for early signs of AD. This paper describes methods for learning models using speech samples from the DementiaBank database, for identifying which subjects have Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. We consider two machine learning tasks: (a)~binary classification to distinguish patients from healthy controls, and (b)~regression to estimate each subject\u2019s Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. To develop models that can use acoustic and/or language features, we explore a variety of dimension reduction techniques, training algorithms, and fusion strategies. Our best performing classification model, using language features with dimension reduction and regularized logistic regression, achieves an accuracy of 85.4\\% on a held-out test set. On the regression task, a linear regression model trained on a reduced set of language features achieves an RMSE of 5.62 on the test set. These results demonstrate the promise of using machine learning for detecting cognitive decline from speech in AD patients.",

In this style, the functional components of the system are implemented in various programming languages as network-accessible \"services\" declaratively specified (in WSDL) and declaratively composed in workflows (using BPEL4WS). Despite this fundamentally distributed conceptualization of service composition, most current middleware assumes that the specification of the service composition is interpreted at run time by a central middleware node. This implies inflexible composition evolution: all parties must be updated concurrently to avoid interaction failures. This paper introduces an intelligent-agent framework that wraps Web services in a conversation layer and is capable of a simple workflow-adaptation function.

Therefore, studying the evolution of a service and the impact it may have on services and business partners that depend on it is essential to studying the evolution of software architecture in the age of service-oriented architecture (SOA). In such an environment with different and possibly independent parties, there may exist conflicting goals. For example, one party may aim for evolution, while another may desire stability.

Flexible decision making for effective adaptation to these challenges is an extremely difficult skill to acquire, and even more challenging to teach. Instructors of software-engineering courses involving collaborative project development are often overwhelmed by the task of monitoring the progress of multiple teams and problems in the team\u2019s process may go unnoticed until it is too late to be fixed. In this paper we describe our work on analyzing the CVS history of a team project repository to extract information about the nature of the collaboration between the members of a team. This analysis can support the instructor in noticing evidence of potential problems who can then use this information to alert the team. It can also be shown to the team members themselves, so that they become more aware of their process.

In this paper, we investigate the relation between project popularity and regular, consistent documentation updates.

The method first collects instances of the DOM trees underlying the application web pages, using a state-of-the-art crawling framework. Then, it clusters these instances into groups, corresponding to distinct features of the application. The contribution of this paper lies in the novel DOM-tree similarity metric of the clustering step, which makes a distinction between simple and composite structural changes. We have evaluated our method on three real web applications. In all three cases, the proposed distance metric leads to a number of clusters that is closer to the actual number of features and classifies web page instances into these feature-specific clusters more accurately than other traditional distance metrics. We therefore conclude that it is a reliable distance metric for reverse engineering the features of Ajax \u2026",

However, unfortunately, the continuing evolution of large, long-lived systems leads to lost information about these hidden relationships. In this paper, we propose a method for recovering such lost knowledge by data mining method. This method relies on the UMLDiff algorithm that, given a sequence of UML class models of a system, surfaces the design-level changes over its life span, thus eliminating the need for high quality modification reports and nonintuitive software code-based metrics. We employ Apriori association rule mining algorithm to the transactional database of class modifications, which elicit previously unknown or undocumented co-evolving relations among two or more classes. The recovered knowledge facilitates the overall understanding of system evolution and the planning of future maintaining activities. We report on one real world case study evaluating our approach.",

To help address these challenges, we developed a data adaptor as an Eclipse plugin, which efficiently handles this dump.

In this paper, we first trace the history of virtual worlds back to its antecedents in electronic gaming and on-line social networking. We then provide an overview of extant virtual worlds, including education-focused, theme-based, community-specific, children-focused, and self-determined worlds \u2013 and we analyze the relationship among these worlds according to an initial taxonomy for the area. Recognizing the apparent leadership of Second Life among today's self-determined virtual worlds, we present a detailed case study of this environment, including surveys of 138 residents regarding how they perceive and utilize the environment.

Our method involves three steps: (a) recognition of Extract Class opportunities, (b) ranking of the identified opportunities in terms of the improvement each one is anticipated to bring about to the system design, and (c) fully automated application of the refactoring chosen by the developer. The first step relies on an agglomerative clustering algorithm, which identifies cohesive sets of class members within the system \u2026",

In this paper, we discuss a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-evolution process and its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of the system, motivated by the hypothesis that it may impact the overall system security. Our methodology relies on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). First, we extract the roles-permissions matrix of each system version and we compute the implicit concept lattice.

These patterns constitute operational models of the application's functional requirements, from the end-user perspective. We have developed an algorithm, IPM, for interaction-pattern discovery. This algorithm discovers patterns that meet a user-specified criterion and is robust to insertion errors, caused by user mistakes or by the availability of alternative scenarios for the same user task.

To use these services, however, developers have to understand \"information-use contracts\" specified in natural language, and, to build applications that benefit from multiple existing services they have to map the underlying resource schemas in their code. This process is difficult and error-prone, especially as the number and overlap of the underlying services increases, and the mappings become opaque, difficult to maintain, and practically impossible to reuse. The more recent advent of the Linked Data formalisms can offer a solution to the challenge. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for REST-service integration based on Linked Data models.

Any change may potentially affect an application's behaviour, performance, and energy consumption profile. Our previous work demonstrated that changes to the system-call profile of an application correlated with changes to the application's energy-consumption profile. This paper evaluates and describes GreenAdvisor, a first of its kind tool that systematically records and analyzes an application's system calls to predict whether the energy-consumption profile of an application has changed. The GreenAdvisor tool was distributed to numerous software teams, whose members were surveyed about their experience using GreenAdvisor while developing Android applications to examine the energy-consumption impact of selected commits from the teams' projects \u2026",

Compared to RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, are more attractive in addressing this challenge. However, it is not easy to manage data in NoSQL database effectively for non-expert users because of the rare data-organization support. A poor data organization may accidentally abuse the features of NoSQL database and achieve unsatisfactory performance. Therefore, a systematic method for NoSQL database data-schema design is a timely and important problem for researchers and practitioners. HBase, as a particular NoSQL database offering, relies (a) on HDFS, for its distributed and replicated storage, and (b) on coprocessors, for efficient parallel query processing. To \u2026",

We propose an interactive visualization tool (City on the River) for visualizing collaborations over time. The City on the River (CotR) visualization shows the contributions and artifacts (\u201cproducts\u201d) of a team on a timeline and the individuals on the team who contributed to each product. CotR enables interactive analyses of each of these components for answering questions such as, which people work together on the most products, which products involve the most people, what kinds of products were produced when and by whom, etc. CotR can be used for analyzing diverse domains such as research collaborations, conference participation, email conversations, and software development. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment to assess CotR for analyzing collaboration and outcomes in GitHub projects. We compared the quality of answers, time to answer, and approaches taken to analyze the project collaborations by two groups of people: one group used the GitHub data displayed in a spreadsheet; the other group used the GitHub data displayed using CotR.",

Using a data set with sensor readings collected from one-person and two-person sessions engaged in a variety of activities of daily living, we investigate the relative merits of relying solely on anonymous sensors, solely on eponymous sensors, or on their combination. We examine how the lack of synchronization across different sensing sources impacts the quality of location estimates, and discuss how it could be mitigated without resorting to device-level mechanisms.

            "Abstract": "While code understanding is the primary program comprehension activity, it is quite challenging to recognize the application requirements from code, since they have usually been occluded by a set of layers of later implementation decisions. An alternative source of evidence, especially valuable for understanding the purposes for which the application was built, can be the dynamic behavior of the system, and more specifically the system-user interaction. We have developed a method for modeling the application behavior from the user's perspective in the form of use case models, using recorded traces of system-user interaction. We use data mining and pattern matching methods to mine these traces for frequently occurring user tasks. When interesting patterns are discovered, they are augmented with semantic information and they are used to build use case models. We demonstrate a successful application of this \u2026",

We compare prediction of cognitive ability with a purpose-built serious game and with a similar game built using a game engine. In an experiment conducted with 28 participants, performance on the two games is assessed relative to three cognitive abilities, using two different tablet sizes and two different input methods. The results for the game-engine variant were similar to the purpose-built game, where both games significantly predicted performance on the three cognitive abilities, and were sensitive to the effects of age. Performance on both games was not significantly affected by tablet size or input method. These results support earlier findings that serious games can provide valid cognitive assessment, and they show that game engines can be used to develop serious games for cognitive assessment, cost \u2026",

Therefore, capturing and understanding the evolution that the system\u2019s logical design has gone through can provide valuable insights in support of consistently maintaining and evolving the system, without compromising the integrity and stability of its architecture. In this paper, we present a method for capturing and analyzing the design evolution of object-oriented software systems. This method relies on UMLDiff, a heuristic UML-structure differencing algorithm, which, given a sequence of UML class models corresponding to the logical design of a sequence of system code releases, produces a sequence of \u201cchange records\u201d that describe the design-level structural changes between subsequent system releases. Various design evolution patterns are then analyzed to reveal the rationale underlying design decisions that may affect the software system. The recovered knowledge about the system\u2019s logic design evolution enables the overall understanding of system design evolution and provides the basis for mentoring the developers on future maintainance activities. We report on one real world case study evaluating our approach.",

The game-configuration process essentially controls the placement and the interaction behavior of the games' objects so that they induce the user to adopt the proper postures, as described by the input exercise specification.

The extension improves state and context management in a multi-tasking environment suffering from severe memory limitations. The solution integrates tuple operations into the model--for networking, event handling, and thread contexts. We demonstrate how tuple constructs improve coding and reduce code overhead.

            "Abstract": "Since 2010, research on cloud-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been receiving increased attention, motivated by the need to increase productivity through interoperability in the construction industry. To date, IFC is the de-facto standard for data exchange among tools in this domain. However, IFC is too large and not sufficiently specific to effectively support the management of a single building model by multiple tools. This paper proposes BIM-kit, a collaborative BIM platform based on a simple, modular data schema. In this research, we demonstrate how multiple task-specific tools can be used collectively and efficiently in a shared cloud-based BIM environment to support a variety of use cases, across the overall building-design activity.",

Its low cost, small form factor, and multiple items tracking make it suitable to use in Smart Supply Chain Management (SSCM). There are many limitations of traditional Supply Chain Management (SCM) such as decentralized control, slow process, a lot of manual bookkeeping, unpredictable supplies which can lead to uncertain prices and deliveries. This paper discusses how SSCM can help overcome these drawbacks, by investigating four different scenarios of SSCM where RFID plays a major role. The frameworks discussed here try to solve some parts of the SSCM and give a brief idea about how they can be incorporated into the whole process. In addition to examining different approaches, a combined framework is proposed at the end. This proposal reflects the best characteristics that can \u2026",

To consistently evolve a system, developers have to understand the rationale behind its current design and the evolution trajectory that has led to it. In this paper, we present a method for analyzing the design evolution of object-oriented software systems, for the purpose of providing relevant advice to developers. This method relies on UMLDiff, a heuristic UML-structure differencing algorithm, which, given a sequence of UML class models corresponding to the logical design of a sequence of system code versions, produces a sequence of \"change trees\" that describe the design-level structural changes between subsequent system versions. A set of design-evolution patterns are then analyzed to understand the rationale underlying design decisions that may affect the software system. We demonstrate how the recovered knowledge \u2026",

As a result, providers are seeking ways to infer customers' interests and to adapt their Web sites to make the content of interest more easily accessible. Pattern mining is a promising approach in support of this goal. Assuming that past navigation behavior is an indicator of users' interests, then records of this behavior, kept in the form of Web-server logs, can be mined to infer what users are interested in. On that basis, recommendations can be dynamically generated, to help new Web-site visitors find information of interest faster.

In this work, we focus primarily on the comparison of service-interface versions, in order to precisely recognize their differences, and the adaptation of client applications. We propose a lightweight model to represent service interfaces, an efficient and accurate comparison method whose output can be seamlessly consumed by the adaptation process, a classification of changes in service interfaces based on their impact on client applications and, finally, a generic adaptation algorithm that can be applied for any type of change and on any client regardless of the implementation technology.

New requirements, tight delivery schedules and developer turnaround present the team with challenges that need to be addressed with informed development-plan modifications. Project-management skills are especially difficult to teach. When working on a substantially complex project, students often become too involved with coding to recognize the need for management; and when they do, they frequently lack the necessary information to make a good decision, because, more often than not, they do not have a complete overview of their progress.In this paper, we describe a lightweight environment for supporting, monitoring and analyzing activities related to software development. This environment integrates a set of tools, including CVS, newsgroups, code analysis and personalprocess tools, and uses a browser-accessible Wiki-based user interface as a front end to all the underlying tools. We have just deployed this environment in the context of an undergraduate software-engineering course. We believe that the familiar lightweight user interface will encourage students to use the integrated tools and will improve their overall learning experience, especially in the project-management area. At the same time, it will enable the instructors to monitor the teamdevelopment progress and to provide relevant and constructive feedback.",

In recent years, e-learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to traditional teaching.

Wiki\u2019s collaborative authoring nature makes it a very attractive tool to use for e-Learning purposes; however, its text-based navigational structure becomes insufficient as the Wiki grows in size, and this backlash can hinder students from taking full advantage of the information available. ENWiC\u2019s goal is to provide student with an intelligent interface for navigating Wikis and other similar large-scale websites. ENWiC make use of graphic organizers to visualize the relationships between content pages so that students can gain a cognitional understanding of the content as they navigating through the Wiki pages. We describe ENWiC\u2019s automated visualization process, and its user interfaces for students to view and navigate the Wiki in a meaningful manner, and for instructors to further enhance the visualization.

The fact that object-oriented software is increasingly developed using an evolutionary development process makes the situation even worse. The developers face increasing difficulties in comprehending the system design and its rapid evolution, since the amount of information is overwhelming. Traditional top-down approach to software evolution understanding does not work very well to precisely capture the changes and their underlying motivations. In this paper, we present our bottom-up design-evolution analysis approach, implemented in the JDEvAn tool. The JDEvAn tool has been equipped with a suite of longitudinal and datamining analysis methods and a set of change-pattern detection queries to automatically recover the interesting core evolution concerns, such as sets of co-evolving classes or instances of refactorings, by aggregating elementary design changes into composite concerns. Given the key participants of an evolution concern, the JDEvAn Viewer allows developers to interactively explore the relevant elements, relations, and their changes over time so that they can incrementally build up their knowledge about what has been changed, how and why. We evaluate the effectiveness of JDEvAn with two case studies on realistic open-source objectoriented software, in the context of which we show how JDEvAn help us capture the completely different rationale for two pairs of seemingly similar evolution concerns.",

SensorGIS provides an integrated service-oriented architecture for collecting, archiving, analyzing, and visualizing sensor network data in a geographic information system (GIS). By using an extendible GIS framework as one of its user views, SensorGIS can contextually communicate the collected data, its trends, and distinct values of interest. In addition, it is designed in the service-oriented style and hence is extendible in terms of the analyses and visualizations. Finally, it integrates an online collaborative forum that enables annotation of the collected data with the users\u2019 observations and interpretations.",

Yet occupant and visitor access to spaces and equipment within these buildings are still managed through unsystematic, inefficient, and human-intensive processes. As a standard practice, long-term building occupants are given access privileges to rooms and equipment based on their organisational roles, while visitors have to be escorted by their hosts. This approach is conservative and inflexible. In this paper, we describe a methodology that can flexibly and securely manage building access privileges for long-term occupants and short-term visitors alike, taking into account the risk associated with accessing each space within the building.

We developed a process for discovering a special type of sequential patterns, called interaction patterns. These are sequences of events with randomly distributed noise, in the form of spurious user activities We successfully applied our interaction pattern mining process in two contexts. First, we mined recorded traces of the system-user dialog with the user interface of a legacy system to recover the de-facto requirements of the legacy system and reengineer its user interface. Second, we mined Web server logs of a focused Web site, which is a site that is used consistently by the users to support an ongoing process, eg, a university course Web site. The discovered interaction patterns of previous recent users can be used to generate Web page recommendation onthe-fly. Interaction pattern mining is promising and can be generalized to other software runtime repositories.",

WSDL specifications, however, can be information poor, with standard data types, unintuitive identifiers for data, messages and operations and little naturallanguage documentation. The nature of the usage of the WSDL elements in the context of a BPEL composition can be an extremely useful source of information in the context of service discovery. In this paper, we discuss our method for service discovery based on interface and usage matching, exploiting the information captured in the WSDL and BPEL specifications. Our approach views both WSDL and BPEL as hierarchical structures and uses tree alignment to compare them in order to assess their similarity and to recognize the correspondences between their elements. We illustrate our method with two example scenarios.",

With more configuration options (virtualized systems, cloud-based systems, etc.), the challenge grows more difficult. Configuring service-oriented systems involves balancing a competing set of priorities and choosing trade-offs to achieve a satisfactory state. To address this problem, we present a simulation-based methodology for supporting administrators in making these decisions by providing them with relevant information obtained using inexpensive simulation-generated data. Our services-aware simulation framework enables the generation of lengthy simulation traces of the system\u2019s behavior, characterized by a variety of performance metrics, under different configuration and load conditions.

As a result, issue trackers are often full of duplicate issues and bugs, and bug triaging is time consuming and error prone. Many researchers have approached the bug-deduplication problem using off-the-shelf information-retrieval tools, such as BM25F used by Sun et al. In our work, we extend the state of the art by investigating how contextual information, relying on our prior knowledge of software quality, software architecture, and system-development (LDA) topics, can be exploited to improve bug-deduplication.

The objective is the placement of the smallest number of sensors with the right combination of footprints. To address the problem, and motivated by the vast search space of possible placement and footprint combinations, we adopt an evolutionary technique. We demonstrate that our technique performs faster and/or produces more accurate results (depending on the application) when compared to previously proposed greedy methods. Furthermore, our technique is flexible in that adding new sensor footprints can be trivially accomplished.",

More specifically we have developed a general method for constructing wrappers for Web-based applications, so that they exchange data with shared semantics such as defined in the XML domain model. At run-time, the user's requests result in the mediator's XML queries to the application wrappers, which, in turn, invoke appropriate methods on the wrapped applications and extract XML data from their responses to these queries.",

Given a readily available representation of a software system, reverse engineering aims at obtaining an abstract representation of the system.

Reverse-engineering methods and technologies play an important role in many software engineering tasks, such as bug fixing, software adaptation and maintenance, and system reengineering or migration. All these activities require, to some extent, an understanding of the system that transcends a limited locality and a single point of view.

It becomes relevant when one needs to assess a system for the purpose of adopting it in a new context, or to further develop it to meet new requirements and change requests. In this paper, we describe our work on analyzing and understanding the evolution of an objectoriented application at the class-design level. We introduce a structure-matching algorithm for comparing two or more versions of an architecture represented in UML (XMI). The algorithm produces a\" change tree\" that reports the differences of the compared versions in terms of class/field/method additions, deletions, moves, and renamings. Analysis of a series of change trees corresponding to a series of versions can reveal interesting and useful information about the evolution history of the application architecture, such as evolution styles, class evolution types, change patterns, etc. In this paper, we discuss the algorithm, the change-tree data structure, and the architecture-evolution analysis, and we report on two case studies evaluating our approach.",

Role-based access control (RBAC), which is likely the most popular access-control technique, specifies \u201cuser roles\u201d and associates each role with \u201cpermissions\u201d to access distinct system functionalities. These role-permissions assignment rules, as well as the types of system users and system functionalities, evolve over time. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices, implied by these matrices.

Practical experience in software development has led to a set of best practices and coding conventions that are believed to make source code easier to read, understand and maintain. Based on a survey of software engineers, we identify the relative importance of 71 coding conventions to maintainability. We propose a metric that offers a different perspective on maintenance, namely a \u201cconvention adherence\u201d metric based on the number and severity of violations of these coding conventions. We examine the code repositories of four open-source Java projects to measure their adherence to coding conventions over the life of the project, based on both their self-identified conventions and those of the convention-adherence metric. Through our analysis, we discovered several interesting phenomena, including pre-release effort to bring new code in line with desirable conventions, effective usage of automated code convention checkers as part of the build process to improve adherence, variations in adherence over the software lifecycle, and a class of conventions consistently ignored in open source projects.",

However, poor adoption of REST specification standards and lack of systematic development tools have given rise to many, more or less compliant, variants of the Restful style constraints, which undermine the evolvability and interoperability of these systems. In this paper, we describe a tool that supports the systematization of RESTful application development, through the use of semi-automatically constructed WADL interface specifications, without compromising the ease of the overall practice.

Wiki\u2019s collaborative authoring nature makes it a very attractive tool to use for e-Learning purposes. Unfortunately, the web\u2019s text-based navigational structure becomes insufficient as the Wiki grows in size, and this backlash can hinder students from taking full advantage of the information available.

To support DaaS integrations, we develop a model-driven method for creating APIs to deliver DaaS.

We have studied five research questions that explore the different types of refactorings applied to different types of sources, the individual contribution of team members on refactoring activities, the alignment of refactoring activity with release dates and testing periods, and the motivation behind the applied refactorings. The studied projects have a history of 12, 7, and 6 years, respectively. We have found that there is very little variation in the types of refactorings applied on test code, since the majority of the refactorings focus on the reorganization and renaming of classes. Additionally, we have identified that the refactoring decision making and application is often performed by individual refactoring \u201cmanagers\u201d. We have found a strong alignment between refactoring activity and release dates. Moreover, we found that the development teams apply a considerable amount of refactorings during testing periods. Finally, we have also found that in addition to code smell resolution the main drivers for applying refactorings are the introduction of extension points, and the resolution of backward compatibility issues.",

Game-based learning and 3D interactive platforms are increasingly used in healthcare because they provide the affordances to be more inclusive teaching tools and to better engage learners. In anatomy courses, students particularly struggle to establish a mental map of the brain which is arguably one of the most complex organs of the human body. Although a wide range of tools already exists, they do not highlight the functional relationships between elements of the brain that are necessary to build an accurate mental image. We applied the principles of the Universal Design for Learning framework to guide the design and the development of a bilingual learning application that allows learners to understand pathways in the brain better.

            "Abstract": "With the advent of more and more services available on the Web, a user can have a difficult job of assembling the various pieces of a complex task to arrive at a final solution. Not only would the user need to access each web-based resource through its individual client-side interface, but she would also need to interpret its response to her request, and to manually combine the multiple responses from the different resources to accomplish the complex task. In this paper, we discuss a multiagent, XML-based framework that supports the development of aggregate applications that rely on semantic-based reflective monitoring and collaboration among several agents to complete the user\u2019s task. Our framework makes use of declarative models of the domain information, the taskspecific information, and the semantic constraints of this information. Each agent uses these models to interact with the user, to coordinate the information exchange with the various web resources, to monitor and control the execution of the applications, and to take action when a failure is detected. When an agent detects a failure, it collaborates with other agents by distributing the tasks to those agents which are capable of completing the task, thus ensuring successful completion of the user\u2019s request. We illustrate our approach and the architecture of the aggregate applications that it produces using a bookbuying assistant as an example.",

Although this automation represents a great opportunity to systematize and improve the quality of the process of using Web APIs, LRA's reliance on SPARQL as the user-interaction model may hinder its adoption. Hence, based upon previous work on Linked Data query systems, in this paper we present a tool that takes advantage of the emergent schema of Web API descriptions, in order to simplify the formulation of LRA-compliant queries.",

            "Abstract": "The problem of automatic item generation (AIG), namely the use of algorithmic methods for automatically and systematically generating a multitude of test items, is attracting increasing interest in the educational-assessment community. After computer-supported online lesson delivery, the AIG research agenda represents the second most important use of computers in supporting education objectives.This agenda is driven by the promise of technology to increase cost-effectiveness and to enable systematic adaptive testing. Generating individual test items is a knowledge-intensive task and test items are not reusable, or rather, they can be reused only under very carefully controlled contexts. For purely practical reasons, automatic generation of test items is of particular interest in decentralized educational institutions, such as distance education centers, that conduct much of their testing online. For example, Athabasca University in Canada has recently started such a service for its staff and students [2], initially focusing on mathematics. Its primary objective is simply to generate a repository of different items in order to reduce staff burden and share individual items among its faculty. From an education-research perspective, educators need to be able not only to generate test items, but also to correlate test items with different knowledge and skills, in order to be able to assess the performance of students, and their progress from one level to the next, over time. This association of test items to knowledge and skill types and levels is an equally knowledge-intensive process, and fundamentally empirical in nature. Furthermore, the advancement of a student \u2026",

Using this tool, developers can create application-specific diagrams of the application's logical model and annotate them with information about the user-interface widgets appropriate for interacting with the model elements. WL++ then produces a relational back-end for storing the model data, a set of RESTful APIs for accessing and updating the back-end, and a multi-platform mobile application that relies on the IBM Worklight framework to render, interact with and store the relevant \u2026",

Real-world evaluation of alternative possible sensor-deployment configurations is labor-intensive, costly, and time-consuming, which implies the need for a simulation-based methodology. In this work, we report on such a methodology that supports the modeling of indoor spaces, the activities of their occupants, and the behaviors of different types of sensors. We argue that, in order for a simulation to be useful for the purpose of evaluating a sensor deployment configuration, it has to generate realistic event streams of individual sensors over time, as well as realistic compositions of sensor events within a time window. We have evaluated our simulator for smart indoor spaces, S I M s i s toolkit, in the context of our Smart-Condo ambient-assisted living platform, supporting the observation and analysis of activities of daily living (ADLs). Our findings indicate that S I M s i s produces realistic agent traces and sensor readings, and has the potential to support the process of developing and deploying sensor-based applications.

New requirements, tight delivery schedules and developer turnaround present the team with challenges that need to be addressed with informed development-plan modi\ufb01cations. Project-management skills are especially difficult to teach. When working on a substantially complex project, students often become too involved with coding to recognize the need for management; and when they do, they frequently lack the necessary information to make a good decision, because, more often than not, they do not have a complete overview of their progress.In this paper, we describe a lightweight environment for supporting, monitoring and analyzing activities related to software development. This environment integrates a set of tools, including CVS, newsgroups, code analysis and personal-process tools, and uses a browser-accessible Wiki-bascd user interface as a front end to all the underlying tools. We have just deployed this environment in the context of an undergraduate so\ufb02ware-engineering course. We believe that the familiar lightweight user interface will encourage students to use the integrated tools and will improve their overall learning experience, especially in the project-management area. At the same time, it will enable the instructors to monitor the teamdevelopment progress and to provide relevant and constructive feedback.",

The fact that object-oriented software is increasingly developed using an evolutionary development process makes the situation even worse. The developers face increasing difficulties in comprehending the system design and its rapid evolution, since the amount of information is overwhelming. Traditional top-down approach to software evolution understanding does not work very well to precisely capture the changes and their underlying motivations. In this paper, we present our bottom-up design-evolution analysis approach, implemented in the JDEvAn tool. The JDEvAn tool has been equipped with a suite of longitudinal and datamining analysis methods and a set of change-pattern detection queries to automatically recover the interesting core evolution concerns, such as sets of co-evolving classes or instances of refactorings, by aggregating elementary design changes into composite concerns. Given the key participants of an evolution concern, the JDEvAn Viewer allows developers to interactively explore the relevant elements, relations, and their changes over time so that they can incrementally build up their knowledge about what has been changed, how and why. We evaluate the effectiveness of JDEvAn with two case studies on realistic open-source objectoriented software, in the context of which we show how JDEvAn help us capture the completely different rationale for two pairs of seemingly similar evolution concerns.",

It advocates the modeling of common and variable features in software-system families with domain-specific languages, and the specification of transformation compositions for successively refining the abstract domain models towards eventually enriching them with execution semantics. Thus, using code-generation environments, families of software systems can be generated, based on models specified in high-level domain languages. The major advantage of this software-construction methodology stems from the fact that it enables the reuse of verified execution semantics, derived from domain models. However, like all software, once an implementation is generated, it is bound to evolve and manually refined to introduce features that were not captured by its original generation environment.

For example, there are a number of commercial surgical simulators which offer great potential for the training of basic skills and techniques, if the tedium of repeated rehearsal can be overcome. It is generally recognized that more abstract problem-solving and knowledge level training needs to be incorporated into simulated scenarios. This chapter explores some examples of what has been developed in terms of teaching models and evaluative methodologies, then discusses the educational theories explaining why virtual simulations and serious games are an important teaching tool, and finally suggests how to assess their value within an educational context.

The value of multidisciplinarity has also been recognized in academic environments, as funding agencies are committing substantial support to large-scale research initiatives that span across disciplines, organizations, academia and industry, even across national borders, and aim to address the major challenges of our time, from climate change, to energy shortage, to pandemics. New incentives and performance indicators are needed to encourage and reward multidisciplinary collaborative work. In this paper, we introduce a metric for multidisciplinarity, based on the notion of T-shapedness and we report on the application of this measure on data collected over four years from the GRAND Network of Centres of Excellence, a large-scale, Canadian, multidisciplinary research network conducting research on digital media with numerous academic and industrial partners. We describe our findings on how the community evolved over time in terms of its T-shaped multidisciplinarity and compare the multidisciplinarity of GRAND researchers to their non-GRAND peers.",

Some of these guidelines are query-agnostic: we defined them based on related literature regarding the desired properties of the HBase organization. Other guidelines are query-aware: we formulated them to incorporate data-access paths, extracted from query logs, in order to improve the quality of the transformation and the eventual access efficiency of the HBase repository.

UDDI, the standard API for publishing web-services specifications, provides a simple browsing-by-business-category mechanism for developers to review and select published services. To support programmatic service discovery, we have developed a suite of methods that utilizes both the semantics of the identifiers of WSDL descriptions and the structure of their operations, messages and data types to assess the similarity of two WSDL files.

In particular, users most enhance on physical attributes that they perceive to be weak in real life. We also find that avatar attractiveness affects online behavioral traits such as extroversion and loudness. Lastly, we find support for a hierarchy of physical variation across online roles whereby people retain core identity elements (such as gender and race) across all their avatars, but they change peripheral elements (such as hair and clothing, and even face).

Because service processes involve co-generating value with consumers, our model intermeshes what the consumer does with what the business does. We accordingly link the stages of the service cycle with four levels of management activity. Needed management activity includes (a) planning strategy,(b) designing the process,(c) managing human resources, technology, and customer perceptions, and (d) measuring service and business performance in each stage of the service cycle. We provide recommendations for each of these levels of management activity, including (i) selecting the value offer,(ii) planning the process to integrate software, information systems, and human resources,(iii) management policy to assist in managing the service system on a day-to-day basis, and (iv) measurement and information systems that inform the management process. The proposed framework for eService is necessarily interdisciplinary, involving marketing (strategic positioning), finance (investment decisions), operations (service process planning and management), computing science (software and hardware planning), communications (customer relationship management), human resource management (personnel selection and training), management information systems (performance measurement), and consumer behavioral science (managing consumer expectations).",

To this end, we have defined a PSM modeling language and a failure-driven redesign process based on this language, both of which were implemented in the AUTOGNOSTIC system. In this paper, we report on a sequence of experiments performed with AUTOGNOSTIC.

Software developers as the builders and maintainers of applications, are responsible for updating and deploying energy efficient applications to end users. Unfortunately, the impact of software change on energy consumption is still unclear. Estimation based on software metrics has proved difficult. As energy consumption profiling requires special infrastructure, developers have difficulty assessing the impact of their actions on energy consumption. System calls are the interface between applications and the OS kernel and provide insight into how software utilizes hardware and software resources. As profiling system calls requires no specialized infrastructure, unlike energy consumption, it is much easier for the developers to track changes to system calls. Thus we relate software change to energy consumption by tracing the changes in an application\u2019s pattern of system call invocations. We find that significant changes to system call profiles often induce significant changes in energy consumption.",

Our methodology stipulates the systematic exploration of varying SOA deployment configurations in order to collect behavioral profiles. One can use these to examine the trade-offs between configuration cost and performance, ultimately identifying a cost-effective configuration that complies with a Service Level Agreement.

With much of our social activity happening online, these sites are now becoming the subject of scholarly study and research. Unfortunately, despite the fact that they collect similar content and support similar relations and activities, the current generation of these sites are hard to query programmatically, offering limited views of their data, effectively becoming disconnected islands of information. We describe SociQL, a high-level query language, and a corresponding service, to which social-networking sites can subscribe, that supports the integrated representation, querying and exploration of disparate social networks. Unlike generic web query languages, SociQL is designed specifically to support the integration of networks through a common information model for the purpose of examining sociological questions, motivated by \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The number of Web APIs for accessing information and services is continuously increasing, and yet, no tools exist to automate the time-consuming and error-prone process of invoking these APIs and composing their responses. The recent emergence of widely-adopted, standardized, Web-API description formats and the development of Linked Data technologies for data integration have motivated our work on the LRA (Linked REST APIs) methodology [1, 2]. LRA relies on RDF service specifications to automate the development process around the usage of Web APIs. This automation represents a great opportunity to systematize and improve the quality of service-oriented application development. However, LRA\u2019s reliance on SPARQL as the user-interaction model may hinder its adoption, because it requires developers to learn the intricacies of the unconventional graph data model and its associated datasets. In this paper we have developed the LRA Workbench (LRAW bench), which takes advantage of the emergent schema of Web-API specifications, in order to simplify the formulation of LRA-compliant SPARQL queries. Our empirical evaluation of the LRAW bench usability demonstrates that our tool significantly improves the performance of developers formulating SPARQL queries for LRA. A subsequent study on the effectiveness of the LRAW bench demonstrated that developers using LRA tend to produce code with considerable better structural complexity, in less time, than developers manually composing APIs.",

            "Abstract": "Model-based code-generators are complex in nature; they are built using a variety of tools such as language workbenches, and model-to-model and model-to-text transformation languages. Due to the highly heterogeneous technology ecosystem in which code generators are built, understanding and maintaining their architecture pose numerous cognitive challenges to both novice and expert developers. Most of these challenges are associated with tasks that require to trace and pinpoint generation artifacts given a life-cycle requirement. We argue that such tasks can be classified in three general categories:(a) information discovery,(b) information summarization, and (c) information filtering and isolation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that visualizations that enable the interactive exploration of model-to-model and model-to-text transformation compositions can significantly improve developers\u2019 performance when reflecting on a code-generation architecture, and its corresponding execution mechanics. In this paper we describe an empirical study conceived (a) to understand the performance of developers (in terms of time and precision) when asked to discover, filter, and summarize information about a model-based code generator, using classic integrated development environments and editors, and (b) to measure and compare the developers\u2019 effectiveness on the same tasks using state-of-the-art traceability visualizations for model-transformation compositions.",

Our experience with such a course has been that the success of a such a team project depends, on one hand, on the technical competency of the students, the quality of the tools they use, and the project-management decisions they make during the project lifecycle, and, on the other, the specific and timely feedback of the instructor is invaluable.

The word \u201cwiki\u201d is in fact from the Hawaiian word for \u201cfast.\u201d The most well\u2010known wiki is arguably Wikipedia, but wikis are also widely used in educational and corporate settings (Majchrzak et al. 2006; Giordano 2007; Arazy et al. forthcoming). In these environments, the generally anonymous nature of wikis can be at odds with the requirement for receiving recognition for work, whether in the form of grades (in the context of education) or expert status (in the context of communities of practice).We have therefore been developing and testing a system for automatically determining and presenting the relative contribution of wiki authors (Arazy et al. working paper). A later phase has provided a statistical comparison of a set of manual ratings vs. these automated scores, which shows a good correlation with some interesting complexities. While wikis typically produce born\u2010digital text, rather than being implicated in the transition from the analog to the digital, they also provide an environment where new affordances for sense\u2010making can be made available to the author and reader, since the digital text as well as the logging records relating to the collaborative process itself become amenable to analysis and feedback in the form of interactive visualization.",

Because service processes involve co-generating value with consumers, our model intermeshes what the consumer does with what the business does.

Needed management activity includes (a) planning strategy,(b) designing the process,(c) managing human resources, technology, and customer perceptions, and (d) measuring service and business performance in each stage of the service cycle. We provide recommendations for each of these levels of management activity, including (i) selecting the value offer,(ii) planning the process to integrate software, information systems, and human resources,(iii) management policy to assist in managing the service system on a day-to-day basis, and (iv) measurement and information systems that inform the management process. The proposed framework for eService is necessarily interdisciplinary, involving marketing (strategic positioning), finance (investment decisions), operations (service process planning and management), computing science (software and hardware planning), communications (customer relationship management), human resource management (personnel selection and training), management information systems (performance measurement), and consumer behavioral science (managing consumer expectations).",

In this thesis, we develop a platform for multimedia streaming on mobile devices, enhanced with textual and touch-display interactions for a rich user experience. Users (Senders) can use our Kaleidoscope mobile application to set up a streaming channel on the platform server, and invite their contacts (Receivers) to share their real-time video recordings. At the Sender site, the Kaleidoscope app captures the video and shares it with the streaming server. The streaming server saves the multimedia streams into files. At the Receiver site, the Kaleidoscope app replays the video. At both sites, users can send text messages to the connected peers and touch the display to point out interesting video scenes; the Kaleidoscope app shares these interactions with all the peers. The data (audio/video, text, touch events) is stored on the cloud server with timestamps to support feature extraction and analytic services on the cloud. We evaluated the Kaleidoscope system on the SAVI cloud at multiple locations, testing the CPU and memory usage of Kaleidoscope streaming server with different numbers of clients, in different locations. ii",

Due to their high cost and generally cumbersome placement requirements, RFID readers must be judiciously placed; in this paper, we study the placement of the readers such that the occupants' trajectory ambiguity is reduced. We rely on a heatmap representing the frequency with which individuals visit locations as they move through the indoor space and on models of coverage for the PIR sensors and RFID readers and develop a heuristic for the RFID reader placement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via simulations.",

Our study indicates that: 1) about 70% of structural changes may be due to refactorings; 2) for about 60% of these changes, the references to the affected entities in a component-based application can be automatically updated by a refactoring-migration tool if the relevant information of refactored components can be gathered through the refactoring engine; and 3) state-of-the-art IDEs, such as Eclipse, support only a subset of commonly \u2026",

In that article, we offered a conceptual framework for managing hybrid service (combining employee delivery, automated delivery, and self-service) and described seven management challenges arising from that framework. Professor Ng does not take issue with our conceptual framework or with the seven challenges that we identify, but instead suggests that our treatment of the topic could be deeper in two primary ways (which we list in reverse order). Firstly, a systems approach should be used to proactively achieve interdepartmental and interdisciplinary coordination. Secondly, one should understand the sources of value created in a system and distinguish between co-production of value in a larger community and value co-creation (which occurs for all services) from a dyad consisting of a firm\u2019s service system and a single consumer. In a nutshell, Ng argues that combining human and automated services requires both a systems perspective and a value perspective. We completely agree. Indeed, we see Ng\u2019s various suggestions regarding our seven challenges as revolving around her call for a coherent systems approach to hybrid service delivery. For example, Ng\u2019s second point above (the need for a value perspective) can be seen to flow from the first point (the need for a systems perspective). That is, understanding the sources of value (ie, a value perspective) is essential to setting \u2026",

In this research, we focus on a method of simulation-based procedural skills training that uses virtual worlds. This method, implemented in our MeRiTS software system, models procedures using executable workflows, which are enacted by the trainee in a virtual world. The workflows may be defined by educators, or demonstrated by experts and then extracted from system logs. To demonstrate the utility of the system, we have created a scenario for training EMTs in patient rescue and transition procedures. We have pilot tested this scenario with students at a polytechnical institute, and will be conducting more rigorous testing with a range of students and institutions in the near future.",

Typically, this is done through code analysis, which can be very difficult and/or expensive. When code analysis is not a must, as for wrapping purposes, system-user interaction can be an alternative input for the reverse engineering process. In the CelLEST project, we have developed a prototype, called LeNDI (Legacy Navigation Domain Identifier), to test this idea. LeNDI records traces of the legacy screen snapshots and user actions, while the user interacts with the legacy system. Then, it extracts a set of features for every snapshot and employs artificial intelligence methods to build a model of the legacy UI, called the state-transition graph. LeNDI uses two clustering methods to group similar snapshots together as one system screen modeled by one node on the graph. LeNDI uses the user \u2026",

As the economy moves away from traditional goods and towards delivering services, the need for an accurate economic model for evaluating software-development decisions of service-delivering businesses is paramount. More specifically, the research problem is to develop an economic model for the development, maintenance, and evolution of software systems in support of B2C services. In this paper, we describe our work on an initial economics-modeling framework for applications, following the service-oriented architecture style. We present methods for calculating both the cost of developing a new service and the value generated by introducing the service to the market. The conjunction of these two concepts enables the estimation of a business\u2019s ROI when new software development is required to deliver a new service.

Our analyses found that: (1) technology-readiness level for smart homes and home health monitoring technologies is low; (2) the highest level of evidence is 1b (i.e., one randomized controlled trial with a PEDro score \u22656); smart homes and home health monitoring technologies are used to monitor activities of daily living, cognitive decline and mental health, and heart \u2026",

For some women the transition is without major problems; others struggle with various psychological and physical symptoms. Regular walking exercise can be an easy way to maintain physical and mental health. Previous focus groups revealed that women enjoy and want the social aspect of walking groups.Objectives: The goal of this study is to test use and effectiveness of a walking app platform specific for menopausal women that allows them to connect with each other to schedule walks in Edmonton, and track the effect of walking on their symptom changes.Methods: Women will be recruited from the Edmonton Menopause clinics and by word of mouth. Interested and consented women receive login information to use the app to schedule and sign-up for walks. Women will complete menopause-specific QOL and symptom \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Software developers and project managers often have to assess the quality of software design. A commonly adopted hypothesis is that a good design should cost less to maintain than a poor design. We propose a model for quantifying the quality of a design from a maintainability perspective. Based on this model, we propose a novel strategy for predicting the \"return on investment\" (ROI) for possible design restructurings using procedure level dependency analysis. We demonstrate this approach with two exploratory Java case studies. Our results show that common low level source code transformations change the system dependency structure in a beneficial way, allowing recovery of the initial refactoring investment over a number of maintenance activities.",

In this article, we describe a new BA approach that relies on two key intuitions. Similar to traditional BA methods, our method constructs the expertise profile of project developers, based on the textual elements of the bugs they have fixed in the past; unlike traditional methods, however, our method considers only the programming keywords in these bug descriptions, relying on Stack Overflow as the vocabulary for these keywords. The second key intuition of our method is that recent expertise is more relevant than past expertise, which is why our method weighs the relevance of a developer's expertise based on how recently they have fixed a bug with keywords similar to the bug at hand.

The work is usually asynchronous, i.e., not orchestrated by an explicit workflow, some times geographically distributed, and involves the use of a variety of tools which do not always interoperate. Version-control repositories are essential in supporting this collaboration but cannot satisfactorily address the problem of traceability of interdependencies among the artifacts produced by the individual tools. In this demo, we present a new collaboration tool, WikiDev 2.0, that proposes to address these problems by adopting a wiki as the central platform in which to integrate information about the various artifacts of interest and to present views on this information that cut across the individual tool boundaries. We believe that WikiDev 2.0 will advance the degree of \u2026",

Mining the information stored in them has been shown to provide interesting insights into the history of the software development and evolution. Several different types of information have been extracted and analyzed from different points of view. However, these types of information have not been sufficiently cross-examined to understand how they might complement each other. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of four aspects of the software repository of an open source project - source-code metrics, identifiers, return-on-investment estimates, and design differencing - to collect evidence about refactorings that may have happened during the project development. In the context of this case study, we comparatively examine how informative each piece of information is towards understanding the refactoring \u2026",

A critical step in the process of developing applications based on web services is service discovery, i.e. the identification of existing web services that can potentially be used in the context of a new web application. Discovery through catalog-style browsing (such as supported currently by web-service registries) is clearly insufficient. To support programmatic service discovery, we have developed a suite of methods that assess the similarity between two WSDL (Web Service Description Language) specifications based on the structure of their data types and operations and the semantics of their natural language descriptions and identifiers. Given only a textual description of the desired service, a semantic information-retrieval method can be used to identify and order the most relevant WSDL \u2026",

Therefore, understanding the phases that the system's logical design has gone through and the style of their evolution can provide valuable insights in support of consistently maintaining and evolving the system, without compromising the integrity and stability of its architecture. In this paper, we present a method for analyzing the evolution of object-oriented software systems from the point of view of their logical design. This method relies on UMLDiff, a UML-structure differencing algorithm, which, given a sequence of UML class models corresponding to the logical design of a sequence of system code releases, produces a sequence of \"change records\" that describe the design-level changes between subsequent system releases. This change-records sequence is subsequently analyzed from the perspective of each \u2026",
