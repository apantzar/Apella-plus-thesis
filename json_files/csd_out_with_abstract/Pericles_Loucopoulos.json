These challenges inevitably need to be addressed through development schemes that recognize the intertwining of information systems, business strategy and their ecosystems. The paper presents the conceptual modeling foundations of such a scheme providing a detailed exposition of the issues and solutions for sustainable systems in which Capability plays an integrative role using examples from an industrial-size application.

From a methodological perspective a designer using CDD is faced with the challenge of reasoning about phenomena present in the business domain, capturing user requirements and developing an IT solution that reflects these phenomena and meets user expectation. Central to this process is the methodology meta-model, which is intended to define both the key concepts on which the designer has to focus and the process to be followed. The purpose of this paper is to report on an investigation on the utility of a specific meta-model in terms of these two aspects. This investigation was carried out through a use case that involved capability modelling on the same application, by different designers. Each approach was documented using design rationale techniques. The two efforts were then analysed and observations about the capability driven design activities were defined. The output of this work has provided feedback to enhancing the capability meta-model and consequently the capability driven design activities in a number of important ways.",

            "Abstract": "Goal oriented modelling (GOM) is one of the most prominent and widely accepted techniques in information systems research. Since the early 1990\u2019s, a large number of GOM approaches have been proposed aiming to a better alignment between business strategy and the behaviour of supporting systems. Different GOM approaches focus on different activities in the early stages of system development and propose a variety of strategies for reasoning about goals. A number of researchers have stressed the advantages of integrating different GOM techniques, especially in the context of modern global business environments. This is evidenced in the increasing number of publications in this area. However as each GOM language (even versions of the same language) comes with its own syntactic and semantic singularities, such integration requires a number of complicated transformations which is a major obstacle to model and tool interoperability, and prevent wider adoption by practitioners. In order to provide a unified view of GOM, one needs a common understanding of GOM concepts, their semantics and deployment. To this end, this paper proposes a language independent meta-model based on the analysis of eight GOM languages. Generic concepts were identified and a robust semantic definition among these concepts was built in a unified meta-model. We claim that the unified GOM meta-model could help in a) analysing existing goal models in order to provide insights regarding different goal modelling perspectives b) identify semantic similarities / overlaps between existing GOM techniques c) provide the basis for a reference model for \u2026",

Therefore, their collection, expression, structuring and organisation should be central activities within information systems analysis. The work presented in this paper concerns the definition of a repository schema for managing business rules, taking into account the objectives (a) to facilitate the rule collection process, (b) to assist the transition from analysis to design and implementation of the information system, and (c) to support business change once the new system has been delivered. These objectives are achieved through the enhancement of the rule repository schema with information on the logistics of the collection process and references to underlying enterprise informational and behavioural knowledge models.

This deliverable defines an initial set of requirements for CDD. These requirements are provided by the industrial partners through exploration of their use cases. The goal of this deliverable is to identify potential benefits that the CaaS approach could bring to the use cases as well the features to be included the CDD methodology. The requirements are elicited from the use case partners during semi-structured interviews. They are documented in a form of goal models, actor models and concept models for each partner separately. Information documented in these models is used to define envisioned capabilities to be design and delivered during the project as well as to establish the scope of each use case. The use case scope definition focuses on use case goals, causes of capability delivery variability, capability delivery context, functions to be provided in the use case as well as potential capability delivery adjustments. The use case specific models are combined together to obtain a preliminary set of general requirements for CDD. These requirements show CDD goals, types of stakeholders, types of context and types of adjustments. The deliverable ends with concluding remarks about the partners\u2019 expectations for CDD. The requirements for the use cases described in this deliverable will be further elaborated in the final requirements document deliverable D1. 4 and will be iteratively refined during the use case elaboration performed in \u2026",

This paper proposes an approach that drives specification and measurement of quality requirements and in doing so relies on business process models as representations of business processes. The approach is presented in the form of a conceptual model and its application is demonstrated for a simplified version of a business process. However, communication becomes a challenge in crossorganizational business processes where multiple business process modelling languages are being practiced which calls for an abstraction as an integration of concepts of these business process modelling languages. In this paper, a business process integrating meta-model is presented as an abstraction of concepts of seven mainstream business process modelling languages. Attaining such level of understanding and specifying business processes fosters specification and measurement of quality requirements.",

The concept of smart manufacturing is based on the integration of the IoT and CPS to create Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) which results in the continuous generation of high volume data, known as Big Data. One of the key challenges for the implementation of CPPS lies in the conceptualisation and design of such systems, or more precisely in obtaining the engagement of domain experts and key stakeholders and for them to articulate, agree, and validate the requirements for an intended system.

The focus of this paper is on Autonomous Vehicular Safety (AVS) management systems. Such systems exploit vehicular and road side infrastructures to increase the effectiveness of vehicular communications and the relevant services and applications offered in urban environments. AVS management systems combine physical with digital components, each with different capabilities, and involve many different stakeholders, with often competing goals. Sophisticated development of algorithms for simulating the behaviour of the AVS system is required to avoid wasted resources if, after it is implemented, shortcomings with respect to the originally stated goals are found. To achieve this, a capability-oriented modelling approach is introduced and \u2026",

It is the contribution and benefit of ICTs to improve the government services to citizen and business organizations through the efficient intra-government operations. However, the introduction of e-Government services have become challenging nowadays because of the growing number of policies and regulations that needs to be compliant in the e-Government system development. The non-compliance of the regulatory requirements from policy and regulation may cause a significant consequence in the e-Government project development. This paper investigates and analyzes various concepts of e-Government regulatory requirements compliance from published literatures employing Systematic Literature Review (SLR).

Today, there exist new model-driven methods and development tools that support capability-based analysis, design, and implementation. However, there are also a plethora of existing efficient development tools that are currently in use by organizations. In this article, we examine how a new set of capability based tools, the Capability Driven Development (CDD) environment, can be combined with model-driven development tools to leverage both novel capability-based functionality and the proven functionality of existing tools. We base the examination on a case study where an existing model-driven tool is combined with the CDD environment.",

Enterprise modeling (EM) is addressing this demand. It refers to the explicit representation of knowledge according to some structured framework that facilitates different perspectives on an enterprise. An enterprise model integrates models of the organizational action system such as goal models or business process models with models of the corresponding information system such as object models or component models. It does not only contribute to reducing complexity, but also fosters communication and collaboration between various groups of stakeholders. By providing an integrated representation of the business and the information system, an enterprise model can serve as a laboratory for elaborate \u2026",

From a methodological perspective a designer using CDD is faced with the challenge of reasoning about phenomena present in the business domain, capturing user requirements and developing an IT solution that reflects these phenomena and meets user expectation. Central to this process is the methodology meta-model, which is intended to define both the key concepts on which the designer has to focus and the process to be followed. The purpose of this paper is to report on an investigation on the utility of a specific meta-model in terms of these two aspects. This investigation was carried out through a use case that involved capability modelling on the same application, by different designers. Each approach was documented using design rationale techniques. The two efforts were then analysed and observations about the capability driven design activities were defined. The output of this work has provided feedback to enhancing the capability meta-model and consequently the capability driven design activities in a number of important ways.",

In this paper, our goal is twofold. First, we present a business process meta-model containing all possible constructs of a business process. Second, after discussing a set of quality factors suitable for business processes constructs, we present a quality oriented meta-model resulting from the enrichment of the business process meta-model with quality related information.",

This has led to new exigencies and to demands for software engineering paradigms that pay particular atttention to meeting them. We advocate that such demands can be met, at least in large parts, through the adoption of software engineering processes that are founded on a reflective stance. To this end, we turn our attention to the field of Design Rationale. We analyze and characterize Design Rationale approaches and show that despite surface differences between different approaches, they all tend to be variants of a relatively small set of static and dynamic affinities. We use the synthesis of static and dynamic affinities to develop a generic model for reflective design. The model is nonprescriptive and affects  minimally the design process. It is context-independent and is intended to be used as a facilitator in participative design, supporting \u2026",

During co-development stakeholders need an early understanding of the potential impact of different requirement choices on the enterprise. An early impact analysis understanding is more likely to actively engage stakeholders, highlight strategic options and deliver useful and sustainable systems. However, when multiple stakeholders are involved with differing backgrounds, experiences and frequently competing goals it is inevitable that conflicts occur during the early phases when requirements tend to be opaque. This paper puts forward a conceptual framework for co-development to support collaborative reasoning and decision-making through the modelling of requirements alternatives and arguments, promoting critical reflection, negotiation and discussion.",

At the same time, organisation of large-scale events impose even more challenges and difficulties in the provision of such services. In this context, the paper discusses on the basic challenges that cities face especially in cases of large scale events, and proposes a capability \u2013 driven enterprise modelling approach towards enabling Smart Objects for Smart City Operations (SCO). It presents specific examples of deploying this approach in smart traffic management and smart spectators\u2019 management in large scale events.

This duality of scope often referred to as co-development, provides the basis for aligning technical systems to business processes and business goals and has a profound effect on the effectiveness of the delivered system. Through conceptual modeling, analysis and evaluation, Requirements Engineering offers opportunities to facilitate codevelopment activities. In this paper we focus on evaluating the quality of business processes through their conceptual models, at the requirements phase. We adopt an intentional approach to defining quality requirements and we focus on the way that these requirements impact on business processes. We present an approach for defining, elaborating and evaluating quality factors that can be measured and reflected upon against stated business goals.",

The validation addresses four areas. Firstly, the use case goals (defined in D3. 2) are revised and their fulfilment is examined. Secondly, questionnaires have been used to examine the CDD methods usefulness, ease of use, ease of transfer and the user\u2019s intention to use the method. Similarly, questionnaires has been used to evaluate the CDD environment in the form the of CDT, CPP and CNA tools. Thirdly, a use case checklist has been produced that describe the current state of the implementation. Fourth, experiences and points for improvements have been documented based on the work within the use case. The validation has shown that the CDD methodology and tools have been successfully used in the use case. The use case goals have been met, either by means of the implementation done with the CDD environment, or indirectly by the use of the CDD methodology. Even though the CDD methodology and environment used in the case was not the final ones, the questionnaires show that the CDD methodology and environment have been used and are deemed of high usefulness in the case. Points for future improvement have been documented for both the method and tools. To some extent the special needs of method components have been covered by method extensions already suggested by the WP3 participants. The use case checklist shows that support for the three identified capabilities has been implemented with the use of the CDD environment components, namely, CDT \u2026",

In this context, the objective of this work is twofold: (a) to demonstrate how to check the feasibility of the design solutions and (b) to provide a framework for guiding the consistency restoration process by providing conflict resolution schemes. To achieve this objective, a new approach the Goal-based Scenario Analysis (GBSA) approach has been developed. GBSA investigates all kinds of goal-originated inconsistencies and errors and their impact to the ways that goals are operationalised, leading to alternative scenarios.",

Experience has shown that a practical solution for the above problem is very hard to achieve unless we address the root cause for business change which in turn impacts on the need to change the support IS. One such cause is traced to business rules. 2 We subscribe to the view that business rule changes bring the highest impact on both software and business processes compared to other changes such as altering code for elegance or speeding execution. 3, 4 This viewpoint raises the need to explicitly consider business rules in software modeling for assisting future evolution. 5 To date many business rule approaches have emerged that attempt to address the \u2026",

The intertwining of business and information systems imposes considerable stresses on requirements engineers to consider quality factors that need to be present in both business processes and the software that supports these processes. We argue that the quality of BPs has to be taken into account at the requirement engineering stage, where quality requirements are to be defined, along with the corresponding quality factors and the metrics that will be used to evaluate them. We consider that a BP is represented by a model and that quality requirements are to be examined within the BP model.

Experienced developers reuse their own ideas by recognising problems that are similar to other problems that they have solved before. They then apply the best solution they had used previously. Patterns crop up from reusing a recurring problem/solution. In the late 1980\u2019s, patterns were introduced as a concept in computer science and they provided a way to save (preserve) and transmit knowledge and experience. This paper describes a prototype tool (RIBAP) that supports working with business analysis patterns when developing or maintaining a system.

A key challenge in the development of systems is the engagement of domain experts in their articulation, agreement, and validation of requirements. This challenge is particularly pronounced at the so-called early requirements phase when multiple stakeholders from different divisions and often different organisations need to reach agreement about the intended systems. Decisions taken at this stage have a profound effect on the technical and economic feasibility of the project. It is no longer appropriate for information systems professionals to focus only on functional and non-functional aspects of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A key requirement to today's fast changing economic environment is the ability of organizations to adapt dynamically in an effective and efficient manner. Information and Communication Technologies play a crucially important role in addressing such adaptation requirements. The notion of `intelligent software' has emerged as a means by which enterprises can respond to changes in a reactive manner but also to explore, in a pro-active manner, possibilities for new business models. The development of such software systems demands analysis, design and implementation paradigms that recognize the need for `co-development' of these systems with enterprise goals, processes and capabilities. The work presented in this paper is motivated by this need and to this end it proposes a paradigm that recognizes co-development as a knowledge-based activity. The proposed solution is based on a multi-perspective \u2026",

Those that advocate a prescriptive stance and those that reject a methodical approach by adopting a descriptive stance. Of course no 'silver bullet' has been found in the way of working within the discipline of requirements engineering. We argue that each of the two paradigms can make a significant contribution towards improving the requirements engineering process and we show how the two models can successfully co-exist in practical situations. This co-existence facilitates, within a single framework, the search for strategy and deliberation, two aspects of requirements engineering that we regard as being of critical importance for successful systems development.",

In the context of the European research project ELEKTRA we developed a pattern approach for capturing best business practices of change management in the electricity sector. In this paper we briefly present this approach and concentrate on the issue of validating the pattern approach through evaluation of its different features. In particular, we define three constituent features, namely the knowledge contained in patterns, the language used to construct patterns and the method for developing the patterns. For each of these features we define an evaluation hypothesis and then test this hypothesis against a set of criteria and metrics. The experiments conducted and the results are presented in summary.",

In most cases these patterns are represented in a \u2018flat\u2019 fashion making their use difficult especially when there is a large number of patterns to consider in a particular application. In this paper we propose an analysis pattern retrieval (APR) approach under a classification schema in order to enable the automatic re-use of analysis patterns. The proposed classification scheme associates a problem to a set of pre-defined terms whereas the retrieval approach based on a Boolean model provides the necessary support to help a designer to locate and select analysis patterns that better solve the conceptual problem that he has in hands. An APR approach under a classification schema has the potential to make large analysis patterns collections easier to use and understand.",

The work presented here provides a general and flexible business model specification environment, the BMSA (Business Modelling System Architect) framework, which can be used in conjunction with various methods that deal with enterprise requirements analysis in a pluralistic and integrated fashion. The BMSA approach is founded on three basic premises-(a) organisational modelling and work design,(b) modelling the business process and (c) automated tool support. These issues are bound together by a set of design principles. The BMSA conceptual foundation is based on the UML notation. This allows interfacing with other development methods and tools. The supporting tool comprises of the following systems-the Repository System, the User Interface System and the Picture View System. At the heart of the tool is the Repository. The proposed framework is flexible in terms of standardisation, independence, reuse and future expandability of models.",

Such approaches generally assume enterprises as deterministic, top-down managed entities, with a well-defined group of processes that develop and maintain products or services for their customers. However, the prevalence and volatility of digital enterprises shifts enterprise modeling towards a more dynamic enterprise configuration, to embrace the idea of dynamic adaptation according to the internal and external influences that constantly (re-)shape the business environment.

            "Abstract": "Conflict identification and resolution is a key phase of requirements engineering. It is crucial to identify conflicts at early stages of the requirements engineering which in turns helps in establishing a cohesive set of requirements to guide the overall requirements engineering process. Conflicts especially arise due to the self reinforcing or contradictory nature of some NFRs (eg efficiency and usability). This paper describes how quality ontologies can be used to support the identification of NFR conflicts and facilitate discussion towards requirements prioritization tasks in requirements engineering. Our approach is based on using the ISO/IEC 9126 quality ontology to underpin the NFR description and reasoning mechanisms to pinpoint potential NFR conflicts that need to be further discussed by stakeholders. The work is implemented in the ElicitO requirements elicitation tool. We also report results of applying the approach and the tool to identify conflicts in requirements elicitation activities at the student intranet project of the University of Manchester (Manchester Unity Web Project).",

In this paper we present a Requirements Engineering framework that is motivated by the System Dynamics paradigm. The framework consists of four key activities: ontology modelling, goal modelling, process modelling and scenarios generation. It is our premise that the synergy between these four activities results in a robust way of working that provides requirements stakeholders with a systematic approach to articulating, defining, debating, and agreeing on the set of desirable functional and non-functional properties of the intended system. The approach is demonstrated with examples from a very large application and claims substantiated from experiences from this project.",

The Object Management Group (OMG) adopted many business standards into the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) environment e.g. Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), the Business Motivation Model (BMM), Business Process Modelling and Notation (BPMN) and Organisational Structure Model (OSM). These can work together to model different aspects of the enterprise at the business level. However, these models lack reasoning and dynamic simulation: there is no significant way to simulate discrete and continuous time system behaviour or to build arguments for reasoning about the design options within the OMG specifications. In this paper we propose an approach to overcoming this problem, by integrating a set of modelling tools into one single platform, taking advantage of meta-modelling techniques to integrate new tools with the OMG specifications in a model driven environment. The prospective framework should be able to tackle advanced analysis and design problems by intertwining design, reasoning and simulation to achieve a higher level of design maturity through implementing the desired scenario.",

            "Abstract": "Since its inception in 1968, software engineering has undergone numerous changes. In the early years, software development was organized using the waterfall model, where the focus of requirements engineering was on a frozen requirements document, which formed the basis of the subsequent design and implementation process. Since then, a lot has changed: software has to be developed faster, in larger and distributed teams, for pervasive as well as large-scale applications, with more flexibility, and with ongoing maintenance and quick release cycles. What do these ongoing developments and changes imply for the future of requirements engineering and software design? Now is the time to rethink the role of requirements and design for software intensive systems in transportation, life sciences, banking, e-government and other areas. Past assumptions need to be questioned, research and education need to be rethought. This book is based on the Design Requirements Workshop, held June 3-6, 2007, in Cleveland, OH, USA, where leading researchers met to assess the current state of affairs and define new directions. The papers included were carefully reviewed and selected to give an overview of the current state of the art as well as an outlook on probable future challenges and priorities. After a general introduction to the workshop and the related NSF-funded project, the contributions are organized in topical sections on fundamental concepts of design; evolution and the fluidity of design; quality and value-based requirements; requirements intertwining; and adapting requirements practices in different domains.",
