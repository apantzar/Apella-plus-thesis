Moreover, such effort is a common task performed by humans who collaborate for long periods of time participating in frequent meetings in order to achieve agreement. New educational approaches are heading to adaptive, flexible, ubiquitous, asynchronous, collaborative, hyper-mediated, and personalized strategies based on modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

This work provides a model that can be used to discover awareness information lying underneath multi-user interaction. This information is initially captured in log files and then is represented in a specific form in events-databases. By using data mining techniques, it is possible to infer both the users\u2019 behavioral profiles and the relationships that occur in a CSCL environment. In this work we combine different data mining strategies and a neural-based approach in order to construct a multi-layer model that provides a mechanism for inferring different types of awareness \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Natural Language (NL) is the main communication media for humans, who have a deep need for communicating based on evolutionary mechanisms. This inner-need implied the development of languages. Proto-humans had to name objects around, feelings, memories, expectations, and etcetera. The growing of conscience in human\u2019s brain along the time, led to the construction of complex models of concepts stored among the neurons of the brain. Some layers of the brain were devoted to handle the relations between an inner net of concepts with the areas concerning the treatment of language. The NL spoken by humans has a complex construction, based on the diversity of meaning for words and expressions according to the context. Besides, there are different cases of languages. Our work is aimed at presenting a multi-agent approach for dealing with the problem of discovering the intention in expressions written in Spanish and inside Web forums. We are also looking for the identification of some relations among participants in the Web forum. Although the conversations in these forums are usually built in some point between formal and informal communications, and would not follow grammatical rules in every case, we have made arrangements to deal with many of the situations present in Web forums and provide an adaptive response for most of the cases.",

The aim of this thesis is to introduce an alternative to the traditional approaches to academic integrity, bridging the anonymity gap and empowering instructors and academic administrators with new ways of maintaining academic integrity that preserve privacy, minimize disruption to the learning process, and promote accountability, accessibility and efficiency. This work aims to initiate a paradigm shift in academic integrity practices. Research in the area of learner identity and authorship assurance is important because the award of course credits to unverified entities is detrimental to institutional credibility and public safety. This thesis builds upon the notion of learner identity consisting of two distinct layers (a physical layer and a behavioural layer), where the criteria of identity and authorship must both be confirmed to maintain a reasonable level of academic integrity. To pursue this goal in organized fashion, this thesis has the following three sections: (a) theoretical, (b) empirical, and (c) pragmatic.",

Our approach is based on ontology, Social Network Analysis (SNA) and fuzzy classification, which has been initially developed as a mechanism to analyse and understand behavioural patterns from collaboration performed in different scenarios. Through the SNA we are able to define an ontological profile that provides a deep knowledge about the participants' roles, intentions and effects; hence a fuzzy model can perform inferences over individual indicators.",

The architecture of the proposed software consists of two main parts: a) an information space where students are provided with opportunities to access appropriate information about OS and b) an experimentation space that allows students to take control of their learning by forming their own set of tasks, assigning them priorities and durations. This architecture could be used for the learning of diverse scheduling algorithms. Finally, the system provides learners \u2026",

The  possibility to enhance learning group\u00e2\u00bf\u00bfs participation by means of providing  appropriate knowledge is rapidly gaining popularity due to its great impact on  group performance and outcomes. Indeed, by storing parameters of interaction  such as participation behaviour and giving constant awareness and feedback of  these parameters to the group may influence group\u00e2\u00bf\u00bfs motivation and emotional  state as well as  enhance the learners\u00e2\u00bf\u00bf and groups\u00e2\u00bf\u00bf problem solving abilities. This  implies a need to capture and structure the information generated by group activity  and then to extract the relevant knowledge in order to provide learners and tutors  with efficient awareness and feedback as regards group performance and  collaboration. To that end, we first identify and define the main types of  information generated in on-line group activity and then we propose a process for  efficiently embedding this information and the knowledge extracted into  collaborative learning applications. However, in order to provide learners with  effective knowledge, it is necessary to process large and complex event log files  from group activity in a constant manner, and thus it may require computational  capacity beyond that of a single computer. To that end, in this chapter we show  how a Grid approach can considerably decrease the time of processing group  activity log files and thus allow group learners to receive selected knowledge \u2026",

Recent advancements in large-scale displays allowed contemporary technology-enhanced museums to get equipped with digital domes, some with real-time capabilities like Virtual Reality systems. By conducting extensive literature review we have come to the conclusion that little to no research has been carried out on the leaning outcomes that the combination of VR and audience interaction can provide in the immersive environments of dome theaters. Thus, we propose that audience collaboration in immersive virtual reality environments presents a promising approach to support effective learning in groups of school aged children.",

Capturing students' feelings and emotional states enclosed in such textual information is important, since sentiments can influence individual behavior and consequently group dynamics as well as individual and group performance. For this reason, emotion awareness becomes an important issue for both tutors and students themselves. Especially for tutors, if they have as accurate affective information as possible about the emotional state that every individual and group is encountered, they might be able to provide more effective feedback to the students that includes not only cognitive but also affective scaffold. A first important step to this endeavor is to develop an approach that enables labeling affective \u2026",

Assessment processes have a significant effect on collaborative learning because they engage learners through accountability and constructive feedback.

The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of group interaction and determine how to best support the collaborative learning process. We propose a generic framework for the study and analysis of group interaction and group scaffolding, which is built by combining different aspects and issues of collaboration, learning and evaluation. In particular, we define learning activity indicators at several levels of description, which prompt to the application of a mixed interaction analysis scheme and the use of different data types and specific tools. At an initial layer, the basis of the approach is set by applying a qualitative process for evaluating the individual and group task performance as well as the group functioning and scaffolding. The interaction analysis process is completed by defining and applying two more layers: a social network analysis of the group activity and participation behavior and a quantitative analysis of group effectiveness as regards task achievement and active interaction involvement. Our work defines a grounded and holistic conceptual model that describes on-line collaborative learning interactions sufficiently and applies it in a real, web-based, complex and long-term collaborative learning situation. An in-depth empirical evaluation of the conceptual model is fully discussed, which demonstrates the usefulness and value of the approach.",

In particular, we focus on analyzing the suitability of adopting CRM processes by universities and higher educational institutions dedicated to e-learning. This is an issue that has much potential but has received little attention in research so far.

As an emerging paradigm for distributed computing, P2P systems are raising important issues as many novel aspects have to be dealt with in such systems. One key issue in P2P distributed computing is the efficient discovery and selection of peers, which is needed for many purposes such as efficient allocation of jobs to peers, load balancing, efficient file transfer, etc. Existing P2P distributed applications use ad hoc ways to discover and select peers, usually without any performance guarantee. In this paper we address the problem of the efficient peer selection in P2P distributed platforms.

Such monitoring can provide valuable information to online instructors, who may guide and support the development of efficient collaborative learning projects. We have developed and tested an information system, Student Activity Monitoring using Overview Spreadsheets (SAMOS), which facilitates the automatic generation of weekly monitoring reports derived from data contained in server log files. These reports provide online instructors with visual information regarding students' and groups' activity, thus allowing for a quick and easy classification of students and groups according to their activity level. That way, entities with a low activity level are easily identified, which allows the establishment of just-in-time assistance for them. Furthermore, instructors can use complementary qualitative monitoring \u2026",

The merge of these technologies represents an attractive, but probably quite laborious enterprise if we consider not only the benefits but also the barriers that we have to overcome. This work presents an attempt toward this direction by developing a generic platform of CSCL components and discussing the advantages that we could obtain if we adapted it to the Grid. We then propose a means that could make this adjustment possible due to the high degree of genericity that our library component is endowed with by being based on the generic programming paradigm. Finally, an application of our library is proposed both for validating the adequacy of the platform which it is based on and for indicating the possibilities gained by using it under the Grid.",

On the other hand, the approaches that are currently used to implement an e-learning framework developed with learning services based on the Grid are limited in semantic expressiveness for matching services and only support keyword based search.

The essential issue here is how to design a platform that can be used for real, long-term, complex collaborative problem-solving situations and which enables the instructor to both analyze group interaction effectively and provide an adequate support when needed. The achievement of this task first involves the design of a conceptual model that structures and classifies the information generated in a collaborative learning application at several levels of description. This conceptual model is then translated into a computational model that not only allows the efficient management of the knowledge produced by the individual and group activity but also the possibility of exploiting this knowledge further as a meta-cognitive tool for real-time coaching and regulating the collaborative learning process. The computational model becomes the central issue in this contribution while the conceptual model is briefly introduced.",

To that end, we focus on online learning groups that are engaged in a problem solving situation which ends up with successful group learning outcomes; the final product they deliver as a group is judged satisfactory. But can we safely admit that such a group was really effective? In other words, can we claim that each individual member achieved the learning objectives set or obtained the same benefit as the others? Or, did the group manage a well-balanced participation and contribution of all its members? This work presents an integrated approach that focuses on analysing the participatory attitudes of group members in collaborative learning activities (group functioning) and their contributions to the problem solving (task performance). This allows us to assess the real effectiveness of online collaborative learning teams by examining and measuring the skills that should characterise an effective collaborative learning team. In particular, we explore the interaction behaviour of different collaborative groups that apparently proved to be effective as regards their performance at problem solving level. The ultimate aim of our work is to provide both a better understanding of group interaction and the means to improve the effectiveness of online learning groups as well as to enhance individual member learning and success.",

One important issue to consider is the types and levels of interaction and knowledge, which is manifested, in a collaborative learning situation. Their approach aims at identifying the various types of interaction produced and examining how an interaction type is related to the learning that results from it.

The search included five main academic databases (ERIC, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Scopus) using predefined selection criteria. In total, 321 different articles were screened, from which 43 articles met the predefined inclusion criteria. The results indicate a correlation between pedagogical practices of Waldorf schools and MI theory compatible teaching practices and between Waldorf schools and neuroeducation. Further empirical research examining different facets of this relationship is still needed to establish live and effective schools as Learning Organizations. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "In previous research we proposed a virtualization process of live collaborative sessions from Web discussion forums and chats with the aim to produce interactive and attractive online learning resources to be played by learners, thus having a positive effect in learner engagement. In order to enhance further learning engagement, in this paper we endow our virtualization process with a multifold assessment framework that provides effective awareness and constructive feedback to learners from the original collaborative interactions amongst group members. The research here presented focuses on e-assessment of collaborative and social learning and extends it with Learning Analytics and Social Network Analysis techniques that are able to analyze and represent cognitive and social interactions underlying live collaborative sessions. The interaction data extracted from collaborative knowledge and social networking is integrated into the virtualized collaborative learning to produce an efficient and personalized awareness and feedback system about the collaborative activity and the social behaviour of the original participants of live collaboration. This paper describes both the conceptual and methodological research to build our multi-fold e-assessment framework. The research is evaluated in real context of e-learning and validated by empirical data and interpretation.scientific gatherings. This 'work-in-progress' spirit is reflected as well in this volume: the call was launched in late 2014 and 10 articles were eventually accepted and published, including reviews -a look behind-, one methods paper, and six original contributions -a look ahead \u2026",

Consequently, we have to take advantage of the interaction data generated in CSCL activities to extract important information related to the emotions manifested by group members and build emotional intelligence that supports awareness and regulation of emotions at both individual and group level. This raises important issues that concern, on the one hand, the ways to label affective behavior in educational discourse and, on the other hand, the ways to present emotional information to group participants.

New media literacy skills (NML) and social-emotional skills are also targeted, as they are strongly connected with CT skills and display bidirectional linkages that can comprehensively benefit students in various ways (cognitively, imaginatively/creatively, materially, socially, and affectively/emotionally) without the need for digital technologies or coding.

In particular, collaborative learning approaches cannot be readily applied to every e-learning experience, since they require a degree of presence and/or collaboration which may be difficult to achieve. In addition, collaborative learning systems often lack the challenging resources and tools required to fully support collaborations, making the experience unattractive to end-users and discouraging progression. Whilst the learner might expect to control the collaborative experience, often it is the collaborative experience that controls and limits the learner. As a result, collaborative learning resources can lack authentic interactivity, user empowerment and balanced levels of challenge, thus having a negative effect in learner motivation and engagement.

The high performance and reliability of multiprocessors have made them a powerful computing resource. Such computing environment requires an efficient algorithm to determine when and on which processor a given task should execute. This paper investigates dynamic scheduling of real-time tasks in a multiprocessor system to obtain a feasible solution using genetic algorithms combined with well-known heuristics, such as 'Earliest Deadline First' and 'Shortest Computation Time First'. A comparative study of the results obtained from simulations shows that genetic algorithm can be used to schedule tasks to meet deadlines, in turn to obtain high processor utilization.",

            "Abstract": "Many researchers argue that students must be meaningfully engaged in the learning resources for effective learning to occur. However, current online learners still report a problematic lack of attractive and challenging learning resources that engage them in the learning process. This endemic problem is even more evident in online collaborative learning approaches whose resources lack of authentic interactivity, user empowerment, social identity and challenge, thus having a negative effect on learners' self\u2010motivation and engagement. To overcome these and other limitations and deficiencies, in this paper, a new type of learning resource named Collaborative Complex Learning Resources (CC\u2013LR) is presented based on the virtualization of collaborative learning with the aim of leveraging knowledge elicited during live sessions. During the CC\u2013LR execution, the collaborative sessions are animated so learners \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Learners interacting in a Web-based distance learning environment produce a variety of information elements during their participation; these information elements usually have a complex structure and semantics, which makes it rather difficult to find out the behavioral attitudes and profiles of the users involved. User modelling in on-line distance learning is an important research field focusing on two important aspects: describing and predicting students\u2019 actions and intentions as well as adapting the learning process to students\u2019 features, habits, interests, preferences, and so on. This work provides an approach that can be used to greatly stimulate and improve the learning experience by tracking the students\u2019 intentions and helping them reconduct their actions that could evolve accordingly as the learning process moves forward. In this context, user modelling implies a constant processing and analysis of user interaction data during long-term learning activities, which produces large and considerably complex information. In this paper we show how a Grid approach can considerably decrease the time of processing log data. Our prototype is based on the master-worker paradigm and is implemented using a peer-to-peer platform called Juxtacat running on the Planetlab nodes. The results of our study show the feasibility of using Grid middleware to speed and scale up the processing of log data and thus achieve an efficient and dynamic user modelling in on-line distance learning.",

These approaches are observational and often external to the learning spaces where the majority of the instructional content resides. Authentic assessments such as discussions, projects and portfolios may not always undergo the same scrutiny as high-stakes examinations and therefore differ in the level of identity and authorship assurance they provide. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to enhancing academic integrity of e-assessments. The approach is based on behavioral biometrics and aided by machine-learning techniques. It provides continuous identity and authorship assurance throughout the learning activities within the existing learning space. It can be applied to measure the degree of learner \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Globalization of technology and employment are two essential factors in today\u2019s network society; therefore, the use of a lingua franca is necessary. English has been playing this role for decades and is considered a powerful means of communication [1]. Particularly in Greece, English has long been an essential part of education and research has revealed many reasons why Greek students are motivated to learn it [2]. However, Greece has faced a harsh financial crisis recently and up to date is unable to overcome its problems. A large number of students, researchers and workforce have moved abroad in order to find better opportunities. Consequently, it is likely that the motivation of current Greek students to learn English has increased over the last decade due to their desire to study and work abroad. Moreover, the technological advances in education have played another important role in today\u2019s English classrooms that may influence students\u2019 motives. This study aims to unravel the young learners\u2019 attitude to learn English in Greece in an era of financial crisis. For the data gathering procedure, a questionnaire is created that explores students\u2019 motivation. The participants are fifty one students in Greek secondary schools or universities aged between 12 and 24 years old, who study English as a foreign language (EFL). The main results reflect that the economic crisis has little influence on students\u2019 motives to learn English since students claim that\u2013regardless of the economic situation-English has always played a dominant role for their future prospective.",

            "Abstract": "Collaborative applications usually register user interaction in the form of semi-structured plain text event log data. Extracting and structuring this data is a prerequisite for later key processes such as the analysis of interactions, assessment of group activity, or the provision of awareness and feedback. Yet, in real situations of online collaborative activity the processing of log data is usually done offline since structuring event log data is, in general, a computationally costly process and the amount of log data tends to be very large. Techniques to speed and scale up the structuring and processing of log data with minimal impact on the performance of the collaborative application are thus desirable in order to be able to process log data in real time. In this paper we present a parallel Grid-based implementation for processing in real time the event log data generated in collaborative applications. Our results show the feasibility of using grid middleware to speed and scale up the process of structuring and processing semistructured event log data. Our Grid prototype follows the Master-Worker paradigm, is implemented using the Globus Toolkit 3.2 and is tested on the Planetlab platform.",

These Learning frameworks have generated new challenges, since they must develop technologies that allow the location of available resources in distributed scientific networks and give users a common access point, which can be customized for user preferences, profile privileges and access limitations. In that sense, semantic description can be used to perform a discovery of learning services based on a semantic matching process between the learning framework characteristic and user needs to obtain the best fit according to individual parameters. This paper presents an infrastructure for virtual laboratories based on semantic capabilities and a case study of discovery of optoelectronic services based on semantic description using Web Services Modeling Ontology (WSMO) and their respective representation using Web Services Modeling Language (WSML).",

From the theoretical point of view, we propose a design methodology of three layers (initiating, forming and performing) that sets the basis for the elaboration of a conceptual framework for understanding virtual collaborative study and learning, the determination of guidelines for modelling collaborative learning situations, and the development of models of cooperation from different perspectives. In particular, we examine the processes involved in virtual collaborative learning, especially why, when and how collaborative interaction mediates the intelligent construction, management and dissemination of knowledge. Due to the lack of a paradigm, there is no definitive approach yet to the design of sound virtual collaborative learning methodologies. To that end, our approach brings new expectations and requires changes in attitudes and reward structures for both the learners and the teachers, such as new roles, different pedagogic and learning methods, and technological and training supports that enable learners build up social structures, encourage learning and develop critical thinking skills.",

In this paper we present LaCOLLA, a fully decentralized infrastructure for building collaborative applications that provides general purpose collaborative functionalities. The provision of those functionalities will avoid applications deal with most of complexities derived from groups and its members, what will help inclusion of collaborative aspects. The implementation of LaCOLLA follows the peer-to-peer paradigm and pays special attention to autonomy of its members and to self-organization of the components of the infrastructure.

These experiences have lead to the design of WWG: a distributed infrastructure for distance learning in groups on an Internet scale. WWG is based on the distribution of events about the information produced by people. Every participant can be notified and thus be aware of the actions, changes, and progress of the groups he belongs to: synchronous awareness for asynchronous work.

            "Abstract": "Providing collaborative learning applications the possibility to offer continuous awareness to on-line collaborative learning teams is a challenging issue since it is essential to keep participants informed of both what is happening and what happened in the learning group. Moreover, awareness is the basis to enhance collaboration and improve the individual and group performance since it allows to track and assess the collaborative learning process more objectively and to model students' behavior more efficiently. In order to provide students and tutors with effective awareness, we consider the collaborative actions registered in log files. It is necessary to process large and considerably complex event log files in a constant manner, and thus it may requires processing capacity beyond that of a single computer. To that end, in this paper we show how a Grid approach can considerably decrease the time of processing group activity log files and thus allow students and tutors to be aware of what is going on in the group activity even in real time. Our approach is based on the master-worker paradigm and is implemented using Globus technology running on the Planetlab platform. To test our application, we used event log files from the Basic Support for Collaborative Work (BSCW) system.",

To that end, our research approach has been based on the following actions: First, we analysed the goals, needs, expectations and preferences of our students, based on a previous pilot experience on distance collaborative learning, in order to understand what is actually happening in networked learning when collaboration becomes an integrated part of the whole learning process. Second, we proceeded to the design, development and implementation of a new pedagogical practice, called Virtual Study Group, to encourage and enhance learning through collaborative construction of knowledge and reflective interaction which contribute to a deeper understanding of the course contents. The paper focuses mainly on the latter. Finally, we provide a critical analysis and evaluation of the outcomes of this experience and of the many issues arising from applying this collaborative pedagogical practice to a virtual learning environment.",

However, there is hardly any study that has investigated how students\u2019 self-regulation of behavior could be promoted in online environments for programming learning and assessment, despite the proliferation of automated programming evaluation systems. This study examined the ways our online Distributed Systems Laboratory (DSLab) tried to enhance students\u2019 self-regulation of behavior in a real long-term online educational experience. Participants were a sample of 111 university students who performed a programming assignment using DSLab. A customized questionnaire was used to collect data from all students. Our results revealed that DSLab tool managed to enhance students\u2019 self-regulation of behavior to a large extent. Moreover, our study explored the correlation between students \u2026",

Assessment processes have a significant effect on CSCL because they engage learners through accountability and constructive feedback. However, in order to design a coherent and efficient assessment system for collaborative and social learning it is necessary to design an enriched learning experience that predisposes the feedback and awareness in the group. A complex set of simultaneously applied assessment approaches, each reinforcing and/or complementing the other is the main tool to enhance collaborative learning and social interaction amongst group members. In this paper, collaborative learning will be developed into a special environment: a Storyboard Learning Object.

Due to pervasiveness of ICT's, most of collaboration can be performed through communication media channels such as discussion forums, social networks, etc. The emotive state of the users while they carry out their activity such as collaborative learning at Universities or project work at enterprises and organizations influences very much their performance and can actually determine the final learning or project outcome. Therefore, monitoring the users' emotive states and using that information for providing feedback and scaffolding is crucial.

The main results of our research consist in designing a layered framework for modelling online collaborative learning interactions which in turns leads to the development of a computational platform, called Collaborative Learning Purpose Library (CLPL), that can be used as a basis for the development of Collaborative Learning applications that achieve an efficient event (group activity) information management. To that end, we developed a Grid approach in order to increase the efficiency of processing event log files. Finally, we developed a middleware architecture, called LaCOLLA, that follows the peer-to-peer paradigm and can be used to build collaborative applications that provide general purpose collaborative functionalities while it pays special attention to the autonomy of its members and to self-organization of the components of the infrastructure. All these results were reflected in several publications in international journals, refereed conferences, as well as participations to new European projects.",
