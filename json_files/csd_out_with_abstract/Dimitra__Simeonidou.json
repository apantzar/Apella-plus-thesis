            "Abstract": "This paper presents views on the future of optical networking. A historical look at the emergence of optical networking is first taken, followed by a discussion on the drivers pushing for a new and pervasive network, which is based on photonics and can satisfy the needs of a broadening base of residential, business, and scientific users. Regional plans and targets for optical networking are reviewed to understand which current approaches are judged important. Today, two thrusts are driving separate optical network infrastructure models, namely 1) the need by nations to provide a ubiquitous network infrastructure to support all the future services and telecommunication needs of residential and business users and 2) increasing demands by the scientific community for networks to support their requirements with respect to large-scale data transport and processing. This paper discusses these network models together \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Grid technology is currently reaching a level of maturity allowing deployment of large test infrastructures world wide, leveraging huge computing facilities to the academic and scientific community (important examples of such infrastructures include the EGEE [1] and TeraGrid [2] deployments in Europe and the US, respectively). Two important trends can however be discerned in current grid developments: the tendency to deploy dedicated optical network facilities [3](instead of sharing network connectivity with other applications) and the adoption of grid technology beyond the e-science community. Especially the envisaged usage of grid-aware applications by home-users entails developments towards more scalable and hence distributed resource management schemes. Current grid systems are indeed specialized in handling (extremely) large jobs submitted by a relative small number of users. Future applications including multimedia editing [4], online gaming and virtual reality immersion [5] have the potential for an enormous user base. The number of jobs launched will not only increase because of the increase of users but also due to higher degrees of parallelism (resulting in a larger number of smaller jobs) typically encountered in multimedia applications. These new application areas for grids result in novel requirements: scalable job management (centralized and hierarchical approaches currently adopted do scale to the envisaged number of service requests), high connectivity for end users, provisioning of computing facilities for residential users, offering guarantees on service levels (service availability and guarantees on job completion \u2026",

This is achieved through the identification of the optimal train speed profiles employing a novel modeling framework based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Train speed profiles are selected with the objective to transfer more passengers in less time and with less energy under scheduling constraints. Given that DEA is a data oriented, non-parametric method, a large-scale experimental camping has been carried out over an operational tramway system to collect the required inputs/outputs. Numerical results show that when the proposed approach energy consumption can be reduced by 10%.",

However, the nonlinear impairments affect the network performance in terms of system reach distance, spectral efficiency and network utilization. The nonlinear impairments are currently assigned a fixed reference margin based on a worst case estimation which results in sub-optimal spectrum utilization. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel load-aware nonlinearity estimation model which is more accurate compared to the fixed reference margin and is shown to reduce request blocking ratio. We further present a routing, modulation and spectrum assignment (RMSA) solution using the proposed nonlinearity model. The integrated approach of our RMSA solution is evaluated for dynamic service requests with single and mixed line-rate traffic \u2026",

To address this issue, we initially propose a relaxation framework that reduces computational complexity.

Further, for applications with tight delay requirements, we propose Dynamic Pricing with Bandwidth Reservation (DPBR), which can reserve bandwidth for specific applications. With the modelling of user satisfaction of cost and performance, we show that tenants with DP and DPBR can get better trade-offs between performance and cost.

Softwaredefined optical networks and network function virtualization contribute to the vision for future programmable, disaggregated, and dynamic optical networks. Future optical networks will be more dynamic in network functions and network services, with high-frequency network reconfigurations. Optical connections will last shorter than that of the static optical networks. It\u2019s straightforward that Programmable optical hardware will require a reduced link margin to improve the hardware utilization. To configure network dynamically, real-time network abstractions are required for both current links and available-for-deploy links. The former abstraction guarantees the established links not be interfered by the newly established link while the latter abstraction provides information for intelligent network planning. In this talk, we use machine-learning technologies to process the collected monitoring data in a field-trial testbed to abstract performances of multiple optical channels. Based on the abstract information, a new channel can be established with maximum performance and minimized interference on the current signals. We demonstrated the dynamic network abstraction over a 563.4-km field-trial testbed for 8 dynamic optical channels with 32 Gbaud Nyquist PM-16QAM signals. The work can be further extended to support complex optical networks.",

            "Abstract": "(PIs) comprising both network and IT resources, is considered. Taking into account the energy consumption levels associated with the ICT today and the expansion of the Internet, energy efficient infrastructures with reduced CO2 emissions become critical. To address this, a hybrid energy power supply system for the high energy consuming IT resources is adopted. In this system conventional and renewable energy sources are cooperating to produce the necessary power for the IT equipment to operate and support the required services. The reduction in CO2 emissions is further increased by applying energy aware planning of VIs over the converged PI. To quantify the benefits of the proposed approach a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model suitable for planning VIs is proposed and developed. This model takes into account multi-period and multi-service considerations over an integrated hybrid-solar powered IT and optical network infrastructure and aims at minimizing the CO2 emissions of the planned VIs. Our modelling results indicate significant reduction of the overall CO2 emissions that varies between 10-50% for different levels of demand requests.",

            "Abstract": "Fast lightpath restoration becomes particularly challenging in all-optical networks. First, the optical transparency complicates failure localization and isolation procedures, as loss of light alarms stemming from a failure propagate downstream from the failure point. Besides, such a transparency implies that optical signals must traverse relatively long distances without electrical regeneration. In view of this, backup path computations must also account for all degradations introduced in the physical end-to-end path, thus ensuring their feasibility. Looking toward the optical core networks of the future, the EU DICONET Project has worked on cross-layer solutions to enhance network control and management with the impairment-awareness needed to govern the underlying optical layer. This includes a network planning and operation tool (NPOT) that implements impairment-aware routing and wavelength assignment \u2026",

Systems at high observing frequencies need bandwidth for full sensitivity, whereas low frequencies need more bits for RFI mitigation. The net effect is that the state of the art instruments have multi-Gbps rates on data links to the correlator.

Ingress node performance has been investigated, as well as the overall performance of the suggested scheme. The results obtained showed that new scheme has superior performance to classical cloning. In particular, QoS provisioning offers a guaranteed burst loss rate, and delay unlike existing proposals for QoS implementation in OBS which use the burst offset time to provide such differentiation. Indeed, classical schemes increase both end-to-end delay and jitter. It is \u2026",

To support sustainable development of these infrastructures, novel data-driven Information and Communication (ICT) solutions are required. These will enable monitoring, analysis and exploitation of energy and asset information for the entire railway system including power grid, stations, rolling stock and infrastructure. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically reconfigurable advanced communication platform enabling connectivity between a variety of monitoring devices and computational resources through a heterogeneous network infrastructure. The connectivity, coordination and collaboration required is provided, on an on-demand basis in accordance to the cloud computing paradigm. The benefits of this platform in the end-to-end service delay and power consumption are quantified over the 5G Bristol is Open network topology.",

In this context, we define several types of flexibility and propose a method, based on entropy maximization, to quantitatively evaluate the flexibility provided by optical node components, subsystems, and architectures. Using this method we demonstrate the equivalence, in terms of switching flexibility, of finer spectrum granularity, and faster reconfiguration rate. We also show that switching flexibility is closely related to bandwidth granularity. The proposed method is used to derive formulae for the switching flexibility of key optical node components and the switching and architectural flexibility of four elastic optical node configurations.

            "Abstract": "Optical networks have been extensively investigated in recent years to provide high capacity for the Internet traffic. Among them the optical packet-switching network deploying buffering, wavelength conversion and multipath routing could be the most suitable one. It cannot only provide high capacity transport for Internet traffic but also achieve high utilization of the network resources. However due to the packet-oriented routing and switching, such a network can result in a large amount of packets out-of-order, packet loss and/or with various delays upon arriving at end systems, causing TCP flows that comprise those packets corrupted. Large amount of corrupted flows can increase the burstiness of the Internet traffic and cause higher-layer protocol to malfunction.

These formats impose far greater demands on networks for high-capacity, low latency and stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) compared to other existing formats. In addition, their data-intensiveness will require real-time interconnection of multiple, possibly distributed, high performance media processing and storage resources. To cater to this, novel networked architectures are required. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based architecture for the deployment of FMNs over intelligent optical networks. The key requirements of FMNs are identified and we discuss the features of our proposed architecture which meet these requirements.

In this paper, we first compare the challenges of employing the microservices approach in both the cloud computing and the NFV domains, and then discuss the need for AI-enabled microservices architecture for NFV.

The current network technologies do not allow defining traffic forwarding policies considering the different application traffic, resulting in an unbalanced load on the network links. Moreover, the devices are not concerned if the traffic is latency-sensitive or bandwidth-intensive. To handle this, we present NetSA, a framework exploiting the communication patterns of scientific applications, considering latency and bandwidth constraints, as the key logic for evenly placing the application flows on the network available paths.

            "Abstract": "Network performance optimization is a poly-parametric task where usually the physical network topology is already provided and given. The latter is mainly defined by the geographical needs and the business models developed in a region that reflect the particular data traffic requirements. However, during the design of a new network, the physical topology can be considered as an additional parameter, and this work aims to study the potential impact of a network topology in the performance of the network. Two relevant metrics of optical WDM networks are evaluated, throughput and blocking ratio. Through the simulation of 350k implementations of more than 500 network topologies, we demonstrate a performance variation on networks with the same number of nodes and edges up to 73.9% on the total network load under same levels of requests blocking ratio, and up to 17.3% on the network throughput.",

An SDN agent is a software element bridging the SDN controller and any legacy wireless network elements (NEs) by providing the abstraction of these elements. The main advantage of this approach is that there is no modification to either the existing SDN elements or the 802.11 protocols, while the SDN controller is enabled to control and manage legacy wireless NEs.

This paper presents the key technical findings from the public trials of several 5GST use cases. These findings explain how Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure is utilized to run compute workloads closer to the end user, therefore reducing end-to-end latency and thus improving quality of user experience.

However, comparatively less focus has been paid so far on the fixed side of the network, ie, toward the management of physical network computing infrastructure. During the next decade, when 5G and related services will be fully deployed, soon after, we will start noticing the mismatch between the 5G mobile services and outdated fixed networks that would impact the latency, reliability and resilience of the 5G applications. Therefore, in order to avoid such clogging on the fixed side of the networks, we will be looking at new frontiers for next generation of infrastructure management technologies such as network function virtualisation that will close the gap between the fixed and mobile side of the network and guarantee enhanced user experience.In this article, colleagues from King's College London, University of Bristol and Digital Catapult London first present an overview of the network function virtualisation in 5G networking use cases, especially from the perspective of latency and quality of experience in emerging use cases. Later, the article will present a brief overview of 5GUK testbeds and trials architecture supported by UK\u2019s Department for Digital Culture, Media & Sport followed by proof of the concept of real time audio/video streaming across the distributed sites at partner institutions to demonstrate the scalability, latency and quality of experience capabilities of the architecture.

Not only is controller traffic subject to jitter due to unreliable links and network contention, but the overhead generated by SDN can severely affect the performance of other traffic. This paper addresses the challenge of bringing high-overhead SDN architecture to IEEE 802.15.4 networks. We explore how the traditional view of SDN needs to evolve in order to overcome the constraints of low \u2026",

However, when QKD is applied in a deployed optical network, physical-layer intrusions may occur in the optical links by injecting harmful signals directly into the optical fiber. This can have a detrimental effect on the key distribution and eventually lead to its disruption. On the other hand, network architectures with software-defined networking (SDN) benefit from a homogeneous and unified control plane that can seamlessly control a QKD-enabled optical network end-to-end.

Besides Global, the local level integrates an RL module that continuously and accurately predicts end-to-end (e2e) service latency after VNF placements, and a node-local CPU load prediction model. HRL\u2019s is designed to stand fully autonomously or to complement and augment existing orchestrators lacking intelligence with a previously unexplored distributed multi-RL approach. Our performance evaluation over an actual 5G testbed implementation and use case shows that HRL can significantly outperform both Open Source Mano and heuristic-based VNF placement while reflecting a more complex trade-off between load and e2e delay, particularly under CPU overloading conditions.",

OBS is a promising technology for metro networks, where the operator can locate their servers to provide services such as video, backup or PC virtualization. These services are competing for shared network bandwidth when running in parallel. This work develops an FPGA-based access edge node, which operates with multiple QoS applications.

In this type of network the user may have the ability to control routing in an end-to-end manner and set up and teardown of light-paths between routing domains. To facilitate this level of user control, users or applications will be offered management/control of the network resources (i.e. bandwidth allocation at the wavelength and sub-wavelength level).

This helps reduce overprovisioning for lightpaths where full capacity is not needed, by (i) eliminating unnecessary regenerators and (ii) reducing the power consumption of terminals, when the clock rate of electronics is reduced along with the baudrate. We propose a novel architecture for an elastic optical interface by combining a variable bitrate transceiver, paired with an elastic aggregation stage, with software-defined control.

The emergence of a broad range of network-driven applications (e.g. multimedia, online gaming) introduces the need for a network environment able to provide service with different Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Burst loss probability, as one of the main QoS metrics on bufferless OBS networks, plays a considerable role on providing a network service with a particular level of QoS. In this paper, a novel MAC based protocol is proposed to support multiple QoS levels on OBS networks without wavelength conversion. It has been evaluated through extensive simulations and its simplistic form makes it very promising. Results indicate that the protocol can clearly provide a relative differentiation of services and guarantee null (or negligible) burst loss probability for a wide network \u2026",

The introduction of MCF in the networks mitigates the spectrum continuity constraint of the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem. In fact cores can be switched freely on different links during routing of the network traffic. Similarly, the route disjointness for demands with same allocated spectrum diminishes to core disjointness at the link level. On the other hand, some new issues such as the inter-core crosstalk should be taken into account while solving the RSCA problem.

            "Abstract": "Datacenter (DC) design has been moved toward the edge computing paradigm motivated by the need of bringing cloud resources closer to end users. However, the software defined networking (SDN) architecture offers no clue to the design of micro DCs (MDCs) for meeting complex and stringent requirements from next generation 5G networks. This is because canonical SDN lacks a clear distinction between functional network parts, such as core and edge elements. Besides, there is no decoupling between the routing and the network policy. In this paper, we introduce residue defined networking architecture (RDNA) as a new approach for enabling key features like ultra-reliable and low-latency communication in MDC networks. RDNA explores the programmability of residues number system as a fundamental concept to define a minimalist forwarding model for core nodes. Instead of forwarding packets based on \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An elastic optical network (EON) plays an important role in transport technology for virtualization of networks. A key aspect of EONs is to establish lightpaths (virtual links) with exactly the amount of spectrum that is needed and with the possibility of grooming, the process of grouping many small traffic flows into larger units, creating a super-lightpath. Grooming eliminates the need for many guard bands between lightpaths and also saves transceivers; however, it often leads to the need to perform optical\u2013electrical\u2013optical conversions to multiple-data-rate optical signals at intermediate nodes. The aim of this paper is to provide a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, as well as heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches, for the design of multiple virtual optical networks (VONs) in an elastic optical substrate network with bandwidth-variable lightpaths, modulation format constraints, and virtual elastic \u2026",

Results show that the proposed scheme outperforms both standard OBS and the basic cloning scheme, while minimizing delay and jitter.

            "Abstract": "We demonstrate for the first time a trusted-node-free fully-meshed metro network with dynamic discrete-variable quantum key distribution DV-QKD networking capabilities across four optical network nodes. A QKD-aware centralised SDN controller is utilised to provide dynamicity in switching and rerouting. The feasibility of coexisting a quantum channel with carrier-grade classical optical channels over field-deployed and laboratory-based fibres is experimentally explored in terms of achievable quantum bit error rate, secret key rate as well as classical signal bit error rate. Moreover, coexistence analysis over multi-hops configuration using different switching scenarios is also presented. The secret key rate dropped 43 % when coexisting one classical channel with 150 GHz spacing from the quantum channel for multiple links. This is due to the noise leakage from the Raman scattering into the 100 GHz bandwidth of the internal filter of the Bob DV-QKD unit. When coexisting four classical channels with 150 GHz spacing between quantum and the nearest classical channel, the quantum channel deteriorates faster due to the combination of Raman noise, other nonlinearities and high aggregated launch power causing the QBER value to exceed the threshold of 6 % leading the SKR to reach a value of zero bps at a launch power of 7 dB per channel. Furthermore, the coexistence of a quantum channel and six classical channels through a field-deployed fibre Test Network is examined.",

For this reason, the supported bandwidth granularities include full lambdas, sub- and super-lambdas and multiple transport formats such as bursts, flows and packets. The programmability is envisaged by a software/hardware platform that simplifies network control, re-planning at the logical level and end-to-end service transparency, by translating the technology-specific information to technology independent services in an abstracted and logical manner.",

            "Abstract": "focusing on control circuit requirements. GSCR lasers are important components for WDM networks due to their wide tuning range capability. This characteristic can be utilised in next generation optical networks if combined with fast switching between thewavelengths. For example, the realization of an ultra-fast tunable laser is essential for the implementation of fast wavelength converters, which are the key subsystems in Optical Packet Networks. They can also be used for O/E/O conversion in hybrid systems. In order to be applicable in optical packet switched systems, the switching times of the laser must be of the order of the packet guard time, ie~ 10 ns. As the intrinsic limitations of the laser would restrict the switching time to a few nanoseconds, an ultra fast control circuit should be able to switch between any two wavelengths at this speed. The control circuit presented here comprises an FPGA board to store the 10-bit digital current values and two digital to analogue converters (D/AC) to convert these values to currents. Switching times of less than 5ns were measured between the required driving currents, representing the full tuning range of 70 nm. This offers the feasibility of achieving wideband wavelength switching in less than 10 ns.",

In this paper we propose a new infrastructure as a service architecture utilizing optical network virtualization. We introduce novel PLI-aware VON composition algorithms suitable for single-line-rate (SLR) and mixed-line-rate (MLR) network scenarios.

In this paper, it is argued that a cost effective solution to this problem is to orchestrate the operation of Optical Data Center networks and Power Grids. To this end, a novel formulation based on Stochastic Linear Programming that considers jointly the Stochastic Service Provisioning Problem in the Optical Data Center networks and the Continuation Power Flow problem in the Power Grids, is presented. The proposed scheme takes into account both the time variability and uncertainty of cloud services as well the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources. Our modeling results illustrate interesting trade-offs \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The explosive growth of the mobile Internet, and the increasing diversity of use cases that are enabled by this, force network providers to concurrently support a large variety of applications and services. This introduces the need to transform traditionally closed, static and inelastic network infrastructures into open, scalable and elastic ecosystems. At the same time, new and emerging services impose enormous capacity requirements that significantly exceed the currently installed capacity. Furthermore, tens of billions of end devices will require connectivity in a scalable and sustainable manner. To address these needs, a more efficient utilization of the radio frequency spectrum is necessary. In view of this, 5thgeneration (5G) mobile and wireless networks will likely be characterized by the deployment of a large number of highly densified radio access points (APs) able to operate in much higher frequency bands, such as millimeter\u2010wave (mmWave). One clear challenge associated with these requirements is to provide infrastructure connectivity from the APs to the core network (CN), also referred to as transport network connectivity, at",

However, traffic offloading can only be adopted, if strict latency constraints imposed by the mobile cloud services are satisfied. To achieve this, significant amounts of computational and network resources need to be allocated, leading to increased operational and capital expenditures for the physical infrastructure providers. To address this issue, a multi-objective service provisioning scheme is proposed that tries to optimize the performance of both the network and computation infrastructure and the battery lifetime of the mobile devices under worst case delay conditions using network calculus theory.",

            "Abstract": "Elastic optical networking (EON) is a solution that promises to improve infrastructure utilization by implementing flexible spectrum allocation with small spectrum slots instead of the rigid 50 GHz fixed grid of current dense wavelength division multiplexing deployments. This new EON flexible grid supports bandwidth variable transponders (BVTs) that can tune their bit rate and bandwidth dynamically with a trade-off between reach and capacity. However, when BVTs need to transmit at low bit rates, part of their capacity is wasted. Therefore, the sliceable bandwidth variable transponder (SBVT) has been proposed, which can provide even higher levels of elasticity and efficiency to the network. SBVTs enable transmitting from one point to multiple destinations, changing the traffic rate to each destination and the number of destinations on demand.

Within 6TiSCH, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been identified as means of providing centralized control in a number of key situations. However, implementing a centralized SDN architecture in a Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) faces considerable challenges: not only is controller traffic subject to jitter due to unreliable links and network contention, but the overhead generated by SDN can severely affect the performance of other traffic.

Moreover it employs a MIMO system to consider the interaction between the scheduler parameters, i.e. TimeOut and MaxLenght in order to provide more accurate modelling than a multiple SISO system approximation. Finally the proposed controller model is verified by the use of OPNET simulation.",

The calculations are narrowed to specific cities for clearer understanding instead of the usual generic estimates. An end-to-end 5G network resource analysis is performed.

To this regard, flexible-grid (Flexgrid) transmission and switching technologies could significantly increase both transport network scalability and flexibility. Further benefits would come from multilayer interworking mechanisms enabling direct control of bandwidth-variable transponders (BVT) based on electronic switching technologies (IP/MPLS, OTN, etc.) for optical bandwidth optimization purposes. The development of data and control plane solutions based on EONs enabling adaptive network and service interworking is the main objective of the ICT project IDEALIST. The paper describes the data plane architecture of a future EON based on the vision of the IDEALIST project. \u00a9 2013 Authors.",

A detailed analysis employing Markov process is provided in order to investigate the performance of optical flow routers and to compare with optical packet routers. Results show that wavelength conversion is a promising technique in improving the optical flow routers\u2019 performance. Up to 99% good-throughput can be achieved in an optical flow router with 10 wavelength conversions and 60 buffers under a traffic load per wavelength of 2. On the other hand our results suggest that the good-throughput of optical packet routers cannot be improved by \u2026",

Specifically, it focuses on the important topic of integrating Grid environments directly with layer 1 optical network services. Included in this chapter is a discussion on layer 1 services involving Optical-to-Optical (OOO) switching as well as Optical-to-Electrical-to Optical (OEO) switching of optical signals [1]. The layer 1 network consists of many types of resources, including Optical Cross-Connect (OXC), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) switches, and Fiber Switches (FXCs) interconnected via fibers. The layer 1 service can provide dedicated end-to-end connectivity in the forms of time-slots, wavelength lightpath (s), or wavebands (multiple wavelengths), either static or dynamic. This chapter is organized as follows. The next section, 12.2 provides a context to the consideration of layer 1 Grid network services. A general introduction to layer 1 Grid network service is given in Section 12.2. 1. Network control and management issues are discussed in Section 12.3. Section 12.4 deals with the current technical challenges facing the layer 1 networks. The Grid network service with an all-optical network infrastructure is presented in Section 12.5 with a focus on Quality of Service",

This new EON flexible grid supports Bandwidth Variable Transponders (BVT) that can tune their bit rate and bandwidth dynamically with a trade off between reach and capacity. However, when BVTs need to transmit at low bit rates, part of their capacity is wasted. Therefore, the Sliceable Bandwidth Variable Transponder (SBVT) has been proposed, which can provide even higher levels of elasticity and efficiency to the network. SBVTs enable transmitting from one point to multiple destinations, changing the traffic rate to each destination and the number of destinations on demand. The aim of this work is to identify the target cost of 400 Gb/s and 1 Tb/s SBVTs to reduce, by at least 30 \u2026",

There is also the requirement to provide a unified description mechanism to cater to the heterogeneous nature of media content, service and infrastructure providers' resources, as well as end-user terminals. This paper describes a service-oriented architecture for implementing future high performance NMIs which are capable of supporting emerging beyond High Definition digital media formats. It focuses mainly on a novel semantic modeling framework based on Resource Description Framework (RDF). This novel framework is being \u2026",

By utilizing the high-reliability and low-latency properties of synchronous flooding, our results show that Atomic-SDN is capable of providing minimal bounded latency guarantees for network-wide SDN operations.

As well as providing large capacity, this new layer will be required to support new services such as rapid provisioning of an end-to-end connection under customer control. The first phase of network evolution, therefore, will provide a circuit-switched optical layer characterized by high capacity and fast circuit provisioning.

A detailed analysis employing Markov process is provided in order to investigate the performance of optical flow routers and to compare with optical packet routers. Results show that wavelength conversion is a promising technique in improving the optical flow routers\u2019 performance.

            "Abstract": "During the past years it has become evident to the technical community that computational resources cannot keep up with the demands generated by some applications. As an example, particle physics experiments [0, 0] produce more data than can be realistically processed and stored in one location (ie several Petabytes/year). In such situations where intensive computation analysis of shared large scale data is needed, one can try to use accessible computing resources distributed in different locations (combined data and computing Grid).Distributed computing & the concept of a computational Grid is not a new paradigm but until a few years ago networks were too slow to allow efficient use of remote resources. As the bandwidth and the speed of networks have increased significantly, the interest in distributed computing has taken to a new level. Recent advances in optical networking have created a radical mismatch between the optical transmission world and the electrical forwarding/routing world. Currently, a single strand of optical fiber can transmit more bandwidth than the entire Internet core. What\u2019s more, only 10% of potential wavelengths on 10% of available fiber pairs are actually lit [0]. This represents 1-2% of potential bandwidth that is actually available in the fiber system. The result of this imbalance between supply and demand has led to severe price erosion of bandwidth product. Annual STM-1 (155 Mbit/sec) prices on major European routes have fallen by 85-90% from 1990-2002 [0]. Therefore it now becomes technically and economically viable to think of a set of computing, storage or combined computing storage nodes coupled \u2026",

To support flexible allocation of spectrum resources the optical network nodes need to be agile.

The node modules in the case of AoD are not hard-wired, but can be connected/disconnected to any input/output port according to the requirements. Thus, each AoD node and the network (fabricated with AoD nodes) as a whole acts like an optical field-programmable gate array. This flexibility inherent in AoD can be exploited for different purposes, such as for cost-efficient and energy-efficient design of the networks.

The neutral host model is key for this vertical, specially to promote the infrastructure sharing between operators for a pervasive infrastructure deployment. However, it demands enhancements in today's virtualization technologies to support geographically scattered and resource constrained computing and networking elements (i.e., core data centers, edge computing point of presences, and far-edge servers at lampposts, etc.). This paper presents the virtualization enhancements developed within the H2020 5GCity project to support the neutral host model for smart city deployments. The envisioned virtualization technology demands security and technology extensions with a unified view of sliceable and heterogeneous devices and radio technologies (e.g., LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi).

In this paper we study the availability and power consumption of different node architectures.

As Data Centers and HPC systems are growing in size and complexity, optical networks seem to be the way to scale the bandwidth of current network infrastructures. To scale the number of servers that are connected to optical switches normally Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is used to group several servers in one fiber. Using DWDM limits the number of servers per fiber to the number of wavelengths that fiber supports, and also may increase the number of packet collisions. Our proposal focuses on using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) to allow multiple servers per wavelength, allowing to scale to a larger number of servers per switch. Initial results have shown that when using TDM we can obtain similar results in performance when comparing it with DWDM. For some of the \u2026",

Next, we investigate different transmission techniques and evaluate the penalty introduced by the filtering effect when considering Nyquist wavelength division multiplexing, single side-band direct-detection orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, and symbol-rate variable dual polarization quadrature amplitude modulation. Also, different approaches to compensate for the filter narrowing effect are discussed.

Reducing the number of used optical components with higher failure probability within nodes represents a promising approach for achieving reliable and cost-effective optical network operation as it reduces the correlated risk of connection failures and enables reusing idle components as redundancy for failure recovery. This can result in greater overall network availability and lower loss of data and related revenue.

However, in the design of an SDN architecture, there is no clear distinction between functional network parts such as core and edge elements. It means that all switches require to support lookups over hundreds of bits with complex actions that have to be specified by multiple tables.

            "Abstract": "The adoption of Software Defined Networking (SDN) within traditional networks has provided operators the ability to manage diverse resources and easily reconfigure or re-purpose networks as requirements change. Recent research has extended this concept to IEEE 802.15. 4 low-power wireless networks, which form a key component of the Internet of Things (IoT). It is, however, difficult to apply the high-overhead approach of SDN, which requires both regularly scheduled and reactive asynchronous communication, to the low-bandwidth, unreliable environment present in IEEE 802.15. 4. Although recent research has attempted to address this issue through optimization, interoperability with the low-power IPv6 stack inevitably results in trade-offs and contention with other protocols. This paper introduces Atomic-SDN: a low-latency, reliable, and energy-efficient cross-layer architecture for SDN control in low-power wireless networks. Atomic-SDN utilizes synchronous flooding, which has recently been shown as a highly capable solution for fast and reliable communication in low-power mesh networks. Additionally, Atomic-SDN introduces cross-layer architecture to satisfy the different traffic patterns required by SDN, through configuration and scheduling of multiple synchronous flooding protocols. Using this approach, controller communication is facilitated at theoretical lower bounds of latency. We demonstrate the practicality of Atomic-SDN through emulation, with extremely high reliability and minimal latency as the mesh scales; presenting end-to-end delivery ratios of over 99.99 and controller association within milliseconds as opposed to \u2026",

However, in order to enable an efficient usage of these resources, automatic orchestration is required. Commonly, automatic orchestration tools are based on the observability of the infrastructure itself, but that is not enough in some cases. Certain classes of applications have specific requirements that are difficult to meet, such as low latency, high bandwidth and high computational power. To properly meet these requirements, orchestration must be based on multilevel observability, which means collecting data from both the application and the infrastructure levels. Thus in this work we developed a platform aiming to show how multilevel observability can be implemented and how it can be used to improve automatic orchestration in cloud environments.

Fast switching is provided for packet traffic where granularity below the wavelength level is required, while slow wavelength switching and routing is facilitated at the same time.

In this paper, it is argued that a cost effective solution to this problem is to orchestrate the operation of Optical Data Center networks and Power Grids. To this end, a novel formulation based on Stochastic Linear Programming that considers jointly the Stochastic Service Provisioning Problem in the Optical Data Center networks and the Continuation Power Flow problem in the Power Grids, is presented. The proposed scheme takes into account both the time variability and uncertainty of cloud services as well the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources.

The key enabler for the disaggregated data centre is the network, which should support the bandwidth and latency requirements of the communication that is currently inside the server. In addition, a management software is required to create the logical connection of the resources needed by an application. In this paper, we propose a disaggregated data centre network architecture, we present the first scheduling algorithm specifically designed for disaggregated \u2026",

It allows for the existence of multiple independent virtual infrastructures, called virtual slices, on top of the same physical infrastructure, each of them specially tailored to the tenants\u2019 needs. In such a scenario, an optimal mapping of the virtual slices plays a capital role toward an efficient utilization of the data center network resources, potentially saving costs for the data center owner. However, due to the increasing trend of bringing optics to data center networks, specific virtual slice mapping mechanisms accounting for the particularities of the optical medium (e.g., wavelength continuity constraint) have to be investigated. For this, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) model for optimally mapping a set of virtual slices from different tenants in a hybrid optical circuit switching (OCS)/optical packet switching (OPS) data center network with the aim to minimize \u2026",

The VI planning optimization objective is to minimize the overall energy consumption satisfying at the same time specific end-to-end delay constraints. To address these issues, together with the uncertainty introduced by the mobility of the end devices we proposed a MOVNO planning scheme based on non-linear programming. Our modeling results illustrate interesting trade-offs between the overall energy consumption of the MOVNOs, the mobility of the end \u2026",

A novel architectural and hardware framework to enable NC are also provided and a suitable implementation addressing the problem of fast NC-related operations processing at the edge is demonstrated. A global time stamping solution that can be used to address the strict synchronization requirements of FH flows arriving at the BBUs, keeping buffering at the edge as low as possible, has been developed.

This paper proposes the creation of an ontology-based reference conceptual model to support VNF Marketplaces, allowing VNF vendors and infrastructure providers to commercialize VNFaaS (VNFs as services). The proposed reference model has been engineered by using foundational ontology techniques (UFO/OntoUML), it has been formally validated by using model simulation techniques, and it has been implemented in OWL.",

This complexity can be reduced by applying the ideas of abstraction from computer science where different equipment is described in the same basic terms. The noise-to-signal ratio can be used as a metric to describe the quality of transmission performance of a signal propagated through a network element and accumulates additively through a sequence of such elements allowing the estimation of end-to-end performance. This study aims to explore the robustness of the noise-to-signal ratio metric in an installed fibre infrastructure. We show that the abstracted noise-to-signal ratio is independent of the observers and their location. We confirm that the abstracted noise-to-signal ratio can reasonably predict the performance of light \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper focuses on the design of service provisioning schemes suitable for mega data center (DC) infrastructures. A major issue linked with the operation of these infrastructures is scalability caused by the increased number of resources available in megasize highly dense DCs and the associated requirements for control and management information. To address this scalability issue, we propose for the first time to monitor and optimize the operation of mega DCs adopting graph factorization combined with compressive sensing theories. This approach takes advantage of the spatial and temporal correlation of compute, and network resource requests, to monitor and optimize metrics, such as delay and energy with reduced control and management information. Our modeling results indicate drastically reduced volume of traffic transferred from the data to control plane and number of optimization process variables.",

It brings the benefits of bit rate and format transparency which provide greater agility and flexibility to optical networks. The rise of high performance computing and Data Centre Networks (DCNs) in recent years are driving clearer scenarios for the application of FOS, which could enable a high bandwidth, low latency, energy-efficient optical interconnect among the processing cores, servers and racks compared to its electrical counterpart [3, 4].Supported by the ECFP7 COSIGN project, Venture Photonics (VPs) is working with University of Bristol (UoB) and Technical University of Denmark (DTU) to develop a new-generation high performance optical crosspoint switch (OXS) module based on the active-vertical-coupling (AVC) technology [5, 6]. As shown in Fig. 1, VPs\u2019 OXS module is chosen to serve the fast inter/intra-rack communication in the all-optical DCNs architecture proposed by the HPN group of UoB, in which TDM fast optical circuit switching (OCS) and OPS would be realized and demonstrated, and also to work as a fast TDM switch in the multidimensional-switching-based DCNs designed by the DTU Fotonik.",

Under such uncertainty, OSNR prediction for unestablished channels becomes indispensable but remains a big challenge. For protective network planning purposes such as margin threshold setting or wavelength assignment, it is desirable to evaluate the worst OSNR performance of each network link. Such exploration will unavoidably employ active monitoring probes, which may cause interruptions to the network. An efficient active monitoring strategy that optimizes the choice of probes or monitoring trials is needed. We propose a \u201cself-learning\u201d monitoring strategy integrated at intermediate nodes. Our method can intelligently select the channel to be monitored in order to search for the target global maxima of OSNR degradation for a specific link. Our \u2026",

We demonstrate that effective secret key generation is possible even with the combined crosstalk effect of the six adjacent cores over the quantum channel. Additional measurements show the impact on the secret key rate and QBER by adding coherent optical channels in different cores.",

In this context, it proposes a heuristic suitable to optimally assign Base Band Unit processing functions in softwarized Radio Access Networks to different servers, taking into consideration their processing requirements with the aim to minimize the overall energy consumption. It also proposes the adoption of live migration of virtualized resources, in order to dynamically reallocate these functions to different servers that better match the continuously changing characteristics of 5G services, for increased energy efficiency purposes. The benefits associated with live migration are quantified through a series of experiments. Our results show a reduction of the number of switched-on servers through live migration that leads to a notable improvement in terms of resource and energy efficiency.",

            "Abstract": "Communications networks are traditionally constructed from hardware dedicated to specific tasks, using data handling rules implemented within the firmware. Naturally, this is a relatively inflexible model and, in an effort to improve key metrics such as scalability, there has been significant drive towards the development of software defined networks (SDNs). The underlying premise of an SDN is that the rules are deployed as software modules instead of being hardcoded, separating the control and forwarding plane, so as to allow global reconfigurability of the network from a single location as and when required. This also makes it easier to merge multiple disparate networks, bypassing any compatibility issues between proprietary architectures [1]. For quantum key distribution (QKD) to be useful in the real world, it must be compatible with nextgeneration communications models. Data centres are ideal for demonstrating this capabability, as they can benefit greatly from the adoption of SDNs [2]. Additionally, virtual network functions (VNFs), which run on generic servers and complement SDNs, can be used to instantiate critical services such as firewalls [3]. However, this requires high levels of security during their deployment via communication channels. For amplifier-free data centre networks spanning distances of up to 10 km, the operational wavelength is 1310 nm [4], increasing the potential for commercial 1550 nm QKD devices to be multiplexed with pre-existing technologies straight out of the box.Here, we have run experiments emulating how QKD can fit into this environment with minimal disruption to the classical setup. We have particularly \u2026",

A unified ANN-based regression model is proposed and implemented to predict Q-factors of all the channels simultaneously. A scenario generator is developed to configure the field-trial testbed with eight testing channels automatically to generate dynamic scenarios. A network configuration and monitoring database (CMDB) is implemented to collect network configuration and monitoring data that include link information, operational parameters of key optical devices, network configuration state, and real-time Q-factors of the available channels for the generated network scenarios. These collected data are used for training and testing of the developed ANN model. In order to achieve multiple channel predictions, we \u2026",

The H2020 5GCity project aims to solve such issues and beyond while designing, developing, and deploying a sliceable, distributed cloud & edge and radio 5G-platform with neutral hosting capability to support the sharing between information technology (IT) infrastructure owners and media service providers i.e., vertical media actors. In this paper we discuss how 5G technology will facilitate the rise of highly demanding media use cases and its implication on how service providers typically operate (in terms of business model).

Besides, increasing energy consumption of the ICT sector makes network energy efficiency gain a lot of attention. Reducing the usage of components in the network is a promising strategy to both make network more energy efficient and reliable as it allows (i) putting idle components into a power-saving, or sleep, mode and (ii) reusing them as redundancy for failure recovery. The new generation of synthetic reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs) implemented by Architecture on Demand (AoD) supports the above functionalities by offering unprecedented flexibility and self-healing capabilities. In AoD nodes, components are interconnected via high-port-count optical switch serving as optical backplane, and \u2026",

This architecture requires high-bandwidth/low-latency optical transport networks interconnecting RUs and compute resources adopting SDN control.

Computer simulation is employed to study the effect of wavelength-number variations, caused by wavelength switching and cable cuts, on the transmitted wavelength channels in a long-haul WDM trunk-and-branch network. The transmission degradation of the affected channels is expressed in terms of Q-factor penalty, which reflects their optical power and optical-signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) variations. Switching-induced wavelength power reductions are found to generate the largest penalties. It is shown that the Q-factor degradation is mostly caused by the receiver decision-threshold misalignment relatively to its optimum position and that the OSNR \u2026",

To address these issues together with the time variability and uncertainty of elastic cloud services, a novel VI planning scheme based on stochastic linear programming (SLP) is proposed.

Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM) photonic interconnects have been suggested as means to overcome capacity upgrade requirements and enable disaggregation in future data centers. Here, Holographic Optical Elements (HOE) are proposed for SDM photonic interconnects. The proposed coupling scheme entails the use of holograms as fan out components for coupling light from a source to multicore fibers (MCF). The scheme is versatile and can be adopted to any SDM fiber core arrangement. Appropriate Computer-Generated Holograms (CGHs) are designed for two kind of MCF and the HOE interconnect is evaluated in terms of performance variations against system and fabrication related parameters. Furthermore, the interconnect design is optimized for loss-sensitive applications. ",

To satisfy the low-latency requirements of content-rich mobile applications, existing mobile cloud computing solutions allow mobile devices to access the required resources by accessing a nearby resource-rich cloudlet, suffering increased capital and operational expenditures. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an infrastructure and architectural approach based on the orchestrated planning and operation of Optical Data Center networks and Wireless Access networks. To this end, a novel formulation based on a multi-objective Non Linear Programming model is presented that considers energy efficient virtual infrastructure planning over the converged wireless, optical network interconnecting DCs with mobile devices, taking a holistic view of the infrastructure.

First, it leverages end-to-end service-level performance predictions for placing VNFs. Second, whereas the majority of other Machine Learning efforts in the literature use Supervised Learning (SL) techniques, AREL3P is based on a particular form of Reinforcement Learning adapted to predictions. This makes placement decisions more resilient to dynamic conditions, as well as portable to other network nodes, and able to generalize in heterogeneous network \u2026",

In this regard, we address this resource allocation problem, for the first time, by designing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model based on a hierarchical 5G network interconnecting multiple MEC nodes. The objective is to minimize the total latency from five sources: processing, queueing, transmission, propagation, and optical-electronic-optical conversion. Experimental results prove that ultra-low latency requirements can be guaranteed and maximum usage of MEC node resources can be obtained.

Currently, Grid computing using optical network infrastructure is dedicated to a small number of well known organizations with extremely large jobs (eg large data file transfers between known users or destinations [1]. Due to the static or semi-static nature of this type of Grids, long-lived wavelength paths between clients and Grid resources with centralized job management strategies are usually deployed (Lambda Grids). This type of Grid networking relies on carrier provision of optical network resources while the Grid users have no visibility of the lambda infrastructure. In other words, the Grid user is not able to setup paths over the optical Grid network.As Grid applications evolve, the need for user controlled network infrastructure is apparent in order to support emerging dynamic and interactive services. Examples of such applications may be high resolution home video editing, real-time rendering, highdefinition interactive TV, e-health and immersive interactive learning environments. These applications need infrastructures that makes vast amount of storage and computation resources potentially available to a large number of users. Key for the future evolution of such networks is to determine early on the technologies, protocols, and network architecture that would enable solutions to these requirements.",

            "Abstract": "The future Internet evolution is driven by appli-cations that require simultaneous real-time access to multiple heterogeneous IT (eg computing and storage) resources interconnected by high-speed optical networks. Service oriented architectural frameworks have been considered to improve service delivery in this environment by organising distributed heterogeneous resources owned by multiple providers. In this paper, we discuss a service oriented architectural framework tailored to the needs of future Internet applications. The framework introduces the capability to orchestrate the provisioning of distributed heterogeneous resources owned by multiple providers. Central to the framework is a novel resource orchestration model. This model focuses on the optimized selection of heterogeneous IT and network resources owned by different Infrastructure Providers (InPs). The proposed model aims to achieve a global optimum from both the end-users\u2019 and InPs\u2019 point of view across different administrative domains. An integer linear program (ILP) is formulated to obtain optimal results that maximizes the number of accepted requests while minimising resource usage. It is compared against a co-scheduling ILP model, whose objective is to maximise the number of accepted requests only. We then propose a heuristic solution for scalability. Its performance is compared against (i) our proposed ILP (ii) a co-scheduling heuristic that aim to maximise the number of accepted requests only and (iii) an algorithm that does not take into account cross-domain optimisations. Finally, two online algorithms for operational scenarios is proposed which outperforms three \u2026",

To this regard, flexible-grid (Flexgrid) transmission and switching technologies could significantly increase both transport network scalability and flexibility. Further benefits would come from multilayer interworking mechanisms enabling direct control of bandwidth-variable transponders (BVT) based on electronic switching technologies (IP/MPLS, OTN, etc.) for optical bandwidth optimization purposes.

It provides a level of abstraction and independence from the traditional networking practice that allows for a fast path of innovation and, specifically, opens new opportunities for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks. In this contribution we explore the implications of this paradigm for the deployment of QKD in practice from the point of view of telecommunications\u2019 providers, network equipment manufacturers and applied research and development. We propose a generic quantum-aware SDN architecture and two applications, a generic end to end encryption one and other for the network infrastructure itself.Quantum Key Distribution is a difficult technology. Beyond its intrinsic point to point nature, the creation, transmission and detection of quantum signals impose very stringent requirements on the physical implementation. This is difficult already in the typical point to point links over which most of QKD research has been done and it gets worse in the case of QKD networks, where new requirements, such as addressability, physical media sharing between classical and quantum channels or the use of common infrastructure come into play. The last items also imply that now losses and noise in the channel are even more relevant, since the quantum channel has to pass through optical devices that are common in the nowadays prevalent paradigm of passive optical networks. These issues have been studied in many networks and testbeds [1]\u2013[3] but although the limits and restrictions are now reasonably well understood, a full integration of QKD in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Recently, it has been recognized that for the Internet to evolve, it is important that network operators be able to virtualize their physical infrastructure into multiple parallel virtual networks, which can support different protocols and services. Due to its inherent exibility, optical networking technology has been identified as a key enabler for a new breed of eficient virtualization at the physical network layer or Layer 1 (L1). The major role in this approach play mechanisms and protocols for the dynamic and automatic network control, the most prominent of which have been proposed within the IETF Generalized Multi-protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) framework. Motivated by the need for efficient resource management in virtualized optical networks, this thesis develops the GMPLS network federation architecture and the Infrastructure Service model based on two novel concepts: (1) the dynamic interconnection of GMPLS domains is facilitated with the introduction of the novel GMPLS Exchange Point (GXP), which is a physical layer equivalent of the Internet Exchange Point (IXP), and (2) the resource allocation and sharing of resources among infrastructure services are controlled by means of a new resource visibility attribute, which represents service-specific resource usage policies within the control plane. Based on these concepts, this thesis develops and evaluates in a simulation study dynamic traffic routing and topology engineering (RToE) methods for the infrastructure services. The results obtained demonstrate signi cant performance benefits of the visibility-enabled resource control and GXP-based architecture, and indicate important directions for \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Over the years, the Internet has become a central tool for society. The extent of its growth and usage raises critical issues associated with its design principles that need to be addressed before it reaches its limits. Many emerging applications have increasing requirements in terms of bandwidth, QoS and manageability. Moreover, applications such as Cloud computing and 3D-video streaming require optimization and combined provisioning of different infrastructure resources and services that include both network and IT resources. Demands become more and more sporadic and variable, making dynamic provisioning highly needed. As a huge energy consumer, the Internet also needs to be energyconscious. Applications critical for society and business (eg, health, finance) or for real-time communication demand a highly reliable, robust and secure Internet. Finally, the future Internet needs to support sustainable business models, in order to drive innovation, competition, and research. Combining optical network technology with Cloud technology is key to addressing the future Internet/Cloud challenges. In this con-",

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes the concept of compute resource disaggregation in centralized softwarised radio access networks. This approach allows individual allocation of processing functions to different servers depending on the nature and volume of their processing requirements. The benefits of the proposed approach are evaluated through experiments analyzing the baseband unit (BBU) processing requirements of LTE PHY using an open source suite for wireless systems and a purposely developed multistage linear programming modeling framework. To address the high computational complexity of integer linear programming (ILP), limiting real-time services, a heuristic algorithm was also developed. Our results show that when using the proposed approach, the overall system power consumption is reduced by 40% under high loading scenarios compared to the traditional solution where all BBU functions are hosted in the same physical servers. The heuristic results achieve relatively good agreement with the ILP results (the gap is less than 5%), particularly for low and high loading conditions. At the same time, the heuristic requires less than 0.3\u2009s to identify the optimal allocation policy.",

            "Abstract": "This study focuses on the provisioning of resilient Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) services employing optical transport networks. In response to the high bandwidth requirements necessary for the protection of the C-RAN architecture from optical transport network and/or BBU failures, a novel approach based on Network Coding (NC) is proposed. A novel architectural and hardware framework to enable NC are also provided and a suitable implementation addressing the problem of fast NC-related operations processing at the edge is demonstrated. A global time stamping solution that can be used to address the strict synchronization requirements of FH flows arriving at the BBUs, keeping buffering at the edge as low as possible, has been developed. The performance of the proposed solution has been experimentally evaluated demonstrating negligible penalties. Network level modeling results demonstrate a reduction of the total optical network capacity required for this type of applications by 33%.",

We propose and demonstrate a bit-rate and modulation-format independent optical cross-connect architecture, based on gridless spectrum selective switch, 20-ms 3D-MEMS and 10-ns PLZT optical switches, that supports arbitrary spectrum allocation and transparent time multiplexing. The architecture is implemented in a four-node field-fiber-linked testbed to transport continuous RZ and NRZ data channels at 12.5, 42.7 and 170.8 Gb/s, and selectively groom sub-wavelength RZ channels at 42.7 Gb/s. We also showed that the architecture is dynamic and can be reconfigured to meet the routing requirements of the network traffic. Results show error-free operation with an end-to-end power penalty between 0.8 dB and 5 dB for all continuous and sub-wavelength channels. \u00a92011 Optical Society of America.",
