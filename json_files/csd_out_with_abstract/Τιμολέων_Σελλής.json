Traditionally, the relevance of a Web service advertisement to a service request is determined by computing an overall score that aggregates individual matching scores among the various parameters in their descriptions. Two drawbacks characterize such approaches. First, there is no single matching criterion that is optimal for determining the similarity between parameters. Instead, there are numerous approaches ranging from using Information Retrieval similarity metrics up to semantic logic-based inference rules. Second, the reduction of individual scores to an overall similarity leads to significant information loss. Since there is no consensus on how to weight these scores, existing methods \u2026",

We introduce query processing algorithms that practically treat containment queries as range queries over the ordered postings lists of OIF and exploit this ordering to quickly prune unnecessary page accesses. OIF is simple to implement and our experiments on both real and synthetic data show that it greatly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for all three classes of containment queries.",

For the composition operator, in particular, we concentrate on two commonly used definitions, namely, consistency-based and existential composition. Our formal framework allows us to prove that our solutions are correct. The presented solutions are handled in a uniform manner and apply to all of the models of the family.",

However, the existing detection techniques largely ignore the outer influence of the communities.

However, the community diversity of influenced users is largely ignored even though it has unique value in practice. For example, the higher community diversity reduces the risk of marketing campaigns as you should not put all your eggs in one basket; the diversity can also prolong the effect of a marketing campaign in the future promotion.

This method can achieve accurate real-time recognition of risky driver behaviours on raw input and can outperform classic learning methods operating on features.

The process of populating the DW with data stemming from the operational sources, in a way that the schema and business requirements of the DW are met, is referred to as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process. Typically, such processes are handled by ETL tools, which are pieces of software responsible for the extraction of data from several sources, their cleansing, customization, and insertion into a DW. However, even though the term ETL is traditionally related to data warehousing, it may be used in a wider sense to refer to any process of exchanging and transforming data between data stores. For example, ETL is the core functionality of a recently emerging type of web applications, called mashups, where information is extracted from various web sites, and it is appropriately transformed and integrated before presented to the final user.",

At the same time, the recent advancement in large-scale 3D modeling has inspired applications that combine visibility and spatial queries, which in turn can be integrated with user trajectories to provide answers for many real-life user queries, such as \u201cHow can I choose the route which provides the best view of a historic site?\u201d. In this work, we propose and investigate the k Aggregate Maximum Visibility Trajectory (k AMVT) query and its variants. Given sets of targets, obstacles, and trajectories, the k AMVT query finds top-k trajectories that provide the best view of the targets.

Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) have been proposed to support sophisticated facilities in exchanging, querying and integrating (semi-)structured data hosted by peers. In this paper, we are interested in routing graph queries in a very large PDMS, where peers advertise their local bases using fragments of community RDF/S schemes (i.e., views). We introduce an original encoding for these fragments, in order to efficiently check whether a peer view is subsumed by a query. We rely on this encoding to design an RDF/S view lookup service featuring a statefull and a stateless execution over a DHT-based P2P infrastructure. We finally evaluate experimentally our system to demonstrate its \u2026",

References to miRNA names in the literature often deviate from standard nomenclature for various reasons, since even the official nomenclature evolves. For instance, a single miRNA name may identify two completely different molecules or two different names may refer to the same molecule. mirPub is a database with a powerful and intuitive interface, which facilitates searching for miRNA literature, addressing the aforementioned issues. To provide effective search services, mirPub applies text mining techniques on MEDLINE, integrates data from several curated databases and exploits data from its user community following a crowdsourcing approach. Other key features include an interactive visualization \u2026",

To support such applications, in this paper, we formulate a new problem of identifying top-k Socio-Spatial co-engaged Location Selection (SSLS) for users in a social graph, that selects the best set of k locations from a large number of location candidates relating to the user and her friends. The selected locations should be (i) spatially and socially relevant to the user and her friends, and (ii) diversified in both spatially and socially to maximize the coverage of friends in the spatial space.

Querying capabilities are provided through tree-pattern queries. The need for querying tree-structured data sources when their structure is not fully known, and the need to integrate multiple data sources with different tree structures have driven, recently, the suggestion of query languages that relax the complete specification of a tree pattern. In this paper, we use a query language which allows partial tree-pattern queries (PTPQs). The structure in a PTPQ can be flexibly specified fully, partially or not at all. To evaluate a PTPQ, we exploit index graphs which generate an equivalent set of\" complete\" tree-pattern queries. In order to process PTPQs, we need to efficiently solve the PTPQ satisfiability and containment problems. These problems become more complex in the context of PTPQs \u2026",

This task is a part of the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process, which is responsible for the population of the data warehouse. In this paper, we propose a customizable and extensible ontology-driven approach for the conceptual design of ETL processes. A graph-based representation is used as a conceptual model for the source and target data stores. We then present a method for devising flows of ETL operations by means of graph transformations.

When a query is posed, it is evaluated locally, using the materialized views, without accessing the original information sources. The DWs are dynamic entities that evolve continuously over time. As time passes, new queries need to be answered by them. Some of these queries can be answered using exclusively the materialized views. In general though new views need to be added to the DW.In this paper we investigate the problem of incrementally designing a DW when new queries need to be answered and possibly extra space is allocated for view materialization. Based on an AND/OR dag representation of multiple queries, we model the problem as a state space search problem. We design incremental algorithms for selecting a set of new views to additionally materialize in the DW that: (a) fits \u2026",

More importantly, MIDAS-RDF utilizes a labeling scheme to handle expensive transitive closure computations efficiently. This allows for distributed RDFS reasoning in a more scalable way compared to existing methods, as also demonstrated by our extensive experimental study. Furthermore, MIDAS-RDF supports a publish-subscribe model that enables remote peers to selectively subscribe to RDF content.",

However, most studies only focus on user influence via cyber interactions while ignoring their physical interactions which are also essential to gauge influence propagation. Additionally, targeted campaigns or advertisements have not received sufficient attention. To address these issues, we first devise a novel holistic influence diffusion model that takes into account both cyber and physical user interactions in an effective and practical way. Based on the new diffusion model, we formulate a new problem of holistic influence maximization, denoted as HIM query, for targeted advertisements in a spatial social network. The HIM query problem aims to find a minimum set of users whose holistic influence can cover all target users in the network, which belongs to a set covering \u2026",

Due to this improved organization schema, processing of aggregation star queries changes dramatically creating new optimization opportunities. An important optimization technique is the so-called pre-grouping transformation. Although this transformation is expected to improve the query-processing plan in most cases, there are several cases where it is not beneficial.In this paper we attempt to apply a cost-based method for the optimal application of the pre-grouping transformation. Taking into consideration the special characteristics of our domain we identify the most suitable algorithms for the operations related to pre-grouping and derive detailed cost formulas for them. When proper statistical information is available the method can decide (1) whether or not to use the pre-grouping transformation and (2) which combination of algorithms to use for the various operations involved.",

Considerable effort has been directed towards context acquisition from sources and context modeling. However, so far, no data model or language for context aware data has been proposed which can be considered a natural analogue to the relational model or algebra. In this work, we argue about the need for a conceptual model for context aware information and propose a context aware data model based on the definition of multi-schema relations.

This phase typically consumes between 50% and 80% of the overall processing time. In typical DW scenarios pre-grouping methods only have a limited effect as the grouping is usually specified on the hierarchy levels of the dimension tables and not on the fact table itself.

In this paper we present GrouPeer, an adaptive, automated approach to both issues in the context of unstructured P2P database overlays. By allowing peers to individually choose which rewritten version of a query to answer and evaluate the received answers, information-rich sources left hidden otherwise are discovered.

            "Abstract": "With the advent of location-based social networks, users can tag their daily activities in different locations through check-ins. These check-in locations signify user preferences for various socio-spatial activities and can be used to build their profiles to improve the quality of services in some applications such as recommendation systems, advertising, and group formation. To support such applications, in this paper, we formulate a new problem of identifying top-k Socio-Spatial co-engaged Location Selection (SSLS) for users in a social graph, that selects the best set of k locations from a large number of location candidates relating to the user and her friends. The selected locations should be (i) spatially and socially relevant to the user and her friends, and (ii) diversified in both spatially and socially to maximize the coverage of friends in the spatial space. This problem has been proved as NP-hard. To address the challenging problem, we first develop a branch-and-bound based Exact solution by designing some pruning strategies based on the derived bounds on diversity. To make the solution scalable for large datasets, we also develop an approximate solution by deriving the relaxed bounds and advanced termination rules to filter out insignificant intermediate results. To further accelerate the efficiency, we present one fast exact approach and a meta-heuristic approximate approach by avoiding the repeated computation of diversity at the running time. Finally, we have performed extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed models and algorithms against the adapted existing methods using four real-world large datasets.",

Recent keyword search approaches return lowest common ancestors (LCAs) of the keyword matches ranked with respect to their relevance to the keyword query. A major challenge of a ranking approach is the efficiency of its algorithms as the number of keywords and the size and complexity of the data increase. To face this challenge most of the known approaches restrict their ranking to a subset of the LCAs (e.g., SLCAs, ELCAs), missing relevant results.In this work, we design novel top-k-size stack-based algorithms on tree-structured data. Our algorithms implement ranking semantics for keyword queries which is based on the concept of LCA size.

In highly dynamic networks, where vertices appear and disappear and their connectivity constantly changes, we need to redefine our measures of centrality to properly capture the temporal dimension of the network structure evolution, as well as the dynamic processes over the network. Betweenness centrality (BC), one of the most studied measures, defines the importance of a vertex as a mediator between available communication paths. BC value of a node is expressed as the fraction of the shortest paths passing through this node. In other words, given the context that information flow follows the shortest paths, a node with higher BC potentially has greater influence on the information flow in the network.

When authoring multimedia scenarios, and in particular scenarios with user interaction, where the sequence and time of occurrence of interactions is not predefined, it is difficult to guarantee the consistency of the resulting scenarios. As a consequence, the execution of the scenario may result in unexpected behavior or inconsistent use of media. The present paper proposes a methodology for checking the temporal integrity of interactive multimedia document (IMD) scenarios at authoring time at various levels. The IMD flow is mainly defined by the events occurring during the IMD session. Integrity checking consists of a set of discrete steps, during which we transform the scenario into temporal constraint networks representing the constraints linking the different possible events in the scenario. Temporal constraint verification techniques are applied to verify the integrity of the scenario \u2026",

We take a different approach and study ranking models for user intent. We exploit user feedback in terms of click data to cluster ranking models for historic queries according to user behavior and intent. Each cluster is finally represented by a single ranking model that captures the contained search interests expressed by users. Once new queries are issued, these are mapped to the clustering and the retrieval process diversifies possible intents by combining relevant ranking functions. Empirical evidence shows that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches on a large corporate query log.",

In this setting, we investigate the problem of maintaining hot motion paths, ie, routes frequently followed by multiple objects over the recent past. Motion paths approximate portions of objects' movement within a tolerance margin that depends on the uncertainty inherent in positional measurements. Discovery of hot motion paths is important to applications requiring classification/profiling based on monitored movement patterns, such as targeted advertising, resource allocation, etc. To achieve this goal, we delegate part of the path extraction process to objects, by assigning to them adaptive lightweight filters that dynamically suppress unnecessary location updates and, thus, help reducing the communication overhead. We demonstrate the benefits of our methods \u2026",

However, the rapid growth of scientific publications and digital expertise data makes identifying the right experts a challenging problem. Existing approaches for finding experts given a topic can be categorised into information retrieval techniques based on vector space models, document language models, and graph-based models. In this paper, we propose , a new ensemble model for expert finding, that integrates a novel -gram vector space model, denoted as VSM, and a graph-based model, denoted as $\\textit{$\\mu$CO-HITS}$, that is a proposed variation of the CO-HITS algorithm. The key of VSM is to exploit recent inverse document frequency weighting method for -gram words and  incorporates VSM into $\\textit{$\\mu$CO-HITS}$ to achieve expert finding. We comprehensively evaluate  on four different datasets from the academic domains in comparison with six different expert finding models. The evaluation results show that  is a highly effective model for expert finding, substantially outperforming all the compared models in 19% to 160.2%.",

Given a set of existing routes D R , a set of passenger transitions D T , and a query route Q, an RkNNT query returns all transitions that take Q as one of its k nearest travel routes. To solve the problem, we first develop an index to handle dynamic trajectory updates, so that the most up-to-date transition data are available for answering an RkNNT query.

Although several amnesic functions have been proposed for approximation of time series, we opt for a simple, yet quite efficient scheme that achieves contiguity along all retained stream pieces. To this end, we adapt an amnesic tree structure that effectively meets the requirements of time-decaying approximation while taking advantage of the succession inherent in positional updates.

The need for integrating multiple data sources with different tree structures has driven, recently, the suggestion of query languages that relax the complete specification of a tree pattern. In this paper we adopt a query language with partially specified tree-pattern queries. A central feature of this type of queries is that the structure can be specified fully, partially, or not at all in a query. Important issues in query optimization require solving the query containment problem. We study the containment problem for partially specified tree-pattern queries. To support the evaluation of such queries, we use semantically rich constructs, called dimension graphs, which abstract structural information of the tree-structured data. We address the problem of query \u2026",

As a large number of online applications use RS as a core component, improving the quality of RS becomes a critically important problem to businesses. Among existing solutions in RS, in particular, collaborative filtering (CF) methods (eg,[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7]) have been shown to be widely effective. Based on the past behavior of users such as explicit user ratings and implicit click logs, CF methods exploit the similarities between users\u2019 behavior patterns. However, when the fraction of known ratings in a rating matrix R is overly small (so-called data sparsity problem), CF methods tend to suffer. For an R with m users and n items, if we assume that each user has rated k items on average, the fraction of rated items in R is k n (= m\u0100k m\u0100n\u017d.

To compensate for missing knowledge, we first determine a set of uncertain preferences based on user profiles, i.e., information collected for previous contexts. Then, we define a probabilistic contextual skyline query (p-CSQ) that returns the tuples which are interesting with high probability. We emphasize that, unlike past work, uncertainty lies within the query and not the data, i.e., it is in the relationships among tuples rather than in their attribute values. Furthermore, due to the nature of this uncertainty, popular skyline methods, which rely on a particular tuple visit order, do not apply for p-CSQs.

Since it is a computationally expensive problem, greedy techniques that iteratively identify the most promising objects are typically used. We focus on the sub-task within one iteration and formalize it as the highest diversity gain problem. We show that it is possible to optimally solve such problems, by appropriately defining a novelty function and identifying the object with the highest novelty. Furthermore, we are able to determine parts of the search space than cannot contain promising objects. Based on these results, we propose a greedy diversification algorithm that iteratively invokes a procedure to determine the most novel object. This procedure uses an index to guide the search towards promising objects, and computes bounds to prune large parts \u2026",

Based on those requirements we then define a new conceptual model that intends to capture the static properties of the involved information. In its definition we use a minimal set of well-understood OLAP concepts like dimensions, levels, hierarchies, measures and cubes. The central concept of the model is the Multidimensional Aggregation Cube (MAC), which gives a broad and flexible definition to the notion of a multidimensional cube. We evaluate our model against other existing multidimensional models and show that MAC offers a unique combination of modeling skills. Our main contribution is the definition of the basic concepts of our model; although the set of requirements and the evaluation of all related models against those requirements represent an additional result.",

The majority of currently existing approaches focuses on centralized architectures, and deals with efficiency typically by pre-computing and storing the results of the semantic matcher for all possible query concepts.

On the other hand, this paper presents an efficient and scalable index-based method for Semantic Web service discovery that allows for fast selection of services at query time and is suitable for both centralized and P2P environments.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose and study the problem of top-m rank aggregation of spatial objects in streaming queries, where, given a set of objects O, a stream of spatial queries (kNN or range), the goal is to report m objects with the highest aggregate rank. The rank of an object w.r.t. an individual query is computed based on its distance from the query location, and the aggregate rank is computed from all of the individual rank orderings. Solutions to this fundamental problem can be used to monitor the popularity of spatial objects, which in turn can provide new analytical tools for spatial data. Our work draws inspiration from three different domains: rank aggregation, continuous queries and spatial databases. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work that considers all three problem domains in a single context. Our problem is different from the classical rank aggregation problem in the way that the rank of spatial objects are dependent on streaming queries whose locations are not known a priori, and is different from the problem of continuous spatial queries because new query locations can arrive in any region, but do not move. In order to solve this problem, we show how to upper and lower bound the rank of an object for any unseen query. Then we propose an approximation solution to continuously monitor the top-m objects efficiently, for which we design an Inverted Rank File (IRF) index to guarantee the error bound of the solution. In particular, we propose the notion of safe ranking to determine whether the current result is still valid or not when new queries arrive, and propose the notion of validation objects to limit the number of objects to \u2026",

The central processor maintains the changing distribution of current object headings around each focal point and may issue alerts once it observes many objects moving along a direction (e.g., increased northbound traffic near the stadium).

The rise of innovative transportation services and recent break-throughs in autonomous vehicles will lead to the continued growth of trajectory data and related applications. Supporting these services in emerging platforms will require more efficient query processing in trajectory databases. In this paper, we propose two new coverage queries for trajectory databases: (i) k Maximizing Reverse Range Search on Trajectories (kMaxRRST); and (ii) a Maximum k Coverage Range Search on Trajectories (MaxkCovRST). We propose a novel index structure, the Trajectory Quadtree (TQ-tree) that utilizes a quadtree to hierarchically organize trajectories into different quadtree nodes, and then applies a z-ordering to further organize the trajectories by spatial locality inside each node. This structure is highly effective in pruning the trajectory search space, which is of independent interest. By exploiting the TQ-tree data structure, we develop a divide-and-conquer approach to compute the trajectory \"service value\", and a best-first strategy to explore the trajectories using the appropriate upper bound on the service value to efficiently process a kMaxRRST query. Moreover, to solve the MaxkCovRST, which is a non-submodular NP-hard problem, we propose a greedy approximation which also exploits the TQ-tree. We evaluate our algorithms through an extensive experimental study on several real datasets, and demonstrate that our TQ-tree based algorithms outperform \u2026",

These multidimensional (MD) data structures are called data cubes. In the existing OLAP products, the user interaction is limited to one operation at a time. Further computing OLAP operations is very expensive since sequential scans are required. In this paper we provide a simple data model for MD databases, and a simple algebraic MD query language that permit the modeling of the principal OLAP operations. The MD query language allows the user to directly specify the result. Therefore, optimization techniques can be applied globally to the MD query evaluation. We state declarative conditions for answering queries on cubes using exclusively one or more \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Conventional DNN training paradigms typically rely on one training set and one validation set, obtained by partitioning an annotated dataset available for the purpose of training, namely gross training set, in a certain way. The training set is used for training the model while the validation set is used to estimate the generalization performance of the trained model as the training proceeds to avoid over-fitting. There exist two major issues in this training paradigm. Firstly, the validation set may hardly guarantee an unbiased estimate of the generalization performance due to potential mismatching with the test data. Secondly, training a DNN corresponds to solve a complex optimization problem, which is prone to getting trapped into inferior local optima and thus leads to the undesired training result. To address these issues, we propose a novel DNN training framework. It generates multiple pairs of training and validation sets from the gross training set via random splitting, trains a DNN model of a pre-specified network structure on each pair while making the useful knowledge (eg, promising network parameters) obtained from one model training process to be transferred to other model training processes via multi-task optimization (ie, a recently emerging optimization paradigm), and outputs the best one, among all trained models, which has the overall best performance across the validation sets from all pairs. The knowledge transfer mechanism featured in this new framework can not only enhance training effectiveness by helping the model training process to escape from local optima but also improve on generalization performance via implicit \u2026",

Another body of literature focuses on developing languages for querying Tweets. This paper addresses issues around the big data nature of Twitter and emphasizes the need for new data management and query language frameworks that address limitations of existing systems. We review existing approaches that were developed to facilitate twitter analytics followed by a discussion on research issues and technical challenges in developing integrated solutions.",

Thus, in our proposed framework, we define comment-specific diversification criteria in order to extract the respective diversification dimensions in the form of feature vectors. These criteria involve content similarity, sentiment expressed within comments, named entities, quality of comments and combinations of them. Then, we apply diversification on comments, utilizing the extracted features vectors. The outcome of this process is a subset of the initial set that contains heterogeneous comments, representing different aspects of the news article, different sentiments expressed, different writing quality, etc. We \u2026",

They are used to enrich semantically the available information. Up to now, hierarchical schemas have been treated rather as sets of individual elements, acting as semantic guides for browsing or querying data. Under that view, queries like \u201cfind the part of a portal catalog which is not present in another catalog\u201d can be answered only in a procedural way, specifying which nodes to select and how to get them.

However, the requirement of the shortest paths being completely vertex or edge disjoint might be too restrictive and demands much more resources in a network. Partially disjoint shortest paths, in which a bounded number of shared vertices or edges is allowed, balance between degree of disjointness and occupied network resources. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding k shortest paths which are edge disjoint but partially vertex disjoint. For a pair of distinct vertices in a network graph, the problem aims to optimally find k edge disjoint shortest paths among which at most a bounded number of vertices are shared by at least two paths. In particular, we present novel techniques for exactly solving the problem with a runtime that significantly improves the current best result. The proposed algorithm is also validated by computer experiments on both synthetic and real networks which demonstrate its superior efficiency of up to three orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.",

The second has a quantitative aspect and computes, also in linear time, the cardinal direction relations with percentages between the input regions. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methodologies. The algorithms have been implemented and embedded in an actual system \u2026",

Existing algorithms for this operation focus almost exclusively on path patterns or tree patterns. Current applications of XML require querying of data whose structure is complex or is not fully known to the user, or integrating XML data sources with different structures. These applications have motivated recently the introduction of query languages that allow a partial specification of path patterns in a query. In this paper, we consider partial path queries, a generalization of path pattern queries, and we focus on their efficient evaluation under the indexed streaming evaluation model. Our approach explicitly deals with repeated labels (that is, multiple occurrences of the same label in a query). We show that partial path queries can be represented as rooted dags for which a topological ordering of the nodes exists \u2026",

Clustering multiple data streams is challenging as the requirement of clustering at anytime becomes more critical. We aim to cluster multiple data streams concurrently and in this paper we report our work in progress. ClusTree is an anytime clustering algorithm for a single stream. It uses a hierarchical tree structure to index micro-clusters, which are summary statistics for streaming data objects. We design a dynamic, concurrent indexing tree structure that extends the ClusTree structure to achieve more granular micro clusters (summaries) of multiple streams at any time. We devised algorithms to search, expand and update the hierarchical tree structure of storing micro clusters concurrently, along with an algorithm for anytime concurrent clustering of multiple streams. As this is work in progress, we plan to test our proposed algorithms, on sensor data sets, and evaluate the space and time complexity of creating and accessing micro-clusters. We will also evaluate the quality of clustering in terms of number of created clusters and compare our technique with other approaches.",

Based on the model we implemented an authoring methodology. Thereafter we present a generic framework for rendering (presenting) IMDs putting emphasis to the handling of interaction and to the temporal synchronization of media objects. The rendering system is implemented as a client-server architecture using Java and accompanying technologies. The implementation is suitable for WWW enabled interactive multimedia documents.",

Unfortunately, these models have not been benchmarked on common datasets using standard metrics.

The CUBE File achieves hierarchical clustering of the data, enabling fast access via hierarchical restrictions. Moreover, it imposes a low storage cost and adapts perfectly to the extensive sparseness of the data space achieving a high compression rate. Our results show that the CUBE File outperforms the most effective method proposed up to now for hierarchically clustering the cube, resulting in 7-9 times less I/Os on average for all workloads tested. Thus, it achieves a higher degree of hierarchical clustering. Moreover, the CUBE File imposes a 2-3 times lower storage cost.",

However, little or no attention is given to combining these partial results to compile the final list of candidate services. Instead, this is often done in an ad hoc manner, implying a priori assumptions regarding the user's preferences. In this paper, we focus on identifying the best candidate semantic Web services given the description of a requested service. We model the problem as a skyline query, also known as the maximum vector problem, and we show how the service selection process can be performed efficiently. We consider different aspects of the service selection process, addressing both the requesters' and the providers' points of view \u2026",

Usually, these structural patterns are in the form of trees (Tree-Pattern Queries-TPQs). Finding the occurrences of such patterns in an XML tree is a key operation in XML query evaluation. The multiple previous algorithms presented for this operation focus mainly on the evaluation of tree-pattern queries. Recently, requirements for flexible querying of XML data have motivated the consideration of query classes that are more expressive and flexible than TPQs for which efficient nonmain-memory evaluation algorithms are not known. In this paper, we consider a class of queries, called Partial Tree-Pattern Queries (PTPQs), which generalize and strictly contain TPQs. PTPQs represent a broad fragment of XPath which is very useful in practice. In order to process PTPQs, we introduce a set of sound and complete inference rules to \u2026",

Web sites have already started providing services such as preferences for the interface, the layout and the functionality of the applications. Personalization services have also been introduced in Web search and metasearch engines, ie tools that retrieve Web pages relevant to keywords given by the users. However, those services deal mostly with the presentation style and ignore issues like the retrieval model, the ranking algorithm and topic preferences. In this paper, we present Captain Nemo, a fully-functionable metasearch engine that exploits personal user search spaces. Users can define their personal retrieval model and presentation style. They can also define topics of interest. Captain Nemo exploits several popular Web search engines to retrieve Web pages relevant to keywords given by the users. The resulting pages are presented according to the defined presentation style and retrieval model. For every page, Captain Nemo can recommend a relevant topic of interest to classify the page, exploiting nearest-neighbour classification techniques.",

Given two nodes s and t in a graph, we want to find a path from s to t. To this end, we propose a novel representation of a graph as a set of paths that preserve the reachability information and introduce P-Index to index and provide efficient access in this representation. Then, we extend the depth-first search algorithm to work with the paths of the representation, instead of the graph edges, for evaluating \u201cfind a path\u201d reachability queries. Finally, we conduct a preliminary set of experiments that indicate the advantage of exploiting a set of paths for efficiently answering \u201cfind a path\u201d reachability queries instead of using the edges of the graph.",

This paper presents a framework for clustering XML documents by structure. Modeling the XML documents as rooted ordered labeled trees, we study the usage of structural distance metrics in hierarchical clustering algorithms to detect groups of structurally similar XML documents. We suggest the usage of structural summaries for trees to improve the performance of the distance calculation and at the same time to maintain or even improve its quality.

The task is to select a set of participants such that the total weight of the monitored POIs is maximized. However, in real applications, users should have the flexibility to offer several preferred routes. This arises our studied maximum sweep assignment problem with flexibility, where each participant proposes several routes, and the new task is to strategically assign each participant a route among their choices in which the way maximizes the total weight of the monitored POIs.

In many real data sets the existence of large spikes in the data values results in many large coefficient values lying on paths of a conceptual tree structure known as the error tree. To exploit this fact, we introduce in this paper a novel compression scheme for wavelet synopses, termed hierarchically compressed wavelet synopses, that fully exploits hierarchical relationships among coefficients in order to reduce their storage.

In reality, it is rarely the case that such complete sets of mappings exist between sources, and the presence of partial mappings is the norm rather than the exception. So, practically, existing query answering algorithms fail to generate any rewriting in the majority of cases. The question is then whether we can somehow relax queries that cannot be rewritten as such (due to insufficient mappings), and whether we can identify the interesting query relaxations, given the mappings at hand.",

Up to now, portal catalogs have not been treated as full-fledged objects so as to allow for their manipulation. A major challenge is thus to complement catalog search and browsing with operations that manipulate structural information from similar vertical portal catalog sites, that is sites of a specific subject or domain.This work proposes models and operators that allow for structural manipulation of vertical portal catalog sites, considering them as first-class citizens in the information search space. First, we explore the algebraic properties of trees representing hierarchies of portal catalogs, and define a lattice algebraic structure on them. Then, turning this structure into a boolean algebra, we present the operators S-union, S-intersection and S-difference to support structural manipulation of such trees. These operators have certain algebraic properties to provide clear semantics and assist the transformation, simplification and optimization of sequences of operations, using laws similar to those of set theory. Finally, we identify the conditions under which this framework is applicable.",

Special characteristics of OLAP cubes such as multidimensionality, hierarchical structure of dimensions, data sparseness, etc., are difficult to handle with ordinary record-oriented storage managers. The SISYPHUS storage manager is based on a chunk-based data model that enables the hierarchical clustering of data with a very low storage cost. Moreover, it provides an access interface that is \u201chierarchy aware\u201d and thus native to the OLAP data space. This interface can be used to implement efficient access paths to cube data.",

Much of the interest and success in this area can be attributed to the need for software and tools to improve data management and analysis given the large amounts of information that are being accumulated in corporate as well as scientific databases. Meanwhile, industry has adopted these established technologies and developed many of them to commercial maturity. However, despite the continued success and maturing of the field, much research remains to be done across many different areas of data warehousing. In particular, the following challenges and new requirements need to be addressed. First, as more and more information is managed and stored electronically, data warehouses continue to increase in size at a staggering rate. Second, data warehousing applications require improved, standardized, and secure conceptual modeling techniques as well as novel approaches to dealing with data quality issues. Third, and closely related to the previous point, the data that needs to be stored in the warehouse is getting more and more complex in both structure and semantics while the analysis must keep up with the demands of new applications. For example, real-time data warehousing, analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data, OLAP mining, mobile OLAP, and more recently applications in the sciences are demanding novel representation and manipulation techniques for non-standard data, efficient algorithms to compute aggregate queries \u2026",

We introduce two path query evaluation paradigms that enjoy the benefits of search algorithms (i.e., fast index maintenance) while utilizing transitivity information to terminate the search sooner. Efficient indexing schemes and appropriate updating procedures are introduced.

The dynamic skyline query can be treated as a standard skyline query, subject to the transformation of all tuples\u2019 values. In this work, we make the observation that results to past dynamic skyline queries can help reduce the computation cost for future queries. To this end, we propose a caching mechanism for dynamic skyline queries and devise a cache-aware algorithm. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of this mechanism compared to standard techniques without caching.",

This interest stems from a real need for data management support for what are called\" advanced application areas\" that are not well-served by relational technology. The case for object-oriented technology has been made on three fronts. First is the data modeling requirements of the new applications. Some of the more important shortcomings of the relational systems in meeting the requirements of these applications include: 1. Relational systems deal with a single object type: a relation. A relation is used to model different real-world objects, but the semantics of this association is not part of the database. Furthermore, the attributes of a relation may come only from simple and fixed data type domains (numeric, character, and, sometimes, date types). Advanced applications require explicit storage and manipulation of more abstract types (eg, images, design documents) and the ability for the users to define their own application-specific types. Therefore, a rich type system supporting user defined abstract types is required. 2. The relational model structures data in a relatively simple and flat manner. Non traditional applications require more complex object structures with nested objects (eg, a vehicle object containing an engine object).",

In this work, we introduce an important class of such problems, the approximate regional sequence matching (ARSM) problem. Given a data and a pattern sequence, an ARSM result is an approximate occurrence of a region of the pattern in the data sequence under two conditions. First, the region must contain a predetermined area of the pattern sequence, termed core. Second, the allowable deviation between the region of the pattern and its occurrence in the data sequence depends on the length of the region. We propose the PS-ARSM method that processes holistically the regions of a pattern, taking advantage of their overlaps to efficiently identify the ARSM results. Its performance is evaluated with respect to existing techniques adapted to the ARSM problem.",

Telecom companies are dealing with terabytes to petabytes of data on a daily basis. IoT applications in telecom are further contributing to this data deluge. Recent advances in BDA have exposed new opportunities to get actionable insights from telecom big data. These benefits and the fast-changing BDA technology landscape make it important to investigate existing BDA applications to telecom sector. For this, we initially determine published research on BDA applications to telecom through a systematic literature review through which we filter 38 articles and categorize them in frameworks, use cases, literature reviews, white papers and experimental validations. We also discuss the benefits and challenges mentioned in these articles. We find \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Conventional DNN training paradigms typically rely on one training set and one validation set, obtained by partitioning an annotated dataset available for the purpose of training, namely gross training set, in a certain way. The training set is used for training the model while the validation set is used to estimate the generalization performance of the trained model as the training proceeds to avoid over-fitting. There exist two major issues in this training paradigm. Firstly, the validation set may hardly guarantee an unbiased estimate of the generalization performance due to potential mismatching with the test data. Secondly, training a DNN corresponds to solve a complex optimization problem, which is prone to getting trapped into inferior local optima and thus leads to the undesired training result. To address these issues, we propose a novel DNN training framework. It generates multiple pairs of training and validation \u2026",

For multimedia watermarks, invisibility is defined in human terms (that is, in terms of human sensory limitations). In this paper, we review recent developments in the non-media applications of data watermarking, which have emerged over the last decade as an exciting new sub-domain. Since by definition, the intended receiver should be able to detect the watermark, we have to redefine invisibility in an acceptable way that is often application-specific and thus cannot be easily generalized. In particular, this is true when the data is not intended to be directly consumed by humans. For example, a loose definition of robustness might be in terms of the resilience of a watermark against normal host data operations, and of invisibility as resilience of the \u2026",

In this work, we present a method that overcomes this issue by exploiting all search results, both rated and unrated, in order to train a ranking function. Given a small initial set of user feedback for some search results, we first perform clustering on all results returned by the search. Based on the clusters created, we extend the initial set of rated results, including new, unrated results. Then, we use a popular training method (Ranking SVM) to train a ranking function using the expanded set of results.

            "Abstract": "In adaptive query processing, query plans are improved at runtime by means of feedback. In the very flexible approach based on so-called eddies, query execution is treated as a process of routing tuples to the query operators that combine to compute a query. This makes it possible to alter query plans at the granularity of tuples. Further, the complex task of searching the query plan space for a suitable plan now resides in the routing policies used. These policies must adapt to the changing execution environment and must converge at a near-optimal plan when the environment stabilizes. This paper advances adaptive query processing in two respects. First, it proposes a general framework for the routing problem that may serve the same role for adaptive query processing as does the framework of search in query plan space for conventional query processing. It thus offers an improved foundation for research in adaptive query processing. The framework leverages reinforcement learning theory and formalizes a tuple routing policy as a mapping from a state space to an action space, capturing query semantics as well as routing constraints. In effect, the framework transforms query optimization from a search problem in query plan space to an unsupervised learning problem with quantitative rewards that is tightly coupled with the query execution. The framework covers selection queries as well as joins that use all proposed join execution mechanisms (SHJs, SteMs, STAIRs). Second, in addition to showing how existing routing policies can fit into the framework, the paper demonstrates new routing policies that build on advances in reinforcement \u2026",

Discovering informative patterns in large tree datasets is an important research area that has many practical applications. Along the years, research has evolved from mining induced patterns to mining embedded patterns. Embedded patterns allow for discovering useful relationships hidden deeply in the datasets which cannot be captured by induced patterns. Unfortunately, previous embedded tree pattern mining approaches cannot scale satisfactorily when the size of the dataset increases. As a consequence, they focus almost exclusively on mining patterns from a collection of small trees and they are incapable of mining patterns from large data trees. However, given the ubiquitous use of tree data, this pattern mining problem needs efficient solutions.In this paper, we address \u2026",

This demonstration presents GrouPeer, a system that overcomes the query degradation problem and enables the dynamic clustering of the overlay according to the semantics of the peer data, utilizing normal query traffic.

During each merging, a system of linear equations is solved to define new edge weights in a way that the new weights have the least effect on the distances. Merging nodes continues until the desired size for the compressed graph is reached. The compressed graph, also known as the coarse graph, can be queried without decompression. As the complexity of distance-based queries such as shortest path queries is highly dependent on the size of the graph, Shrink improves the performance in terms of time and storage.

            "Abstract": "Accurate house prediction is of great significance to various real estate stakeholders such as house owners, buyers, investors, and agents. We propose a location-centered prediction framework that differs from existing work in terms of data profiling and prediction model. Regarding data profiling, we define and capture a fine-grained location profile powered by a diverse range of location data sources, such as transportation profile (e.g., distance to nearest train station), education profile (e.g., school zones and ranking), suburb profile based on census data, facility profile (e.g., nearby hospitals, supermarkets). Regarding the choice of prediction model, we observe that a variety of approaches either consider the entire house data for modeling, or split the entire data and model each partition independently. However, such modeling ignores the relatedness between partitions, and for all prediction scenarios, there may not be sufficient training samples per partition for the latter approach. We address this problem by conducting a careful study of exploiting the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model. Specifically, we map the strategies for splitting the entire house data to the ways the tasks are defined in MTL, and each partition obtained is aligned with a task. Furthermore, we select specific MTL-based methods with different regularization terms to capture and exploit the relatedness between tasks. Based on real-world house transaction data collected in Melbourne, Australia. We design extensive experimental evaluations, and the results indicate a significant superiority of MTL-based methods over state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, we conduct an in \u2026",

The congestion scenario is often represented by a set of distinguishable network partitions that have a homogeneous level of congestion inside them but are heterogeneous to others. Due to the dynamic nature of traffic, these partitions evolve with time in terms of their structure and location. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to capture the evolution by incrementally updating the partitions in an efficient manner using a two-layer approach.

            "Abstract": "In digital repositories, it is crucial to refine existing subject terms and exploit a taxonomy with subject terms, in order to promote information retrieval tasks such as indexing, cataloging and searching of digital documents. In this paper, we address how to refine an existing set of subject terms, often containing irrelevant ones or creating noise, that are used to index digital documents. Further, we present how to automatically induce a subject term taxonomy to capture and utilise the semantic relations among subject terms. Most related works have little studied these problems, focusing mostly on creating subject terms or building a taxonomy of key terms from text documents. We propose a methodology2 for refining an existing set of subject terms in a digital repository by identifying their semantics, as well as inducing a taxonomy with subject terms by analysing their mutual usages, maximising their semantic relatedness \u2026",

Latent factor models produce rather accurate predictions of user preferences, but the latency of the features extracted make it difficult to substantiate a recommendation to a user. The realisation that many aspects tend to exist in rating and social connections data, such as social influence or bias, led to the development of a component-based matrix factorisation approach in earlier work. The ability to quantify the contributions of a component to a recommendation opens up possibilities to identify reasons for recommendations which can be presented to the consumer receiving them. Reviews that accompany rating data can be analysed and correlated with latent factors to provide more detailed reasons for recommendations. This paper introduces a general \u2026",

The global distribution, high complexity, and physical separation pose new challenges into the quality assurance of such complex services. One major challenge is that they are intricately connected with the spatial and temporal characteristics of the domains they support. In this paper, we present our visions on the integration of spatial and temporal logic into the system design and quality maintenance of the complex services in the cloud. We suggest that new paradigms should be proposed for designing software architecture that will particularly embed the spatial and temporal properties of the cloud services, and new testing methodologies should be developed based on architecture including spatio-temporal aspects. We also discuss several potential directions in the relevant research.",

In this paper, we argue that novel window types, other than strictly temporal, can also prove adequate in providing finite portions of multidimensional streams. We systematically examine the particular case of spatiotemporal streams generated from moving point objects and we introduce a comprehensive classification of window variants useful in expressing the most common operations, such as range or nearest- neighbor search. Our investigation also demonstrates that composite windows, combining temporal and spatial properties, can effectively capture the evolving characteristics of \u2026",

Continuous queries expressed in these languages usually employ windowing constructs in order to extract finite portions of the potentially unbounded stream. Explicitly or not, window specifications rely on ordering. Usually, timestamps are attached to all tuples flowing into the system as a means to provide ordered access to data items. Several window types have been implemented in stream prototype systems, but a precise definition of their semantics is still lacking. In this paper, we describe a formal framework for expressing windows in continuous queries over data streams. After classifying windows according to their basic characteristics, we give algebraic expressions for the most significant window types commonly appearing in applications.

User interests are however widely spread, subject to change, and cannot always be captured well, thus rendering the deployment of personalized models challenging. In this doctoral work, we describe our approach where we study ranking models from the aspect of search intent. Our approach is query-centric. That is, it does not rely on separate user search profiles/histories nor it personalizes ranking based on topical similarity of queries. Contrary, it examines the search behaviors/intents induced by queries and groups together queries with similar such behaviors, forming search behavior clusters. Specifically, we exploit user feedback in terms of click data to cluster the queries. Each cluster is finally represented by a single ranking model that captures the contained intents expressed by users. Once new queries are issued, these are mapped to the clustering and the retrieval process diversifies possible intents by combining relevant ranking functions.",

In order to solve this problem, we show how to upper and lower bound the rank of an object for any unseen query. Then we propose an approximation solution to continuously monitor the top-m objects efficiently, for which we design an Inverted Rank File (IRF) index to guarantee the error bound of the solution. In particular, we propose the notion of safe ranking to determine whether the current result is still valid or not when new queries arrive, and propose the notion of \u2026",

The journey of the student is analogous to that of a vehicle trajectory, in which a student is similar to a vehicle which passes through different units/subjects instead of different geographical locations to reach a certain graduate outcome (destination). The trajectory concept provides a model to capture and represent a large amount of data collected by universities in a meaningful way.

Detecting anomalies in such data streams in real-time is an important and challenging task. It is able to provide valuable information from data and then assists decision-making. However, exiting approaches for anomaly detection in multi-dimensional data streams have not properly considered the correlations among multiple multi-dimensional streams. Moreover, for multi-dimensional streaming data, online detection speed is often an important concern. In this paper, we propose a fast yet effective anomaly detection approach in multiple multi-dimensional data streams. This is based on a combination of ideas, i.e., stream pre-processing, locality sensitive hashing and dynamic isolation forest. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves a magnitude \u2026",

Also, this information can help to improve our understanding on how new topics have emerged or formed through a sequential or interrelated events of emergence, modification and integration of prior topics. Nevertheless, the implementation of the existing methods for topic trajectory identification is rarely available as usable software. In this paper, we present TopicTracker, a platform for topic trajectory identification and visualisation. The key of Topic Tracker is that it can represent the three facets of information together, given two kinds of input: a time-stamped topic profile consisting of the set of the underlying topics over time, and the evolution strength matrix among them: evolutionary pathways of dynamic topics, evolution states of the topics, and topic importance. TopicTracker is a publicly available software implemented using the R software.",

MIDAS requires that peers maintain little network information, and features mechanisms that support fault tolerance and load balancing. The proposed algorithms process point and range queries over the multidimensional indexed space in only O(log n) hops in expectance, where n is the network size. For nearest neighbor queries, two processing alternatives are discussed. The first, termed eager processing, has low latency (expected value of O(log n) hops) but may involve a large number of peers.

In order to overcome these drawbacks we present DOMProxy (dynamic objects manager proxy), a new proxy architecture that enables front-end Web caching for dynamically generated Web pages. Instead of caching Web pages produced dynamically or their fragments, the proposed architecture provides methods for \"caching\" their generation process. This is achieved by caching both the applications and the back-end data content that are used to create dynamic Web pages.

Existing studies limit to either finding the best group of a fixed size for a single meeting location, or a single group of a fixed size w.r.t. multiple locations. However, it is highly desirable to consider multiple locations in a real-life scenario in order to organize impromptu activities of groups of various sizes. In this paper, we propose Top k Flexible Socio Spatial Group Query (Top k-FSSGQ) to find the top k groups w.r.t. multiple POIs where each group follows the minimum social connectivity constraints. We devise a ranking function to measure the group score by combining social closeness, spatial distance, and group size, which provides the flexibility of choosing groups of different sizes under different constraints. To effectively process the Top k-FSSGQ, we first develop an Exact approach that ensures early termination of the search based on the derived upper bounds. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, hence we first present a heuristic based approximation algorithm to effectively select members in intermediate solution groups based on the social connectivity of the users. Later we design a Fast Approximate approach based on the relaxed social and spatial bounds, and connectivity constraint heuristic. Experimental studies have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches on real datasets.",

Thus, we model spatial relationships of objects at a higher level of abstraction than simple co-ordinate system transformations. We also define the behavior of objects in a declarative way, by means of Event-Condition-Action rules. Events and Actions can be synthesized by a set of operators for the creation of really complex behavior.

The need for querying tree-structured data sources when their structure is not fully known, and the need to integrate multiple data sources with different tree structures have driven, recently, the suggestion of query languages that relax the complete specification of a tree pattern. In this paper, we consider a query language that allows the partial specification of a tree pattern. Queries in this language range from structureless keyword-based queries to completely specified tree patterns. To support the evaluation of partially specified queries, we use semantically rich constructs, called dimension graphs, which abstract structural information of the tree-structured data.

These methods aim at grouping users\u2019 clickthrough data (queries, results lists, clicked results), based either on content or on specific features that characterize the matching between queries and results and that capture implicit user search behaviors. After obtaining clusters of similar clickthrough data, we train multiple ranking functions (using Ranking SVM model), one for each cluster. Finally, when a new query is posed, we combine ranking functions that correspond to clusters similar to the query, in order to rerank/personalize its results. We also present how to support personalization in data management systems by providing users with mechanisms for specifying their preferences. In the past, a number of methods have been proposed for ranking tuples according to userspecified preferences. These methods include for example top-k, skyline, top-k dominating queries etc. However, neither of these methods has attempted to push preference evaluation inside the core of a database management system (DBMS). Instead, all ranking algorithms or special indexes are offered on top of a DBMS, hence they are not able to exploit any optimization provided by the query optimizer. In this talk we present a framework for supporting user preference as a fist-class construct inside a DBMS, by extending relational algebra with preference operators and by appropriately modifying query plans based on these preferences.",

For example, data entry or query forms are used by hundreds of users updating or querying information and complex workflows that operate in the enterprise frequently pose queries to the database. What happens if we delete a popular attribute from a relation in the database? Typically, all applications accessing this attribute will crash. Take for example, the case in Figure 1, where we use an Architecture-graph-like sketch representation of two relations (WORKS and EMP) and a query Q1. Observe the attribute EMP. Emp#, which is the Primary Key (PK) of relation EMP. Its role is such that it participates as (1) a grouper in the group-by query Q1,(2) a part of join condition between relations EMP and WORKS,(3) a part of the result of Q1, while, at the same time,(4) it is also part of a foreign key in the database. Clearly, the impact of deleting this attribute is significantly higher for the structure of the database and its surrounding applications, than, eg, attribute WORKS. Hours. At the same, if for some reason we would like to alter the primary key of relation EMP, this would incur even higher reconstruction costs of the database (both due to the presence of query Q1 and the foreign key among relations WORKS and EMP).",

Moreover, the interpretation and suitability of data may depend on changing conditions, eg the current position of the user or the media he is using (laptop, mobile, PDA, etc.). To cater for such ambiguous situations the information provider needs to specify the context under which information becomes relevant. Conversely, information users can specify their own current context when requesting for data in order to denote the part that is relevant to their specific situation.Task 2.9 aims to investigate how support for context-dependent data can be integrated into Digital Libraries. The goal is to use context as an abstraction mechanism that will allow Digital Libraries to provide users with information relevant to their situation, background, and preferences. The direction is twofold:(a) incorporate context as first class citizen into data management systems, and (b) use context to enhance the support for personalized access to Digital Libraries.",

The aggregator could be the sink node in a sensor network where all the sensory data are gathered, or a smart-meter responsible for computing power measurements of a group of households, or any other entity that is basically in charge of answering aggregation queries such as average or summation in a data streaming environment. In these applications, important decisions are made based on the aggregated results and therefore, it is vitally important to investigate the authenticity and integrity of aggregated values. One possible approach for solving this problem is marking the data before sending it out to the aggregators (i.e. marked at the point of origin) such that the existence of those marks could be verified subsequently after the aggregation process. Our goal is to produce hidden marks that remain detectable after \u2026",

Graph data, particularly the ones generated from social networks generally has text associated to the graph. Although graph systems provide support for efficient graph-based queries, there have not been comprehensive studies on how other dimensions, such as text, stored within a graph can work well together with graph traversals. In this paper we focus on a query that can process graph traversal and text search in combination in a graph database system and rank users measured as a combination of their social distance and the relevance of the text description to the query keyword. Our proposed algorithm leverages graph partitioning techniques to speed-up query processing along both dimensions. We conduct experiments on real-world large graph datasets and show \u2026",

In this paper, we present VisCrimePredict, a system that uses visual and predictive analytics to map out crimes that occurred in a region/neighbourhood. VisCrimePredict is underpinned by a novel algorithm that creates trajectories from heterogeneous data sources such as open data and social media with the aim to report incidents of crime.

We are interested in routing queries about spatial data in such overlays, solely by exploiting local knowledge on sites, ie based on locality and directionality in space. For such a system, we explore the parameters that can make search for any spatial information realizable and efficient. In this work we focus on the management of grid-partitioned space. In such a system there is a necessity for a mechanism that provides even knowledge of space to each site of the overlay.

            "Abstract": "Geographic Information Systems are computer-based systems designed to support the capture, management, manipulation, analysis, modelling and display of spatially referenced data at different points in time (Aronoff, 1989). Today, GIS are widely used in many government, business and private activities, which fall into three major categories (Maguire et al., 1991):1. socio-economic applications (for example, urban and regional planning, cadastral registration, archaeology, natural resources management, market analysis, etc.); 2. environmental applications (for example, forestry, fire and epidemic control, etc.); 3. management applications (for example, organization of pipeline networks and other services, such as electricity and telephone, real-time navigation for vessels, planes and cars, etc.). The role of GIS in these applications is to provide the users and decision-makers with effective tools for solving the complex and usually ill-or semistructured spatial problems (Hopkins, 1984), while providing an adequate level of performance.GIS are enormously complicated software systems. A GIS is supported by an operating system, and depends on the presence of a graphic package for input and output, routines supplied by the programming language in which the GIS is written, and numerous other software products (Goodchild, 1991). Many of the more powerful contemporary GIS are designed to rely on a Database Management System (DBMS), relieving developers of many of the common data housekeeping functions. However, traditional DBMSs have only dealt with alphanumeric domains and have proved not to be suitable for non-standard \u2026",

Their study exists for more than twenty years. Lately, is triggered even more by the progress achieved in the power of computers which permits them to accommodate graphics and easily perform geometrical calculations. Spatial databases form an autonomous, active research community and a series of International Conferences are regularly organised (series of Symposium on Spatial Databases and Symposium on Spatial Data Handling). A number of Journals concern with spatial Databases as well (Cartographica, International Journal of Geographic Information Systems). The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA, USA) is an established body coordinating research in Spatial Databases and their beneficial application in geography. OpenGIS is an International Consortium trying to bring Interoperability into Geographic Information Systems.Temporal databases incorporate the concept of time to create high-level abstractions useful in database applications. This has been an active area of research for about twenty years. In the last few years the importance of the temporal database area has been recognised by the international scientific community. This recognition came in part in the form of the ARPA/NSF sponsored International Workshop on Temporal Database Infrastructure in 1993, a VLDB-affiliated temporal workshop in 1995, a special section of the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering on temporal and real \u2026",

Important ones, consider producing all the possible mappings for a pair of schemas, insinuating any accompanying semantics in the mappings and adapting correct mappings as schemas evolve.

In crowdsensing, mobile sensors (humans, vehicle-mounted sensors, etc.) generate streams of information that is used for inferring high-level phenomena of interest (e.g, traffic jams, air pollution). Unlike traditional sensor network data, crowdsensed data has a highly skewed spatio-temporal distribution caused largely due to the mobility of sensors [1]. Thus, designing systems that can mitigate this effect by acquiring crowdsensed at a fixed spatio-temporal rate are needed.

DIANA-microT 3.0 is an algorithm for microRNA target prediction which is based on several parameters calculated individually for each microRNA and combines conserved and non-conserved microRNA recognition elements into a final prediction score, which correlates with protein production fold change. Specifically, for each predicted interaction the program reports a signal to noise ratio and a precision score \u2026",

Existing service matchmakers typically determine the relevance between a web service advertisement and a service request by computing an overall score that aggregates individual matching scores among the various parameters in their descriptions. Two main drawbacks characterize such approaches. First, there is no single matching criterion that is optimal for determining the similarity between parameters. Instead, there are numerous approaches ranging from Information Retrieval similarity measures up to semantic logic-based inference rules. Second, the reduction of individual scores to an overall similarity leads to significant \u2026",

The rise of innovative transportation services and recent break-throughs in autonomous vehicles will lead to the continued growth of trajectory data and related applications. Supporting these services in emerging platforms will require more efficient query processing in trajectory databases. In this paper, we propose two new coverage queries for trajectory databases:(i) k Maximizing Reverse Range Search on Trajectories (kMaxRRST); and (ii) a Maximum k Coverage Range Search on Trajectories (MaxkCovRST). We propose a novel index structure, the Trajectory Quadtree (TQ-tree) that utilizes a quadtree to hierarchically organize trajectories into different quadtree nodes, and then applies a z-ordering to further organize the \u2026",

With the increased popularity of CS and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) courses, the ability to measure the similarity/distance between units can aid the decision-making process of education providers during learning path recommendations, evaluating unit exemptions/advanced standings, etc. The ability to quantitatively measure the similarity of two units will assist decision-making processes which are otherwise likely to be tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, we explore how to quantitatively measure the similarity/distance between two CS/ICT units, in an Australian setting. In this study, we utilize data from multiple CS/ICT courses offered by two Australian education providers.

In this work, we present a related query for spatial-textual databases that finds an optimal location, and a set of keywords that maximizes the size of bichromatic reverse spatial textual k nearest neighbors (MaxBRSTkNN). Such a query has many practical applications including social media advertisements where a limited number of relevant advertisements are displayed to each user. The problem is to find the location and the text contents to include in an advertisement so that it will be displayed to the maximum number of users. The increasing availability of spatial-textual collections allows us to answer these queries for both spatial proximity and textual similarity. This paper is the first to consider the MaxBRSTkNN query. We show that the problem is NP-hard and present both \u2026",

Instead of building a specialized spatiotemporal database, we have chosen to retain geographic information in a renowned stream processing engine with native support for spatial features. Through a graphical interface, users are able to specify typical continuous queries (such as range, distance, or nearest neighbor search), and receive incremental results. Moreover, this application offers capabilities for visual display of objects' trajectories and online collection of movement statistics.",

            "Abstract": "In the dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT), a set of transportation requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles. We use two cost metrics that capture both the company\u2019s and the customer\u2019s viewpoints regarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems, the rule of thumb is to apply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solution based on a graph-based formulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly, in this conceptual graph, the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to that of the delivery location. However, we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-like algorithms cannot be applied. Still, our method is able to find dPDPT solutions significantly faster than a conventional two-phase \u2026",

The definition of link statements between distinct resources plays a key role to interconnect several life science repositories.

We consider two versions of the Agrovoc RDF repository to calculate different types of change operations and associate them to link change actions. Obtained results indicate the existence of the cases investigated in this study. We demonstrate that RDF changes impact the evolution of established links.",

Requirements for flexible querying of XML data including XML data from scientific applications have motivated recently the introduction of query languages that are more general and flexible than TPQs. These query languages correspond to a fragment of XPath larger than TPQs for which efficient non-main-memory evaluation algorithms are not known.In this paper, we consider a query language, called Partial Tree-Pattern Query (PTPQ) language, which generalizes and strictly contains TPQs. PTPQs represent a broad fragment of XPath which is very useful in practice. We show how PTPQs can be represented as directed acyclic graphs augmented with \u201csame-path\u201d constraints.

            "Abstract": "The purpose of data visualization is to offer intuitive ways for information perception and manipulation, especially for non-expert users. Most traditional visualization tools and methods operate on an offline way, limited on accessing static (preprocessed) sets of data. They also restrict themselves on dealing with small dataset sizes, which can be easily visually analysed with conventional visualization techniques. However, the Web of Data has realized the availability of a great amount and variety of big datasets that are dynamic in nature; most of them offer query or API endpoints for online access and analysis. Modern visualization techniques must address the challenge of on-the-fly visualizations over large dynamic sets of data, offering efficient exploration techniques, as well as mechanisms for information abstraction and summarization. Moreover, they must take into account different user-defined exploration scenarios and user\u2019s preferences. In this work, we present a generic model for personalized multilevel exploration and analysis over large dynamic sets of numeric and temporal data. Our model is built on top of a lightweight tree-based structure which can be efficiently constructed on-the-fly for a given set of data. This tree structure aggregates input objects into a hierarchical multiscale model. We define two versions of this structure, which adopts different data organization approaches, well-suited to exploration and analysis context. In the proposed structure, statistical computations can be efficiently performed on-the-fly.

More specifically, if a given trajectory is allowed to start and finish at the same region, 6 base relations are defined (TC-6). If a given trajectory should have different start and finish regions but cycles are allowed within, 10 base relations are defined (TC-10).

Rank queries are particularly challenging, since the search area (ie, which tuples qualify) cannot be determined by any peer individually. While our proposed framework is generic enough to apply to all decentralized structured systems, we show that when coupled with a particular distributed hash table (DHT) topology, it offers guaranteed worst-case performance. Specifically, rank query processing in our framework exhibits tunable polylogarithmic latency, in terms of the network size. Additionally we provide a means to trade-off latency for communication and processing cost. As a proof of concept, we apply RIPPLE for top-k query processing. Then, we consider skyline queries, and demonstrate that our framework results in a method that has better latency and lower overall communication cost than existing approaches over DHTs. Finally, we provide a RIPPLE-based approach for constructing a k-diversified set, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first distributed solution for this problem. Extensive experiments with real and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.",

We answer this question by introducing two edge-labeling schemes, GrdRandom and FlipInOut, that label edges with natural number ordering based on the premise that edges should be assigned integer identifiers exploiting their consecutiveness to a maximum degree.

Popular examples of such structures are the product catalogs of e-market stores, which provide data (ie products) organized in thematic hierarchies on a category/subcategory basis.

Navigational paths are the knowledge artifacts to represent such groups. We consider paths in hierarchies as patterns which provide a conceptual clustering of data in groups sharing common properties. Under this perspective, we have designed and implemented PatMan, a visual database system to manage hierarchical catalogs.

            "Abstract": "Sharing of structured data in decentralized environments is a challenging problem, especially in the absence of a global schema. Social network structures map network links to semantic relations between participants in order to assist in efficient resource discovery and information exchange. In this work, we propose a scheme that automates the process of creating schema synopses from semantic clusters of peers which own autonomous relational databases. The resulting mediated schemas can be used as global interfaces for relevant queries. Active nodes are able to initiate the group schema creation process, which produces a mediated schema representative of nodes with similar semantics. Group schemas are then propagated in the overlay and used as a single interface for relevant queries. This increases both the quality and the quantity of the retrieved answers and allows for fast discovery of interest \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This chapter focuses on pre-grouping transformation, attempts to generalize its applicability and identifies its relationship to other similar transformations. The results include a general algebraic definition of the Pre-Grouping transformation along with the formal definition of sufficient conditions for applying the transformation. Using a provided theorem, this chapter shows that pre-grouping can be applied in the presence of functional and inclusion dependencies without the explicit usage of hierarchical surrogate keys. An additional result of the study is the definition of the Surrogate-Join transformation that can modify a join condition using a number of dependencies. One important such optimization technique, called hierarchical pre-grouping, uses the hierarchical surrogate keys in order to aggregate the fact table tuples as early as possible and to avoid redundant joins.",

            "Abstract": "In a world of wide-scale information sharing, data are described in different formats, i.e. data structures, values and schemas. Querying such sources entails techniques that can bridge the data formats. Some existing techniques deal with schema mapping and view complementary aspects of the problem. Important ones, consider producing all the possible mappings for a pair of schemas, insinuating accompanying semantics in the mappings and adapting correct mappings as schemas evolve. In this work, we consider the problem of discovering mappings as schemas of autonomous sources are gradually revealed. Using as an example setting an overlay of peer databases, we present a schema mapping solution that discovers correct mappings as peer schemas are gradually revealed to remote peers. Mapping discovery is schema-centric and incorporates new semantics as they are unveiled. Mapping experience \u2026",
