            "Abstract": "In opportunistic networks (OppNets), routing and data forwarding among mobile devices are facilitated by relays or next-hop forwarders. To guarantee end-to-end data delivery it is important to provide participation. However, in sparsely connected OppNets, it is extremely challenging to monitor the behaviour of the relays and identify selfish/malicious relays cooperating with each other in order to forge routing information or drop useful data. Cooperation enforcement schemes are seen as a lightweight alternative to conventional secure forwarding techniques that involve cryptographically signed certificate exchanges, providing a `softer' security layer to protect basic networking operations. In general, cooperation enforcement schemes fall into two broad categories: trust establishment via a reputation system and pricing or credit-based schemes.

A problem that should be addressed in the context of multi-access communications is the efficient accommodation of traffic requests to the downlink subframe. The allocation operation in downlink sub-frame is not standardized, while only restrictions on the usage of downlink sub-frame's bandwidth are defined. The most noticeable restriction is the rectangular restriction, requiring all downlink allocations to be mapped in a two-dimensions rectangular shaping. This study is a first step towards defining a QoS-aware mapping scheme, prioritizing traffic requests in accordance with the strict delay requirements they pose. The mapping scheme applies horizon scheduling, permitting bursts to be scheduled efficiently and in a simple way \u2026",

The core power management process comprises distinct states representing the desired power management transitions, while two modes: namely, the doze and the cyclic sleep mode, are defined. This study provides an analytical model for power consumption computation of an optical network unit (ONU), assuming that the two modes are enabled in the ONU operation. The presented analytical findings are verified by conducting extensive simulation experiments. Concurrently, the average time spent on doze and cyclic sleep states is \u2026",

Beyond the green provisioning, the proposed scheme is able to increase occasionally the network performance in terms of mean packet delay and packet drop ratio.

            "Abstract": "In the present work we present the initial stages and first results of the development of a site-specific intelligent plant protection system for bean cultivation. The aim of the system is to be used as a decision tool for rational management of the major key pests of bean crop and with the view to reduce plant protection costs and to mitigate side effects and negative impact on the environment. Currently, we have established a telemetric meteorological network which consists of seven meteorological stations which are distributed in the major bean cultivation area of Greece and over the border area of the Prespes National Park. Through climate sensors the network delivers real time weather data to a cloud server to be further used to establish real time risk thresholds of pest occurrence during the bean growth season. Additionally, the system is passing a stage of pest models development and risk thresholds using in field phenology data along with weather data and Growing Degree-days. Particularly, for the development and validation of the pest risk thresholds we have established experimental fields. The risk thresholds include the pests: Helicoverpa armigera, Thrips sp. and Tetranychus urticae. Pest phenology is observed in four experimental fields which consist of two conventional as well as two organic fields serving as control. The current results will contribute to a better exploitation of the established meteorological station network and their real time microclimate data to provide important information on the rational use of pesticides.",

Our starting point is a business case that falls into the realm of personal mobility. The aim of the business case is to enable users that are found outside their home domain to access services by choosing the best visited retailer, i.e. the one offering adequate quality services in the most cost\u2010efficient manner. In the sequel the following key issues are addressed. First, the introduction of the additional functionality that is required for supporting the business case, and the realisation through appropriate service components.

The idea of DiffServ is based on the aggregation of traffic flows at an ingress (or egress) point of a network and the IP packet marking for distinct priority flows, according to several classification criteria. In this paper the problem of the improvement and fairness of absolute QoS provisioning to paths established along a DiffServ network on a per router basis is considered. Specifically, the dynamic service rate reconfiguration problem of a router\u2019s output link is formally defined, mathematically formulated and solved by means of efficient heuristic algorithms, providing good solutions in reasonable time. Two versions of the problem are addressed. First, a confined version, which exploits the available resources of service classes in order to improve QoS characteristics of the problematic flows. Second, an extended version of the problem, in which the strict constraints of the lower classes are relaxed in order to strictly meet the absolute QoS requirements of the higher order service classes.",

However, this promising feature is not properly utilized, since hitherto scheduling and mapping schemes proposed neglect it. In this paper, this challenging issue is effectively addressed by proposing an adaptive model that attempts to adequately adjust the downlink-to-uplink subframe width ratio according to the current traffic conditions.

The mapping process is critical since it allocates the users' requests into the downlink sub-frame in order to be sent to the mobile stations. One of the most noticeable issues in this area lies on the fairness aspect. Giving that the mapping process defines the order and the way that the users' requests are being serviced, some users may be treated unfairly. In this work this issue is considered and a new mapping scheme is introduced. The proposed scheme encloses fair and more efficient mapping process, compared to the leading scheme, according to the presented simulation results.",

Traditional search engines perform poorly on blogs since they do not cover these aspects. In an attempt to exploit these features, this paper proposes a personalized recommendation model, which capitalizes on a collaborative rating mechanism that exploits the hyperlinks between blogs.

In this paper, we move towards that direction by introducing an energy efficient power management scheme that encompasses two major goals: a) to reduce the energy consumption by allowing the optical devices to enter the sleep mode longer, and b) to concurrently maintain the network performance.

This paper proposes enhancements to the personal mobility support capabilities of existing service architectures. The TINA service architecture is considered to be our starting point. The key issues in this paper are the following. First, the definition of the required functionality and its design by means of appropriate service components. Second, the use of mobile intelligent agent technology for the implementation of the new components. Third, the integration of the agent based personal mobility support components to the \u201cstandard\u201d TINA.",

            "Abstract": "Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is generally considered as a competitive candidate networking technology for the realization of the 4G vision. Among the key factors towards its successful and widespread deployment are the effective support of mobility and the provision of mechanisms for enabling service access at a high quality level in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Nonetheless, this effort should take into account and adequately address strict and severe energy limitations that the mobile devices are currently facing. Power saving constitutes an issue of vital importance, as mobile terminals continue to incorporate more and more functionalities and energy-hungry features in order to support the ever increasing user requirements and demands. The standard employs variations of power saving classes in a frame-to-frame basis, while recent power saving mechanisms proposed in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Mobile ad hoc networks rely on node cooperation to perform and support basic functions like packet forwarding, routing and network management. In general, nodes' misbehaviour can significantly degrade the performance of the network. Cooperation enforcement schemes are seen as a lightweight alternative to conventional security techniques, providing a \u201csofter\u201d security layer to protect basic networking operations. The aim of this paper is to survey representative cooperation enforcement schemes exploiting a reputation system proposed in related research literature. Their distinct features are analyzed and their relative merits and weaknesses are discussed.",

Mobile agents are one of the means that may enhance the intelligence and improve the effectiveness of systems in the e-marketplace. This paper aims to present the basic elements of the designed dynamic multilateral negotiation model and strategies that do not require a complicated rationale on behalf of the buyer agents. It focuses on the enhancement of the seller's reasoning component by incorporating to the designed negotiation strategies a novel mechanism for the estimation of the mutually acceptable contract region by exploiting relative market data combined with knowledge acquired from previous experience. This technique is used to extend the functionality of autonomous agents, so that they reach to an agreement faster aiming to maximise their owner's utility. The \u2026",

This paper presents such mechanisms. Our starting point is the definition of a business case, through which the role of the best candidate-retailer selection problem is explained. In the sequel, the problem is analysed and the identified sub-problems are concisely defined, mathematically formulated and solved. The identified components of the best candidate-retailer selection problem involve the evaluation of the quality of a retailer offer and the reduction of the set of candidate retailers by exploiting learning from experience notions. In the final sections, results are provided and concluding remarks are made.",

The idea of DiffServ is based on the aggregation of traffic flows at an ingress (or egress) point of a network and IP packet marking for different priority flows, according to several classification criteria. In this paper the problem of the improvement and fairness of absolute QoS provisioning to paths established along a DiffServ network on a per router basis is considered. The service rate reconfiguration problem of a router's output link is formally defined, mathematically formulated and solved by means of efficient heuristic algorithms, providing good solutions in reasonable time.

To resolve the problem a set of Grid Services are defined and implemented conforming to the OGSA standards. The proposed scheduling architecture is semantically enhanced and provides the most appropriate assignment of tasks to computing resources, given the current load conditions of each computing resource and the network status. The Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO) was used to effectively assign tasks to computing resources. First experimental results indicate that the proposed framework produces good results in comparison to other well known schemes considered (e.g. round robin).",

            "Abstract": "Social networks have rapidly grown over the last years. The socio-technical information that they include may be exploited to improve the performance of the underlying communication network. This is of utmost importance especially in Next Generation Networks (NGNs), which provide multiple services with increased bandwidth requirements. In this paper, the problem of resource allocation in a bottleneck link of a NGN is examined. To this end, a utility based technique is proposed, which integrates the information of an overlaid social network expressed by the social distance parameter. In this case, the utility function employed is reformed, so as to incorporate this parameter, which in this study is determined by the users' average popularity. Network users are classified into friendship classes according to the social distance parameter. Then, the users' resource allocation objective is formulated as an optimization \u2026",
