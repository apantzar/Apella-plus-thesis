            "Abstract": "Automated segmentation of multi-part anatomical objects in images is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a similarity-based appearance-prior to fit a compartmental geometric atlas of the mouse brain in gene expression images. A subdivision mesh which is used to model the geometry is deformed using a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework. The proposed appearance-prior is computed as a function of the similarity between local patches at corresponding atlas locations from two images. In addition, we introduce a similarity-saliency score to select the mesh points that are relevant for the computation of the proposed prior. Our method significantly improves the accuracy of the atlas fitting, especially in the regions that are influenced by the selected similarity-salient points, and outperforms the previous subdivision mesh fitting methods for gene expression images.",

The shape transformation between the standing and lying poses is achieved by optimizing the deformations applied to the intervertebral transformations. Singleton and pairwise potentials measure the support from the data and geometrical dependencies between neighboring vertebrae respectively, while higher-order cliques (groups of vertebrae) are introduced to integrate consistency in regional curves.

Knowledge-based segmentation can then be expressed using a Markov Random Field, where the pairwise potentials encode the variation of the shape, while the singleton potentials refer to the data term through the Voronoi decomposition of the space.

Such an objective is addressed using a collection of 2-D X-rays acquired from multiple viewpoints. Then, both bone and prosthetic shape recovery are formulated as a multi-view reconstruction process through the minimization of an objective function. The objective function is designed to recover 3-D surfaces, which once projected to 2-D images, minimize edge-based and region-based criteria. The calculus of variations and gradient descent are used to obtain a surface with minimum cost through a 3-D level set implementation. Promising results are given for real X-ray data.",

Although recent technological advances shortened the longish acquisition time, this is still the limiting factor avoiding its wide-spread clinical usage. The acquisition of images with large field-of-view helps to relieve this drawback, but leads to significantly distorted images. Therefore, we propose a deformable mosaicing approach, based on the simultaneous registration to linear weighted averages, to correct for distortions in the overlapping area. This method produces good results on in-vivo data and has the advantage that a seamless integration into the clinical workflow is possible.",

            "Abstract": "This paper casts surface registration as the problem of finding a set of discrete correspondences through the minimization of an energy function, which is composed of geometric and appearance matching costs, as well as higher-order deformation priors. Two higher-order graph-based formulations are proposed under different deformation assumptions. The first formulation encodes isometric deformations using conformal geometry in a higher-order graph matching problem, which is solved through dual-decomposition and is able to handle partial matching. Despite the isometry assumption, this approach is able to robustly match sparse feature point sets on surfaces undergoing highly anisometric deformations. Nevertheless, its performance degrades significantly when addressing anisometric registration for a set of densely sampled points. This issue is rigorously addressed subsequently through a novel deformation model that is able to handle arbitrary diffeomorphisms between two surfaces. Such a deformation model is introduced into a higher-order Markov Random Field for dense surface registration, and is inferred using a new parallel and memory efficient algorithm. To deal with the prohibitive search space, we design an efficient way to select a number of matching candidates for each point of the source surface based on the matching results of a sparse set of points. A series of experiments demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed framework, notably in challenging cases of large and/or anisometric deformations, or surfaces that are partially occluded.",

During the past decade, different MRF models as well as inference methods - in particular those based on discrete optimization - have been developed towards addressing numerous vision problems of low, mid and high level. While most of the literature concerns pairwise MRFs, during recent years, we have also witnessed significant progress on higher-order MRFs, which substantially enhances the expressiveness of graph-based models and enlarges the extent of solvable problems.

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to optimally solve volumetric registration problems. The proposed framework exploits parametric dictionaries for sparse volumetric representations, \u2113 1  dissimilarities and DC (Difference of Convex functions) decomposition. The SAD (sum of absolute differences) criterion is applied to the sparse representation of the reference volume and a DC decomposition of this criterion with respect to the transformation parameters is derived. This permits to employ a cutting plane algorithm for determining the optimal relative transformation parameters of the query volume. It further provides a guarantee for the global optimality of the obtained solution, which-to the best of our knowledge-is not offered by any other existing approach. A numerical validation demonstrates the effectiveness and the large potential of the proposed method.",

            "Abstract": "Relevance and penetration of machine learning in clinical practice is a recent phenomenon with multiple applications being currently under development. Deep learning\u2014and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\u2014is a subset of machine learning, which has recently entered the field of thoracic imaging. The structure of neural networks, organized in multiple layers, allows them to address complex tasks. For several clinical situations, CNNs have demonstrated superior performance as compared with classical machine learning algorithms and in some cases achieved comparable or better performance than clinical experts. Chest radiography, a high-volume procedure, is a natural application domain because of the large amount of stored images and reports facilitating the training of deep learning algorithms. Several algorithms for automated reporting have been developed. The training of deep learning algorithm CT images is more complex due to the dimension, variability, and complexity of the 3D signal. The role of these methods is likely to increase in clinical practice as a complement of the radiologist\u2019s expertise. The objective of this review is to provide definitions for understanding the methods and their potential applications for thoracic imaging.",

In addition, we study the resolution of this relaxation using popular gradient methods, and further propose a more effective solution using a multilinear decomposition framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on many real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed ADMM significantly outperforms other nonconvex relaxation based methods, and compares favorably with state of the art MRF optimization algorithms in different settings.",

In this paper we propose a novel approach to address these challenges, that combines efficiently low-level detection using machine learning techniques, local unsupervised clustering detections and finally high-level perceptual organization of these segments towards its complete reconstruction. The latter handles miss-detections and is based on a local search algorithm. Very promising results were obtained.",

            "Abstract": "Extraction of structures of interest in medical images is often an arduous task because of noisy or incomplete data. However, hand-segmented data are often available and most of the structures to be extracted have a similar shape from one subject to an other. Then, the possibility of modeling a family of shapes and restricting the new structure to be extracted within this class is of particular interest. This approach is commonly implemented using active shape models [2] and the definition of the image term is the most challenging component of such an approach. In parallel, level set methods [8] define a powerful optimization framework, that can be used to recover objects of interest by the propagation of curves or surfaces. They can support complex topologies, considered in higher dimensions, are implicit, intrinsic and parameter free. In this paper we re-visit active shape models and introduce a level set \u2026",

In this paper, a novel recognition-driven variational framework is introduced for automatic and accurate multiple building extraction from aerial and satellite images. We aim to solve the problem of inaccurate data-driven segmentation. To this end, multiple shape priors are considered. Segmentation is then addressed through the use of a data-driven approach constrained from the prior models. The proposed framework extend previous approaches towards the integration of shape priors into the level set segmentation. In particular, it allows multiple competing priors and estimates buildings pose and number from the observed single image. Therefore, it can address multiple building extraction from single panchromatic images a highly demanding task of fundamental importance in various geoscience and remote sensing applications. Very promising results demonstrate the potentials of our approach.",

Experiment 1 consisted in evaluating the impact of the MRI input sequence. To this aim, two datasets composed of 222 and 220 T1-only and T1Gd-only MR images respectively were constituted and distributed between the training, validation and test sets. A second experiment was conducted to quantify the impact of the training set size. Five models were used, with 242, 121, 60, 30 and 15 patients respectively in the training set. The validation and test sets remained the same and were composed of 81 and 79 patients respectively. A last experiment to assess the role of MR standardization was performed. 242, 81 and 79 patients were included in the training, validation and test sets respectively. Three different approaches were investigated: no standardization (NS), histogram-based (HB)(2) and zero mean-unit variance (ZMUV) standardizations. To evaluate the quality of all generated pCT, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was computed within four areas (whole head, air, bone and water components). T-tests were conducted for statistical evaluation.Results: For the first experiment, a p-value of 0.72 was achieved between the T1-only and T1Gd-only models suggesting that the two sequences can be used without any distinction. The MAE obtained for the second experiment are presented in Figure 1. We showed that more than 100 patients must be used in the training set to reach optimal performances. The last experiment led to head MAE of 92HU+/-23HU, 83HU+/-22HU and 96HU+/-23HU for the HB, ZMUV, NS approaches respectively \u2026",

At least for a number of diseases, biomedical imaging is one of the most promising means of early diagnosis. Medical hardware manufacturer's progress has led to a new generation of measurements to understand the human anatomical and functional states. These measurements go beyond simple means of anatomical visualization (e.g. X-ray images) and therefore their interpretation becomes a scientific challenge for humans mostly because of the volume and flow of information as well as their nature. Computer-aided diagnosis develops mathematical models and their computational solutions to assist data interpretation in a clinical setting. In simple words, one would like to be able to provide a formal answer to a clinical question using the available measurements. The development of mathematical models for automatic clinical interpretation of multi-modalities is a great challenge.",

This is difficult to acquire, due to uncertainty in the definition and extent of disease patterns and the need of significant human effort, especially for large datasets. Therefore, often current methods use patch-based implementations of convolutional neural networks, which however tend to produce spatially inhomogeneous segmentations due to their local contextual view.

Control points are used to represent the guide-wire. Their displacements in time aims at optimizing an image-driven likelihood (on the same space used for segmentation), preserving the geometric characteristics of the curve while establishing correspondences for meaningful landmark points automatically extracted along the guide-wire. The tracking and the landmark correspondence problem form a two layer inter-connected graphical model, that is solved using linear programming towards simultaneous recovery of the two set of variables.

In this paper, we present the construction of a probabilistic atlas mapping the preferential locations of diffuse WHO grade II gliomas in the brain. This is carried out through a sparse graph whose nodes correspond to clusters of tumors clustered together based on their spatial proximity. The interest of such an atlas is illustrated via two applications. The first one correlates tumor location with the patient\u2019s age via a statistical analysis, highlighting the interest of the atlas for studying the origins and behavior of the tumors. The second exploits the fact that the tumors have preferential locations for automatic segmentation. Through a coupled decomposed Markov Random Field model, the atlas guides the segmentation process, and characterizes which preferential location the tumor belongs to and consequently which behavior it could be associated to. Leave-one-out cross validation experiments on a large database highlight the robustness of the graph, and yield promising segmentation results.",

Early diagnosis is quite often associated with more efficient treatment leading to a significant decrease of the mortality rate. In this paper, we present tools developed to process different cardiac modalities over the past years with aim to facilitate/automate computer aided diagnosis. In particular we present algorithms and advanced techniques for the segmentation of the left ventricle for magnetic resonance and echocardiographic imaging. Furthermore, to account for user interaction, we extent our method towards user-aided boundary delineation where the user has the ability to correct local discrepancies of automated results.",

To this end, we propose the use of angular Hilbertian metrics between multivariate normal distributions to define a family of distances between tensors that we generalize to fibers. The obtained metrics between fiber tracts encompasses both diffusion and localization information. As far as clustering is concerned, we use two methods. The first approach is based on diffusion maps and k-means clustering in the spectral embedding space. The second approach uses a linear programming formulation of prototype-based clustering. This formulation allows for classification over manifolds without the necessity to embed the data in low dimensional spaces and determines automatically the number of clusters. The experimental validation of the proposed framework is done using a manually annotated significant dataset of DTI of the calf muscle for healthy and diseased subjects.",

One of its main advantages is that it offers a substantial speedup over that method, e.g. it can be at least 3-9 times faster than \u03b1-expansion. Its efficiency is a result of the fact that Fast-PD exploits information coming not only from the original MRF problem, but also from a dual problem. Furthermore, besides static MRFs, it can also be used for boosting the performance of dynamic MRFs, i.e. MRFs varying over time. On top of that, Fast-PD makes no compromise about the optimality of its solutions: it can compute exactly the same answer as a-expansion, but, unlike that method, it can also guarantee an almost optimal solution for a much wider class of NP-hard MRF problems. Results on static and dynamic MRFs demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and power. E.g., Fast-PD has been able to compute disparity for \u2026",

We then develop novel techniques for the 2D shape parsing problem that take into account the specificities of the facade parsing problem.

Model maps represent the coherence of behavior of individual fMRI-measurements for a set of observations, or a time sequence. The maps establish a relation between individual positions in the brain by encoding the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal over a time period in a Markov chain. They represent this relation by mapping spatial positions to a new metric space, the model map. In this map the Euclidean distance between two points relates to the joint modeling behavior of their signals and thus the co-dependencies of the corresponding signals. The map reflects the functional as opposed to the anatomical geometry of the brain. It provides a quantitative tool to explore and study global and local patterns of \u2026",

Our approach is based on a coupled propagation of two cardiac contours and integrates visual information with anatomical constraints. The visual information is expressed through a gradient vector flow-based boundary component and a region term that aims at best separating the cardiac contours/regions according to their global intensity properties. In order to deal with misleading visual support, an anatomical constraint is considered that couples the propagation of the cardiac contours according to their relative distance. The resulting motion equations are implemented using a level set approach and a fast and stable numerical approximation scheme, the Additive Operator Splitting.

The level set method is embedded in a geodesic active contours variational formulation. Geodesic active contours technique is an advancement of the classical snakes and active contours that can handle the limitation to change their topology. The proposed mathematical model consists of a functional with two basic energies; one that forms a region-based energetic module for the evolving interface in the level set space and an another one that takes into account the a priori knowledge of the geometry of the desired for extraction objects. With such a functional shape information is embedded into the level set based segmentation scheme. Shape information can cope with missing or misleading information in the input images due to noise, clutter and occlusion. The shape priors were developed to segment objects of familiar shape in a given image.

State-of-the art methods often are based on prior knowledge that can either encode geometry, appearance or both.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of mutual population segmentation using discrete optimization where results from a given example influence results for the rest of the examples towards improving the overall segmentation performance. The aim is to combine prior knowledge along with consistency through the simultaneous segmentation of the whole population. This is achieved through their mutual deformation towards the atlas, while being constrained through a simultaneous all-to-all deformable diffeomorphic registration.

The method assumes a control points representation of the model and an arbitrary interpolation strategy. First, we construct the prior manifold using the distributions of the relative normalized distances between pairs of control points within the training set. The considered shape model refers to an incomplete graph that consists of intra and inter-cluster connections representing the inter-dependencies of control points. The clusters are determined according to the co-dependencies of the deformations of the control points within the training set. Then, we introduce a geometric partition of the space using a Voronoi decomposition that aims to determine relationships between the control points and the image domain. The same prior model is extended to the temporal domain to encode dynamic dependencies between the control points in the case of image sequences. We apply our model to both segmentation and tracking. Our knowledge-based approach to solve these problems is expressed using a Markov Random Field, where the unknowns are the positions of the control points. The pairwise potentials encode the variations of the shape, while the singleton potentials refer to the data term through the Voronoi decomposition of the space, and to the dynamic constraints. State-of-the art techniques from linear programming are considered both for the clustering and the optimization of the designed function.

Common prior assumptions on the nature of the deformation such as near-rigidity, isometry or learning from a training set, reduce the search space but often at the price of loss of accuracy when it comes to deformations not in the prior assumptions. If we consider the set of all possible 3D surface matchings defined by specifying triplets of correspondences in the uniformization domain, then we introduce a new matching cost between two 3D surfaces.

However, most MIL approaches do not exploit the interdependencies of tiles extracted from a whole slide image, which could provide valuable cues for classification. This paper presents a novel MIL approach that exploits the spatial relationship of tiles for classifying whole slide images. To do so, a sparse map is built from tiles embeddings, and is then classified by a sparse-input CNN. It obtained state-of-the-art performance over popular MIL approaches on the classification of cancer subtype involving 10000 whole slide images. Our results suggest that the proposed approach might (i) improve the representation learning of instances and (ii) exploit the context of instance embeddings to enhance the classification performance.

            "Abstract": "This paper deals with the matching of geometric shapes. Our primary contribution is the use of a simple, robust, rich and efficient way to represent shapes, the level set representations according to singed distance transforms. Based on these representations we propose a variational framework for global as well as local shape registration that can be extended to deal with structures of higher dimension. The optimization criterion is invariant to rotation, translation and scale and combines efficiently a global motion model with local pixel-wise deformations. Promising results are obtained on examples showing small and large global deformations as well as arbitrary topological changes.",

The developed framework exploits the relation between the registration and change detection problems, while under a fruitful synergy, the coupling energy term constrains adequately both tasks. In particular, through a decomposed interconnected graphical model, the registration similarity constraints are relaxed in the presence of change detection. Moreover, the deformation space is discretized, while efficient linear programming and duality principles are used to optimize a joint solution space where local consistency is imposed on the deformation and the detection space as well. The proposed formulation is able to operate in a fully unsupervised manner addressing binary change detection problems, i.e., change or no-change with respect to different similarity metrics.

This is achieved through a bottom up approach that first extracts local geometric primitives of interest in both images. Fusion between two graphs built with these primitives is performed through spectral matching and allows the definition of an improved criterion of ordering of the wire primitives. Given such criterion, local ordering is used towards reconstruction of multiple curvilinear structures that inherit visual support from both images.

We take advantage of the fact that in a typical urban scene, there is ordinarily a small number of dominant planes. Given two views of the scene, we align a dominant plane in one view with the other. Conjugate epipolar lines between the reference view and plane-aligned image become geometrically identical and can be added to the rectified image pair line by line. Selecting conjugate epipolar lines to cover the whole image is simplified since they are geometrically identical. In addition, the polarities of conjugate epipolar lines are automatically preserved by plane alignment, which simplifies stereo matching.",

While segmenting organs in medical images, which is the topic of this paper, a significant amount of prior knowledge about the shape, appearance, and location of the organs is available that can be used to constrain the solution space of the segmentation problem. Among the various types of prior information, the incorporation of prior information about shape, in particular, is very challenging. In this paper, we present an explicit shape-constrained MAP-MRF-based contour evolution method for the segmentation of organs in 2-D medical images. Specifically, we represent the segmentation contour explicitly as a chain of control points. We then cast the segmentation problem as a contour evolution problem, wherein the evolution of the contour is performed by \u2026",

Then, the registration cost is expressed using a discrete sum over image costs (using an arbitrary similarity measure) projected on the control points, and a smoothness term that penalizes local deviations on the deformation field according to a neighborhood system on the grid.

The mean and entropy of the detail sub-images for each decomposition scheme were used as texture features, which were subsequently fed as input into several classifiers.

However, when it comes to treatment through an endovascular intervention, only two dimensional lower resolution information such as angiograms or fluoroscopic images are usually available. Overlaying the pre-operative information from high resoluion acquisition onto the images acquired during intervention greatly helps physician in performing the operation. We propose to register pre-operative DSA or MRS with intra-operative images to bring the two data sets into a single coordinate frame. The method uses the vascular structure, which is present and visible from most of DSA, MRA and x-ray angiogram and fluoroscopic images, to determine the registration parameters. A robust multiple hypothesis framework is built to minimize a fitness \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we introduce a novel approach to single view reconstruction using shape grammars. Our approach consists in modeling architectural styles using a set of basic shapes and a set of parametric rules, corresponding to increasing levels of detail. This approach is able to model elaborate and varying architectural styles, using a tree representation of variable depth and complexity. Towards reconstruction, the parameters of the rules are optimized using image-based and architectural costs. This is done through an efficient MRF formulation based on the shape grammar itself. The resulting framework can produce precise 3D models from single views, can deal with lack of texture and the presence of occlusions and specular reflections, while maintaining the ability to cope with very complex architectural styles. Promising results demonstrate the potential of our approach.",

Advances in computing power continue to make the use and processing of visual information an important part of our lives. The evolution of these techniques was a natural outcome of the need to p-cess an emerging informationspace, the space of natural images. Images in space and time are now a critical part of many human activities. First, pictures and now video streams were used to eternalize small and signi? cant moments of our life. Entertainment including movies, TV-programs and video games are part of our every-day life where capturing, editing, understanding and transmitting images are issues to be dealt with. The medical sector is also a major area for the use of images. The evolution of the acquisition devices led to new ways of capturing information, not visible by the human eye. Medical imaging is probably the most established market for processing visual information [405]. Visualization of c-plex structures and automated processing towards computer aided diagnosis is used more and more by the physicians in the diagnostic process.

Standard methods for the calculation of ADC ignore the presence of noise and motion between successive (in time) DW-MR images acquired by changing the b-value. In order to accurately quantify the diffusion process during image acquisition, we introduce a method based on a high-order Markov Random Field (MRF) formulation that jointly registers the DW-MR images and models the spatiotemporal diffusion. Spatial smoothness on the ADC map, as well as spatiotemporal deformation smoothness, is imposed towards producing anatomically meaningful representations. The high-order dependencies in our MRF model are handled through Dual Decomposition. Performance of registration is compared to a state-of-the art registration approach in terms of obtained fitting error of the diffusion model in the core of the tumor. We also assess the clinical significance of the proposed method by examining the ability of the mean ADC value inside the tumor to act as imaging surrogate for lymphoma staging. Preliminary results reveal a marginally better performance of our method when compared against the standard ADC map used in clinical practice, which indicates its potential as a means for extracting imaging biomarkers.",

This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model.

This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival.

The aim of this work is to apply machine learning in order to train prediction models using data acquired by costly experimental procedures and perform enzyme functional classification. Enzymes constitute key pharmacological targets and the knowledge on the chemical reactions they catalyze is very important for the development of potent molecular agents that will either suppress or enhance the function of the given enzyme, thus modulating a pathogenicity, an illness or even the phenotype. Classification is performed on two levels: (i) using structural information into a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier and (ii) based on amino acid sequence alignment and Nearest Neighbor \u2026",

Quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to provide prognosis, predict tumor response in a non-invasive fashion and improve patient selection for IORT. A biologically inspired CD8 T-cells-associated radiomics signature has been developed on previous cohorts. We evaluated here whether this CD8 radiomic signature is associated with lesion response, whether it may help to assess disease spatial heterogeneity for predicting outcomes of patients treated with IORT. We also evaluated differences between irradiated and non-irradiated lesions.MethodsClinical data from patients with advanced solid tumors in six independent clinical studies of IORT were investigated.

Our approach is based on the integration of visual information, anatomical constraints and a flexible shape-driven cardiac model. The visual information is expressed through an intensity-based grouping module. The anatomical constraint accounts for the relative positions of the structures of interest. Global shape consistency is introduced by seeking for the lowest potential of the distance between the solution and the prior model. Registration is obtained using the same criterion where the transformation that aligns the latest segmentation map to either the shape model or to the previous segmentation result (temporal domain) is to be recovered.",

Second, the cluttered regions of the semantic objects are represented with a shape descriptor. Many-to-many matching of regions is specially challenging due to the instability of the segmentation under slight image changes, and we explicitly handle it through high order potentials. We demonstrate the matching approach applied to images of world famous buildings, captured under different conditions, showing the robustness of our method to large variations in illumination and viewpoint.",

The main challenge we face is that the training samples are not fully supervised. Specifically, they provide a hard segmentation of the images, instead of a probabilistic segmentation. We overcome this challenge by treating the optimal probabilistic segmentation that is compatible with the given hard segmentation as a latent variable.

The 3D hand pose, the hand texture and the illuminant are dynamically estimated through minimization of an objective function. Derived from an inverse problem formulation, the objective function enables explicit use of texture temporal continuity and shading information, while handling important self-occlusions and time-varying illumination. The minimization is done efficiently using a quasi-Newton method, for which we propose a rigorous derivation of the objective function gradient. Particular attention is given to terms related to the change of visibility near self-occlusion boundaries that are neglected in existing formulations. In doing so we introduce new occlusion forces and show that using all gradient terms greatly improves the performance of the method. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the formulation.",

While such methods have satisfactory performance in many scenarios, they do not model the relationships and correlation amongst nearby pixels. Such correlation between pixels exists both in space and across time especially when the scene consists of image structures moving across space. Waving trees, beach, escalators and natural scenes with rain or snow are examples of such scenes.

            "Abstract": "In this work we introduce the Deforming Autoencoder, a generative model for images that disentangles shape from appearance in a latent representation space that is learned in a fully unsupervised manner. As in the deformable template paradigm, shape is represented as a diffeomorphism between a canonical coordinate system (template') and an observed image, while appearance is modeled in template coordinates, thus discarding variability due to deformations. We introduce novel techniques that allow this approach to be deployed in the setting of autoencoders and show that this method can be used for unsupervised group-wise image alignment. We show experiments with expression morphing in humans, hands, and digits, face manipulation, such as shape and appearance interpolation, as well as unsupervised landmark localization. A more powerful form of unsupervised disentangling becomes possible in template coordinates, allowing us to successfully decompose face images into shading and albedo, and further manipulate face images.",

Our primary contribution is the use of a simple and robust shape representation (distance functions) for global-to-local alignment. We propose a rigid-invariant variational framework that can deal as well with local non-rigid transformations. To this end, the registration map consists of a linear motion model and a local deformations field, incrementally recovered. In order to demonstrate the performance of the selected representation a simple criterion is considered, the sum of square differences. Empirical validation and promising results were obtained on examples that exhibit large global motion as well as important local deformations and arbitrary topological changes.",

Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a new approach to tackle simultaneously linear and deformable registration between two images. Our combined formulation avoids the bias created when linear registration is performed independently before a deformable registration. Our registration problem is formulated as a discrete Markov Random Field and a higher order objective function. Usually, a grid is superimposed on the image domain where the latent variables correspond to the local image displacement vectors. Here, we decouple the linear part and the deformable part of the displacement vectors into two conjugate nodes of the grid. We enforce the smoothness of the deformable displacements vectors with binary potentials while the linearity is imposed through third and fourth order potentials. The resulting formulation is modular with respect to the image metric used to evaluate the correctness of mapping as well as with respect to the nature of the linear transformation (rigid, similarity, affine). Inference on this graph is performed efficiently through Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Promising results on medical 3D images demonstrate the potentials of our approach.",

We introduce a voxel-wise probabilistic level set formulation to account for prior knowledge. To this end, objects are represented in an implicit form. Constraints on the segmentation process are imposed by seeking a projection to the image plane of the prior model modulo a similarity transformation. The optimization of a statistical metric between the evolving contour and the model leads to motion equations that evolve the contour toward the desired image properties while recovering the pose of the object in the new image. Upon convergence, a solution that is similarity invariant with respect to the model and the corresponding transformation are recovered. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potential of such an approach. ",

We represent the illumination environment as a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions. Then, each shadow pixel becomes the combination of samples generated from this illumination environment. We integrate a number of low-level, illumination-invariant 2D cues in a graphical model to detect and estimate cast shadows on textured surfaces. Both 2D cues and approximate 3D reasoning are combined to infer a set of labels that identify the shadows in the image and estimate the positions \u2026",

The 3D-2D consistency is also encoded in such high-order interactions, which eliminate the necessity of viewpoint estimation. Furthermore, the modeling of visibility improves further the performance of the method by handling missing correspondences and occlusions.

In order to automate and standardize this task, we trained multiple U-net like neural networks, mainly with deep supervision and stochastic weight averaging, on the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2020 training dataset. Two independent ensembles of models from two different training pipelines were trained, and each produced a brain tumor segmentation map. These two labelmaps per patient were then merged, taking into account the performance of each ensemble for specific tumor subregions. Our performance on the online validation dataset with test time augmentation were as follows: Dice of 0.81, 0.91 and 0.85; Hausdorff (95%) of 20.6, 4,3, 5.7 mm for the enhancing tumor, whole tumor and tumor core, respectively. Similarly, our solution achieved a Dice of 0.79, 0.89 and 0.84, as well as Hausdorff (95%) of 20.4, 6.7 and 19.5mm on the final test dataset, ranking us among the top ten teams. More complicated training schemes and neural network architectures were investigated without significant performance gain at the cost of greatly increased training time. Overall, our approach yielded good and balanced performance for each tumor subregion. Our solution is open sourced at https://github.com/lescientifik/open_brats2020.",

In order to determine the limits of this method, we analyze the conditions that these subproblems have to satisfy and demonstrate the extreme generality and flexibility of such an approach. We thus show that by appropriately choosing what subproblems to use, one can design novel and very powerful MRF optimization algorithms.

In this study, we investigate the topic focusing on the interpretability of deep learning-based registration methods. In particular, with the appropriate model architecture and using a simple linear projection, we decompose the encoding space, generating a new basis, and we empirically show that this basis captures various decomposed anatomically aware geometrical transformations. We perform experiments using two different datasets focusing on lungs and hippocampus MRI. We show that such an approach can decompose the highly convoluted latent spaces of registration pipelines in an orthogonal space with several interesting properties. We hope that this work could shed some light on a better understanding of deep learning-based registration methods.",

Two higher-order graph-based formulations are proposed under different deformation assumptions. The first formulation encodes isometric deformations using conformal geometry in a higher-order graph matching problem, which is solved through dual-decomposition and is able to handle partial matching. Despite the isometry assumption, this approach is able to robustly match sparse feature point sets on surfaces undergoing highly anisometric deformations. Nevertheless, its performance degrades significantly when addressing anisometric registration for a set of densely sampled points.

            "Abstract": "During the past decade, with the significant progress of computational power as well as ever-rising data availability, deep learning techniques became increasingly popular due to their excellent performance on computer vision problems. The size of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has increased more than 15-fold since 1999, which enabled the expansion of models that aim at predicting enzymatic function via their amino acid composition. Amino acid sequence, however, is less conserved in nature than protein structure and therefore considered a less reliable predictor of protein function. This paper presents EnzyNet, a novel 3D convolutional neural networks classifier that predicts the Enzyme Commission number of enzymes based only on their voxel-based spatial structure. The spatial distribution of biochemical properties was also examined as complementary information. The two-layer architecture was investigated on a large dataset of 63,558 enzymes from the PDB and achieved an accuracy of 78.4% by exploiting only the binary representation of the protein shape.

Regional triangles are associated with pixels labeling which aims to create consistency between the model and the image space.

Graphical models have been the most popular formulation in the field over the past two decades where the problem is viewed as an discrete assignment labeling one. Modularity, scalability and portability are the main strength of these methods which once combined with efficient inference algorithms they could lead to state of the art results. In this tutorial we focus on the inference component of the problem and in particular we discuss in a systematic manner the most commonly used optimization principles in the context of graphical models. Our study concerns inference over low rank models (interactions between variables are constrained to pairs) as well as as higher order ones (arbitrary set of variables determine hyper-cliques on which constraints are introduced) and seeks a concise, self-contained presentation of prior art as well as the presentation of the current state of the art methods in the field.",

The proposed framework is inspired by the geodesic active contour model and leads to a paradigm that is relatively free from the initial curve position. Towards this end, it makes use of a recently introduced external boundary force, the gradient vector field that refers to a spatial diffusion of the boundary information. According to the proposed flow, the traditional boundary attraction term is replaced with a new force that guides the propagation to the object boundaries from both sides. This new geometric flow is implemented using a level set approach, thereby allowing dealing naturally with topological changes and important shape deformations. Moreover the level set motion equations are implemented using a recently introduced numerical approximation scheme, the Additive Operator Splitting Schema (AOS) which has a fast convergence \u2026",

The proposed architecture consists of multiple deep neural networks that are trained after co-aligning multiple anatomies through multi-metric deformable registration. This multi-network architecture can be trained with fewer examples and leads to better performance, robustness and generalization through consensus.

Registration is considered in an implicit higher dimensional space. The powerful space of distance transforms of arbitrary metric is used as an embedding function. Mutual information can support various motion models and is considered to perform global registration. A B-Spline approximation of grid is used within a free-from deformation criterion to recover a (complementary to the global) dense registration field that is continuous and guarantees one-toone mapping. Such framework exhibits robustness and can cope in an efficient manner with important local deformations. 2D/3D shapes are used to demonstrate the potentials of the proposed technique.",

            "Abstract": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are increasingly being used in computer vision for applications such as: gesture analysis, action recognition from video, and illumination modeling. Their use involves an off-line learning step that is used as a basis for on-line decision making (i.e. a stationarity assumption on the model parameters). But, real-world applications are often non-stationary in nature. This leads to the need for a dynamic mechanism to learn and update the model topology as well as its parameters. This paper presents a new framework for HMM topology and parameter estimation in an online, dynamic fashion. The topology and parameter estimation is posed as a model selection problem with an MDL prior. Online modifications to the topology are made possible by incorporating a state splitting criterion. To demonstrate the potential of the algorithm, the background modeling problem is considered \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a framework for extracting mutually-salient landmark pairs for registration. Traditional methods detect landmarks one-by-one and separately in two images. Therefore, the detected landmarks might inherit low dis-criminability and are not necessarily good for matching. In contrast, our method detects landmarks pair-by-pair across images, and those pairs are required to be mutually-salient, i.e., uniquely corresponding to each other. The second merit of our framework is that, instead of finding individually optimal correspondence, which is a local approach and could cause self-intersection of the resultant deformation, our framework adopts a Markov-random-field (MRF)-based spatial arrangement to select the globally optimal landmark pairs. In this way, the geometric consistency of the correspondences is maintained and the resultant deformations are relatively smooth and topology-preserving \u2026",

The approach is based on B-spline snakes defined by a set of control points whose optimal configuration is determined through efficient discrete optimization. Each control point is associated with a discrete random variable in a MAP-MRF formulation where a set of labels captures the deformation space. In such a context, generic terms are encoded within this MRF in the form of pairwise potentials. The use of pairwise potentials along with the B-spline representation offers nearly perfect approximation of the continuous domain. Efficient linear programming is considered to recover the approximate optimal solution. The method is successfully applied to the tracking of guide-wires in fluoroscopic X-ray sequences of several hundred frames which requires extremely robust techniques.",

It does so by relying on a much tighter class of LP-relaxations, called cycle-relaxations. With the help of this class of relaxations, our algorithm tries to deal with a difficulty lying at the heart of MRF optimization: the existence of inconsistent cycles. To this end, it uses an operation called cycle-repairing. The goal of that operation is to fix any inconsistent cycles that may appear during optimization, instead of simply ignoring them as usually done up to now. The more the repaired cycles, the tighter the underlying LP relaxation becomes. As a result of this procedure, our algorithm is capable of providing almost optimal solutions even for very general MRFs with arbitrary potentials. Experimental \u2026",

The proposed framework is modular, scalable, and can be instantiated into different variants. Two instantiations are studied exploring pairwise and higher-order constraints.

In particular, a set of multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor attributes are extracted and the optimal components are selected, so that they form a highly distinctive morphological signature reflecting the anatomical and geometric context around each voxel. Moreover, the way in which the optimal Gabor attributes are constructed is independent of the underlying image modalities or contents, which renders DRAMMS generally applicable to diverse registration tasks.

Here, we tackle the challenging task of evaluating the ability of clinical, gene expression and histopathology data to predict response following dual HER2 blockade without chemotherapy. Our aim is through artificial intelligence to automatically decipher the complementarity of clinical, genomic and histopathology data through an evidence-driven approach towards a low dimensional holistic signature that determines outcomes and could be subsequently used as a clinical biomarker for treatment patient inclusion.

Change detection and crowding/congestion density estimation are two sub-tasks in a subway monitoring system. We propose a method that decomposes this problem into two steps. The first step consists of a change detection algorithm that distinguishes the background from the foreground. This is done using a discontinuity preserving MRF-based approach where the information from different sources (background subtraction, intensity modeling) is combined with spatial constraints to provide a smooth motion detection map. Then, the obtained change detection map is combined with a geometry module that performs a soft auto-calibration to estimate a measure of congestion of the observed area (platform).

These candidates are grouped into consistent geometric segments through the use of a state-of-the art unsupervised clustering algorithm.

We begin the chapter by explaining how one can formulate the deformable registration problem as a minimal cost graph problem where the nodes of the graph corresponds to the deformation grid, the graph connectivity encodes regularization constraints, and the labels correspond to 3D displacements. We then explain the use of discrete models in intensity-based volumetric registration.

The creation of computational models predicting enzymatic function is of major importance since such models provide the means to better understand the behavior of newly discovered enzymes when catalyzing chemical reactions. Until now, single-label classification has been widely performed for predicting enzymatic function limiting the application to enzymes performing unique reactions and introducing errors when multi-functional enzymes are examined. Indeed, some enzymes may be performing different reactions and can hence be directly associated with multiple enzymatic functions. In the present work, we propose a multi-label enzymatic function classification scheme that combines structural and amino acid sequence information. We investigate two fusion approaches (in the feature level and decision level) and assess the methodology for general enzymatic function prediction indicated by the first digit of the enzyme commission (EC) code (six main classes) on 40,034 enzymes from the PDB database. The proposed single-label and multi-label models predict correctly the actual functional activities in 97.8% and 95.5% (based on Hamming-loss) of the cases, respectively. Also the multi-label model predicts all possible enzymatic reactions in 85.4% of the multi-labeled enzymes when the number of reactions is unknown.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, a novel variational framework is introduced toward automatic 3-D building reconstruction from remote-sensing data. We consider a subset of building models that involve the footprint, their elevation, and the roof type. These models, under a certain hierarchical representation, describe the space of solutions and, under a fruitful synergy with an inferential procedure, recover the observed scene's geometry. Such an integrated approach is defined in a variational context, solves segmentation both in optical images and digital elevation maps, and allows multiple competing priors to determine their pose and 3-D geometry from the observed data. The very promising experimental results and the performed quantitative evaluation demonstrate the potentials of our approach.",

Local shape deformation properties of the model can be captured and learned in an optimal manner from a training set using dual decomposition. These higher order shape terms are combined with conventional visual ones aiming at maximizing the posterior segmentation likelihood. The considered graphical model is optimized using dual decomposition and is used towards 2D (computer vision) and 3D object segmentation (medical imaging) with promising results.",

            "Abstract": "Precision medicine is a paradigm shift in healthcare relying heavily on genomics data. However, the complexity of biological interactions, the large number of genes as well as the lack of comparisons on the analysis of data, remain a tremendous bottleneck regarding clinical adoption. In this paper, we introduce a novel, automatic and unsupervised framework to discover low-dimensional gene biomarkers. Our method is based on the LP-Stability algorithm, a high dimensional center-based unsupervised clustering algorithm, that offers modularity as concerns metric functions and scalability, while being able to automatically determine the best number of clusters. Our evaluation includes both mathematical and biological criteria. The recovered signature is applied to a variety of biological tasks, including screening of biological pathways and functions, and characterization relevance on tumor types and subtypes. Quantitative comparisons among different distance metrics, commonly used clustering methods and a referential gene signature used in the literature, confirm state of the art performance of our approach. In particular, our signature, that is based on 27 genes, reports at least  times better mathematical significance (average Dunn's Index) and 25% better biological significance (average Enrichment in Protein-Protein Interaction) than those produced by other referential clustering methods. Finally, our signature reports promising results on distinguishing immune inflammatory and immune desert tumors, while reporting a high balanced accuracy of 92% on tumor types classification and averaged balanced accuracy of 68% on tumor subtypes \u2026",

A low-dimensional manifold embedding is created from a training set of prior mesh models to establish the patterns of global shape variations. Local appearance is captured from neighborhoods in the manifold once the overall representation converges. Inference with respect to the manifold and shape parameters is performed using a Markov Random Field (MRF). Singleton and pairwise potentials measure the support from the data and shape coherence from neighboring models respectively, while higher-order cliques encode geometrical modes of variation for local vertebra shape warping. Optimization of model parameters is achieved using efficient linear programming and duality. The resulting model is geometrically intuitive, captures the statistical distribution of the underlying manifold and respects image \u2026",

However, biopsies are only taken from part of the tumor and cannot assess the full cellular extension. Such information is essential to delineate as accurately as possible the tumor volume on a three-dimensional basis. Furthermore, they require highly qualified personnel and are associated with significant risks. The aim of our work is to provide alternative means to gather clinical information related to histology through MR image translation towards virtual pathological content generation. Conventional approaches to address this objective exploit paired data that is cumbersome to achieve due to tissue collapse and deformation, different resolution scales and absence of plane correspondences. In this paper, we introduce a versatile, scalable and robust closed-loop dual synthesis concept that composes two generation mechanisms-cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks-, one exploring weakly paired data and a subsequent harnessing virtually generated paired correspondences. The clinical relevance and interest of our framework are demonstrated in prostate cancer patients. Qualitative clinical assessment and quantitative reconstruction measurements demonstrate the potential of our approach.",

Staging and prognosis are especially crucial for organizational anticipation (intensive-care bed availability, patient management planning) and accelerating drug development; through rapid, reproducible and quantified response-to-treatment assessment. In this letter, we report on an artificial intelligence solution for performing automatic staging and prognosis based on imaging, clinical, comorbidities and biological data. This approach relies on automatic computed tomography (CT)-based disease quantification using deep learning, robust data-driven identification of physiologically-inspired COVID-19 holistic patient profiling, and strong, reproducible staging/outcome prediction with good generalization properties using an ensemble of consensus methods. Highly promising results on multiple independent external evaluation cohorts along with comparisons with expert human readers demonstrate the potentials of our approach. The developed solution offers perspectives for optimal patient management, given the shortage of intensive care beds and ventilators, along with means to assess patient response to treatment.",

The problem is reformulated as a graphical model that consists of hidden (deformation fields) and observed variables (intensities). A novel deformation grid-based scheme is proposed that guarantees the diffeomorphism of the deformation and is computationally favorably compared to standard deformation methods. Towards addressing important deformations we propose a compositional approach where the deformations are recovered through the sub-optimal \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The 3D modeling of the proximal femur is a valuable diagnostic tool for orthopedic surgery planning. The use of computed tomography is the most prominent modality to visualize bones both in terms of resolution as well as in term of bone/tissue separation. Towards reducing the impact of radiation to the patient, low-dose X-ray imaging systems have been introduced while still providing partial views with rather low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we focus on automating the 3D proximal femur reconstruction from simultaneously acquired 2D views. A deformable model represented by triangulated mesh surfaces extends to a linear sub-space describing the variations across individuals. Segmentation consists of inferring a global deformation of 3D model followed by a local adaption based on the most prominent combination of the sub-space parameters. The ba-sis of which relies on the minimization of a cost function based on the biplanar projection of this model. To this end, we employ an active region model that aims at optimizing the 3D model parameters such that projection of surface is attracted from edge potentials, while creating an optimal partition between the bone class and the remaining structures. The global parameters of the model and the local ones are optimized through a gradient-free approach. Promising results demonstrate the potentials of our method compared to a supervised reconstruction technique.",

The general literature trend is to perform behavior recognition separately after an initial phase of feature/attribute extraction. We propose a framework where behavior recognition is performed jointly with attribute extraction, allowing the two tasks to mutually improve their results. To this end, we express the joint recognition/extraction problem in terms of a probabilistic temporal model, allowing its resolution via a variation of the Viterbi decoding algorithm, adapted to our model. Within the algorithm derivation, we translate probabilistic attribute extraction into a variational segmentation scheme. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework through a particular implementation for finger-spelling recognition. The obtained results illustrate the superiority of our collaborative model with respect to the traditional approach, where attribute extraction and behavior recognition are performed sequentially.",

However, the registration of very large multimodal, multitemporal, with different spatial resolutions data is, still, an open matter. To this end, we propose a generic and automated registration framework based on Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and efficient linear programming. The discrete optimization setting along with the introduced data-specific energy terms form a modular approach with respect to the similarity criterion allowing to fully exploit the spectral properties of multimodal remote sensing datasets. The proposed approach was validated both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrating its potentials on very large (more than 100M pixels) multitemporal remote sensing datasets. In particular, in terms of spatial accuracy the geometry of the optical and radar data has been recovered with displacement errors of less than 2 and 3 pixels, respectively. In terms of computational efficiency the optical data term can converge after 7-8 minutes, while the radar data term after less than 15 minutes.",

            "Abstract": "Segmentation is a fundamental problem in medical image analysis. The use of prior knowledge is often considered to address the ill-posedness of the process. Such a process consists in bringing all training examples in the same reference pose, and then building statistics. During inference, pose parameters are usually estimated first, and then one seeks a compromise between data-attraction and model-fitness with the prior model. In this paper, we propose a novel higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model to encode pose-invariant priors and perform 3D segmentation of challenging data. The approach encodes data support in the singleton terms that are obtained using machine learning, and prior constraints in the higher-order terms. A dual-decomposition-based inference method is used to recover the optimal solution. Promising results on challenging data involving segmentation of tissue \u2026",

It commonly comprises two steps: (1) a series of pairwise registrations that establish correspondences between a query image and a number of atlases, and (2) the fusion of the available segmentation hypotheses towards labeling objects of interest. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that solves simultaneously for the underlying segmentation labels and the multi-atlas registration. The proposed approach is formulated as a pairwise Markov Random Field, where registration and segmentation nodes are coupled towards simultaneously recovering all atlas deformations and labeling the query image. The coupling is achieved by promoting the consistency between selected deformed atlas segmentations and the estimated query segmentation. Additional membership fields are \u2026",

We express deformable registration as a minimal cost graph problem, where nodes correspond to the deformation grid, a node's connectivity corresponds to regularization constraints, and labels correspond to 3D deformations. To cope with both iconic and geometric (landmark-based) registration, we introduce two graphical models, one for each subproblem. The two graphs share interconnected variables, leading to a modular, powerful, and flexible formulation that can account for arbitrary image-matching criteria, various local deformation models, and regularization constraints. To cope with the corresponding optimization problem, we adopt two optimization strategies: a computationally efficient one and a tight relaxation alternative. Promising results \u2026",

This paper presents a novel MIL approach that exploits the spatial relationship of tiles for classifying whole slide images. To do so, a sparse map is built from tiles embeddings, and is then classified by a sparse-input CNN. It obtained state-of-the-art performance over popular MIL approaches on the classification of cancer subtype involving 10,000 whole slide images.

The proposed method takes advantage of both the diffusion information and the spatial location of tensor in order to define an appropriate metric in a probabilistic framework. A registration energy is defined in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), encoding the image dissimilarity and the regularity of the deformation field in both the translation and the rotation space. The problem is reformulated as a graphical model where the latent variables are the rotation and the translation that should be applied to every tensor and the observed variables are the tensors themselves. Efficient linear programming is used to minimize the resulting energy.

Although these datasets are typically under-sampled and high-dimensional, they often need to be represented with low-complexity statistical models, which are comprised of only the important probabilistic dependencies in the datasets. Most methods attempt to reduce model complexity by enforcing structure sparseness. However, sparseness cannot describe inherent regularities in the structure. Hence, in this paper we first propose a new class of Gaussian graphical models which, together with sparseness, imposes local constancy through l1-norm penalization. Second, we propose an efficient algorithm which decomposes the strictly convex maximum likelihood estimation into a sequence of problems with closed form solutions. Through synthetic experiments, we evaluate the closeness of the recovered models to the ground truth. We also test the generalization performance of our method in a wide range of complex real-world datasets and demonstrate that it captures useful structures such as the rotation and shrinking of a beating heart, motion correlations between body parts during walking and functional interactions of brain regions. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art structure learning techniques for Gaussian graphical models both for small and large datasets.",

            "Abstract": "Registration and modeling of shapes are two important problems in computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite enormous progress made over the past decade, these problems are still open. In this paper, we advance the state of the art in both directions. First we consider an efficient registration method that aims to recover a one-to-one correspondence between shapes and introduce measures of uncertainties driven from the data which explain the local support of the recovered transformations. To this end, a free form deformation is used to describe the deformation model. The transformation is combined with an objective function defined in the space of implicit functions used to represent shapes. Once the registration parameters have been recovered, we introduce a novel technique for model building and statistical interpretation of the training examples based on a variable bandwidth kernel approach.

Materials and Methods Based on the Fast Forward RT schedule of 5 fractions of 5.2 Gy over 5 days for adjuvant BC, we designed a workflow to perform BC RT over 1 week from the first RT consultation to the end of treatment (figure 1). Patients were seen in consultation on Monday morning. The planning CT was carried out immediately after the consultation. A deep inspiration breath-hold technique was systematically offered to all patients. Automatic delineation using an artificial Intelligence (AI) based model with ART-PlanTM software was first corrected by a junior radiation oncologist (RO) then, independently by a senior RO. As 3D conformal RT failed to achieve dose constraints of the fast forward trial in many cases (due to breast hotspots), we developed a restricted IMRT (rIMRT) technique based on 2 tangential beams (internal and external) using inverse planning restricted optimization parameters to improve the dose homogeneity. Treatment planning was semi-automated by scripting the creation and optimization steps of rIMRT plans. After validation of the reliability of rIMRT treatment delivery by patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) with gamma index evaluation on 20 patients, we decided to abandon systematic PSQAs. In-vivo dosimetry was validated by end-to-end controls and performed for each patient during the first fraction on Monday afternoon. Daily repositioning \u2026",

To this end, we use the classic quadratic data fidelity term derived from the Stejskal-Tanner equation with a new smoothness term leading to a convex objective function. The regularization term is based on the assumption that the signal can be reconstructed using a weighted average of observations on a local neighborhood. The weights measure the similarity between tensors and are computed directly from the diffusion images. We preserve the positive semi-definiteness constraint using a projected gradient descent. Experimental validation and comparisons with a similar method using synthetic data with known noise model, as well as classification of tensors towards understanding the anatomy of human skeletal muscle demonstrate the potential of our method.",

These patches are positioned on top of missing segment, ordered depending on their similarity weight, and form in some fashion a multi-layered graph over time. Markov Random Fields are used to formalize inpainting as a labelling estimation problem while a combinatorial approach is used to recover the optimal combination of patches to complete the missing structure. The min-cut max-flow algorithm within the \u03b1-expansion process is used to determine the optimal cut that, in an implicit fashion, completes the missing image structure.

Shape parsing entails simultaneously optimizing the geometry and the topology (e.g. number of floors) of the facade, so as to optimize the fit of the predicted shape with the responses of pixel-level 'terminal detectors'. We formulate this problem in terms of a Hierarchical Markov Decision Process, by employing a recursive binary split grammar. This allows us to use RL to efficiently find the optimal parse of a given facade in terms of our shape grammar. Building on the RL paradigm, we exploit state aggregation to speedup computation, and introduce image-driven exploration in RL to accelerate convergence. We achieve state-of-the-art results on facade parsing, with a significant speed-up compared to existing methods, and substantial robustness to initial conditions. We demonstrate that the method can also be applied \u2026",

We adopt a grid-based parametrization of the deformation field that is encoded by a higher order graphical model. In the proposed formulation, latent variables correspond to local grid displacement vectors and unary potentials locally quantify the level of alignment between the two images. Higher order constraints that involve third and forth order potentials, enforce the linearity of the resulting transformation. The resulting formulation is modular with respect to the image metric used to evaluate the correctness of mapping as well as with respect to the nature of the linear transformation (rigid, similarity, or affine). Inference on this graph is performed through dual decomposition. Comparison with classic algorithms demonstrates the potential of our approach.",

The resulting paradigm supports hierarchies both in the model and the search space, can encode complex geometric and photometric dependencies of the structure of interest, and can deal with arbitrary topologies.

Here we present a novel model-based approach to 3D animal tracking from monocular video which allows the quantification of bioluminescence signal on freely moving animals. The 3D animal pose and the illumination are dynamically estimated through minimization of an objective function with constraints on the bioluminescence signal position. Derived from an inverse problem formulation, the objective function enables explicit use of temporal continuity and shading information, while handling important self-occlusions and time-varying illumination. In this model-based framework, we include a constraint on the 3D position of bioluminescence signal to enforce tracking of the biologically produced signal. The minimization is done \u2026",

We first formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem. This leads to an efficient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well defined LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm\u2019s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efficient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.",

The number of motion planes and initial motion parameters are obtained by robust block-wise optical flow estimation, followed by non-parametric clustering in the motion parameter space. Implicit representations are used to further improve the estimation and to segment the image plane according to consistent motion. Our approach integrates a smoothness constraint, a spatial-temporal motion constraint and a color-driven segmentation module within the multiphase level set framework. Therefore, our method is able to recover the different topology of the motion layers and provide smooth motion segmentation that is consistent with the geometry of the scene. Experimental results on both natural and synthetic image sequences demonstrate the potential of the proposed technique.",

Scientists of various origins like biology, medicine, neurophysiology, engineering, math ematics, etc. aim to understand the processes leading to visual perception process and at reproducing such systems. Understanding the environment is most of the time done through visual perception which appears to be one of the most fundamental sensory abilities in humans and therefore a significant amount of research effort has been dedicated towards modelling and repro ducing human visual abilities. Mathematical methods play a central role in this endeavour. Introduction David Marr's theory v^ as a pioneering step tov^ ards understanding visual percep tion. In his view human vision was based on a complete surface reconstruction of the environment that was then used to address visual subtasks. This approach was proven to be insufficient by neuro-biologists and complementary ideas from statistical pattern recognition and artificial intelligence were introduced to bet ter address the visual perception problem. In this framework visual perception is represented by a set of actions and rules connecting these actions. The emerg ing concept of active vision consists of a selective visual perception paradigm that is basically equivalent to recovering from the environment the minimal piece information required to address a particular task of interest.",

Conventional approaches refer to the definition of a similarity criterion that, once endowed with a deformation model and a smoothness constraint, determines the optimal transformation to align two given images. The definition of this metric function is among the most critical aspects of the registration process. We argue that incorporating semantic information (in the form of anatomical segmentation maps) into the registration process will further improve the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised approach to learn domain-specific aggregations of conventional metrics using anatomical segmentations.

By combining contrast terms with prior terms, it provides accurate segmentations of medical images in a fully automated manner. However, one of the main drawbacks of using the RW algorithm is that its parameters have to be hand-tuned. we propose a novel discriminative learning framework that estimates the parameters using a training dataset. The main challenge we face is that the training samples are not fully supervised. Speci cally, they provide a hard segmentation of the images, instead of a proba-bilistic segmentation. We overcome this challenge by treating the optimal probabilistic segmentation that is compatible with the given hard segmentation as a latent variable. This allows us to employ the latent support vector machine formulation for parameter estimation. We show that our approach signi cantly outperforms the baseline methods on a challenging dataset consisting of real clinical 3D MRI volumes of skeletal muscles.",

The use of divergence theorem leads to an elegant pairwise formulation where image support and prior knowledge are jointly encoded within a pairwise MRF and the segmentation is achieved efficiently by employing MRF inference algorithms.

Model maps represent the coherence of behavior of individual fMRI-measurements for a set of observations, or a time sequence. The maps establish a relation between individual positions in the brain by encoding the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal over a time period in a Markov chain. They represent this relation by mapping spatial positions to a new metric space, the model map. In this map the Euclidean distance between two points relates to the joint modeling behavior of their signals and thus the co-dependencies of the corresponding signals. The map reflects the functional as opposed to the anatomical geometry of the brain. It provides a quantitative tool to explore and study global and local patterns of resource allocation in the brain. To demonstrate the merit of this representation, we report quantitative experimental results on 29 fMRI time sequences, each with sub-sequences corresponding to 4 different conditions for two groups of individuals. We demonstrate that drug abusers exhibit lower differentiation in brain interactivity between baseline and reward related tasks, which could not be quantified until now. 1",

The key advantage of such framework is twofold: 1) it naturally deals with shapes of arbitrary dimension (2D, 3D, or higher) and arbitrary topology (multiple parts, closed/open) and 2) it preserves shape topology during local deformation and produces local registration fields that are smooth, continuous, and establish one-to-one correspondences \u2026",

It consists of a boundary attraction term, a background subtraction component and a visual consistency constraint.

This leads to an efficient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well defined LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm\u2019s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efficient approximations to the latter.

One of its main advantages is that it offers a substantial speedup over that method, eg it can be at least 3-9 times faster than \u03b1-expansion. Its efficiency is a result of the fact that Fast-PD exploits information coming not only from the original MRF problem, but also from a dual problem. Furthermore, besides static MRFs, it can also be used for boosting the performance of dynamic MRFs, ie MRFs varying over time. In addition, despite being fast, Fast-PD makes no compromise about the optimality of its solutions: it can compute exactly the same answer as \u03b1expansion, but, unlike that method, it can also guarantee an almost optimal solution for a much wider class of NP-hard MRF problems. Results on static and dynamic MRFs demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s efficiency and power. Eg Fast-PD has been able to compute disparity for stereoscopic sequences in real time, with the resulting disparity coinciding with that of \u03b1-expansion.",

With the recent advances in computational medicine, automatic tools have been proposed to assist clinicians in their everyday practice. Such tools typically process these large images by slicing them into tiles that can then be encoded and utilized for different clinical models. In this study, we propose a novel generative framework that can learn powerful representations for such tiles by learning to plausibly expand their visual field. In particular, we developed a progressively grown generative model with the objective of visual field expansion. Thus trained, our model learns to generate different tissue types with fine details, while simultaneously learning powerful representations that can be used for different clinical endpoints, all in a self-supervised way. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conducted classification experiments on CAMELYON17 and CRC benchmark datasets, comparing favorably to other self-supervised and pre-trained strategies that are commonly used in digital pathology.

Graph matching is then reformulated as a non-convex non-separable optimization problem that can be split into smaller and much-easier-to-solve subproblems, by means of the alternating direction method of multipliers. The proposed framework is modular, scalable, and can be instantiated into different variants. Two instantiations are studied exploring pairwise and higher-order constraints. Experimental results on widely adopted benchmarks involving synthetic and real examples demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform existing pairwise graph matching methods, and competitive with the state of the art in higher-order settings.",

Their delineation is particularly problematic due to the lack of solid visual support that is also compromised by the presence of clutter and low signal to noise ratios. In this article, we propose a modular approach to curvilinear structures extraction based on recent advances in discrete optimization on the basis of aggregate clustering. Given an initial clustering of the detected points, first a pair-wise Markov Random Field (MRF) is considered to determine consistent elongated structures while penalizing their number and rejecting outliers. The outcome of this process is then locally refined through a non-submodular MRF aiming at center-line extraction process and guided by local geometric consistency between segments expressing the intra-cluster \u2026",

Our MRF framework makes use of recent advances in discrete optimization, is efficient in terms of computation time, and provides great flexibility. Any similarity measure can be encoded right away, since no differentiation is needed. In this work, we investigate the performance of our framework in a challenging scenario: the registration of thoracic CT images. In order to assess the potential of the discrete MRF setting, we employ the simplest registration objective function based on intensity differences. The registration is fully-automatic, constant parameters are used throughout the experiments, we omit the use of the available segmentations, and (except for linear pre-alignment) no pre-processing of the data is performed. Despite the simplicity of our experimental setup, we are able to obtain accurate registration results for most of the data in a very efficient manner.

Here, regularization plays an important role in order to obtain smooth deformations for the inherent ill-posed problem. Smoothness is achieved by penalizing the derivatives of the displacement field. However, efficient optimization strategies (based on iterative graph-cuts) are only available for second-order MRFs which contain cliques of size up to two. Higher-order cliques require graph modifications and insertion of auxiliary nodes, while pairwise interactions actually allow only regularization based on the first-order derivatives. In this paper, we propose an approximated curvature penalty using second-order derivatives defined on the MRF pairwise potentials. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approximated term has similar properties as higher-order \u2026",

Defining structures invariant to some class of shape transformations results in an invariant minimum-distortion correspondence or similarity. In this paper, we model shapes using local and global structures, formulate the invariant correspondence problem as binary graph labeling, and show how different choice of structure results in invariance under various classes of deformations.",

An accurate 3D reconstruction from standard X-rays is obtained before surgery to provide the geometry of vertebrae. The outcome of this procedure is used as basis to derive an articulated spine model that is represented by consecutive sets of intervertebral articulations relative to rotation and translation parameters (6 degrees of freedom). Inference with respect to the model parameters is then performed using an integrated and interconnected Markov Random Field graph that involves singleton and pairwise costs. Singleton potentials measure the support from the data (surface or image-based) with respect to the model parameters, while pairwise constraints encode geometrical dependencies between vertebrae.

A graph of interest points clusters is constructed and we use the matrix of commute times between the different nodes of the graph to obtain a description of their relative arrangement that is robust to large intra class variation. The obtained high dimensional representation is then embedded in a space of lower dimension by exploiting the spectral properties of the graph made of the different images. Classification tasks can be performed in this embedding space. We expose classification and labelling results obtained on three different datasets, including the challenging PASCAL VOC2007 dataset. The performances of our approach compare favorably with the standard bag of features, which is a particular case of our representation.",

However, it can suffer from low spatial and temporal resolution while animal deformable displacements could also degrade significantly the localization of the measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to perform fusion of cinematic flow and optical imaging towards enhancement of the biological signal. To this end, fusion is reformulated as a population (all vs. all) registration problem where the two (being spatially aligned) signals are registered in time using the same deformation field. Implicit silhouette and landmark matching are considered for the cinematic images and are combined with global statistical congealing-type measurements of the optical one.

The relatively slow rotation speed of C-arm systems involves motion artifacts that limit the use of three-dimensional imaging in interventional procedures. The main contribution of this paper is a reconstruction algorithm that deals with the temporal variations due to intra-arterial injections. Based on a compressed-sensing approach, we propose a multiple phase reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. The algorithm was evaluated by qualitative and quantitative assessment of image quality on both numerical phantom experiments and clinical data from vascular C-arm systems. In this latter case, motion artifacts reduction was obtained in spite of the cone-beam geometry, the short-scan acquisition, and the truncated and subsampled data.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we will propose a novel variational framework for speckle removal in ultrasound images. Our method combines efficiently a fidelity to data term adapted to the Rayleigh distribution of the speckle and a novel spatio-temporal smoothness constraint. The regularization relies on a non parametric image model that describes the observed image structure and express inter-dependencies between pixels in space and time. The interaction between pixels is determined through the definition of new measure of similarity between them to better reflect image content. To compute this similarity measure, we take into consideration the spatial aspect as well as the temporal one. Experiments were carried on both synthetic and real data and the results show the potential of our method.1. Introduction. Ultrasound imaging is a popular non invasive and low cost technique to observe the dynamical behavior of organs. The produced images inherit a multiplicative component that is the speckle. This signal may contain information useful to medical experts [17]. Nevertheless, for some applications like segmentation or registration the speckle affects the quality of images and complicates the diagnosis task. Therefore, speckle removal could be a tool to obtain better images while preserving details. In the literature, numerous methods for speckle suppression were proposed. Some of them transform the multiplicative noise problem into an additive one by considering the logarithm of the image and assume that the noise is Gaussian [2, 12]. The limitation of such a method lies in the fact that the logarithm function reduces the contrast in the image and makes the \u2026",
