In this work, we consider slippage detection as a binary problem (slip, stable) and we propose a novel set of temporal and frequential features, extracted from force norm profiles and collected during reliable ground truth labeling processes, finally employed within the machine learning classification techniques. Classification performance of the proposed scheme, with respect to its success and generalization ability, is assessed systematically utilizing different performance metrics that clarify class predictions as opposed to most of the reported works. We show that our proposed feature extraction method improves classification performance over the commonly used feature sets, even when trained with one surface, and generalizes successfully to unseen ones. The trained classifier is tested on a completely new task and object, for real-time slippage \u2026",

The proposed controller guarantees compliance of the operated manipulator strictly within preselected spatial limits. Specifically, by introducing a nonlinear stiffness term into the control design, the manipulator is prevented from colliding with an explicitly defined hard boundary, like a human being or a fragile object. When operating in spatial regions sufficiently away from the boundary the manipulator behaves as if it were operated via a linear stiffness impedance controller, thus preserving in these regions its compliance and convergence characteristics. A comparative simulation with a linear stiffness impedance controller is performed to verify and clarify the proposed approach.",

During surgery, it is important to constraint the motion of the instrument not to stress the incision wall to avoid injuring the patient. Hence the incision point is desired to act like a remote center of motion (RCM). The breathing or/and heartbeat function means that the incision point is time-varying. With a general purpose manipulator such desired RCM should be actively imposed by the control function. In this work, we propose a control scheme that achieves this objective for hands-on procedures in which the robot is directly manipulated by the surgeon. The proposed control scheme is proved to satisfy the moving RCM constraint while the controlled robot is passive under the exertion of a human generalized force.

Fingertip rolling is essential for robot object fine positioning and manipulation and should be explicitly considered as a control objective. The prescribed performance control methodology is employed. Under the designed controller, the sliding and spinning regime of the robot tip motion is quickly suppressed, a desired position and normal force is reached with prespecified transient and steady state behavior while contact maintenance is guaranteed. Simulations validate the approach.",

This work attempts to fill this need by proposing a control law that, starting from an initial contact state which does not necessarily correspond to an equilibrium, achieves dynamically a stable grasp and a relative finger orientation in the case of pinching an object with arbitrary shape via rolling soft fingertips. Controlling relative finger orientation may improve grasping force manipulability and allow the appropriate shaping of the composite object consisted of the distal links and the object, for facilitating subsequent tasks. The proposed controller utilizes only finger proprioceptive measurements and is not based on the system model. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller with objects of different shapes.",

To gain a physical insight into the problem, consideration is restricted to the case that the motion of the whole system is confined to a horizontal plane. Secondly on the basis of the derived model it is shown that the rotation of the object can be indirectly controlled by the change of positions of the center points of both contact areas on the object. Then, each of the center points of contact areas can be positioned by inclining the last link of each corresponding finger against the object. It is further shown that, when both forces of pressing the object becomes almost equal, the equation of motion of the object in terms of rotational angles assumes the form of a harmonic oscillator with a forcing term, which can be regulated coordinately \u2026",

A position controller is used for the free motion and a force controller for the contact task and the goal is to stabilize the robot in contact with the spring-like environment while exerting a desired force. As the robot makes or breaks contact, the control law switches accordingly and the aim is to examine the system's stability using ideas from hybrid stability theory. By considering typical candidate Lyapunov functions for each of the two discrete system states, conditions on feedback gains are derived that guarantee Lyapunov stability of the hybrid task. It is shown that conditions can be decoupled with respect to the discrete state only when the more general hybrid stability theorems are used.",

Control parameter selection is merely confined in achieving admissible input torques.

            "Abstract": "Prehensile robotic grasping of a target object in clutter is challenging because, in such conditions, the target touches other objects, resulting to the lack of collision free grasp affordances. To address this problem, we propose a modular reinforcement learning method which uses continuous actions to totally singulate the target object from its surrounding clutter. A high level policy selects between pushing primitives, which are learned separately. Prior knowledge is effectively incorporated into learning, through action primitives and feature selection, increasing sample efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the singulation task. Furthermore, although training is performed in simulation the learned policy is robustly transferred to a real environment without a significant drop in success rate. Finally, singulation tasks in different environments \u2026",

The basic frequency of the periodic movement in the operational space is determined using adaptive frequency oscillators with Fourier approximation. The multi-dimensionality issue of the demonstrated movement is handled by using a common canonical system and the attractor landscape is learned online with periodic Dynamic Movement Primitives. Based on the robot\u2019s tracking error and the operator\u2019s applied force, we continuously adjust the adaptation rate of the frequency and the waveform learning during the demonstration, as well as the target stiffness of the robot, while progressive automation is achieved. In this way, we enable the operator to intervene and demonstrate either small modifications or entirely new tasks and seamless transition between guided and autonomous operation of the robot, without distinguishing among a learning and a reproduction phase. The proposed method is verified experimentally with an operator demonstrating periodic tasks in the freespace and in contact with the environment for wiping a surface.",

A sufficient condition that ensures that the robot will remain in contact with the surface is derived involving the system's velocity at the time of contact",

In such conditions, the target object touches or is covered by adjacent obstacle objects, thus rendering traditional grasping techniques ineffective.

The basic frequency of the periodic movement in the operational space is determined using adaptive frequency oscillators with Fourier approximation. The multi-dimensionality issue of the demonstrated movement is handled by using a common canonical system and the attractor landscape is learned online with periodic Dynamic Movement Primitives. Based on the robot\u2019s tracking error and the operator\u2019s applied force, we continuously adjust the adaptation rate of the frequency and the waveform learning during the demonstration, as well as the target stiffness of the robot, while progressive automation is achieved. In this way, we enable the operator to intervene and demonstrate either small modifications or entirely new tasks and seamless transition between guided and autonomous operation of the robot, without distinguishing among a learning and a reproduction phase. The proposed method is verified experimentally with an operator demonstrating periodic tasks in the freespace and in contact with the environment for wiping a surface.",

            "Abstract": "Recent research results propose a series of recommendations on how to develop courses which can be taught to multicultural virtual classes over the Internet with the purpose of enhancing the learning process. According to these recommendations, learning is enhanced if synchronous lectures, feedback quizzes, simulations and tele-lab operations are combined during teaching sessions. Current state of the art technology of e-learning software seems to be able to support all these activities with the exception of that of the simulation and tele-lab operations. In this work, it is demonstrated that it is quite feasible to design courses which involve all the above mentioned activities by using the provided services of the current state of the art e-learning environments and adding custom made software modules for the simulation and tele-lab operations. Two experimental courses were developed, namely one in Robotics and the other in Satellite Communications in which the feasibility of combining all the mentioned above activities was first investigated. The courses were delivered to an international and multicultural class of students who were spatially located to different places in Europe and communicating over the Internet by a current state of the art synchronous e-learning environment. Based on interviews and questionnaires, students\u2019 and tutors\u2019 evaluation of the extend to which the considered activities are realizable and improve the learning. process was recorded and is reported in this paper.",

The ability of the proposed model to accurately reproduce the behavior is demonstrated through simulations and experiments.

A singularity free DMP formulation for orientation in the Cartesian space is proposed by Ude et al.[1] and has been largely adopted by the research community. In this work, we demonstrate the undesired oscillatory behavior that may arise when controlling the robot\u2019s orientation with this formulation, producing a motion pattern highly deviant from the desired and highlight its source. A correct formulation is then proposed that alleviates such problems while guaranteeing generation of orientation parameters that lie in SO (3). We further show that all aspects and advantages of DMP including ease of learning, temporal and spatial scaling and the ability to include coupling terms are maintained in the proposed formulation. Simulations and experiments with robot control in SO (3) are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed formulation and compare it with the previously adopted one.",

It is theoretically shown and demonstrated by a simulation study that the proposed controller can guarantee tracking of the desired joint position trajectory with a priori determined accuracy, overshoot and speed of response.

Additionally, we utilize an online estimate of the normal vector to the plane, so that the robot is able to quickly adapt to rotated hinged surfaces such as a window or a door. Using the framework of progressive automation for compliance adaptation, the robot transitions seamlessly and bi-directionally between hand guidance and autonomous operation within few repetitions of the task.

The equilibrium conditions are derived from the system dynamics and depend on the deformation and on the kind of elastic material with regard to the fingertip's rolling distance characteristics. Equilibrium conditions of the three contacted bodies (elastic fingertips-object) show that in general no-collinear interaction forces act on the object's surface and they correspond to the equilibrium of an \"internal object\" hold by two point contacts with friction.",

Firstly, we assume that the environment imposes a purely kinematic rolling constraint on the end-effector motion in the tangent direction of the contacted surface. This implies no energy transfer or dissipation between the fingertip and the environment due to frictional forces. On the other hand, we assume that it is feasible for the fingertip to slip in which case pure rolling motion could be disturbed. The two different models are subsequently used to show by simulation that control laws, which have been designed on a rolling constraint dynamic model for frictional forces, fail to perform rolling in various environments.

In particular, three grasp strategies are proposed which aim to pinch small flat objects from different scenes. The framework uses representations of the robotic hand, the support surface and the target object which encapsulate rough information for the scene. Furthermore, the strategies exploit the environmental constraint of the support surface by establishing compliant contact with it, which leads to increased robustness against object geometry uncertainties as well as pose estimation errors possibly introduced by the perception system. This is inspired by how humans perform relative grasping tasks with object pose and geometry uncertainties by using compliant contact with the support surfaces.

A proportional derivative position controller with gravity compensation is used for the free motion and a parallel force/position controller for the contact task. The goal is to stabilise the robot in contact with the environment, exert a desired force and place the end-effector at a desired position. The robot is modelled as a switched system, and its stability is examined using hybrid stability theory by considering typical candidate Lyapunov functions for each of the two discrete system states. The stability analysis reveals that extra conditions involving control gains and control targets should be satisfied in order to guarantee asymptotic stability of the switched task in a Lyapunov sense.
