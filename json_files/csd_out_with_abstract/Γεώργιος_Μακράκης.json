Assuming that the waves propagate in a narrow cone around the z direction (paraxial propagation), we decompose the wave function [20],[33],[14] in the form u (x, y, z)= exp (ikz) \u03c8 (z, x, y),(1.2) where \u03c8= \u03c8 (z, x, y) is the slowly varying component of the wave field with respect to the main direction of of propagation ie|\u2202 2 z \u03c8|\u226a 2k|\u2202 z\u03c8|.

Acoustic signals propagating for long distances in the water column and reflections of underwater sound from the ocean boundaries provide novel problems of interpretation and inversion. The chapters in this volume discuss some of the contemporary aspects of these problems. They provide recent and useful results for bottom recognition, inverse scattering in acoustic wave guides, and ocean acoustic tomography, as well as a discussion of some of the new algorithms, such as those related to matched-field processing, that have recently been used for inverting experimental data.

The kernel of the intermediate condition is approximated by a uniform stationary phase formula taking account of the possible coalescence of the brach points of the integrand with the stationary points of the phase, and it leads to a non-local boundary condition of Volterra-type for the parabolic equation.

We employ the so-called harmonic approximation of the Schr odinger eigenfunctions for single-well potentials in configuration space, to construct an asymptotic expansion of the solution of the Wigner equation. This expansion is a perturbation of the Wigner function of a harmonic oscillator but it is not a genuine semiclassical expansion because the correctors depend on the semiclassical parameter. However, it suggests the selection of a novel ansatz for the solution of the Wigner equation, which leads to an efficient regular perturbation scheme in phase space. The validity of the approximation is proved for particular classes of initial data. The proposed ansatz is applied for computing the energy density of a a quartic oscillator on caustics (focal points). The results are compared with those derived from the so-called classical approximation whose principal term is the solution of Liouville equation with the same initial data. It turns out that the results are in good approximation when the coupling constant of the anharmonic potential has certain dependence on the semiclassical parameter.",

We compare these fields, with those predicted by the geometrical optics, for a couple of model problems: first, the cusp generated by the evolution of a parabolic initial front in a homogeneous medium, a problem which arises in the high-frequency treatment of cylindrical aberrations, and second, the cusp formed by refraction of the rays emitted from a point source in a stratified medium with a weak interface.

            "Abstract": "We consider semi-classical time evolution for the phase space Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation and present two methods of constructing short time asymptotic solutions. The first method consists of constructing a semi-classical phase space propagator in terms of semi-classical Gaussian wave packets on the basis of the Anisotropic Gaussian Approximation, related to the Nearby Orbit Approximation, by which we derive an asymptotic solution for configuration space WKB initial data. The second method consists of constructing a phase space narrow beam asymptotic solution, following the Complex WKB Theory developed by Maslov, on the basis of a canonical system in double phase space related to the Berezin-Shubin-Marinov Hamilton-Jacobi and transport equations. We illustrate the methods for sub-quadratic potentials in .",

            "Abstract": "It is well known that although the usual harmonic ansatz of geometrical optics fails near a caustic, uniform expansions can be found which remain valid in the neighborhood of the caustic, and reduce asymptotically to the usual geometric field far enough from it. Such expansions can be constructed by several methods which make essentially use of the symplectic structure of the phase space.  In this paper we efficiently apply the Kravtsov\u2013Ludwig method of relevant functions, in conjunction with Hamiltonian ray tracing to define the topology of the caustics and compute high-frequency scalar wave fields near smooth and cusp caustics.  We use an adaptive Runge\u2013Kutta method to successfully retrieve the complete ray field in the case of piecewise smooth refraction indices. We efficiently match the geometric and modified amplitudes of the multi-valued field to obtain numerically the correct asymptotic behavior of the \u2026",

Using the displacement formulation and applying WKB, we show that although the problem is formally a singular perturbation problem, it can be reduced to a regular one, and we construct a regular expansion for the elastodynamic field in the bottom. The same results come out using alternative formulations, based either on Lam\u00e8 potentials or on the Love function. The later formulation appears to have independent interest, as it explains why the problem under investigation does not fall in the existing framework of coercive singular perturbations which appear in one-dimensional elasticity.",

The DtN map is the map which maps the pressure applied on the boundary of this region to the corresponding flux (displacement). In an analogous geometric configuration and with similar boundary conditions, the uniqueness for the inverse electroconductivity problem from the DtN map (i.e. voltage\u2010to\u2010current map) can be proved in the same framework.

The Wigner equation retains terms of any order with respect to the small parameter, and contrary to the moment equations derived form the classical Liouville equation, it provides a hierarchy of conservation equations which is uniformly valid when the wave field develops caustics. We confirm the validity of the equations with analytical examples for simple caustics, namely the focal points of a harmonic oscillator and the fold caustic generated from the initial data in the case of the free Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We also make some new observations concerning the relation of the derived conservation equations with those coming from the application of Noether's variational theorem.

This problem is commonly studied via the WKB method. An alternative method is based on the limit Wigner measure. This approach recovers geometrical optics, but, like the WKB method, it fails at caustics. To remedy this deficiency we employ the semiclassical Wigner function which is a formal asymptotic approximation of the scaled Wigner function but also a regularization of the limit Wigner measure. We obtain Airy-type asymptotics for the semiclassical Wigner function. This representation is shown to be exact in the context of concrete examples. In these examples we compute both the semiclassical and the limit Wigner function, as well as the amplitude of the wave field near a fold or a cusp caustic, which evolve naturally from suitable initial data.",

The broadband approximation results by applying the stationary-phase method to the Fourier transform of the Green's function, expressed in terms of normal modes. The narrowband approximation is obtained by incorporating the shape function of the emitted signal \u2014 assumed Gaussian \u2014 into the phase term and applying the steepest-descent method. The roots of the frequency-derivative of the phase are located in the complex plane by using a second-order expansion of the eigenvalues. The performance of the two approximations is studied numerically. While the broadband approximation improves with increasing bandwidth, the narrowband approximation improves when the bandwidth decreases. Both approximations improve with increasing range, and they can be used for \u2026",

We then use a result due to H\u00f6rmander, which permits using the formula for the commutation of a pseudodifferential operator with Maslov\u2019s canonical operator to \u201cmove\u201d the compactly supported amplitudes outside the canonical operator and thus obtain effective formulas preserving the structure based on the Airy and Bessel functions.
