Indeed, due to the heterogeneity of such investments and due to the immaturity of the market, the entry into this business is unattractive for many financial institutions, although energy efficiency projects can often present a guaranteed return. The aim of this chapter is to propose a methodological framework on energy efficiency investments and robust financing programs/models in targeted case study countries that will act as first-of-a-kind demonstration for the banks, institutional investors, and asset managers, with the use of approaches based on knowledge transfer and capacity building among key actors. The experience gathered from in-country demonstration will also facilitate and accelerate the replicability where findings could then be used to lead to concrete recommendations \u2026",

Individual preferences are aggregated by appropriate operators and a group parameter set is produced which is used as input for the classification algorithm. NeXClass multicriteria classification algorithm is applied for the classification, initially at a training set of alternatives and later at the entire set. Finally, group members evaluate results and consensus as well as satisfaction metrics are calculated. In case of low acceptance level, problem parameters are redefined by group members and aggregation phase is repeated. Finally, we present an illustrative example of the methodology, demonstrating its application to real world problems. The methodology has been applied to classification problems in business environment, with results depicting its validity for such problems.

EParticipation aims to enhance citizen involvement in public governance activities through the use of information and communication technologies. An innovative approach towards this objective is exploiting the potentials of semantic web technologies centred on conceptual knowledge models in the form of ontologies. Ontologies are generally defined as explicit human and computer shared views on the world of particular domains. In this paper, the potentials and benefits of using ontologies for policy deliberation processes are discussed. Previous work is then extended and synthesised to develop a deliberation ontology. The ontology aims to define the necessary semantics in order to structure and interrelate the stages and various activities of deliberation \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In alignment with the European Union\u2019s legislation, Greece submitted its final 10-year National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) in December 2019, setting more ambitious energy and climate targets than those originally proposed in the draft version of the document. Apart from higher penetration of renewable energy sources (RES), the final NECP projects also zero carbon use in power generation till 2030. Although decarbonization has long been regarded beneficial for economies that base their energy production on coal, as it is the case with Greece, the macroeconomic and societal ramifications of faster transitions to carbon-free economies remain highly unexplored. Under this context, in this paper, we soft-link energy models, namely Times-Greece and Primes, with a macroeconomic model, namely Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), to measure the effects of the final and draft NECPs on the Greek economy and evaluate the impact of higher decarbonization speeds. We find that the faster transition scenario displays both economic and societal merits, increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and household income by about 1% and 7%, respectively. View Full-Text",

The need for supply of electricity is getting greater year by year. In addition, climate change problems and the limited fossil resources require new sustainable electricity generation options, which utilize Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and are economical in the meantime. Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) generation is a proven renewable energy technology that has the potential to become costeffective in the future. This analysis explores for Chile the potential of CSP to deliver key energy services for the country. The specific technology has a significant technical potential within Chile, but \u2018somehow\u2019do not receive sufficient attention from relevant stakeholders, because of gaps either in stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the technology or in domestic research and development (R&D) and/or public/private investment. The aim of this paper is to establish a well-informed discussion on the feasibility and potential of the specific sustainable energy technology, namely the CSP technology, within a given country context and particularly Chile. It provides an overview of the fundamental (macro-economic) forces within an economy and identifies some of the blockages and barriers that can be expected when introducing a new technology.",

            "Abstract": "In the era of digitisation, innovative technologies and Information & Communication Technology (ICT) systems have transformed many areas and domains. The same cannot be said for Higher Education, especially as this concerns the certification of degrees, qualifications and other accreditations of students and job seekers that are still largely in paper form and require manual and time-consuming processes. Given that such documents are pertinent not only for education purposes but also for the job market and Human Resources-related (HR) processes of private and public organisations, there is a growing need for automatic and trustworthy systems that can handle qualification certification while at the same time providing added value for the job market. This paper is written under the context of the European Union (EU)-funded project QualiChain that aspires to investigate the impact of disruptive technologies, such as blockchain, semantics, data analytics and gamification in the domain of public education, as well as the interfaces of the latter with the fields of private education, the labour market, and public sector administrative procedures.. The scope of this publication is to perform a landscape analysis on commercial tools and frameworks that operate in the aforementioned domains and compare them to the projected functionality of the QualiChain platform.",

In this framework, the Computerised Model for Intelligent Energy Management (CMIEM) can constitute a powerful technical tool in the hands of the final energy users, because it is a diagnostic mean of required energy consuming equipment, in order to improve the energy efficiency. The CMIEM has the potential of estimating the energy indicators and designing the energy consumption net.

The Government Interoperability Maturity Matrix (GIMM) that is proposed in this paper aims to provide administrations with a simple, self-evaluation method that can be used to assess the current status of the administrations concerning eGovernment interoperability and the steps that need to be taken to improve their positioning in respect to system implementation and services provision to citizens and businesses. The paper expands the three types of interoperability considered in the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) identifying several Interoperability Attributes that need to be taken into consideration in order to evaluate each organisation positioning in eGovernment interoperability and presents the rational of the Methodology that has been formulated and introduced. Within this modeling context, levels of existing interoperability status of organisations are clearly defined, while certain practices or directions lead to interoperability state changes within the maturity matrix.",

However, contrary to the theoretical expectations of the classical approach, the tests achieved on most financial markets have revealed the existence of more variables, beyond those of risk and return. Moreover, the conventional theory does not take into consideration the investor's specific preferences and behavioural aspects. Under this rationale, the problem of selecting an attractive portfolio is a multicriteria issue, which should be tackled by using appropriate techniques. It is our purpose in this paper to show that the modelling framework of multiobjective mathematical programming (MMP) constitutes the most solid methodological basis for resolving the inherent multidimensional nature of the portfolio selection problem.

            "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes a neurodegenerative disease with serious consequences to peoples' everyday lives, if it is not diagnosed early since there is no available cure. Because of the cost of examinations for diagnosing dementia, i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG) signals etc., current work has been focused on diagnosing dementia from spontaneous speech. However, little work has been done regarding the conversion of speech data to Log-Mel spectrograms and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and the usage of pretrained models. Concurrently, little work has been done in terms of both the usage of transformer networks and the way the two modalities, i.e., speech and transcripts, are combined in a single neural network. To address these limitations, first we employ several pretrained models, with Vision Transformer (ViT) achieving the highest evaluation results. Secondly, we propose multimodal models. More specifically, our introduced models include Gated Multimodal Unit in order to control the influence of each modality towards the final classification and crossmodal attention so as to capture in an effective way the relationships between the two modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models and their superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.",

At the same time, such conditions bring into the spotlight and set priority to measures targeting the ICT sector and promoting ICT-based innovation as a means of pursuing economic recovery. The 2008 financial crisis affected severely several parts of the world and particularly the Mediterranean region, where, even today, several years after the start of this economic turmoil in Europe, finding an effective response to mitigating the consequences of recession is still pertinent. Building on previous literature that recognizes ICT-based innovation as a crisis mitigation enabler, this paper propels discussion on the association among ICT- and innovation-oriented \u2026",

Therefore, SMEs should enhance their current business model in a way that would give them a competitive advantage. This paper presents work from the European-funded research project ToyLabs that aims to build on this identified need to establish a new, collaborative value chain for product development in the toy industry, with business interoperability playing a key role in this quest. The methodology engages toy manufacturers, FabLabs, toy safety experts and end customers in the product design workflow to create new, safe customer-centred and market-targeted toys that are ready to be certified and put into production. For achieving the goals of this approach, the methodology behind the ToyLabs platform focuses on the incorporation of cross-sectorial business \u2026",

Distribution transformers constitute the most important technical component of an electrical distribution network. The purpose of this paper is to assess the cost to the Greek economy, deriving from failures of distribution transformers due to induced overvoltages and thefts. The effects stemming from distribution transformer failures to the economy are investigated in the following three sectors: service (tourism, banks, commerce, private and public services), residential and agricultural sector. The above issue and underlying policy matters are of vital importance, especially in the case of the periphery\u2019s highly indebted countries. Finally, a computational model is introduced in order to quantify the relative cost and analytical results are illustrated and discussed.",

Renewable energy projects require high up-front expenditures including, in many cases, considerable financing costs. The main objective of this paper is to elaborate and apply a methodology that allows assessing the most important risk categories related to renewable energy investments. The cornerstone of this approach is the weighted average cost of capital, which has been extracted for new onshore wind projects in EU-28 member states based on diverse methods e.g. Capital Asset Pricing Model. Moreover, to validate the model results, a series of interviews with renewable energy project developers and financers across the EU has been conducted. The results show that, following the country risk, policy-related risks exert the highest impact on the cost of capital. Moreover \u2026",

Mainstreaming EE financing is considered a key priority to avert climate change. The lack of evidence on the performance, commonly agreed procedures and standards for EE investments, particularly during the first stages of investment generation and pre-selection/pre-evaluation, are the key problems hampering EE investment financing. It is also true that often project developers do not have the expertise or resources to make a convincing financing case for investors. In order to boost EE investments, this paper proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology intending to support financing institutions to identify attractive EE project ideas in the early development phase of project initiation and planning.

However, the benefits have not been seen by the vast majority of the population, particularly Peru's rural population. Virtually all of the nation's rural health-care centres are cut off from the rest of the country, so access to care for most people is not only difficult but also costly. MEDNET attempts to redress this issue by developing a medical health network with the help of the collaboration medical application based on TeleConsult & @HOME medical database for vital signs. The expected benefits include improved support for medics in the field, reduction of patient referrals, reduction in number of emergency interventions and improved times for medical diagnosis. An important caveat is the emphasis on exploiting the proposed infrastructure for education and social enterprise initiatives. The \u2026",

According to modern portfolio theory, comparisons between portfolios are generally made using two criteria, corresponding to the first two moments of the return distributions, namely the expected return and portfolio variance. One criticism over this model, which has often been addressed by both practitioners and academics, is that it fails to embody the objectives of the DM, through the various stages of the decision process.

We then utilize a nonlinear optimization model to generate portfolios comprising stocks classified as those with the optimal characteristics, during the first stage. Finally, the portfolios designed at the previous stage are evaluated by using a wide set of well-known sophisticated evaluation criteria. The preferences and experiences of professionals and experts in the field of portfolio management were taken into consideration throughout all stages of the process.

Nowadays, the liberalization of energy markets and the deterioration of the climate, in combination with the non-stop crude oil price increase, have had a decisive influence on the development of the above sectors. Indeed, one of the most important elements for the RES and EE development is the enhancement of energy producers by RES and ESCOs respectively.

The message is clear: across the globe, transparency and accountability are critical to restore trust and reverse the tide of corruption. Without them, global policy solutions to many global crises are at risk. Increase in transparency in public administration cannot be achieved simply by the introduction and spread of web-based e-Government technology. Introduction of e-Government without the corresponding institutional reform in the civil service system and organizational reform in the agencies may only lead to limited success in enhancing accountability. Therefore the effect of technology on organizational change should never be overstated. It is simply a myth that e-Government will automatically and dramatically change the accountability nature of public organizations.

Fuzzy logic (FL) is a method for understanding, quantifying and dealing with vague, ambiguous and uncertain characteristics, ideas and judgments. In more specific terms, what is central about fuzzy logic is that, unlike classical logical systems, it aims at modelling the imprecise modes of reasoning that play essential role in the remarkable human ability to make rational decisions in an environment of uncertainty and imprecision.

Nevertheless, the abstract and multidimensional nature of prosperity, weaknesses around their definition from a methodological perspective and concerns on their legitimacy among other factors pose difficulties on the exploitation of prosperity indicators for public debate. This paper reviews the usage of prosperity indicators in policy making, bringing up developments, trends and concerns around their conceptualization and use. It further presents the Policy Compass approach, which provides an observatory for experimentation with prosperity indicators with the view of influencing the policy-making process at the local and regional level, and thus contributing towards the vision of more responsive governance.",

In addition, the model's impact on the energy consumption and indoor quality of a typical office building in Greece is presented. The model can control how the building operational data deviates from the settings as well as carry out diagnosis of internal conditions and optimize building's energy operation. In this context, the integrated \u201cdecision support model\u201d can contribute to the management of the daily energy operations of a typical building, related to the energy consumption, by incorporating the following requirements in the best possible way: (a) the guarantee of the desirable levels of living quality in all building's rooms and (b) the necessity for energy savings.",

            "Abstract": "Citizen sensing applications need to have a number of users defined that ensures their effectiveness. This is not a straightforward task because neither the relationship between the size of the userbase or its effectiveness is easily quantified, nor is it clear which threshold for the number of users would make the application \u2018effective\u2019. This paper presents an approach for estimating the number of users needed for location-based crowdsourcing applications to work successfully, depending on the use case, the circumstances, and the criteria of success. It circumvents various issues, ethical or practical, in performing real-world controlled experiments and tackles this challenge by developing an agent-based modelling and simulation framework. This framework is tested on a specific scenario, that of missing children and the search for them. The search is performed with the contribution of citizens being made aware of the disappearance through a mobile application. The result produces an easily reconfigurable testbed for the effectiveness of citizen sensing mobile applications, allowing the study of the marginal utility of new users of the application. The resulting framework aims to be the digital twin of a real urban scenario, and it has been designed to be easily adapted and support decisions on the feasibility, evaluation, and targeting of the deployment of spatial crowdsourcing applications.",

Although huge infrastructural projects for the development of interconnections are at several stages, the associated transmission burdens are not yet fully incorporated in the respective socioeconomic analysis. In this respect, the aim of this paper is to present a collective summary of electricity transmission burdens and their associated impacts. To increase coherence, the burdens have been classified in the following categories: transmission losses; electromagnetic fields; infrastructure; visual intrusion; noise; interruption of supply; land use; ecosystems; and property values. Moreover, the burdens relation with transmission technologies and associated impacts are illustrated in original overview tables. Copyright \u00a9 \u2026",

As we are moving into an era of \"knowledge capitalism\", knowledge management in combination with information management will play a fundamental role towards the success of transforming individual knowledge into organizational knowledge. Higher education (HE) institutions are in the knowledge business, since they are involved in knowledge creation, dissemination and learning. The increasing economic importance of knowledge, which nowadays redefines the links among education, work and learning, makes the role of KM in HE crucial.In this framework, this paper presents the key concepts of human-computer interaction in knowledge management, discusses their applicability to HE and proposes the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The need to support the search for cost-effective climate policy instruments at the EU level was emphasised in recent years by worrying trends in GHGs. Nowadays, more than half of current 25-EU member states are headed towards substantially exceeding their agreed share of the total allowed emissions. In this framework, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) proposal was established by Directive 2003/87/EC on 13th October 2003. Based on the Directive, all countries were required to submit National Allocation Plans (NAPs). The EU-ETS finally came into force on 1st January 2005, covering the period 2005 - 2007. The successful implementation of EU-ETS is of crucial importance, since it could provide evidence of EU's capabilities in acting as a frontrunner in the development of climate change strategies and implementation of novel climate change abatement instruments. In this context, the aim of the paper is to identify important factors of the EU-ETS based on the main directions member states will follow. In particular, the description of the recent developments that are related to the announcements of NAP's documents, the constraints as well as the perspectives of an integrated EU-ETS based on the expected new avenue that will be opened are examined. 27 refs., 2 figs.",

Ranking of the alternatives and selection of the most efficient and suitable access network to meet the QoS requirements of a specific service, as these are defined by the user, constitutes thus an important issue. Decisions on which network to connect to are however difficult to be reached, since multiple factors of different relative importance have to be taken into consideration. This paper addresses this difficulty by adopting Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods. Fuzzy AHP, a MADM method, is initially applied to determine the weights of certain Quality of Service indicators that act as the criteria impacting the decision process. The fuzzy extension of the method, and consequently the use of fuzzy numbers, is adopted in order to incorporate the existence of fuzziness as a \u2026",

It implements a novel classification algorithm based on multicriteria analysis and fuzzy preference relations. More detailed, assignment to classes is based on the concept of category threshold, which defines at what degree an alternative can be included in a specific category. For each category a threshold is defined by the corresponding decision maker, which indicates its lower limit with respect to the evaluation criteria. Actions are then evaluated according to the criteria and fuzzy inclusion degrees are calculated for each category. Finally, an action is assigned to the category for which the inclusion degree is the maximum. The DSS implements the above classification algorithm, providing a user-friendly interface \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Derivatives pricing models have been widely applied in the financial industry for building software systems for pricing derivative instruments. However, most of the research work on financial derivatives is concentrated on computational models and formulas. There is little guidance for quantitative developers on how to apply these models successfully in order to build robust, efficient and extensible software applications. The present paper proposes an innovative design of a web-based application for real-time financial derivatives pricing, which is entirely based on design patterns, both generic and web-based application specific. Presentation tier, business tier and integration tier patterns are applied. Financial derivatives, underlying instruments and portfolios are modelled. Some of the principal models for evaluating derivatives (Black\u2013Scholes, binomial trees, Monte Carlo simulation) are incorporated. Arbitrage opportunities and portfolio rebalancing requirements are detected in real time with the help of a notification mechanism. The novelty in this paper is that the latest trends in software engineering, such as the development of webbased applications, the adoption of multi-tiered architectures and the use of design patterns, are combined with financial engineering concepts to produce design elements for software applications for derivatives pricing. Although our design best applies to the popular J2EE technology, its flexibility allows many of the principles presented to be adopted by web-based applications implemented with alternative technologies.

            "Abstract": "In alignment with the European Union\u2019s legislation, Greece submitted its final 10-year National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) in December 2019, setting more ambitious energy and climate targets than those originally proposed in the draft version of the document. Apart from higher penetration of renewable energy sources (RES), the final NECP projects also zero carbon use in power generation till 2030. Although decarbonization has long been regarded beneficial for economies that base their energy production on coal, as it is the case with Greece, the macroeconomic and societal ramifications of faster transitions to carbon-free economies remain highly unexplored. Under this context, in this paper, we soft-link energy models, namely Times-Greece and Primes, with a macroeconomic model, namely Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), to measure the effects of the final and draft NECPs on the Greek economy and evaluate the impact of higher decarbonization speeds. We find that the faster transition scenario displays both economic and societal merits, increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and household income by about 1% and 7%, respectively.",

The necessity to take into account several decision parameters apart from purely economic ones, such as socio-political, technical, institutional and environmental, lead to the use of multicriteria methods instead of single uni-criterion ones. Moreover, most of the times such decisions are taken in a group environment. A hybrid of ELECTRE III and PROMETHEE methods, MURAME, has been specially developed and constitutes the main part of an integrated project ranking methodology for groups. The experience of the application of the methodology in the Armenian energy sector is presented.",

A comprehensive analysis of the capabilities and potential of these initiatives is currently missing from the recent research literature. In order to address this gap, the paper at hand aims towards analyzing the landscape of Open Governmental Data in the European Union from a functional, semantic and technical perspective. Our research focused on the collection and categorization of an indicative number of public data sources for each of the 27 European Union country-members through investigating their services and characteristics. By modeling and classifying the data sources according to their key attributes, we were able to proceed to their statistical analysis and assessment in terms of their content, licensing, multilingual support, acquisition, ease of access, provision and data format. Our results portray the current quality of Public Sector Information infrastructures and highlight what still needs to be done in order to make public data truly open and readily available for researchers, citizens, companies and innovation in general.",

The aim of this paper is to present an alternative methodological approach for modelling one of the most crucial phases of the portfolio management process, the security evaluation phase. The main characteristic of the proposed approach is that it fully takes into account the inherent multidimensional nature of the problem, while allowing the DM to incorporate his preferences in the decision process.

Actual CDM practice has shown that projects are largely initiated by the demand for relatively low-cost certified emission reductions, leading to a series of ad-hoc projects, rather than serving the overall host countries' sustainable development needs and priorities. In the above framework, the study aims to direct CDM towards national sustainable development priorities, through the identification of sustainable energy technology priorities for electricity generation in five examined developing countries, namely Chile, China, Israel, Kenya and Thailand. The current approach lays emphasis on the formulation of the process so as to be relatively straightforward to incorporate direct experts' preferences as well as trying to deal with the needs of flexibility and validity \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The foundations of a policy framework for renewable energy sources until 2020 were laid by the European Parliament and Council in 2009, with Directive 2009/28/EC. This Directive advocated an overall, EU-wide target of 20% renewables by 2020. This target was broken down into legally binding national targets. National policy instruments have since been created and adapted to support the deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) at member state level. There is clear evidence of progress towards the 2020 target: the EU-wide share of renewables in gross final energy consumption increased from 8.5% in 2004 to 16.0% in 2014.Yet both the effectiveness and the economic efficiency of the various national support policies vary greatly from country to country. Effective policy instruments are able to trigger investments in the targeted amount of renewables while economically efficient policies ensure that the target is met at low cost. It is in this context, that the DiaCore project has been set up.",

            "Abstract": "In the era of digitisation, innovative information and communication technologies have transformed many areas and domains. The same cannot be said for Higher Education, especially as this concerns the certification of degrees, qualifications, and other accreditations of students and job seekers. Such certificates are still largely in paper form and require manual and time-consuming processes for their verification. The inability to effectively verify academic skills and qualifications also affects labour market processes, such as recruitment and competency management. In addition, current ICT solutions in the domain do not leverage emerging technologies that can offer solutions to existing challenges. Innovative technologies such as blockchain can offer an additional level of security and traceability of actions and data transactions, while semantics can provide the necessary data interoperability that is required for more effective analyses of data. The computational intelligence found in data analytics and decision support systems can facilitate the generation of useful knowledge and recommendations, while gamification can be used to transform processes, like recruitment, that are normally stressful and boring into something that can be intriguing, motivating, enjoyable and engaging. As such, this publication aims to assess blockchain, semantics, data analytics and gamification as four potential game changers that can be used to develop innovative solutions in the domain. Under that context, the potential of these four technologies will be evaluated as well as their current usage in existing solutions in the field. In addition, this publication is written \u2026",

The different layers of Interoperability define in high level the necessary stack for interoperable systems, however, their abstraction level hinders researchers and practitioners to really identify problems and provide solutions, as those levels do not only overlap in many cases, but they also hide important low level aspects that deal with technologies and methods that span across all levels. In order to identify a proper structure for Enterprise Interoperability, which can at a second stage be mapped to the four fundamental layers adapted by the European Interoperability Framework, one has to focus on the real object of observation, which is the \u201cEnterprise\u201d, and by analysing it in its core components to identify the interoperability needs within them. Starting from those core ingredients of an Enterprise, and by analysing the current technological trends and the background knowledge of the domain the present papers presents the twelve main Scientific Themes of Enterprise Interoperability",

The alternatives include onshore and offshore pipeline corridors and LNG shipping, determined after exhaustive investigation of all possible existing and future routes, taking into consideration all possible natural gas infrastructure development projects around Greece. A multicriteria additive value system is assessed via the robust ordinal regression methodology, aiming to support the national energy policy makers to devise favorable strategies, concerning both long-term national natural gas supplies and infrastructure developments. The obtained ranking shows that noticeable alternative corridors for gas passage to Greece do exist both in terms of maritime transport of LNG and in terms of potential future pipeline infrastructure projects.",

            "Abstract": "Cities are becoming more and more of a focal point for our economies and societies, particularly because of the on-going urbanization, and the trend towards increasingly knowledge intensive economies as well as their growing share of resource consumption and emissions. Energy is an essential component of life in the cities, as it supports the whole spectrum of their economic activities and secures a certain level of quality of life to residents. To meet public policy objectives under these circumstances, cities need to change and develop in a smart way, without disregarding the issues of energy efficiency and sustainability. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a Decision Support Framework able to assess and optimize the energy use in Smart Cities. The proposed methodology is addressed to the cities local authorities, so as to optimize the energy use in their premises and achieve significant reduction \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cities are characterized by a concentration of people, communities, activities, flows and impacts leading to severe sustainability challenges. Energy is an essential component of life in cities, as it supports the whole spectrum of their economic activities, and secures a certain level of quality of life to residents. Nowadays cities tend to become \u201cSmarter\u201d, usually disregarding the issues of energy efficiency and sustainability. The current work provides City Authorities with an effective framework to assess the behavior and performance of a City, reflecting the clearly quantifiable energy related indicators, but also the related policy context performance and the integration of Smart infrastructure. The framework can be designed generally for the whole activities spectrum of a city, but it can also be customized per sector, providing more focused information.",

In the proposed method we introduce measures of robustness for Pareto optimal solutions. In this way we can compare them according to their robustness, introducing one more characteristic for the Pareto optimal solution quality. In addition, especially in multi-objective discrete problems, we can detect the most robust Pareto optimal solution among neighboring ones. A computational experiment \u2026",

However, the degree of digitization in the sector is lagging, as certificates are still paper based and verification processes are very time-consuming. While the first Information & Communication Technology (ICT) solutions in these domains have been developed, they are still dependant on issuing organisations and manual processes. Blockchain is one technology that can be considered for developing trustworthy solutions for digital certificates, given its native characteristics for decentralisation, visibility and verification of transactions. Additionally, the computational intelligence found in analytics and decision support can help develop added value services while gamification can help develop more personalised approaches for the stakeholders of such domains. Under this context, the present publication presents QualiChain, an European Union (EU)-funded project that aims to revolutionise the domain of public education, as well as its interfaces with the labour market, policy making and public sector administrative procedures by disrupting the way accredited educational titles and other qualifications are archived, managed, shared and verified.",

A myriad researchers have presented methodologies, frameworks, technologies and have discussed various KM theoretical and practical issues. However, KM still needs extensive development \u2013 it is in its infancy. This paper aims to explore the world of KM in a different way; to review the current status quo and analyze the main agreements and disagreements among researchers and practitioners in order to highlight the key issues which need to be further researched.The authors attempt to review and analyze in a coherent way the main agreements and disagreements among researchers and practitioners \u2013 in the field of KM \u2013 based on a wide range of published works, including papers, books, reports and web \u2026",

The proposed framework combines discrete multiple criteria evaluation methods with a non-linear continuous optimisation model. The preferences and experiences of professionals and experts in the field of portfolio management are strongly taken into consideration, through all the stages of the process. The validity of the above methodology is tested through a large scale illustrative application on the stocks that constitute the FTSE-140 index of the Athens Stock Exchange.",

            "Abstract": "The European Union (EU) aims to prepare its strategy and infrastructure for further decarbonisation of its energy system in the longer term towards 2050. Recent political discussions and research interest focus on ways to accelerate the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies with respect to the targets set for 2030 and 2050. However, the diverse options available that are to be implemented, are policy sensitive and need careful comparative assessment. This paper presents a multi-criteria approach based on an extension of the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) method for group decision-making that incorporates fuzzy set theory in order to evaluate alternative transformation pathways for achieving a sustainable energy system in EU. This assessment aims at providing a direction towards a most preferable pathway concept that should be taken into account by a future model-based analysis of the necessary transformation of our energy sector. The results obtained could support policymakers in drawing effective recommendations based on the findings. The added value of this analysis to policymakers is its contribution to plan climate and energy strategies towards a low-carbon transition pathway by using the information of this approach and prioritizing uncertainties through an environmental and energy perspective.

A number of non-destructive methods have been used in order to evaluate in situ the building envelope's effective thermal transmittance, characterised, however, by long-lasting measurement periods. This paper examines the uncertainty and method limitations to use short-time measurements using an infrared camera for this purpose, but also within real environmental conditions that are inevitably unsteady during the measurement series. Experimental measurements were realised with three different infrared cameras, and the results show that a value of effective thermal transmittance could be estimated in situ by a relative uncertainty that does not exceed 20% (coverage factor\u2009=\u20092), a reliable estimation as long as all systematic errors are identified and diminished through \u2026",

In addition, the lack of economies of scale, due to the small dimension of the energy market, results in the high installation and operation costs of the power supply system, as far as the per capita consumption is concerned. However, Substantial renewable energy sources are present in many of the isolated areas and in particular in islands, that can enable local development, contribute to the reduction of dependence on energy imports and the minimisation of CO2 emissions. To this end, the paper presents an integrated methodology for regional energy planning aiming at the optimisation of the power supply system through the penetration of renewable energy technologies.

            "Abstract": "This study introduces a framework for assessing the resilience of different European countries against the problem of energy poverty. The proposed framework is established upon two major implementation pillars: capturing stakeholder knowledge and employing a multi-criteria analysis framework in order to provide valuable insights and objective results. The implicated evaluation criteria have been identified by the group of stakeholders and incorporate several socio-economic aspects of the problem beyond the energy dimension. The proposed methodology is largely dependent on the engaged stakeholders\u2019 assessments, thus introducing nuggets of subjectivity into the whole analysis. However, it significantly differs from other energy poverty-based approaches, its novelty lying in that it directly attempts to evaluate a country according to its potential to deal with the problem as a whole, rather than deconstructing it in components and partial indicators. The proposed framework is demonstrated in countries in both Southern/Eastern and Northern/Western Europe (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain), exploiting diversities and particularities associated with their context.

            "Abstract": "Good governance is a concept that has recently come into regular use in political science and public administration and appears to be member of a wider group of terms such as democracy, civil society, human rights, social development. In addition, it is only recently that government policy makers have started looking at the potential of applying the tools and techniques of e-commerce to the tasks of government. In parallel, during the last 15 years, KM has changed from one generation to the next through constant improvements and new perspectives. Many researchers have presented methodologies, frameworks, technologies and have discussed various KM theoretical and practical issues in several sectors, including public administration. Yet, e-government and KM-based public administration are still in an early state of evolution, and it is only recently that researchers decided to intensify their efforts in these fields \u2026",

This potential can be utilised through the provision of energy services, with the support of intelligent information systems. In particular, up to date several researchers, have proposed energy management tools and methodologies that provide specialized energy management services. However, the majority of the known energy tools are limited to a single equipment type, fuel, or locality.

            "Abstract": "Public Administration desks are in any country the most active point of transactions between the state governments and the citizens. This fact emphasises the importance of services offered by Public Administrations and in the modern technological era, it is essential for Information Technology to provide solutions for transforming these traditionally offered services into electronic transactions that could be initiated over the Internet, aiming at the facilitation of the citizen\u2019s life, who is the eventual \u201cclient\u201d of any government. Although public administrations have strived over the last few years to meet this goal, their individual attempts resulted in isolated, ad-hoc systems, offering a small piece of the whole service bouquet. As the connectivity generated by the Internet is opening new opportunities in service delivery, public administrations are seeking ways to deliver integrated value-adding services though an Interoperable environment. The goal of a systematic service composition, which will guarantee eGovernment Interoperability, can be accomplished with an effective method of modelling the public services, in order to expose their interfaces and their actual workflow. Applying this method in Greek Municipalities by respecting the context of the emerging Greek eGovernment Interoperability Services Framework, various services have been analysed, leading to corresponding generic process patterns.",

In addition, the present situation indicates that CDM with its strong focus on greenhouse gases abatement has a tendency to lead to ad hoc investments without including technology transfer and a clear link to host countries' development strategies. This paper proposes a participatory in-country approach using the market mapping method for exploring technology implementation chains in a particular developing country. The aim is to facilitate decision makers and key stakeholders to assess and select the most suitable energy technologies for technology transfer via the CDM with a view to the country's specific sustainable development objectives.

The connection between HEIs and the labor market is why the effectiveness and quality of the provided services of academic institutions tend to be evaluated in terms of the time it takes for their graduates to find employment. This paper presents work from the EU funded research project QualiChain that aims to transform and revolutionize the domain of public education as well as its interfaces with those of private education, the labor market, public and private organizations and society at large, drawing its added value proposition from the challenges currently faced in these domains. The ultimate goal of the project is the development of the QualiChain platform that will offer blockchain-enabled verification of education and other credentials as well as data analytics and decision support for process optimization. The platform will be validated via its implementation in four different pilot cases. The present paper focuses on the pilot of optimizing university operations through semantically enhanced data and advanced decision support algorithms that will be implemented in the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).",

We then utilize a nonlinear optimization model to generate portfolios comprising stocks classified as those with the optimal characteristics, during the first stage. Finally, the portfolios designed at the previous stage are evaluated by using a wide set of well-known sophisticated evaluation criteria. The preferences and experiences of professionals and experts in the field of portfolio management were taken into consideration throughout all stages of the process. The validity of the above methodology is tested through an illustrative application on the stocks that constitute the FTSE-140 index of the Athens Stock Exchange.

In the future, fossil fuels are expected to strengthen their participation in the European energy balance and imports will amount to 70% of overall energy needs. On the other hand, the development of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is a central aim of the European Commission's energy policy. RES hold a significant share in the 10 new countries recently joined the EU and the adoption of RES-related policies is of imperative importance for the joint cooperation of the new member states with the EU.

FA involves identifying the strengths and weaknesses of firms, mainly through judgmental procedures. The latter address the qualitative evaluation and interpretation of financial ratios as they arise from accounting statements. FA can also be viewed as the activity of providing input during the portfolio construction phase because it entails the process of analyzing the special characteristics of securities and corresponding firms, leading to final selection recommendations.",

The decision maker's Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is formulated through a multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming model. The model is then solved through the augmented e-constrained (AUGMECON) method, a novel a posteriori Multiobjective Mathematical Programming (MMP) technique. Our purpose for transforming the traditional two-dimension portfolio selection problem into a mixed-integer multiobjective optimisation problem in space is twofold: 1) to incorporate three objective functions in the decision process beyond the mean-variance approach, i.e., an additional measure of return, the portfolio's relative dividend yield, 2) to model even the most complex preferences that the investor may \u2026",

Effective energy planning is a dynamic process that is repeated periodically and adjusts to changing conditions. Energy decision makers and planners are no longer able to rely on inductive decision making since they have to investigate the effect of various decision parameters and possible future changes. To help in this process, models have been developed where estimates of future load growth, candidate power plants, fuels and other key factors can be introduced, from which the planners can evaluate decision parameters and the available alternatives.

This company receives periodically a set of orders for the production of specific items (jobs) through a number of specialised production (assembly) lines. The paper presents a non compensatory approach based on an interactive implementation of the \u03b5-constraint method that enables the decision maker to achieve a satisfactory goal for each objective separately. In fact, the method generates and evaluates a large number of non dominated solutions that constitute a representative sample of the criteria ranges. The experience with a specific numerical example shows the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed model in solving large scale bicriterion industrial integer programming \u2026",

Following this path, the proposed multicriteria approach first captures the imprecision and vagueness of data by using linguistic variables. At a second level, it utilises human processes of decision-making by creating decision rules and modelling them with functions used in fuzzy sets theory. This method also is compatible with the way fuzzy logic models and combines fuzzy propositions. The proposed method considers the ideal solution and the anti-ideal solution and assesses each alternative in terms of distance as well as similarity to the ideal solution and the anti-ideal solution. Distance and similarity measures for fuzzy numbers are used and their aggregation is guided by the decision rules in order to construct decision functions. Further, OWA operators with maximal entropy are used to aggregate \u2026",
