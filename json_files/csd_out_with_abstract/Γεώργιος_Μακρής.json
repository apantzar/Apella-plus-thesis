            "Abstract": "The notion of Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF) has been extensively used by designers to evaluate various aspects of design robustness. While AVF is a very accurate way of assessing element resiliency, its calculation requires rigorous and extremely time-consuming experiments. In response, designers have introduced various methodologies that allow AVF calculation within reasonable time, at the cost of some loss of accuracy. In this paper, we present a method for calculating the AVF of design elements-using Statistical Fault Injection (SFI)-with equal accuracy but several orders of magnitude faster than traditional SFI techniques. Our method partitions the design into various hierarchical levels and systematically performs incremental fault injections to generate the AVF numbers. The presented method has been applied on an Intel microprocessor, where experimental results corroborate its ability to \u2026",

A random test pattern generation phase is also available in order to improve run time. The key ATPG challenge in speed-independent circuits is the generation of patterns that are valid independently of the relative timing and the order of arrival of signals. SPIN-TEST addresses this challenge by guaranteeing fault sensitization with hazard/race-free patterns and response observation that is not affected by oscillations or non-deterministic circuit states.

Existing CED techniques, however, require modification in order to be successfully adapted to asynchronous designs. We discuss the limitations of duplication, the simplest CED method, when applied to asynchronous circuits. We demonstrate that such limitations arise mainly due to comparison synchronization issues and inadequate detection of performance-related errors. We propose a circuit that alleviates the difficulties associated with comparison synchronization and we introduce a methodology that enables detection of errors that do not result in logic discrepancies and, thus, may not be detected through comparison.

To address this, we propose a reliability-aware floorplanner for CGRRAs based on a mixed Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) method that extends the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) of CGRRAs by balancing processing element (PE) usage. We use this as the basis of a design space explorer that generates a variety of configurations, trading off PE displacement vs. MTTF.

Thus, exponent monitoring can be utilized to detect errors in the control logic of the FPU. Predicting the exponent involves relatively simple operations, therefore our method incurs significantly lower overhead than the classical approach of duplicating the control logic of the FPU. Indeed, experimental results on the openSPARC T1 processor show that, as compared to control logic duplication, which incurs an area overhead of 17.9% of the FPU size, our method incurs an area overhead of only 5.8% yet still achieves detection of over 95% of transient errors in the FPU \u2026",

Traditionally, reactive thermal/power management techniques have been used to take appropriate action when the temperature reaches a threshold. However, these approaches do not always balance temperature and, as a result, may degrade system reliability. Therefore, to distribute temperature evenly across all cores, a proactive mechanism is needed to forecast future workload characteristics and the corresponding temperature, in order to make decisions before hot spots occur.

As a result, nanodevice characterization and testing calls for a slow and tedious procedure involving a large number of measurements. In this work, we discuss a statistical approach which learns measurement correlations from a small set of fully characterized nanodevices and utilizes the extracted knowledge to simplify the process for the rest of the nanodevices. More specifically, we employ various machine-learning methods which rely on a small subset of measurements to (i) predict the performances of a fabricated nanodevice, (ii) decide whether a nanodevice \u2026",

The key novelty of the proposed system is that it successively establishes a separation hypersurface of order that adapts to the intrinsic complexity of the problem. Thus, it performs excellent classification even in the presence of complex distributions. The test criterion for classifying a circuit is simply the location of its measurement pattern with respect to the separation hypersurface. Despite its simplicity, this criterion is, by construction, strongly correlated to the performance parameters of the circuit and does not rely on fault models.",

However, certain timing constraints, such as the bundled data assumption, are exploited in the single-rail implementation of these circuits in order to simplify them. Therefore, any delay fault in the circuit may cause one of two problems, namely performance degradation or logic errors. To address the challenges incurred by the autonomous behavior of handshake circuits during at-speed test, we propose test methods for both types of delay faults based on a DFT strategy which greatly simplifies the complexity of test generation. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through experimental results on several handshake circuits.",

Though wireless devices use some form of encryption, the underlying hardware is still vulnerable to malicious modificiations (aka hardware Trojans). Therefore, in this research work, we (i) theoretically analyze the risks posed by hardware Trojans in wireless networks,(ii) experimentally validate those risks and (iii) develop defense mechanisms to prevent such attacks. Wireless devices inherently possess unused space, ie a gap, between their operating point and the physical limits of communication (Figure 1). A well crafted hardware Trojan, therefore, can be hidden within this gap and can be used to carryout malicious operations. Along this line, we have extensively studied the risks posed by two hardware Trojans in an IEEE 802.11 a/g wireless network. The first Trojan attack is staged in the baseband part of the wireless device, more specifically in the Forward Error Correction Encoder. The second attack is staged in the RF front-end of the wireless device, namely at the power amplifier. After thorough experimental analysis to study the Trojan characteristics, we have implemented these malicious circuits on two experimental platforms, namely the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and Wireless Open Access Research Platform (WARP). Using these two setups, we demonstrate the hardware Trojan attacks, as well as the ability of the rogue receiver to retrieve the leaked information, while an unsuspecting legitimate receiver continues to accurately recover the original message \u2026",

This categorization method makes it possible to construct trojan models and then lower the cost of testing. Path delays of nominal chips are collected to construct a series of fingerprints, each one representing one aspect of the total characteristics of a genuine design. Chips are validated by comparing their delay parameters to the fingerprints. The comparison of path delays makes small trojan circuits significant from a delay point of view.

Furthermore, in contrast to concurrent error detection approaches, which presume the ability to re-synthesize the FSM and exploit parity-based state encoding, the proposed method is non-intrusive and does not interfere with the encoding and implementation of the original FSM.

In this work, we investigate a cost-efficient implementation of a neural classifier, which is the central component of this BIST method. We present the design of a reconfigurable analog neural network (ANN) experimentation platform and address the key questions concerning its cost-efficiency: a fully analog implementation with strict area and power budgets, a learning ability of the proposed architecture, fast dynamic programming of the weight memory during training, and high precision non-volatile storage of weight coefficients during operation or standby.

Moreover, with the increasing popularity of mobile devices that usually depend on finite energy sources, power consumption has been introduced as an additional constraint. As a result, post-silicon calibration is often performed to identify the optimal operating voltage (V\u2098\u1d62\u2099) of a given Integrated Circuit. This calibration is time-consuming, as it requires the device to be tested in a wide range of voltage inputs across a large number of tests.

Using silicon measurements from 40 chips fabricated in TSMC's 0.35\u03bcm technology, we also assess the effectiveness of a side channel \u2026",

Among these challenges, detection of design weak-points, popularly known as `Lithographic Hotspots', has attracted substantial attention. Hotspots are certain patterns which exhibit a higher probability of causing defects due to complex design-process interactions. Identifying such patterns and fixing them in the design stage itself is imperative towards ensuring high yield. In the early days of hotspot detection, Pattern Matching (PM) based methods were proposed. While effective in identifying previously known patterns, these methods failed to identify Never-Seen-Before (NSB) hotspots. To address this drawback, Machine Learning (ML) based solutions were introduced. Over the last decade, we have witnessed a plethora of ML \u2026",

The increasing demand for faster time-to-market and for designs with growing quality requirements and complexity, requires a quick and successful yield estimation prior to HVM. Prior to commencing HVM, a few early silicon wafers are typically produced and subjected to thorough characterization. One of the objectives of such characterization is yield estimation with better accuracy than what pre-silicon Monte Carlo simulation may offer. In this work, we propose predicting yield of a device using information from a similar previous-generation device, which is manufactured in the same technology node and in the same fabrication facility.

Therefore, test methods for transistor-level faults are required for dynamic asynchronous pipelines.

These test requirements reflect the inherent connectivity and regularity of each module and, when supported by corresponding hierarchical test paths, they guarantee complete testability of the module. Their key advantage is that they are not fully specified test vectors and, therefore, they do not require a computationally expensive search algorithm to satisfy from the primary inputs and outputs of the circuit.

In this work, we demonstrate how rewiring can also be used for reducing the soft error rate (SER). We employ an ATPG-based rewiring method to generate functionally-equivalent yet structurally-different implementations of a logic circuit based on simple transformation rules. This rewiring capability, along with an off-the-shelf method for assessing the SER of a circuit, enable the integration of the SER in a unified search algorithm that iteratively evolves the design in order to satisfy a given set of objectives. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 and ITC'99 benchmark circuits verify that rewiring can indeed be successfully used to reduce the SER of a circuit and, thus, it facilitates a design-space exploration framework for trading off area, power consumption, delay, testability, and SER",

Counterfeiting includes re-labeling legitimate chips or illegitimately replicating chips and deceptively selling them as made by the legitimate manufacturer, or simply selling fake chips. Counterfeiting also includes providing defective parts or simply previously used parts recycled from scrapped assemblies. Obviously, there is a multitude of legal and financial implications involved in such activities and even if these devices initially work, they may have reduced lifetime and may pose reliability risks.

While errors may affect more than one state/output bit, not all combinations of state/output bits constitute potential erroneous cases for a given fault model. Therefore, it is possible to compact them without loss of error information. Thus, concurrent error detection is performed through hardware that predicts the values of the compacted state/output bits and compares them to the actual values of the FSM. In order to minimize the incurred hardware overhead, a randomized algorithm is proposed for selecting the minimum number of required parity functions.",

To alleviate this problem, we develop a methodology that estimates the confidence in the obtained test outcome.

PCHIP involves these three additional tasks development of security properties for the design as formal theorems, conversion of the HDL code to the formal representation, and construction of formal proofs for those security theorems. We established a set of security properties which ensure the trustworthiness of microprocessor IPs and developed VeriCoq, which automates the conversion of hardware IPs in Verilog to their equivalent Coq representation. We also built a special PCHIP framework for cryptographic cores, capable of tracking sensitive information through the design and ensure their secureness. Finally, we developed VeriCoq-IFT, which automates all of PCHIPs tasks for this special framework, including conversion of HDL code to formal representation and generation of security theorems and their proofs.Descriptors:",

Such laser resistor trimming is slow and expensive, typically performed in a closed-loop, where the laser is iteratively fired and some circuit parameter (i.e. current) is monitored until a target condition is satisfied. Toward reducing this cost, we introduce a novel methodology for predicting the laser trim length, thereby eliminating the closed-loop control and speeding up the process. Predictions are obtained from waferlevel spatial correlation models, learned from a sparse sample of die on which traditional trimming is performed.

We develop a rigorous theory that yields an error detection circuit of size that is, in general, much smaller than a duplicate of the circuit under test. The error detection circuit monitors the input and some judiciously selected observable internal nodes of the examined circuit to produce an estimate of its output. In error-free operation, this estimate converges to the actual output value in a time interval that can be controlled to be sufficiently small. From then onwards, it follows exactly the output. The estimate is constructed such that it does not converge in the presence of errors and, thus, concurrent error detection is performed by comparing the two signals through an analog checker. The derived theory is validated through representative simulations on two filter examples.",

As a result, post-silicon calibration is often performed to identify the optimal operating voltage (V min ) of a given Integrated Circuit. This calibration is time-consuming, as it requires the device to be tested in a wide range of voltage inputs across a large number of tests.

A PUF is a physical entity which provides a measurable output that can be used as a unique and irreproducible identifier for the artifact wherein it is embedded. Popularized by the electronics industry, silicon PUFs leverage the inherent physical variations of semiconductor manufacturing to establish intrinsic security primitives for attesting integrated circuits. Owing to the stochastic nature of these variations and the multitude of steps involved, photo-lithographically manufactured silicon PUFs are impossible to reproduce (thus unclonable). Inspired by the success of silicon PUFs, we sought to exploit a combination of sequence-restricted barcodes and the inherent stochasticity of CRISPR-induced non-homologous end joining DNA error repair to create the first generation of genetic physical unclonable functions in three distinct human cells (HEK293, HCT116, and HeLa). We demonstrate that these CREAM-PUFs are robust (i.e., they repeatedly produce the same output), unique (i.e., they do not coincide with any other identically produced PUF), and unclonable (i.e., they are virtually impossible to replicate). Accordingly, CREAM-PUFs can serve as a foundational principle for establishing provenance attestation protocols for protecting intellectual property and confirming authenticity of engineered cell lines.",

A transparency based scheme is devised for the datapath, wherein locally generated vectors are translated into global design test. The controller is examined through influence tables, used to generate valid control state sequences for testing each module through hierarchical test paths. Fault coverage levels and vector counts thus attained match closely, those of traditional test generation methodologies, while sharply reducing the corresponding computational cost.",

            "Abstract": "We discuss a non-intrusive methodology for concurrent fault detection in random combinational logic. The proposed method is similar to duplication, wherein a replica of the circuit acts as a predictor that immediately detects potential faults by comparison to the original circuit. However, instead of duplicating the circuit, the proposed method selects a small number of prediction logic functions which only partially replicate it. Selection is guided by the objective of minimizing the incurred hardware overhead at the cost of introducing fault detection latency. To achieve this, the proposed method replicates only a reduced width output function for every input combination, yet without compromising the ability to detect all faults. In contrast to concurrent error detection schemes which presume the ability to re-synthesize the circuit, the proposed method does not interfere with the implementation of the original design.

In this comparative study, faults are injected in both the RT- and the Gate-Level description of the design and are simulated under actual workload of the microprocessor, which is executing SPEC2000 benchmarks. The objective of this study is to analyze and contrast the impact of RT- and gate-level faults on the instruction execution flow of the microprocessor. The key observation is a pronounced consistency in the type and frequency of instruction level errors (ILEs) arising due to RT- vs. gate-level faults. The motivation for this work stems from the need to understand the relative importance of low-level faults based on their instruction-level impact, in order to appropriately allocate error detection and/or correction resources. Hence, the consistency revealed through this study implies that such \u2026",

Our chip consists of a reconfigurable array of synapses and neurons operating below threshold and featuring sub-\u03bcW power consumption. The synapse circuits employ dynamic weight storage for fast bidirectional weight updates during training. The learned weights are then copied onto analog floating gate (FG) memory for permanent storage. The chip architecture supports two learning models: a multilayer perceptron and an ontogenic neural network. A benchmark XOR task is first employed to evaluate the overall learning capability of our chip. The BIST-related effectiveness is then evaluated on two case studies: the detection of parametric and catastrophic faults in an LNA and an RF \u2026",

The proposed CED scheme is based on monitoring a set of invariances imposed through added hardware, violation of which signifies the occurrence of an error. The novelty of our solution stems from the workload-cognizant way in which these invariances are selected so that they leverage the application-level error masking inherent in program execution. Specifically, in order to ensure cost-effectiveness of the hardware employed to construct these invariances, we make use of information regarding the type and frequency of errors affecting the typical workload of the microprocessor. Thereby, we identify the most susceptible aspects of instruction execution and we accordingly distribute CED resources to protect them. Our approach is demonstrated on the Scheduler of an Alpha-like superscalar microprocessor \u2026",

The checker monitors the fully differential analog code, which states that, in nominal operation, the common mode signal of any symmetric node pair remains within a narrow band around the quiescent DC bias. The checker measures the common mode voltage and reports an error whenever the measured value exceeds a threshold. Its key feature is that this comparison threshold is dynamically adjusted in order to lower the probability of false alarms. The design was fabricated in a 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. The chip test results prove the feasibility of the adaptive thresholding concept.",

This globalization of Integrated Circuit (IC) design flow has introduced security vulnerabilities. If a design is fabricated in a foundry that is outside the direct control of the (fabless) design house, reverse engineering, malicious circuit modification, and Intellectual Property (IP) piracy are possible. In this tutorial, we elaborate on these and similar hardware security threats by making connections to VLSI testing. We cover design-for-trust techniques, such as logic encryption, aging acceleration attacks, and statistical methods that help identify Trojan'ed and counterfeit ICs.",

To date, yield estimation is generally performed through simulation-based methods. However, such methods are not only very time-consuming for certain circuit classes, but also limited by the accuracy of the statistical models provided in the process design kits (PDKs). In contrast, herein we introduce yield estimation solutions which rely exclusively on silicon measurements and we apply them toward predicting yield during: 1) production migration from one fabrication facility to another and 2) transition from one design generation to the next. These solutions are applicable to any circuit, regardless of PDK accuracy and transistor-level simulation complexity, and range from rather \u2026",

These variations can be observed at different granularity levels, within every die, across die at wafer level, across lots, and holistically for the entire production. Understanding and addressing such variations is the primary objective for many engineering roles, ranging from designers, to process engineers, and to test engineers. In this chapter, we focus on understanding and modeling wafer-level spatial and spatiotemporal variations through the use of Gaussian processes and we present various real-life applications of such modeling in test cost reduction, quality improvement, and yield learning.",

The second solution is an error mitigation approach, which leverages a newly devised soft error susceptibility assessment method for ABMMs, along with partial duplication, to suppress a carefully chosen subset of transient errors.
