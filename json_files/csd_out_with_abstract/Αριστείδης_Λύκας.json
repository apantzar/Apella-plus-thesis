Recently, the transductive approach to reliability estimation has been proved to be very efficient when used with several machine learning classifiers, such as Naive Bayes and decision trees. However, the efficiency of the transductive approach for state-of-the art kernel-based classifiers was not considered. In this work we deal with this problem and apply the transductive reliability methodology with sparse kernel classifiers, specifically the Support Vector Machine and Relevance Vector Machine. Experiments with medical and bioinformatics datasets demonstrate better performance of the transductive approach for reliability estimation compared to reliability measures obtained directly from the output of the classifiers. Furthermore, we apply the methodology in the problem of reliable \u2026",

In contrast to conventional feedfoward neural networks having one or two hidden layers, DBNs are feedforward neural networks with many hidden layers. Until recently it was not clear how to initialize the weights of deep neural networks, which resulted in poor solutions with low generalization capabilities. A greedy layer-wise unsupervised algorithm was recently proposed to tackle this problem with successful results. In this work we present a methodology for spam detection based on DBNs and evaluate its performance on three widely used datasets. We also compare our method to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which is the state-of-the-art method for spam filtering in terms of classification performance.

The method was evaluated on a set of lip images taken from healthy subjects as well as on a set acquired from elder people with degraded lip shapes, and diagnosed with solar cheilosis. Our approach is a low complexity algorithm for robust and accurate lip contour extraction revealing shape details, which might be of value in diverse applied fields such as automated lip biometric and monitoring patients with affected lip contour.",

Such knowledge is very useful for several data analysis problems, such as for deciding on the number of clusters and determining unimodal projections. We propose a technique called UU-test (Unimodal Uniform test) to decide on the unimodality of a one-dimensional dataset. The method operates on the empirical cumulative density function (ecdf) of the dataset. It attempts to build a piecewise linear approximation of the ecdf that is unimodal and models the data sufficiently in the sense that the data corresponding to each linear segment follows the uniform distribution. A unique feature of this approach is that in the case of unimodality, it \u2026",

By taking into account spatial information, adjacent pixels are more probable to belong to the same cluster (which is intuitively desirable). Also, all of the model parameters are estimated in closed form from the data. The proposed conducted experiments indicate that our approach compares favorably to both standard and previous spatially constrained mixture model-based segmentation techniques.",

The method consists of an ultrasound sensing module and an intelligent module. The sensing system is based on a semi-invasive application of ultrasound. Two ultrasound transducers are mounted onto the bone surface, on opposite sides of the fracture site, one acting as transmitter and the other as receiver (through-transmission mode). The transmitter sends out a short pulse (of 500KHz central frequency), which propagates along the long axis of the bone, crosses the fracture site and is then captured by the receiver. In this paper, in vitro fracture models have been studied, using dead lamb tibiae. Osteotomy is carried out to the tibiae and the bony fragments are then held together by an external fixator.

            "Abstract": "Several methods for the acceleration of the healing process have been used, including electrical stimulation. Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have direct biological effects on endochondrial cells and enhance the formation of callus (Gupta et al., 1991). Ultrasound is currently used for the diagnosis of osteoporosis (R. Strelitzki et. al., 1996). In this case, two ultrasound transducers are placed on the skin, on opposite sites of the bone sample and the transition time of ultrasound waves is measured. In a recent study (C. Malizos et. Al., 1999) the use of ultrasound waves was proposed to enhance callus formation. In this work, the architectural design of a personalized wearable device for the monitoring and acceleration of bone fracture healing using ultrasound signals is presented. The proposed wearable device is plugged onto an external fixator and the traducers are placed directly on the surface of the bone. The proposed system can be used for the acceleration, as well as the monitoring of the healing progress. In comparison with currently used techniques, such as X-rays and manual sensing, the proposed device provides accurate information on the progress of healing and can recognize possible problems or non-union quite early in the process. In addition, it provides with several support services, such as communication of information to the doctor, intelligent data processing and generation of alerts when it is needed.",

An iterative framework is proposed which consists of two steps: at first, correspondences between distinct points are estimated by the Hungarian algorithm and then a regression procedure based on a Bayesian linear model (RVM) maps the two sets of points. By these means, a large variety of transformation is captured without imposing any prior knowledge on the form of the point sets. The proposed algorithm provides a smooth transformation even if the correspondence between the points in the two sets contains erroneous matches. The algorithm was successfully evaluated on sets of points with varying difficulty and favorably compared with state-of-the-art methods in cases of noise.",

The Greedy EM algorithm is a recently proposed method that tries to overcome this drawback, in the case of the density estimation problem using mixture models. In this work we propose a similar approach for incremental training of the PRBF network for classification.

In this paper a method is presented for the segmentation of touching and overlapping groups of chromosomes in M-FISH images. Initially, the watershed transform is applied and the image is decomposed into watershed regions. Next, gradient paths starting from points of high concavity are computed for each produced region.

            "Abstract": "A relevance feedback (RF) approach for content based image retrieval (CBIR) is proposed, which combines Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with Gaussian Mixture (GM) models. Specifically, it constructs GM models of the image features distribution to describe the image content and trains an SVM classifier to distinguish between the relevant and irrelevant images according to the preferences of the user. The method is based on distance measures between probability density functions (pdfs), which can be computed in closed form for GM models. In particular, these distance measures are used to define a new SVM kernel function expressing the similarity between the corresponding images modeled as GMs. Using this kernel function and the user provided feedback examples, an SVM classifier is trained in each RF round, resulting in an updated ranking of the database images.

            "Abstract": "The extraction of representative key-frames from video shots is very important in video processing and analysis, since it constitutes the basis for several important tasks such as video shot summarization, browsing and retrieval as well as high-level video segmentation. The extracted key-frames should capture a great percentage of the information of a shot content, while at the same time they should not present similar visual information. Clustering or segmentation methods are usually employed to extract key-frames. A major difficulty is caused by the large variety in the visual content of videos. Thus, using a single image descriptor (color, texture etc) to extract key-frames is not always effective, since there is no single descriptor surpassing the others in all video cases. To tackle this problem, we propose an approach for the weighted fusion of several descriptors that automatically estimates the weight of each \u2026",

In order to find the parameters of the proposed Bayesian model we present a new generalization of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on the variational approximation methodology. The proposed variational-based algorithm for BID can be derived in closed form and can be implemented in the discrete Fourier domain. Thus, it is very efficient even for very large images. We demonstrate with numerical experiments that the algorithm which was derived by the variational methodology yields promising improvements as compared to previous Bayesian algorithms for BID. Furthermore, the methodology presented here is very general with potential applications to other Bayesian models for this and other imaging problems.",

The main novelty of this model is the use of a sparse kernel-based model for the point spread function (PSF) that allows estimation of both PSF shape and support. In the herein proposed approach, a robust model of the BID errors and an image prior that preserves edges of the reconstructed image are also used. Sparseness, robustness, and preservation of edges are achieved by using priors that are based on the Student's-t probability density function (PDF). This pdf, in addition to having heavy tails, is closely related to the Gaussian and, thus, yields tractable inference algorithms. The approximate variational inference methodology is used to solve the corresponding Bayesian model. Numerical experiments are presented that compare this BID methodology to previous ones using both simulated and real data.",

The basic issue concerning the construction of neural network systems for protein classification is the sequence encoding scheme that must be used in order to feed the neural network. To deal with this problem we propose a method that maps a protein sequence into a numerical feature space using the matching scores of the sequence to groups of conserved patterns (called motifs) into protein families. We consider two alternative ways for identifying the motifs to be used for feature generation and provide a comparative evaluation of the two schemes. We also evaluate the impact of the incorporation of background features (2-grams) on the performance of the neural system.

By exploiting the marginalization property of the Gaussian distribution, we show that PRBF is especially suitable for these explanation techniques.

However, they are inconvenient for Bayesian inference since their normalization constant cannot be found in closed form. In this paper a new Bayesian framework is proposed for the image restoration problem, where the observed image is degraded by a convolutional operator, which bypasses this difficulty. An image prior is defined by imposing Student-t densities on the outputs of local convolutional filters, which are termed \"experts\". Thus, this prior can simultaneously smooth flat areas of the image and preserve edges in different directions. The variational methodology is used to fuse the information from all experts and the data in order to infer the restored image.

A review of all these previous results, where we used neural networks, filter-driven optimization and genetic algorithms is presented and in a companion lecture during this conference. The use of neural networks for the solution of the inverse problem makes possible the on-line solution of the problem. In fact, one usually approximates the inverse mapping (measurements versus crack quantities). Most of the effort is spent for the learning of this relation, while a sufficiently trained neural network provides predictions with, practically, zero computational cost. Potential applications include on-line, in-flight health monitoring systems with applications in civil and mechanical engineering and production control. In this paper we present new developments in the design of specialized neural networks for the solution of the crack identification problem. Emphasis is posed on the effective use of the learning data, which are produced by the boundary element method. Several technical data will be discussed. They include thoughts about the effective choice of the neural network architecture, the number of training examples and of the learning algorithms will be provided, together with the results of our recent numerical investigation. A detailed application for one or more elliptical cracks using static analysis results with the use of back-propagation trained neural networks will be provided.

At first, a pixel similarity-based algorithm for the rigid registration between single and multimodal images is presented. The images may present dissimilarities due to noise, missing data or outlying measures. The method relies on the partitioning of a reference image by a Student\u2019s t-mixture model (SMM). This partition is then projected onto the image to be registered. The main idea is that a t-component in the reference image corresponds to a t-component in the image to be registered. If the images are correctly registered the distances between the corresponding components is minimized. Moreover, the extension of the method to the registration of point clouds is also proposed. The use of SMM components is justified by the property that they have heavier tails than standard Gaussians, thus providing robustness to outliers. Experimental results indicate \u2026",

Weights are learned together with the cluster assignments, through an iterative procedure. The proposed weighting scheme limits the emergence of large variance clusters and allows high quality solutions to be systematically uncovered, irrespective of the initialization. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our approach and its robustness over bad initializations, as it compares favorably to both k-Means and other methods from the literature that consider the k-Means initialization problem.",

The direct application of this method for the classification task is obvious, as long as we are interested in typical mixture models. In this work we propose a greedy learning method adapted for a generalized mixture model (called the Probabilistic RBF network) with the particular char-acteristic that it allows the sharing of the mixture components among all classes, in contrast to the convetional model that suggests mixture components describing only one class. The proposed algorithm starts with a single component and adds components sequentially, using a combination of global and local search. The addition of the new component is based on criteria for detecting a region in the data space that is crucial for the classification task.

In the method we propose, the video is first segmented into shots and key-frames are extracted using the global k-means clustering algorithm that represent each shot. Then an improved spectral clustering method is applied to cluster the shots into groups based on visual similarity and a label is assigned to each shot according to the group that it belongs to. Next, a method for segmenting the sequence of shot labels is applied, providing the final scene segmentation result. Numerical experiments indicate that the method we propose correctly detects most of the scene boundaries while preserving a good trade off between recall and precision.",

We introduce a new quality measure to evaluate a partitioning of an undirected and unweighted graph into communities that is called inclusion. This quality measure evaluates how well each node is included in its community by considering both its existent and its non-existent edges. We have implemented a strategy that maximizes the inclusion criterion by moving each time a single node to another community. We also considered inclusion as a criterion for evaluating partitions provided by spectral clustering. In our experimental study, the inclusion criterion is compared to the widely used modularity criterion providing improved community detection results \u2026",

A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH), has been developed to ease the analysis of the process. Using an M-FISH technique each chromosome class (1,2,...,22,X,Y) is stained with a unique color. However, significant variations between images are observed due to a number of factors such as uneven hybridization and spectral overlap among channels. These types of variations influence the pixel classification accuracy of image classification methods which are supervised and require a set of annotated images for training. In this paper, we present a fully unsupervised M-FISH chromosome image classification methodology.

The main advantages of this model are two. First, it explicitly models the mixing proportions as probability vectors and simultaneously imposes spatial smoothness. Second, it results in closed form parameter updates using a maximum  a posteriori  (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

However, most attempts take into account the bursty terms individually, without investigating the relation between them. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that most of the important documents of a topic are published during the period in which the'main'topic terms are bursty.

The comparison is based upon five criteria that include ST segment changes, T wave alterations and patient's age. The difficulty in applying these criteria is the determination of the required parameter values (thresholds and weights). To overcome it, a genetic algorithm is used, which after proper training, automatically calculates the optimum values of the above parameters.

In this work, we perform face clustering by combining multiple representations of each image obtained from several deep face networks.

This widely used method suffers from two important drawbacks, namely it cannot estimate the true number of mixing components, and depends strongly on the initial parameter values. The Greedy EM algorithm is a recently proposed algorithm that tries to overcome these drawbacks for the density estimation task. The direct application of this method for the classification task is obvious, as long as we are interested in typical mixture mod-els. In this work we propose a greedy learning method adapted for a generalized mixture model (called the Probabilistic RBF network) with the particular characteristic that it allows the sharing of the mixture components among all classes, in contrast to the convetional model that suggests mixture components describing only one class. The proposed algorithm starts with a single component and adds components sequentially, using a combination of global and local search. The addition of the new component is based on criteria for detecting a region in the data space that is crucial for the classification task. Experimental results using several well-known classification datasets indicate that the greedy method provides solutions of superior classification performance.",

In more technical terms, CDSSs are active knowledge systems that use two or more items of patient data to generate case\u2010specific advice. CDSSs first appeared in the late 1950s but have experienced significant growth over the last three decades providing advice in the clinical decision\u2010making process. Specific fields of decision support offered by CDSSs include diagnosis, therapy planning, alerting and informing, and information retrieval. CDSSs interact with patient records and measurement devices for data acquisition and knowledge bases for retrieval of knowledge related to the specific case. Combining the data from the above sources, intelligent methods are applied for clinical inference. Rule\u2010based, probabilistic, and machine learning techniques are employed to provide \u2026",

Then, simple decision rules based on the translations of the regions are employed in order to decide for the existence and the type of camera motion in each frame. In this way, three signals are constructed (pan, tilt, zoom) which are subsequently filtered to improve the robustness of the method.

The second one is a robust distribution of the BID model errors and the third novelty is an image prior that preserves edges of the reconstructed image. Sparseness, robustness and preservation of edges is achieved by using priors that are based on the Student-t probability density function (pdf).

In this work we apply the general methodology in the context of the probabilistic radial basis function (PRBF) network which constitutes an effective black box classifier. Nevertheless, like most other neural network models it is not straightforward to obtain explanations for the PRBF decisions. By exploiting the marginalization property of the Gaussian distribution, we demonstrate how this explanation technique can be implanted into PRBF to explain the model\u2019s decisions for new unlabeled cases.

            "Abstract": "Reliable video summarization is one of the most important problems in digital video processing and analysis. The most common approach used for shot representation is the extraction of a set of key-frames sufficiently representing the total content of the shot. In such way, the whole video content can be represented using only a few, cautiously picked, non redundant key-frames maintaining at the same time a great percentage of information. A typical approach is to extract key frames using clustering. However, using a single image descriptor to extract key-frames is not sufficient due to large variations in the visual content of videos. In our approach, a weighted multi-view clustering algorithm is employed to combine two different image descriptors into a single similarity matrix, that serves as an input to a spectral clustering algorithm. Each image descriptor (view) does not contribute equally to the similarity matrix, but \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with algorithms and techniques that allow computer systems to \u201clearn from experience\u201d to successfully solve artificial intelligence problems. Experience is usually provided in the form of problem-specific \u201cexamples\u201d(organized in \u201cdatasets\u201d) that allow the learning system to discover new knowledge and improve its performance on a particular task. If the training examples are not available at the beginning of the learning process, but they are collected during training we have the case of \u201con-line\u201d or incremental learning. If the system is already provided some knowledge about the domain and/or the task, we have the case of knowledge refinement or analytical learning.Machine Learning problems are generally distinguished into three main categories depending on the nature of the datasets: In supervised learning, we are given a set of labeled examples and the aim is to discover the knowledge required for labeling new examples. Typical tasks that fall within the paradigm of supervised learning are classification where a class label is predicted for each input example and regression, where a numerical value is predicted for each input example. In unsupervised learning we are given a set of unlabeled examples and the aim is to identify the underlying structure of the data and extract it in the form of actionable knowledge. Typical unsupervised learning tasks are clustering, where the goal is to identify commonalities among the examples and form interesting clusters, and model estimation, where the knowledge model that generated the data is being sought, eg in the form of \u2026",

The method relies on the partitioning of a reference image by a Student's t-mixture model (SMM). This partition is then projected onto the image to be registered. The main idea is that a t-component in the reference image corresponds to a t-component in the image to be registered. If the images are correctly registered the weighted sum of distances between the corresponding components is minimized. The use of SMM components is justified by the property that they have heavier tails than standard Gaussians, thus providing robustness to outliers.

The input to the network was produced through a principal component analysis (PCA) to achieve dimensionality reduction.

            "Abstract": "The Probabilistic RBF (PRBF) network constitutes an a-daptation of the RBF network for classification. Moreover it extends the typical mixture model by allowing the sharing of mixture components among all classes, in contrast to the conventional approach that suggests mixture components describing only one class. The typical learning method of PRBF for a classification task employs the Expectation-Max-imization (EM) algorithm. This widely used method depends strongly on the initial parameter values. The Greedy EM algorithm is a recently proposed method that tries to overcome this drawback, in the case of the density estimation problem using mixture models. In this work we pro-pose a similar approach for incremental training of the PRBF network for classification. The proposed algorithm starts with a single component and incrementally adds more components. After convergence the algorithm splits all the components of the network. The addition of a new component is based on criteria for detecting a region in the data space that is crucial for the classification task. Experimental results using several well-known classification datasets indicate that the incremental method provides solutions of superior classification performance.",

These variations are computed in closed form by minimizing the differential EMD between Gaussian mixtures, yielding a very fast algorithm with high accuracy, without recurring to the EM algorithm in each frame. Moreover, we also propose a framework to handle occlusions, where the prediction for the object's location is forwarded to an adaptive Kalman filter whose parameters are estimated on line by the motion model already observed. Experimental results show significant improvement in tracking performance in the presence of occlusion.",

According to this model, the pixel labels are random variables and a smoothness prior is imposed on them. The main novelty of this work is a new family of smoothness priors for the label probabilities in spatially variant mixture models. These Gauss-Markov random field-based priors allow all their parameters to be estimated in closed form via the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using the expectation-maximization methodology. Thus, it is possible to introduce priors with multiple parameters that adapt to different aspects of the data. Numerical experiments are presented where the proposed MAP algorithms were tested in various image segmentation scenarios. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed segmentation scheme compares favorably to both standard and previous spatially \u2026",

In order to overcome the cluster initialization problem associated with this method, in this work we propose the global kernel k-means algorithm, a deterministic and incremental approach to kernel-based clustering. Our method adds one cluster at each stage through a global search procedure consisting of several executions of kernel k-means from suitable initializations. This algorithm does not depend on cluster initialization, identifies nonlinearly separable clusters and, due to its incremental nature and search procedure, locates near optimal solutions avoiding poor local minima. Furthermore a modification is proposed to reduce the computational cost that does not significantly affect the solution quality.

Using a task-specific cardiac beat database the multicriteria method was properly adjusted to classify each presented cardiac beat as ischaemic or normal.

Any reliable keyframe extraction algorithm should automatically detect the number of keyframes, while extracting non-repetitive keyframes that can efficiently summarize the video content. Moreover, it is important that key-frame extraction is performed in reasonable time. The proposed method is based on a moving window of successive frames that slides over the whole frame sequence (shot). The set of frames included in each window is tested for content homogeneity using an appropriate unimodality test. Thus, each window is characterized as unimodal or not and the frame sequence of each non-unimodal window is splitted into two (possibly unimodal) segments. In this way, each video shot is segmented into unimodal segments and the key-frames are computed as the representative frames (medoids) of each \u2026",

The method relies on a principle due to Helmholtz stating that every large deviation from uniform noise should be perceptible, provided that the deviation is generated by an a contrario model of geometric structures. By assuming local linearity, we first employ a robust algorithm to model the local manifold of the corrupted data by local line segments. Our rationale is that long line segments should not be expected in a noisy set of points. This assumption leads to the modeling of the lengths of the line segments by a Pareto distribution, which is the adopted a contrario model for the observations. The model is successfully evaluated on two problems in computer vision: shape recovery and linear regression.",

In this work, views are expressed in terms of given kernel matrices and a weighted combination of the kernels is learned in parallel to the partitioning.

We propose a method capable of extracting from noisy long duration ECG recordings those ECG characteristics that can be used for myocardial ischemia detection and analysis. We tested the performance of the method using noisy ECGs from the European Society of Cardiology ST-T database (ESC ST-T database).

The mixture weights, which are provided by a spatial kernel, along with the hue values are used in order to estimate the parameters of the weighted von Mises mixture model. The von Mises distribution is suitable for circular data and it is employed in order to eliminate drawbacks in kernel-based tracking caused by eventual shifts of the target\u2019s histogram bins. The weights allow a mean shift-like gradient based optimization by maximizing the weighted likelihood, which would not be feasible in the context of a standard von Mises mixture. Moreover, as only the hue component of the target is involved, many quantities of the algorithm may be pre-calculated for given parameters and therefore the algorithm can perform in real time, which is experimentally confirmed.

This widely used method suffers from two important drawbacks, namely it cannot estimate the true number of mixing components, and depends strongly on the initial parameter values. The Greedy EM algorithm is a recently proposed algorithm that tries to overcome these drawbacks for the density estimation task. The direct application of this method for the classification task is obvious, as long as we are interested in typical mixture models. In this work we propose a greedy learning method adapted for a generalized mixture model (called the Probabilistic RBF network) with the particular characteristic that it allows the sharing of the mixture components among all classes, in contrast to the convetional model that suggests mixture components describing only one class.

The approach is based on the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression framework. According to this approach the shape of the activations is a superposition of kernel functions, one at each pixel of the image, and a hierarchical Bayesian model is employed which imposes a sparse representation by selecting a number relevant kernel functions. We have implemented an incremental method for constructing the RVM model and, in addition, we have employed a cross-validation criterion to deal with the problem of kernel width selection. The proposed method allows the accurate estimation of the activation locations when correlated noise is present even at low signal-to-noise ratios.

Moreover, we propose a dynamic scheme for the Kalman filter as the elements of its state matrix are updated on-line depending on a measure evaluating the quality of the observation. According to this measure, if the target is not occluded the observation contributes to the update equations of the Kalman filter state matrix. Otherwise, the observation is not taken into consideration.

While the algorithm performs well when the target's appearance and the lighting conditions are constant, it may fail when these conditions are not met because the ideal histogram is generally shifted with respect to the reference histogram. In this work, we propose to compute the initial histogram of the target using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) rather than impulses generated by simple counting. This mixture plays the role of a weighting function, in the histograms computed in subsequent frames, in order to make them smoother and increase the overlapping area with the initial histogram.

The proposed algorithm considers each cluster member as an individual \u2018viewer\u2019and applies a univariate statistic hypothesis test for unimodality (dip-test) on the distribution of distances between the viewer and the cluster members. Important advantages are: i) the unimodality test is applied on univariate distance vectors, ii) it can be directly applied with kernel-based methods, since only the pairwise distances are involved in the computations.

Then, a sequence alignment algorithm is applied to detect when the pattern of shot labels changes, providing the final scene segmentation result. In this way shot similarity is computed based only on visual features, while ordering of shots is taken into account during sequence alignment.

Then, a merge process follows in order to combine neighboring ellipses with almost collinear major axes to reduce the complexity of the model. Experimental results on various databases show that the proposed scheme is an efficient technique for modeling unordered sets of points and shapes by line segments.

            "Abstract": "Noisy optimization problems arise very often in real-life applications. A common practice to tackle problems characterized by uncertainties, is the re-evaluation of the objective function at every point of interest for a fixed number of replications. The obtained objective values are then averaged and their mean is considered as the approximation of the actual objective value. However, this approach can prove inefficient, allocating replications to unpromising candidate solutions. We propose a hybrid approach that integrates the established Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm with the Reinforcement Learning approach to efficiently tackle noisy problems by intelligently allocating the available computational budget. Two variants of the proposed approach, based on different selection schemes, are assessed and compared against the typical alternative of equal sampling. The results are reported and analyzed, offering \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cardiac beat classification is a key process in the detection of myocardial ischemic episodes in the electrocardiographic signal. In the present study, we propose a multicriteria sorting method for classifying the cardiac beats as ischemic or not. Through a supervised learning procedure, each beat is compared to preclassified category prototypes under five criteria. These criteria refer to ST segment changes, T wave alterations, and the patient's age. The difficulty in applying the above criteria is the determination of the required method parameters, namely the thresholds and weight values. To overcome this problem, we employed a genetic algorithm, which, after proper training, automatically calculates the optimum values for the above parameters. A task-specific cardiac beat database was developed for training and testing the proposed method using data from the European Society of Cardiology ST-T database \u2026",

Accordingly, a parallelizable search strategy is proposed based upon local search with random restarts that exploits the characteristics of the representation. Preliminary experimental results on several sets of test problems, among which very well-known benchmarks, show that the representation developed, matched with the search strategy proposed, attains high quality near-optimal solutions in moderate execution times.",

This approach uses Gaussian mixture (GM) models of the image features and a query that is updated in a probabilistic manner.

The retrieval is based on a recently proposed distance measure between probability density functions, which can be computed in closed form for GM models. The proposed approach takes advantage of the form of this distance measure and updates it very efficiently based on the models of the user-specified relevant and irrelevant images. It is also shown that this RF framework is fairly general and can be applied in case other image models or distance measures are used instead of those proposed in this work.

We experimentally show that in an image retrieval scenario the proposed metric provides as good results as the KL divergence at a fraction of the computational cost. This metric is also compared to a Bhattacharyya-based distance metric that can be computed in closed form for GMs and is found to produce better results.",
