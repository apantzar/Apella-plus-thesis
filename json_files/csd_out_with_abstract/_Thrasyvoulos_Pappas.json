In Experiment 1, the roughness of frequency-modulated tones was determined using a paired-comparison paradigm. It was found that using this paradigm similar results in comparison to literature were found. In Experiment 2, the perceived visual roughness of textures drawn from the CUReT database was determined. It was found that participants could systematically judge the roughness of the textures. In Experiment 3 the perceived pleasantness for the textures used in Experiment 2 was determined. It was found that two groups of participants could be distinguished. One group found rough textures unpleasant and smooth textures pleasant. The other group found rough textures pleasant and smooth textures unpleasant. Although for the latter groups the relation between relative roughness and perceived \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In an attempt to mimic human (colorful) texture classification by a clustering algorithm three lines of research have been encountered, in which as test set 180 texture images (both their color and gray-scale equivalent) were drawn from the OuTex and VisTex databases. First, a k-means algorithm was applied with three feature vectors, based on color/gray values, four texture features, and their combination. Second, 18 participants clustered the images using a newly developed card sorting program. The mutual agreement between the participants was 57% and 56% and between the algorithm and the participants it was 47% and 45%, for respectively color and gray-scale texture images. Third, in a benchmark, 30 participants judged the algorithms\u2019 clusters with gray-scale textures as more homogeneous then those with colored textures. However, a high interpersonal variability was present for both the color and the gray-scale clusters. So, despite the promising results, it is questionable whether average human texture classification can be mimicked (if it exists at all).",

The segmentation of image planes in the video is modeled as a spatial Gibbs-Markov random field, and the probability density distributions of temporal changes are modeled by a Mixture of Gaussians approach. The intensity of each spatiotemporal volume is modeled as a slowly varying function distorted by white Gaussian noise. Starting from an initial spatial segmentation, the pixels are classified using the temporal probabilistic model and moving objects in the video are detected. This classification is updated by Markov random field constraints to achieve smoothness and spatial continuity. The temporal model is updated using the segmentation information and local statistics of the image frame. Experimental results show the performance of our algorithm.",

We evaluate SSIM metrics and compare their performance to traditional approaches in the context of realistic distortions that arise from compression and error concealment in video compression/transmission applications. In order to better explore this space of distortions, we propose models for simulating typical distortions encountered in such applications.

A new reconstruction method is proposed that uses three steps to interpolate the interior of each block under the model that an image can be decomposed into piecewise planar regions plus noise. First, the K-planes algorithm is developed in order to fit several planes to the observed pixel values on the border. Second, one of theK planes is assigned to each pixel of the block interior, by a process of partitioning the block with polygons, thereby creating a piecewise planar approximation. Third, the interior pixels are interpolated by modeling them as a Gauss Markov random field whose mean is the piecewise planar approximation just obtained. The new method is shown to improve significantly upon previous methods, especially in the preservation of \u201csoft \u2026",

Digital halftoning is used to display continuous-tone images in media in which the direct rendition of the tones is impossible. The most common example of such media is ink or toner on paper, and the most common rendering devices for such media are, of course, printers. Halftoning works because the eye acts as a spatial low-pass filter that blurs the rendered pixel pattern, so that it is perceived as a continuous-tone image. Although all halftoning methods rely at least implicitly, on some understanding of the properties of human vision and the display device, the goal of model-based halftoning techniques is to exploit explicit models of the display device and the human visual system (HVS) to maximize the quality of the displayed images.

Moreover, since video packets are usually of different importance, optimal bit allocation across video packets results in different packets receiving unequal error protection (UEP). For Internet video, cross-packet FEC in addition to source packets can be performed by generating parity packets [1]. Alternatively, a source packet can be partitioned into different transport packets to achieve prioritized protection, which has been studied for scalable video in [2]. In this paper, we compare the performance of these two packetization schemes applied to single-layer video. The comparison is carried out in a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, where error resilient source coding and FEC are jointly designed. We show that either packetization scheme may be optimal depending on the packet loss rate.",

We use polarization photography to obtain separate images of surface and subsurface reflections, and rely on psychophysical studies to uncover and separate the influence of the two components on skin gloss perception. We capture images of facial skin at two levels, macro-scale (whole face) and meso-scale (skin patch), before and after cleansing. To generate a broad range of skin appearances for each subject, we apply photometric image transformations to the surface and subsurface reflection images. We then use linear regression to link statistics of the surface and subsurface reflections to the perceived gloss obtained in our empirical studies. The focus of this paper is on within-subject gloss perception, that is, on visual differences among images of the same subject. Our \u2026",

There is a great need for developing technologies to automatically or semi-automatically detect nuclear proliferation activities using remote sensing. Images acquired from earth observation satellites is an important source of information in detecting proliferation activities. High-resolution remote sensing images are highly useful in verifying the correctness, as well as completeness of any nuclear program. DOE national laboratories are interested in detecting nuclear proliferation by developing advanced geospatial image mining algorithms.

While such metrics can successfully account for contrast and luminance masking, they are quite sensitive to spatial shifts, intensity shifts, contrast changes, and scale changes. In contrast, the recently proposed structural similarity (SSIM) metrics account for perception more implicitly with the assumption that the HVS is adapted for extracting structural information (relative spatial covariance) from images. As such, they have the potential to be much more effective in quantifying suprathreshold compression artifacts than traditional perceptual metrics, as such artifacts tend to distort the structure of an image.

When the boundary consists of 2 runs, the set of minimum odd bond reconstructions are formed in one or more of the following ways: by simple paths connecting the endpoints of the two black runs; by simple paths connecting the two white runs; or by three simple paths connecting one of the boundary odd bonds to each of the other three.

The vectors of the lip FAPs along with the first order and the second order temporal derivatives over frames and the conditional probabilities of these vectors are modeled as Gaussian distributions. As a result, the MAP estimate of the inner lip FAPs can be obtained as a linear transformation of the outer lip FAPs, or vice versa. When data obtained from the training process are stored in the receiver, the inner (or outer) lip FAPs can be interpolated from the outer (or inner) lip FAPs, which are all that needs to be transmitted.

Among the many challenges in this area are the time-varying channel conditions, limited available resources, such as bandwidth and power, and the different transmission requirements of different video content. This work takes into account the time-varying nature of the wireless channels, as well as the importance of individual video packets, to develop a cross-layer resource allocation and packet scheduling scheme for multiuser video streaming over lossy wireless packet access networks.

We combine a previously proposed adaptive clustering algorithm for color segmentation with a simple but effective texture segmentation approach to obtain an overall image segmentation.

The characteristics of these data sets are studied and various approximation approaches are applied on each of them to reach an ORD optimal result. We apply, for example, polygonal approximation on both the skeleton and distance data. We demonstrate that the resulting approach outperforms existing ORD optimal approaches.",

Since humans are the ultimate users of most retrieval systems, it is important to organize the contents semantically, according to meaningful categories. We propose a novel approach for assigning semantic labels to image segments, which together segment layout information can lead to content-based image classification and retrieval. The proposed approach relies on a perceptually based, spatially adaptive, color-texture segmentation scheme. We derive segment-wide features (color and spatial texture). These features serve as medium level descriptors that can effectively bridge the \"semantic gap\" between low and high level descriptors.

In packet-based communication systems, such as a wireless channel or the Internet, the quality of the received signal is affected by both signal compression and packet losses. Due to the probabilistic nature of the channel, the distortion in the reconstructed signal is a random variable. In addition, the quality of the reconstructed signal depends on the error concealment strategy. A common approach is to use the expected mean squared error of the end-to-end distortion as the performance metric. It can be shown that this approach leads to unpredictable perceptual artifacts. A better approach is to account for both the mean and the variance of the end-to-end distortion. We explore the perceptual benefits of this approach.

We propose a non-invasive system that can be used to convey graphical and pictorial information via touch and hearing. The main idea is that the user actively explores a two-dimensional layout consisting of one or more objects on a touch screen with the finger while listening to auditory feedback. We have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed approach in a range of tasks, from basic shape identification to perceiving a scene with several objects. The proposed approach is also expected to contribute to research in virtual reality, immersive environments, and medicine.",

We propose a new hierarchical compression approach that extends the previously proposed fixed-grid lossy cutset coding (LCC) technique by adapting the grid size to local image detail. LCC was claimed to have the best rate-distortion performance of any lossy compression technique in the given image class, but cannot take advantage of detail variations across an image. The key advantages of the hierarchical LCC (HLCC) is that, by adapting to local detail, it provides constant quality controlled by a single parameter (distortion threshold), independent of image content, and better overall visual quality and rate-distortion \u2026",

We introduce the idea of \"structurally lossless\" compression of visual data that allows significant differences between the original and decoded images, which may be perceptible when they are viewed side-by-side, but do not affect the overall quality of the image. We then discuss the development of objective texture similarity metrics, which allow substantial point-by-point deviations between textures that according to human judgment are essentially identical.",

In such a network, the probability of loss for each video packet is determined by the service class assigned to it. Using information about the error concealment strategy at the decoder and the QoS status of the network, we jointly consider the selection of source coding parameters and packet classification. A minimum cost approach is presented in which the goal is to minimize the cost to transmit a video sequence, while achieving a desired level of video quality, as measured by the expected distortion of the received video sequence. An approach for minimizing the distortion subject to a cost constraint is also discussed. A solution approach based on Lagrangian relaxation and deterministic dynamic programming is presented. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of simultaneously adapting the source coding and priority assignment.",

            "Abstract": "Spammers are constantly creating sophisticated new weapons in their arms race with anti-spam technology, the latest of which is image-based spam. The newest image-based spam uses simple image processing technologies to vary the content of individual messages, e.g. by changing foreground colors, backgrounds, font types, or even rotating and adding artifacts to the images. Thus, they pose great challenges to conventional spam filters. In this paper, we propose a system using a probabilistic boosting tree to determine whether an incoming image is a spam or not based on global image features, i.e. color and gradient orientation histograms. The system identifies spam without the need for OCR and is robust in the face of the kinds of variation found in current spam images. Evaluation results show the system correctly classifies 90% of spam images while mislabeling only 0.86% of non-spam images as spam.",

We formulate two approaches to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework: a minimum distortion approach and a minimum cost approach, in which the encoding mode and priority class for each packet are optimally selected so as to minimize the total distortion subject to cost constraints, or to minimize the total cost subject to end-to-end distortion constraints.

In this paper, we present a packet scheduling scheme that can be used for real-time streaming of pre-encoded video over downlink packet access wireless networks. We consider a gradient-based scheduling scheme in which user data rates are dynamically adjusted based on their channel quality as well as the gradients of a utility function. The utility functions are designed by taking into account the distortion of the received video. They allow for content-aware packet scheduling both within and across multiple users. Simulation results show that the gradient-based scheduling framework, when combined with the distortion-aware utility functions, significantly outperforms conventional content-independent packet scheduling schemes.",

We have proposed a new approach for semantic image classification that utilizes the adaptive perceptual color-texture segmentation algorithm by Chen et al., which segments natural scenes into perceptually uniform regions.  The color composition and spatial texture features of the regions are used as medium level descriptors, based on which the segments are classified into semantic categories.  The segment features consist of spatial texture orientation information and color composition in terms of a limited  number of spatially adapted dominant colors.  The feature selection and the performance of the classification algorithms are based on the segment statistics. We investigate the dependence of the segment statistics on the segmentation algorithm.

The cutsets considered are Manhattan grids, for example every Nth row and column of the image. Cutset sampling is motivated mainly by applications with physical constraints, e.g. a ship taking water samples along its path, but also by the fact that dense sampling along lines might permit better reconstruction of edges than conventional sampling at the same density. The main challenge in cutset sampling lies in the reconstruction of the unsampled blocks. As a first investigation, this paper uses segmentation followed by linear estimation. First, the ACA method [1] is modified to segment the cutset, followed by a binary Markov random field (MRF) inspired segmentation of the unsampled blocks. Finally, block interiors are estimated from the pixels on their boundaries, as well as their \u2026",

Our focus is on streaming applications with relatively strict delay constraints; for such applications, forward error correction (FEC) is the preferred channel coding technique to recover from packet losses. We propose a framework of joint source-channel coding and power allocation (JSCCPA), where resources such as bandwidth and transmission power are optimally allocated to provide unequal error protection (UEP) for achieving the best video quality. An efficient algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation and dynamic programming is proposed to solve the constrained optimization problem. Simulation results illustrate the advantage of the proposed framework.",

The block-based motion estimation is performed in the spatial domain, and an embedded zerotree wavelet coder (EZW) is employed to encode the residue frame. In contrast to other motion-compensated wavelet video coders, where all the MBs are forced to be in INTER mode, we construct the residue frame by combining the prediction residual of the INTER MBs with the coding residual of the INTRA and INTER_ENCODE MBs. Different from INTER MBs that are not coded, the INTRA and INTER_ENCODE MBs are encoded separately by a DCT coder. By adaptively selecting the quantizers of the INTRA and INTER_ENCODE coded MBs, our goal is to equalize the characteristics of the residue frame in order to improve the overall coding efficiency of the wavelet coder.

Three classes of image QA algorithms that correlate with visual perception significantly better are discussed\u2014human vision based metrics, Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) metrics, and information theoretic metrics. Each of these techniques approaches the image QA problem from a different perspective and using different first principles.

Relying on the Markov random field model, the decoder takes a MAP approach to reconstructing the interior of each grid block from the pixels on its boundary, thereby creating a piecewise smooth image that is consistent with the encoded grid pixels. The MAP rule, which reduces to finding the block interiors with fewest black-white transitions, is directly implementable for the most commonly occurring block boundaries, thereby avoiding the need for brute force or iterative solutions.

The resulting segments can be classified into semantic categories using region-wide features as medium level descriptors. Such descriptors are the key to bridging the gap between low-level image primitives and high-level image semantics. The segment classification is based on linear discriminant analysis techniques.

On the other hand, structural similarity metrics (SSIM) attempt to base image similarity on \"structural\" information. We evaluate the performance of SSIM metrics in the context of texture similarity, and propose new metrics that incorporate the best features of SSIM and eliminate the most serious drawbacks. We show that the proposed new texture similarity metrics outperform SSIM and its variations, as well as PSNR and other traditional metrics. We demonstrate the advantages of the new metrics on a carefully selected set of 39 texture pairs and comparisons with informal subjective test results.",

In packet-based communication systems, such as wireless channels or the Internet, packet delivery is not guaranteed. Therefore, from the point-of-view of the transmitter, the distortion at the receiver is a random variable. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on minimizing the expected value of the end-to-end distortion. This paper explores the benefits of accounting for not only the mean, but also the variance of the end-to-end distortion when allocating limited source and channel resources. By accounting for the variance of the distortion, the proposed approach increases the reliability of the system by making it more likely that what the end-user sees, closely resembles the mean end-to-end distortion calculated at the transmitter. Experimental results demonstrate that variance-aware resource \u2026",

The effectiveness and efficiency of such tests depend on a careful analysis of the abilities of human perception and the application requirements. The focus of this paper is on defining performance requirements and testing procedures for objective texture similarity metrics. We identify three operating domains for evaluating the performance of a similarity metric: the ability to retrieve \u201cidentical\u201d textures; the top of the similarity scale, where a monotonic relationship between metric values and subjective scores is desired; and the ability to distinguish between perceptually similar and dissimilar textures.

However, in many applications, such as video streaming, due to the diversity of channel capacities and display devices, the viewing distance and the spatiotemporal resolution of the displayed signal may be adapted in order to optimize the perceived signal quality. For example, at low bitrate coding applications an observer may prefer to reduce the resolution or increase the viewing distance to reduce the visibility of the compression artifacts. The tradeoff between resolution/viewing conditions and visibility of compression artifacts requires new approaches for the evaluation of image quality that account for both image distortions and image size.

Efficiently utilizing the available energy is therefore an important design consideration. We consider a situation where a video sequence is to be compressed and transmitted over a wireless channel. The goal is to limit the amount of distortion in the received video sequence while using the minimum required transmission energy. To accomplish this goal, we consider error resilience and concealment techniques, at the source coding level, as well as the dynamic allocation of physical layer communication resources. We consider these approaches jointly in a novel framework. We formulate an optimization problem that corresponds to minimizing the energy required to transmit a video frame with an acceptable level of distortion.

As the digital images are captured, stored, transmitted, and displayed in di erent devices, there is a need to maintain image quality. In this chapter we examine objective criteria for the evaluation of image quality that are based on models of visual perception. An image is a two (or three) dimensional reproduction of the real world with an additional dimension for moving images. In this chapter we are only interested in images that are intended to be seen by humans. Such images could include a number of di erent imaging modalities, eg infrared, x-ray images, CAT scans, etc., as long as the ultimate destination is the human eye. The tasks could vary from looking at a photograph or watching a movie to reading text and trying to detect a target or a medical condition. However, the problem of image quality changes fundamentally when the ultimate user or interpreter of an image is not the human eye. For example, a typical quality metric for a range1 image is a maximum (percent) deviation from the true value. On the other hand, the human eye's sensitivity to luminance variations depends on a number of factors, including light level, spatial frequency, and signal content.Even though we use the term image quality, we are primarily interested in image delity, ie how close an image is to a given original or reference image. It is very hard to develop objective metrics that evaluate image quality without a reference image, even though the human visual system is very good at doing that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We propose novel techniques for the evaluation of perceived facial gloss across subjects with varying surface reflections. Given a database of facial skin images from multiple subjects, ordered according to perceived gloss within each subject, we propose a head-tail (least and most glossy image of each subject) selective comparison approach for ordering the entire database. We conducted a two-alternative forced-choice empirical study to compare the facial gloss across subjects within each group. Using the gloss scores of selected candidates and the gloss range of a reference subject, we fit each within-subject gloss range to a global gloss range and quantized the scores into distinct gloss levels. We then conducted another empirical study to validate the quantized gloss levels. The results show that in 90% of the cases, the levels are consistent with human judgments. Based on the database with quantized gloss \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Most full-reference quality metrics compare the original image to a distorted image at the same level of resolution assuming a fixed viewing distance. In video streaming applications, however, the transmitted or received signal may differ from the original in compression as well as spatiotemporal resolution. For example, at low bitrate coding applications the compressed image may be too distorted, and hence the observer may prefer to reduce the resolution or increase the viewing distance in order to reduce the visibility of the compression artifacts. The selection of the best tradeoff between resolution/viewing distance and visibility of compression artifacts requires a quality metric that accounts for both image distortions and image size. Such tradeoffs are not reflected in existing quality metrics, which ignore the signal visibility and only measure the visibility of compression distortions, which decrease with image size.

This could be intimidating or discouraging, but human performance also can provide inspiration and a performance goal for scientists and engineers working in the field. Many image-and videoprocessing algorithms rely, at least implicitly, on the properties of human vision. Image halftoning (displaying continuous-tone images using a limited number of colors), for example, would not be possible without the ability of the eye to act as a spatial lowpass filter. Movies would be perceived as a sequence of still-frame images were it not for the ability of the eye to act as a temporal lowpass filter. There has been a lot of progress recently in incorporating explicit HVS models in image processing algorithms to maximize system performance.

Recently proposed structural texture similarity (STSIM) metrics assign high similarity scores to such perceptually identical textured patches, even though they may have significant pixel-wise deviations. We use an STSIM approach that compares a set of statistical patch descriptors through a weighted distance, and, given a dataset of labeled texture images partitioned into classes of perceptually identical patches, we calculate the weights as the variances of each statistic centered around the mean of its class.

This is particularly important for textured regions, which can have significant point-by-point differences, even though to the human eye they appear to be the same.

We also show that contrast modification of an image with near-frontal illumination can compensate for the change in perceived gloss due to an oblique illumination (of the same texture at the same viewing angle).",

The image is compressed by losslessly coding the pixels in a square grid of lines and adding bits when needed to preserve structural information. The decoder uses the MRF model to reconstruct the interior of each block bounded by the grid, based on the pixels on its boundary, plus the extra bits provided for certain blocks. The idea is that, as long as the key structural information is preserved, then the smooth contours of the block having highest probability with respect to the MRF provides acceptable reconstructions.

Since the original data consists of a limited number of images (25 subjects, front and side view, before and after skin cleansing), we apply different transformations to surface and subsurface reflection images, in order to generate a broad range of appearance of skin images. We conducted two empirical studies with the expanded set of data, at both the macro-scale level (whole face) and the meso-scale level (local skin patch). We found that increasing the contrast of surface reflection results in higher gloss perception, while a decrease in the amount of subsurface reflection (lower average lightness, darker complexion) results in higher gloss perception; however, the differential effect of subsurface reflection on gloss diminishes as the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Matched-Texture Coding is a novel image coder that utilizes the self-similarity of natural images that include textures, in order to achieve structurally lossless compression. The key to a high compression ratio is replacing large image blocks with previously encoded blocks with similar structure. Adjusting the lighting of the replaced block is critical for eliminating illumination artifacts and increasing the number of matches. We propose a new adaptive lighting correction method that is based on the Poisson equation with incomplete boundary conditions. In order to fully exploit the benefits of the adaptive Poisson lighting correction, we also propose modifications of the side-matching (SM) algorithm and structural texture similarity metric. We show that the resulting matched-texture algorithm achieves better coding performance.",

Rate-distortion (R-D) optimization is carried out to determine the encoding mode for each packet and the channel coding rates, in order to minimize the overall expected end-to-end distortion.

In this paper, we conducted further experiments with several images, different encoders, and a finer set of bitrates to determine the preferred resolution at each bit rate, and also the resolution at which there are no visible coding artifacts. Analysis of the subjective results using a wavelet-based perceptual quality metric verifies our earlier conclusion that human observers tend to reduce resolution in order to maintain image quality, but are willing to accept more artifacts as image size decreases.",

Automatic classification is useful for organizing large digital collections, for automatic artistic recommendation, and even for mobile capture and identification by consumers. Our evaluation uses variable resolution painting data gathered across Internet sources rather than solely using professional high-resolution data. Consequently, we believe this solution better addresses the task of classifying consumer-quality digital captures than other existing approaches.

Better performance can be achieved when LRI is combined with complementary texture features, e.g., Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and the proposed Subband Contrast Distribution.
