            "Abstract": "Over the years, digital games have become one of adolescents' main interests and a controversial issue among researchers all over the world. However, it is claimed that digital games can be a promising educational tool utilizing both the attributes that make them effective in the learning process and the students' predisposition to deal with them. The present study explores the background of digital game use in a group of Greek adolescents (N=125) (12 to 16 years old) and the potential of using digital games as an educational tool, on a socio-cognitive learning theory basis. Gender differences were revealed; concerning the time spent playing digital games, the game preferences, and the identification with the hero of the game. There was no correlation of frequent digital game use with low academic performance, though frequent game use was partially correlated with low self-esteem and high computer self-efficacy.",

To achieve such goals, many academic institutions implement teacher professional development (TPD) programs to support the professional development of the educational community. The goal of our research is to design an online TPD program which allocates roles and activities to learners and manages their progression through both in order to maximise the learning benefits. To this end, a PBLJii script orchestrated in line with the principles of a PBL model and the Jigsaw II collaborative strategy in a CSCL environment (Moodle) was designed and implemented to bolster collaboration and communication skills among teachers.

Initiative and self-direction skills are needed, including the ability to manage goals and time, to work independently, and be self-directed learners. On the other hand, e-learning has brought changes in every field of formal and informal education, such as training programs, basic education, and life-long learning. However, e-learning is not inherently motivating and can even be demotivating due to technological, intrapersonal, and interpersonal hurdles. A hallmark of e-learning is its reliance on learner autonomy, also called independent or self-directed learning.

            "Abstract": "Gamification constitutes a new methodology in instructional design that gains more and more attention in education field. Many systems utilize gamification techniques for the purposes of different fields, such as marketing, education and computer science (Werbach & Hunter, 2012). Gamification increases the levels of engagement of users (Lamprinou, 2015; Alafouzou, 2017). Consequently, gamified learning systems promote motivation improvement both in learning and training. However, developing a gamified learning system requires a background of a theory of Motivation, based on which the levels of engagement and motivation can be measured. This theoretical research proposes an enhancement of ARCS model (Keller, 1979) in a gamified learning environment using the characteristics of Project Based Learning. The ARCS model of motivation combines four theories; Bandura\u2019s Theory of Self-Efficacy, Berlyne\u2019s Theory of Curiosity and Arousal, Maslow\u2019s Needs Hierarchy and Rotter\u2019s Locus of Control and consists of four core components; Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction (Keller, 1983). The approach of Project Based Learning is very strong match with the ARCS Model, as this model can be used with many models of instructional design (Keller, 1987a, 1999, 2000a; Keller & Suzuki, 2004). Project based learning is a teaching methodology that promotes authentic learning experiences through real world problem solving and investigation. Having learners create projects allows them to engage in more active learning rather than absorbing material in an isolated learning environment. Besides, the eight characteristics of \u2026",

There is a need to examine the way individuals can engage in effective goal setting, enhance self-regulated learning and promote academic and professional development.

Based on the findings of the ePortfolio implementation, the design of an affective goal-setting Plug in for self-regulated learners is proposed to enable the latter to feel self-efficient since they have set hierarchical specific goals for themselves, selected appropriate strategies, achieved a desirable state and felt satisfied with their effort.",

In a landscape of technology innovations, teacher professional development should try to capitalize on modern internet-based tools and services, better known as Web 2.0 and virtual worlds, in an effort to meet the increasing lifelong learning needs of pre-and in-service teachers. In this paper we suggest using the Second Life MUVE for teaching role-playing instruction to practitioners. After designing and implementing a 3D virtual learning environment in Second Life according to cognitive apprenticeship methods, we taught role-playing instruction to fifteen primary and secondary school teacher educators, using as a case scenario a rhapsody from Homer\u2019s Odyssey. We applied qualitative research methods to investigate the effect of role-playing on affective, behavioral and cognitive engagement of our participants. Our exploratory study indicated that learning role-playing instruction in a virtual learning environment has positive impact on learning engagement.",

Extending previous research on ne (x) t generation skills and the impact of personal factors in enhancing human performance, such as Self-Regulation (SR) skills, and acknowledging the lack of theoretical foundations based on interdisciplinary perspectives of computer science, instructional design and learning psychology for training, we design e-learning courses based on Self-Regulation learning theory using the virtual environment of Second Life to enhance situated experience in professional and career development. As a result, we present an educational script and its components, in order to describe the structures of interaction that we use to design learning activities that would enhance selfregulation skills in a VLE. This script is used as a tool for conducting experiments in e-learning courses, studying the design, development and evaluation of the collaborative learning process in Second Life.",

It is recognised that the capability of self-regulation exists in all human beings and this enables us to survive, evolve and improve ourselves. Researchers have indicated that self-regulation can be taught, but the period of the attainment is often long. However, a start must be made and the earlier the better. While problem solving is placed in the heart of mathematics (NCTM, 2000), it is considered to contribute to the whole thinking processes. Nevertheless, differences in mathematical problem solving ability begin to appear in Grade 1 and increase gradually throughout the formal years of schooling. These differences have already been recorded and are known as \u2018novice\u2019compared to \u2018expert\u2019differences. However, there is a period of unknown duration which raises some questions in which novices are transformed into experts. Students who pass through this period in mathematics are called \u2018medium\u2019solvers by their teacher. The present pilot study examines this period in three different environments in an effort to describe under what conditions the transformation is achieved more effectively.

Participants were 20 undergraduate students in a physics course, who were randomly assigned to participate in the 3 different modutes. Results indicated that the AHLE had a strong impact on students' perception of physics and metacognitive components of learning. Analysis of the results reveals a strong shift of students towards developing metacognitive strategies (conceptual change) and this is primarily true for students with a high self-esteem and FI as cognitive parameter. A web tool de-signed by the authors to count the number of trials of students indicates that students with a high degree of meta-learning have a low number of trials.

Although PBL learning has been studied extensively and a number of papers have discussed the merits of implementing PBL in educational environments, greater emphasis should be given on how it can be adapted to teach language effectively in secondary education. To make language learning skills more effective, an educational scenario was prepared based on the principles of a PBL model and the Jigsaw II collaborative strategy in a Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) environment (Moodle). This educational scenario was designed and implemented so as to bolster collaboration and to enhance the language learning skills for high school students.

More specifically, this paper includes the empirical findings of the research which used quantitative analysis techniques to investigate the relationship between physiological factors in MMOGs, such as sense community, performance and intrinsic motivation. In order to understand the reason why MMOGs are so popular to people, and especially to students, a research was conducted in a population of students who play a popular MMOG, called World of Warcraft (WoW). The findings of this research revealed that the ability to create groups and develop a sense of community in a game is motivating for the players. Moreover, the sense of belonging in a community was positive correlated with the players\u2019 performance, implying that the performance of a player can be enhanced when the sense of community in a game is strong. These findings suggest that the development of groups of players in a game is possible to increase intrinsic motivation of players and enhance their performance in the game. Therefore, the contribution of this paper to games-based learning research is that it provides empirical results for the reason why MMOGs, such as WoW, are so popular to people: it seems that the players\u2019 ability to form groups and develop a sense of belonging in them intrinsically motivates the players to play and perform well in these games.

These teams are often virtual and the role of the leader is changing rapidly from\" directing/controlling\" a system, to\" disturbing/facilitating\" the network. This new type of leader must facilitate the creation of highly adaptive and regularly changing organization structures, teams, and communications via a Transformational Leadership (TL) behaviour, by which change is introduced to individuals and/or organizations. For all these reasons, organizations are increasingly searching for leadership training programs that can help leaders adapt to their new role and enhance their performance. However, most trainings are based on lectures, causing participants' lack of engagement and motivation toward the training program and leading to low percentage of skill transfer.

Blended learning also is used to describe learning that mixes various event-based activities, including face-to-face classrooms, live e-learning, and self-paced learning. Blended learning's role is to go beyond online course delivery and actually transform the educational experience. To that end, including educational technology that supports a full range of teaching and learning styles and optimises intellectual and technical resources along with traditional pedagogic forms in University teaching appears to become a necessity in a technological ever-changing world.",

This new generation of games, such as the MMOGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Games), have become very popular and their users spend thousands of hours analyzing in a fast pace new situations, interacting with multiple characters, and solving problems quickly and independently. It is claimed that MMOGs are popular mainly because they motivate players to create communities and interact with each other. On the contrary, the high dropout rate of e-learning is linked with low rates of self-motivation and self-direction in e-Learning. According to these thoughts, there is a need to find new educational technologies that would ensure the learners' greater motivation and persistence to e-learning courses.

            "Abstract": "In education, instructors adopt different instructional modes that correspond to their preferred teaching style: some focus on principles and others on applications; some present the material in a logical progression of small incremental steps, others proceed from the big picture to the detail and so on. On the other side, students are characterized by different learning styles: preferences or predispositions to behave in a particular way when engaged in a learning process. In the elearning area, adaptive educational hypermedia applications are designed in order to offer personalised learning experience based on the personal learning style. It has been proven that the good match between learning style and instructional design drives to effective learning. This paper proposes a systematic approach for designing leaning tasks for educational hypermedia applications that suit the individual learning style. In particular, we show how the design patterns approach can be used as a design model tool.",

The integration of the iPad in education, in particular, is thought to bring a paradigm shift and transform the twenty-first century classroom. However, as it is relatively new and experiences from pilot projects are just now beginning to surface, little concrete research on how it can be effectively adopted in the classroom and in other pedagogical activities exists. This raises the question of how to support students and teachers to realize the full potential of the 1:1 iPad approach. We followed the principles of action research in order to explore students\u2019, teachers\u2019 and parents perception of 1:1 iPad approach in the classroom. Towards this, we conducted a mixed-method research and combined quantitative and qualitative data. For the needs of this research, we \u2026",

Correlation analysis was used to examine the connection between the perceptions of learners on authentic assessment and study approach (deep/surface), reflective thinking, motivation and dimensions of authentic assessment in a web based collaborative learning environment. Findings indicate that authentic assessment promotes deep study approach, reflection and intrinsic goal orientation. Learners strongly connect web based authentic assessment with overall authenticity, task, physical context, results, criteria and criterion transparency. Educators and constructors of CSCL environments could use authentic assessment as an alternative and more efficient way of assessment and learning. Well organized and understandable to learners standards, authentic tasks, criteria and rubrics enhance authenticity in assessment.",

MMOGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Games) and MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role\u2011Playing Games) are complex systems, in which players are self\u2011organized and collaborate in guilds; constantly improve to remain competitive, visioning the enemys and guilds reaction. Nevertheless, these are considered to be important leadership skills for the real world, revealing multiple similarities that link the gaming world and the real world. However, despite the significant amount of educational research and the growing interest of the scientific community in MMOGs, there is a lack of empirical research considering the cognitive and social aspects of these games. This paper outlines the theoretical rationale behind a doctoral research project which is currently in progress and examines the leadership skills that can be developed in a self\u2011organized community of MMOGs. The main questions that this project attempts to address are: What characteristics related to the social nature of MMOGs activate leadership skills? What MMOGs can teach us about the design of successful online social spaces and activities for teaching leadership skills in virtual teams? In order to address these issues, this paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the social interactions in multiplayer games, within the context of community of practice, connectivism, self\u2011organization and activity theory.
