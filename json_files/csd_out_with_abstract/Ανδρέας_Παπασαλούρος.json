This transformation is driven by mobility, wireless interfaces, and built-in sensors that these smart devices offer in order to enable blended and context-sensitive mobile learning (m-Learning) activities. Thus, m-Learning is becoming more independent and ubiquitous (u-Learning). In order to identify and analyze the main trends and the future challenging issues involved in designing mGBL learning strategies, as well as to bring to the foreground important issues pertaining to mobile and context-aware ubiquitous GBL, the work at hand conducts a comprehensive survey of this particular area. Specifically, it introduces and applies a six-dimensional framework consisted of Spatio-temporal, Collaboration/Social, Session, Personalization, Data security & privacy, and Pedagogy \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Networked learning is much more ambitious than previous approaches of ICT-support in education. It is therefore more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the networked learning activities. Evaluation of learners\u2019 interactions in networked learning environments is a difficult, resource and expertise demanding task. Educators participating in online learning environments, have very little support by integrated tools to evaluate students\u2019 activities and identify learners\u2019 online browsing behavior and interactions. As a consequence, educators are in need for non-intrusive and automatic ways to get feedback from learners\u2019 progress in order to better follow their learning process and appraise the online course effectiveness. They also need specialized tools for authoring, delivering, gathering and analysing data for evaluating the learning effectiveness of networked learning courses.Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose a new set of services for the evaluator and lecturer so that he/she can easily evaluate the learners\u2019 progress and produce evaluation reports based on learners\u2019 behaviour within a Learning Management System. These services allow the evaluator to easily track down the learners\u2019 online behavior at specific milestones set up, gather feedback in an automatic way and present them in a comprehensive way. The innovation of the proposed set of services lies on the effort to adopt/adapt some of the web usage mining techniques combining them with the use of semantic description of networked learning tasks",

Indeed, though much ingenuity, experience and effort are placed in the design and construction of such systems, their faultless functioning during their operation is not guaranteed without proper maintenance. This problem is more serious in some categories of technical systems. Among them are the mobile communication systems especially their radio access network and in particular the Base Transceiver Station sites (BTS sites). Maintenance has many facets i.e. recognition of a malfunction within a short time, determination of the faulty parts, availability of spare parts needed to repair malfunctions, etc. Another facet of maintenance is the gathering of proper data, right after the repair of a malfunction in the system, which could be used for extracting statistical data regarding the actual functioning of the system. Such statistical data are useful, for example \u2026",

As it happens in the physical economy, the grid economy must be supported by services that locate resources based not only on their characteristics, but also on market-related properties, the properties and constraints of offers and requests, as well as on declarative specifications of peers' (providers and consumers) features. Resource retrieval in the context of a grid economy extends the notion of resource matchmaking to the process of discovering those markets that trade resources through market orders. This paper describes an ontology that represents resource orders (offers and requests) in a market-oriented resource retrieval process, and describes the Semantic Information System (SIS) that exploits this ontology for the retrieval of markets.

Within this context, knowledge acquisition in this timely and important field has greater chances to be more fruitful when the learner is properly motivated. Also, it is anticipated to be more joyful when knowledge is acquired in the form of a digital game-based activity. The paper at hand discusses the development of a novel mobile app called CyberAware, destined to cybersecurity education and awareness. At present, the game is designed for K-6 children in order to support either or both formal or informal learning. Additionally, due to its mobile characteristics, the game can be experienced as an outdoor or classroom activity. Finally, opposite to similar studies found in the literature so far, our attention is not solely drawn to game\u2019s technological aspects but equally to the educational factor. This is achieved through the consideration and use of the ARCS motivational model already from the game\u2019s design phase.",

They also offer adaptive sequencing (navigation) over the learning content based on rules that stem from the user model requirements and the instructional strategies. EAHA are gaining the focus of the research community as a means of alleviating a number of user problems related to hypermedia. However, despite the growing interest of the community and the increasing number of available systems, the actual impact of these systems in e-learning remains low. The difficulty and complexity of developing such applications and systems have been identified as a possible reason for this low diffusion of Adaptive Hypermedia in web-based education. The development of EAHA (authoring process) is a complex task engaging people with different backgrounds: instructional designers, subject matter experts, content developers, multimedia developers, user interface experts, programmers, etc. Experience from traditional Software Engineering as well as Hypermedia Engineering suggests that a model-driven design approach is appropriate in developing applications where such requirements and constraints occur. This paper presents on a model-driven design process of EAHA. This process accords to the principles of hypermedia engineering and its innovation is the use of a formally specified object oriented design model.",

There are now justifiable research and development efforts that attempt to formalize the engineering process of such applications in order to achieve better learning effectiveness as well as development efficiency. A lot of work has been done in the field of the instructional designing rather than on hypermedia designing of such applications. Most of the design methods that have been used are general purpose hypermedia design methods which do not allow much in either the conformance of the design models to the latest learning technology standards, or in their seamless translation to standard data formats. This paper presents an attempt for facilitating the conceptual design of web-based educational application by meta-modelling their underlying content and navigational structure. This work is based upon and also extends the OOHDM principles. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) serves the purpose of notation syntax and semantics for this meta-model.

The integration of key technologies such as Semantic Wiki and Argumentation models with Ontology Engineering (OE) serve as an enabler of e-class construction for different domainspecific information spaces. Such e-classes provide two kinds of lessons, ie a) lessons concerning how an information space is shaped into an ontology (development knowledge) and b) lessons concerning the analysis of the domain itself (domain knowledge). An e-class captures the created knowledge (both domain and development) in ontological models for future reference and teaching.

As it happens in the physical economy, grid economy must be supported by services that locate resources based not only on their characteristics, but also on market-related properties, offerspsila and requestspsila properties and constraints, as well as on declarative specifications of peerspsila (providers and consumers) features. Resource retrieval in the context of a grid economy extends the notion of resource matchmaking to the process of discovering those markets that trade resources through market orders.

            "Abstract": "The paper presents a novel approach which aims to support the training of decision makers in maritime environmental pollution policies via an intelligent tutoring system that focuses on the automatic generation of self-assessment material. More specifically, the paper reports on the automatic construction of multiple-choice question tests from knowledge bases ie domain ontologies, instances, if-then rules, and multimedia objects. The reported work has been conducted with a prototype environmental pollution knowledge base (focused on maritime pollution with oil) representing ontology classes and instances in OWL language and rules in SWRL, capturing knowledge related to policies of diagnosis and response, and environmental-change events, for oil spill pollution.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a framework that aims to support the active participation and collaboration of knowledge workers and engineers in the co-authoring of place-based, cross-cultural and media-rich memories, experiences, stories and narration. To achieve this, the framework proposes a novel approach for facilitating such a participation and collaboration through the semantic integration of data/information and integrated tools that will be both accessible via an open, user-friendly, mobile and knowledge-based platform, emphasizing a low-effort participative and guided co-authoring approach. The presented collaborative and participative approach is expected to foster social cohesion in heterogeneous communities of interest and practice. For the realization of the framework, we propose the implementation of a proof-of-concept system and its evaluation in the socio-cultural group of immigrants and refugees within the context of creating and sharing knowledge related to the physical and digital artifacts of a modern art museum. Our vision for the proposed framework is to introduce new technology for the collaborative authoring of cultural experiences with low effort using an intelligent assistant. Additionally, we envision a Shared Experiences Ecosystem (SEE) that aims to provide media-rich content and tools that will eventually foster the inclusive access of heterogeneous socio-cultural groups to shared experiences, increasing social cohesion in resilient local environments.

This paper presents a new language named COSTLy for describing certain mechanisms of CSCL scripts, namely, group formation and task distribution. The expressiveness of the proposed language is demonstrated by describing jigsaw, a well-known CSCL script. The proposed descriptions are automatically transformed into constraint logic programs which can be executed so as to support group formation in actual scenario instances.",

The model is primarily originated on the Adaptive Hypermedia Applications Model (AHAM), and extends it by defining the presentation layer of a particular Hypermedia Application. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) serves the purpose of notation syntax and semantics for this model. The theoretical analysis of the model is accompanied by an case study application for the design of an adaptive web-based testing system.",

Although other methods have been already reported in the literature, the proposed approach is based on ontologies, representing both domain and multimedia knowledge. The article also reports on a prototype implementation of this approach, which automatically creates tests using the Semantic Web standard technology OWL (Ontology Web Language) as well as proper annotations of images. The proposed approach is independent of specific domain characteristics, since question items are generated according to generic ontology-based strategies. In the presented prototype implementation, simple natural language generation techniques are used to project the items in the tests.",

E-Learning Resource Brokers are a potential solution to this problem, as they represent the state-of-the-art in facilitating the exchange of learning resources between multiple parties. These systems currently operate at a limited scale but their use is vastly increasing, especially in the context of multifaceted educational organizations, such as virtual universities. This paper presents some of these systems that are extensively used in the e-learning market. It then moves on to provide an overview of the ideal functionality that e-Learning Resource Brokers should provide. Finally it discusses future trends in their development, within the context of global e-learning forces.",

This report is a public version of the document\" D2. 1\u2013Requirements for Grid4All Virtual Organisations and Resource Management and State of art analysis\", as specified in the Grid4All Annex 2\" Description of Work\". The objective of Grid4All is to provide middleware support and higher level services for the creation and maintenance of virtual organisations formed of autonomous entities in an open environment. This aim of this project is to address nonconventional Grid users, that is, not just large enterprises and scientific institutions, but small organisations, and individual users on the Internet. This report corresponding to Deliverable report D2. 1 presents the requirements, detailed state of art analysis, and architectures for both the management middleware and higher level services required to support maintenance and evolution of virtual organisations. This report is structured in four major parts. Open and volatile environments require middleware with self-management and self-organisation capabilities. The first chapter presents an architecture based framework that takes its source from autonomic computing and addresses essentially creation, deployment, and maintenance of virtual organisations. The second chapter addresses allocation of computational resources with an approach based on open resource markets. Information and discovery services are essential for the operation of virtual organisations. The third chapter addresses the heterogeneity through an approach \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Automatic assessment has recently drawn the efforts of researchers in a number of fields. While most available approaches deal with the construction of question items that assess factual and conceptual knowledge, this paper presents a method and a tool for generating questions assessing procedural knowledge, in the form of simple proof problems in the domain of the Euclidean Geometry. The method is based on rules defined as Horn clauses. The method enumerates candidate problems and certain techniques are proposed for selecting interesting problems. With certain adaptations, the method is possible to be applied in other knowledge domains as well.",

            "Abstract": "There is an exponentially increasing demand for provisioning of high-quality learning resources, which is not satisfied by current web technologies and systems. E-Learning Resource Brokers are a potential solution to this problem, as they represent the state-of-the-art in facilitating the exchange of learning resources between multiple parties. These systems currently operate at a limited scale but their use is vastly increasing, especially in the context of multi-faceted educational organizations, such as virtual universities. This paper presents some of these systems that are extensively used in the e-learning market. It then moves on to provide an overview of the ideal functionality that e-Learning Resource Brokers should provide. Finally it discusses future trends in their development, within the context of global e-learning forces.",

The market-based environment in a democratized Grid context poses new requirements concerning the functionality of a semantic information system. In this context, the paper motivates the development of the Grid4All Semantic Information System (G4A-SIS) and presents the design and the technologies used for the realization of this system. G4A-SIS is deployed as a web service using a Java API which defines the functionality of the system and abstracts low-level ontology implementation details, providing to the clients an interface for registering and querying semantically annotated market and application-specific services.

This paper proposes a framework on the analysis of potentiality and on the evaluation of LMSs\u2019 admissibility. The most commonly used LMSs have been selected for the application of this specific framework. The aim of the evaluation is twofold; to search their usefulness and their quality in use.",

            "Abstract": "Learning Management Systems are sophisticated web-based applications that are being engineered today in increasing numbers by numerous institutions and companies that want to get involved in e-learning either for providing services to third parties, or for educating and training their own people. Even though the construction of such systems has been taking place for many years, they are still designed and developed from scratch. The reason is that experience from previous Learning Management Systems, is not codified or documented, resulting in forcing the development teams to \u2018re-invent the wheel\u2019. This paper presents an approach of recording design experience in the form of design patterns for Learning Management Systems and aims at developing a pattern language for these systems.",
