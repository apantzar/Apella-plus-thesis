            "Abstract": "When writing source code, programmers have varying levels of freedom when it comes to the creation and use of identifiers. Do they habitually use the same identifiers, names that are different to those used by others? Is it then possible to tell who the author of a piece of code is by examining these identifiers? If so, can we use the presence or absence of identifiers to assist in correctly classifying programs to authors? Is it possible to hide the provenance of programs by identifier renaming? In this study, we assess the importance of three types of identifiers in source code author classification for two different Java program data sets. We do this through a sequence of experiments in which we disguise one type of identifier at a time. These experiments are performed using as a tool the Source Code Author Profiles (SCAP) method. The results show that, although identifiers when examined as a whole do not seem to reflect program authorship for these data sets, when examined separately there is evidence that class names do signal the author of the program. In contrast, simple variables and method names used in Java programs do not appear to reflect program authorship. On the contrary, our analysis suggests that such identifiers are so common as to mask authorship. We believe that these results have applicability in relation to the robustness of code plagiarism analysis and that the underlying methods could be valuable in cases of litigation arising from disputes over program authorship.",

            "Abstract": "Within Information and Knowledge Society the concept of Privacy has been enriched including aspects related to digital life, while the right to online Privacy gains more and more attention daily due to several cases of privacy breaches. Privacy is associated with the control, access and use or misuse of personal information by others, including governments, companies and other users as well. Social Network Sites as a part of digital space have altered the way that people communicate and have contributed to the construction of online social networks. During online interaction, users disclose information about them or others, while at the same time they express their concerns about Privacy infringement that may come up due to self-disclosure practices, not restricting or reversing though their disclosure behavior. Thus the \u201cPrivacy paradox\u201d phenomenon is recorded since users cannot balance between Privacy concerns and their need for disclosure. Privacy\u2019s circumvention destabilizes the trust between social actors, increases the feelings of insecurity and puts into risk social cohesion which is a prerequisite for the sustainability of our society.

Cloud computing technology and services, despite the advantages they bring to the market, have created number of issues regarding the security and trust of the individuals using them. Incidents occurring in cloud computing environments are hard to be solved since digital forensic methods used to conduct digital investigations are not suitable for cloud computing investigations. This is due to the fact that they do not consider the specific characteristics of the Cloud. Cloud forensics has been introduced to help forensic investigators find potential evidence against cloud criminal activities and maintain the security and integrity of the information stored in the cloud.  Cloud forensics introduces processes for resolving incidents occurring in cloud computing environments. However, designing cloud services capable to assist a cloud investigation process when an incident occurs is of vital importance and recent research efforts concentrate on these directions. In addition, digital forensics methods cannot support a cloud investigation since cloud environments introduce many differences compared to traditional IT environments. Although cloud forensics assists in the direction of investigating and solving cloud-based cyber-crimes, in many cases the design and implementation of cloud services falls back. Software engineers should focus their attention on the design and implementation of cloud services that can be investigated in a sound forensic manner.

Privacy concerns have emerged as some database segments contain sensitive data. Data mining techniques are used to parse, process, and manage enormous amounts of data while ensuring the preservation of private information. Cryptography, as shown by previous research, is the most accurate approach to acquiring knowledge while maintaining privacy. In this paper, we present an extension of a privacy-preserving data mining algorithm, thoroughly designed and developed for both horizontally and vertically partitioned databases, which contain either nominal or numeric attribute values. The proposed algorithm exploits the multi-candidate election schema to construct a privacy-preserving tree-augmented naive Bayesian classifier, a more robust variation of the classical naive Bayes classifier. The exploitation of the Paillier cryptosystem and the distinctive homomorphic primitive shows in the security analysis that privacy is ensured and the proposed algorithm provides strong defences against common attacks. Experiments deriving the benefits of real world databases demonstrate the preservation of private data while mining processes occur and the efficient handling of both database partition types.",

            "Abstract": "Foreseeable 4G environments will extensively take advantage of the concept of context transfer to provide seamless secure handovers between different administrative domains. However, the utilization of context transfer comes with a cost in the users' privacy. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on these privacy issues and propose two privacy enhanced context transfer schemes that alleviate these problems. In the first scheme the Mobile Node (MN) is responsible for the transmission of the context to the new domain. In the second scheme the Home Domain (HD) of the user forwards the context acting as a proxy between the old and the new domain. In addition, assuming that the most appropriate form of user identity for the context is the Network Access Identifier (NAI), we show how the employment of temporary NAIs can further increase the privacy of our schemes.",

Services such as audio/video streaming, digital libraries, on-line businesses, and live camera remote surveillance are widely deployed. Users will be able to access these services anytime, anywhere, and using any computing device in a pervasive way. For example, a user may bring a PDA on a field trip, carry a laptop (with both wireless and wired network cards) on a business trip, use high performance workstations at work, and use desktop PCs at home (with dial-up, cable, or DSL connection). In another example, a user continues to watch the soccer game over home TV, while he watches the game through a mobile device out of home. Some other ubiquitous multimedia services include mobile games and entertainment, mobile blog, mobile community, home network, and so on \u2026",

This security property, which is called non-repudiation, becomes more important in Digital Rights Management (DRM) scenarios, where a consumer can freely access to certain contents but needs to obtain the proper Right Object (RO) from a vendor in order to process it. Any breach in this process could result on financial loss for any peer, thus it is necessary to provide a service that allows the creation of trusted evidence. Unfortunately, non-repudiation services has not been included so far in DRM specifications due to practical issues and the type of content distributed. In this paper we analyze how to allow the integration of non-repudiation services to a DRM framework, providing a set of protocols that allows the right objects acquisition to be \u2026",

A significant aspect of protection comes down to the attitudes, awareness, behaviour and capabilities of the people involved, and they often need support in order to get it right. Factors such as lack of awareness and understanding, combined with unreasonable demands from security technologies, can dramatically impede their ability to act securely and comply with policies. Ensuring appropriate attention to the needs of users is therefore a vital element of a successful security strategy, and they need to understand how the issues may apply to them and how to use the available technology to protect their systems.With the above in mind, the Human Aspects of Information Security and Assurance (HAISA) symposium series specifically addresses information security issues that relate to people. It concerns the methods that inform and guide users' understanding of security, and the technologies that can benefit and support them in achieving protection.",

Therefore, privacy issues are becoming increasingly important. In this paper we model the risk that an IT firm is exposed to, as a result of potential privacy violation incidents. The proposed model is based on random utility modeling and aims at capturing the subjective nature of the question: \u201dhow important is a privacy violation incident to someone?\u201d. Furthermore, we propose a collective risk model for the economic exposure of the firm due to privacy violation. These models are useful for the design and valuation of optimal privacy related insurance contracts for the firm and are supportive to its risk management process.",

Among others, the criteria of model distinguishability, completeness, compactness, and fuzzy set sharing between rules are considered. To support distinguishability, the distances between fuzzy set centers are lower bounded and the widths are manipulated as to control the overlap between fuzzy sets. Sufficient conditions are given to satisfy the completeness criterion, whereas the compactness requirement is addressed by comparing models with different number of rules. Finally, fuzzy set sharing between rules is achieved through a model optimization procedure that involves fuzzy set merging. It turns out that the feasible region is a compact and convex set. The tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy is established by minimizing the model's \u2026",

To do so, we delve deeper into the security policy notion and discover the importance of taming security policy semantics and using uniform policy representations. We present the Security Policy Ontology (SPO) notion along with basic SPO design criteria. Finally, we use the SPO notion to construct a generic framework that enhances security policy negotiation in the Grid; we exemplify using two simple security policies.",

In an OSBE protocol, an encrypted message can only be decrypted by the receiver who holds a valid signature on a public message, while the sender (encrypter) does not know whether the receiver has the signature or not. Our major contributions in this work lie in the following aspects. We improve the notion of OSBE so that a valid credential holder cannot share his/her credential with other users (i.e., all-or-nothing non-transferability). We clarify the relationship between one-round OSBE and identity-based encryption (IBE) and show that one-round OSBE and semantically secure IBE against the adaptively chosen identity attack (IND-ID-CPA) are equivalent, if the signature in the OSBE scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptively chosen message \u2026",

In this regard high availability, reliability and redundancy are key factors for any SIP based infrastructure. In an adverse environment, especially the Internet and foreseeable 3GPP IMS, high availability solutions are of major importance for SIP network components to smoothly mitigate call increments, device failures, misconfigurations, physical disasters and throttle active attacks. This paper proposes a practical and transparent failover solution for SIP and RTP-Proxy servers. We demonstrate that both methods work properly and increase stability and availability of such systems. Furthermore, high availability solutions are enhanced through the employment of easy to implement load balancing schemes. All the proposed solutions are technically analyzed and evaluated via properly designed test-beds, showing fine performance in terms of service times.",

Since medical services and the associated to them information are considered particularly sensitive, the employment of wireless sensors in medical environments poses many security issues and challenges. However, security services and the underlying key management mechanisms cannot be seen separately from the efficiency and scalability requirements. Network clustering used in both routing and group key management mechanisms can improve the efficiency and scalability and therefore can also be envisioned in medical environments. This paper introduces a general framework for cluster-based wireless sensor medical environments on the top of which efficient security mechanisms can rely.

The negotiation process requires efficient modeling methods for the determination of secure access states and demands support from automated tools aiming to support administrators and to minimize human intervention; thus making the whole process more efficient and less error-prone. In this paper we define a framework that enables the representation of policy merging between autonomous domains, as a constraint satisfaction problem, while remaining neutral in regard to the policy language. Role and permission hierarchies are modeled using the constraint programming formalism. Policy mappings are utilized in order to enable cross-organizational role assignment. Further optimization on policy mappings is achieved by \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing provides a wide range of services to organisations in a flexible and cost efficient manner. Nevertheless, inherent cloud security issues make organisations hesitant towards the migration of their services to cloud. In parallel, the cloud service-oriented nature requires a specific and more demanding description of the business functional requirements intended for migration. Organisations need to transform their functional requirements based on a specific language, taking into account the respective non-functional requirements of the migrating services. Thus, the need for an approach that will holistically capture organisations' security and privacy requirements and transform them to cloud service requirements is immense. To this end, this paper presents an approach that takes as input abstract security and privacy requirements and produces through a semi-automatic process various alternative implementation options for cloud services. To achieve that a series of model transformations are utilised in order to create a mapping between the organisational and the operational level of the system's analysis.",

In this world, every entity (be it a machine, a daily object, a person, or anything) can have a globally locatable, addressable, and readable virtual counterpart, which can collaborate with each other in the provisioning of various services. This concept is slowly becoming a reality: specific standards are being developed, new research results are being obtained, and novel services are being provided by both newborn start-ups and experienced companies in various areas (eg, SCADA systems, smart grids, smart cities). However, several significant obstacles hinder the full implementation of this concept, and among them are the security issues. In fact, as there is already \u2026",

Lately, there is much focus on alternative, distributed approaches, which attempt to overcome the single organization\u2019s KM paradigm, and develop inter-organizational knowledge exchange infrastructures. Effective management from a security perspective is always a serious and difficult to achieve challenge, especially when it comes to managing resources from cooperating autonomous domains. Security issues in Information Systems coalition enabling environments are treated in this paper and a secure distributed KM architecture is being presented.",

            "Abstract": "Source code author identification deals with identifying the most likely author of a computer program, given a set of predefined author candidates. There are several scenarios where digital evidence of this kind plays a role in investigation and adjudication, such as code authorship disputes, intellectual property infringement, tracing the source of code left in the system after a cyber attack, and so forth. As in any identification task, the disputed program is compared to undisputed, known programming samples by the predefined author candidates. We present a new approach, called the SCAP (Source Code Author Profiles) approach, based on byte-level n-gram profiles representing the source code author\u2019s style. The SCAP method extends a method originally applied to natural language text authorship attribution; we show that an n-gram approach also suits the characteristics of source code analysis. The methodological extension includes a simplified profile and a less complicated, but more effective, similarity measure. Experiments on data sets of different programming-language (Java or C++) and commented/commentless code demonstrate the effectiveness of these extensions. The SCAP approach is programming-language independent. Moreover, the SCAP approach deals surprisingly well with cases where only a limited amount of very short programs per programmer is available for training. Finally, it is also demonstrated that SCAP effectiveness persists even in the absence of comments in the source code, a condition usually met in cyber-crime cases.",

In this paper we discuss the design and security requirements for large-scale privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) systems in a fully distributed setting, where each client possesses its own records of private data. To this end we argue in favor of using some well-known cryptographic primitives, borrowed from the literature on Internet elections. More specifically, our framework is based on the classical homomorphic election model, and particularly on an extension for supporting multi-candidate elections. We also review a recent scheme [Z.

As organizations increasingly rely on IS resources, they face more advanced IS security challenges. This paper explores the relationship between the development of IS resources and security resources; are organizations willing to invest more in IS security resources as they invest more on IS resources? The authors conduct an empirical investigation in organizations located in five Mediterranean countries. The sample includes responses from 61 CEOs, information security managers and IS managers. The results reveal that IS resources positively affect the IS security resources. The human capital plays the most important role for the adoption of IS security.",

Despite their popularity-due both to their simplicity and relative ease of interpretation-the non-linearity assumption of data samples is inappropriate in practice, due to its inability to capture the apparent non-linear relationships, which characterize these samples. In this paper, we propose the SF-HME, a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts system, attempting to overcome limitations common to other machine-learning based approaches when applied to spam mail classification. By reducing the dimensionality of data through the usage of the effective Simba algorithm for feature selection, we evaluated our SF-HME system with a publicly available corpus of emails, with very high similarity between legitimate and bulk email-and thus low discriminative potential \u2026",

Aiming at safeguarding users\u2019 privacy more effectively within SNs, self-adaptive privacy preserving schemes have been developed, considered the importance of users\u2019 social and technological context and specific privacy criteria that should be satisfied. However, under the current self-adaptive privacy approaches, the examination of users\u2019 social landscape interrelated with their privacy perceptions and practices, is not thoroughly considered, especially as far as users\u2019 social attributes concern. This study, aimed at elaborating this examination in depth, in order as to identify the users\u2019 social characteristics and privacy perceptions that can affect self-adaptive privacy design, as well as to indicate self-adaptive privacy related requirements that should be satisfied for users\u2019 protection in SNs. The study was based on an interdisciplinary research instrument, adopting constructs and metrics from both sociological and privacy literature. The results of the survey lead to a pilot taxonomic analysis for self-adaptive privacy within SNs and to the proposal of specific privacy related requirements that should be considered for this domain. For further establishing of our interdisciplinary approach, a case study scenario was formulated, which underlines the importance of the identified self-adaptive privacy related requirements. In this regard, the study provides further insight for the development of the behavioral models that will enhance the optimal design of self-adaptive privacy preserving schemes in SNs, as well as \u2026",

SIP is an application layer control signaling protocol, whose main purpose is to create, modify and terminate multimedia sessions. Research has shown that SIP has a number of security issues that must be solved in order to increase its trustworthiness and supersede or coexist with PSTN. In this paper our purpose is to address such a weakness, namely the caller identity privacy issue. While some solutions to this problem do exist, we will show that they are inadequate in a number of situations. Furthermore, we will propose a novel scheme for the protection of callerpsilas identity which can also support roaming between different administrative domains. Finally, we provide some performance results, which demonstrate that the proposed solution is efficient even \u2026",

In this context, searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) has gained a lot of attention. An SSE scheme aims to protect the privacy of the outsourced data by supporting, at the same time, outsourced search computation. However, the design of an efficient dynamic SSE (DSSE) has been shown to be a challenging task. In this paper, we present two efficient DSSEs that leak a limited amount of information. Both our schemes make a limited use of ORAM algorithms to achieve forward privacy and to minimize the overhead that ORAMs introduce, at the same time. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other DSSE scheme that offers efficiently forward privacy. Our schemes are parallizable and significantly improve the search and update \u2026",

These message constructors include blind signatures, commitments and zero-knowledge proofs. Furthermore, a standard formalization of the Dolev-Yao intruder does not take into account these message constructors, nor does it consider some types of attacks (such as privacy attacks, brute-force dictionary attacks and known-plaintext attacks) that privacy-preserving as well as other types of protocols are designed to protect against. This paper aims to present an extension of Typed MSR in order to formally specify the needed message constructors, as well as the capabilities of a Dolev-Yao intruder designed to attack such protocols.",

Trusting software depends on various elements, one of which is the protection of user privacy. Protecting privacy is about complying with user's desires when it comes to handling personal information. It can also be defined as the right to determine when, how and to what extend information about them is communicated to others. The aim of this paper is to bring forward the modern practices for ensuring privacy during the design of information systems.

One is a mature work; in the sense that it has predecessors that have been extensively analyzed, while the other is a fresh proposal. Our security analysis demonstrates that both are weak, as they suffer from a similar desychronization attack.

Moreover, hierarchical and distributed frameworks are discussed, based on the type of ad hoc and sensor networks they are designed for.

Involving security experts early in the development process can circumvent this problem. This practice, however, entails high costs; moreover communication between developers and security experts is usually problematic and security expertise is difficult to be captured and exploited by developers. This paper proposes that the process of building secure applications can be facilitated through the use of security patterns. It presents a security patterns repository that can provide developers with an effective mechanism to address the issue of incorporating security requirements and mechanisms in application development. The paper also specifies a list of patterns and describes their basic elements. For describing and managing the patterns, the paper proposes a structure that is especially suitable for the case of security patterns. The method followed for developing the security patterns repository entails the employment of security ontology. Finally, the paper presents a set of exemplary cases where the repository can support the software development process. The paper\u2019s contribution is an enhanced security patterns repository that allows application developers to benefit from the accumulated knowledge and expertise in the area of security, so that they are able to develop secure applications.",

Cryptography, as shown by previous research, is the most accurate approach to acquiring knowledge while maintaining privacy. In this paper, we present an extension of a privacy-preserving data mining algorithm, thoroughly designed and developed for both horizontally and vertically partitioned databases, which contain either nominal or numeric attribute values.

This work introduces two novel botnet architectures that consist only of mobile devices and evaluates both their impact in terms of DNS amplification and TCP flooding attacks, and their cost pertaining to the maintenance of the C&C channel. The first one puts forward the idea of using a continually changing mobile HTTP proxy in front of the botherder, while the other capitalizes on DNS protocol as a covert channel for coordinating the botnet.

Using the binary tree structure, certificate chains are easily built between communicating nodes that are multi-hops away and the cumbersome problem of certificate chain discovery is avoided.

            "Abstract": "Cloud Computing technology and services despite the advantages they bring to the market have created number of issues regarding the security and trust of the individuals using them. Incidents occurring in cloud computing environments are hard to be solved since digital forensic methods used to conduct digital investigations are not suitable for cloud computing investigations since they do not consider the specific characteristics of the Cloud. However, designing services over the cloud that will support and assist an investigation process when an incident occurs is also of vital importance. This paper presents a conceptual model for supporting the development of a cloud forensics method and process, thus assisting information systems developers in building better services and investigators to be able to conduct forensics analysis in cloud environments.",

Hence, it is straightforward that DNS nameservers are constantly under the threat of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This paper presents a new, stealthy from the attacker's viewpoint, flavor of DNSSEC-powered amplification attack that takes advantage of the vast number of DNS forwarders out there. Specifically, for augmenting the amplification factor, the attacker utilizes only those forwarders that support DNSSEC-related resource records and advertize a large DNS size packet. The main benefits of the presented attack scenario as compared to that of the typical amplification attack are: (a) The revocation of the need of the aggressor \u2026",

Currently, several security incident database models have been proposed and used. The discrepancies of such databases entail that worldwide incident information is stored in different formats and places and, so, do not provide any means for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) collaboration. This paper presents an architecture based on advance database techniques, able to collect incident related information from different sources. Our framework enhances the incident management process by allowing the law enforcement units to (a) collect the required evidence from incident data that are spread through a number of different incident management systems; (b) transform, clean, and homogenize them; and, finally, (c) load them to a central \u2026",

This paper classifies and analyses possible major solutions proposed until now towazds solving the device authentication issue. We constructively argue on each solution presented examining its advantages and disadvantages. A qualitative comparative analysis for the device authentication schemes in question is also offered, probing its applicability for both infrastructure and ad-hoc deployments.

            "Abstract": "Gamification, the use of game design elements in applications that are not games, has been developed to provide attractive environments and maintain user interest in several domains. In domains such as education, marketing and health, where gamification techniques are applied, user engagement in applications has increased. In these applications the protection of users\u2019 privacy is an important aspect to consider, due to the applications obtaining a record of the personal information of their users. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify if applications where gamification is applied do respect users\u2019 privacy. For the accomplishment of this aim, two main steps have been implemented. Since the main principle of gamification is the existence of game elements, the first step was to identify the set of game elements recorded in the literature that are commonly applied in various applications. Afterwards, an examination of the relationship between these elements and privacy requirements was implemented in order to identify which elements conflict with the privacy requirements leading to potential privacy violations and which elements do not. \u0391 conceptual model according to the results of this examination was designed, which presents how elements conflict with requirements. Based on the results, there are indeed game elements which can lead to privacy violations. The results of this work provide valuable guidance to software developers, especially during the design stages of gamified applications since it helps them to consider the protection of users\u2019 privacy in parallel from the early stages of the application development onwards.

During online interaction, users disclose information about them or others, while at the same time they express their concerns about Privacy infringement that may come up due to self-disclosure practices, not restricting or reversing though their disclosure behavior. Thus the \u201cPrivacy paradox\u201d phenomenon is recorded since users cannot balance between \u2026",

One of them is whether touchstroke-based analysis (similar to keylogging) can be a reliable means of profiling the user of a mobile device. Of course, in such a setting, the coin has two sides. First, one can employ the output produced by such a system to feed machine learning classifiers and later on intrusion detection engines. Second, aggressors can install touchloggers to harvest user's private data. This malicious option has been also extensively exploited in the past by legacy keyloggers under various settings, but has been scarcely assessed for soft keyboards. Compelled by these separate but interdependent aspects, we implement the first-known native and fully operational touchlogger for ultramodern smartphones and especially for those employing the proprietary iOS platform.

In this context, a new competitive to public and carrier ENUM, peer-to-peer approach promotes itself, stating to be more reliable and secure, called DUNDi. Although considerable arguing has been generated among various ENUM forums and standardization fora on ENUM implementations, until now, several issues remain obscured and unresolved.

Equally important is the issue of applying privacy-related legislation in a coherent and coordinated way. Both these topics gain extra attention when referring to medical environments and, thus, to the protection of patients' privacy and medical data. Electronic medical transactions require the transmission of personal and medical information over insecure communication channels like the Internet. It is, therefore, a rather straightforward task to capture the electronic medical behavior of a patient, thus constructing \"patient profiles,\" or reveal sensitive information related to a patient's medical history. The consequence is clearly a potential violation of the patient's privacy.

The link between these two assumptions is the cloud service. Although cloud forensics assists in the direction of investigating and solving cloud-based cyber-crimes, in many cases the design and implementation of cloud services fall back. Software designers and engineers should focus their attention on the design and implementation of cloud services that can be investigated in a forensic sound manner. This paper presents a methodology that aims on assisting designers to design cloud forensic-enabled services. The methodology supports the design of cloud services by implementing a number of steps to make the services cloud forensic enabled.

However, the existing work on formal methods does not cover privacy-preserving protocols as much as other types of protocols. Furthermore, privacy-related properties, such as unlinkability, are not always easy or even possible to prove statically, but need to be checked dynamically during the protocol\u2019s execution. In this paper, we demonstrate how, starting from an informal description of a privacy-preserving protocol in natural language, one may use a modified and extended version of the Typed MSR language to create a formal specification of this protocol, typed in a linkability-oriented type system, and then use this specification to reach an implementation of this protocol in Jif, in such a way that privacy vulnerabilities can be detected with a mixture of static and runtime checks.",

It anonymizes both the querying and responding peers through the use of unstructured topologies, called clouds, which are added onto the structured overlays. In addition, it regulates the cloud topologies to ensure the guaranteed location of data and scalability of routing. A unique characteristic of the design is the ability of users to tradeoff between desired anonymity and performance. The paper presents a thorough performance and anonymity analysis of the system, and also analyzes few anonymity compromising attacks and countermeasures \u2026",

After an initial period of experimental application of evaluation activities, the need for optimization of processes and exploitation of recorded observation has arisen; the obvious aim is the provision of educational processes in accordance with the quality standards. Within the aforementioned framework the Balanced Scorecard technique provides a useful framework that assists in converting the organizational scope to measurable indexes and processes. This procedure however, in order to be applied to the educational domain, demands an appropriate adjustment of the model to the educational needs.

            "Abstract": "One of the most hindering factors for e-Commerce has been the fact that most of the services related to e-Commerce have not been implemented with security in mind. If security is applied as an add-on or a patch to existing e-Commerce solutions, it provides a degraded service because existing e-Commerce functional requirements cannot easily be altered a posteriori. Even if this is not the case, e-Commerce users do not usually trust such an e-Commerce service and frequently opt out of it, being afraid of possible risks they might have to take while using the service. Security for e-Commerce must be thought of as a primary functional requirement and must be designed and implemented a priori. Thus, security will not constitute a hindering factor, but an enabler. This paper first considers security requirements for e-Commerce applications, then discusses the workings of the Public Key Infrastructure, PKI, and, finally, highlights its role in developing secure, hence trustworthy, e-Commerce applications.",

In this context, the current paper revolves around a key question: Do modern mobile applications respect the privacy of the end-user? The focus is on the iPhone platform security and especially on user\u2019s data privacy. By the implementation of a DNS poisoning malware and two real attack scenarios on the popular Siri and Tethering services, we demonstrate that the privacy of the end-user is at stake.",

A critical review of the relative research reveals two major trends. First, that there is a shift in the perception of privacy protection, which is increasingly considered as a responsibility of the individual, instead of an individual right protected by a central authority, such as a state and its laws. Second, it appears that current IT research is largely based on the assumption that personal privacy is quantifiable and bargainable. This paper discusses the impact of these trends and underlines the issues and challenges that emerge. The paper stresses that, for the time being, IT research approaches privacy in ubiquitous environments without taking into account the different aspects and the basic principles of privacy. Finally the paper stresses the need for multidisciplinary research in the area, and \u2026",

Within this context, knowledge acquisition in this timely and important field has greater chances to be more fruitful when the learner is properly motivated. Also, it is anticipated to be more joyful when knowledge is acquired in the form of a digital game-based activity. The paper at hand discusses the development of a novel mobile app called CyberAware, destined to cybersecurity education and awareness. At present, the game is designed for K-6 children in order to support either or both formal or informal learning. Additionally, due to its mobile characteristics, the game can be experienced as an outdoor or classroom activity. Finally, opposite to similar studies found in the literature so far, our attention is not solely drawn to game\u2019s technological aspects but equally to the educational factor. This is achieved through the consideration and use of the ARCS motivational model already from the game\u2019s design phase.",

Due to sensitive information contained within, data can be exploited by potential aggressors. Previous research has shown the most accurate approach to acquire knowledge from data while simultaneously preserving privacy is the exploitation of cryptography. In this paper we introduce an extension of a privacy preserving data mining algorithm designed and developed for both horizontally and vertically partitioned databases. The proposed algorithm exploits the multi-candidate election schema and its capabilities to build a privacy preserving Tree Augmented Naive Bayesian classifier. Security analysis and experimental results ensure the preservation of private data throughout mining processes.",

This has resulted in the emergence of new e-participation paradigms, such as crowdsourcing approaches, aiming to drive more constructive interactions between governments and citizens or experts, in order to exploit their knowledge, opinions, and ideas when tackling complex societal problems. However, the continuous exposure of the average users, without or with limited awareness of the dangers of the disclosure of sensitive data, remains a threat to the preservation of their information privacy.

In this paper we argue about the necessity for adjustable security mechanisms towards the security management of multi-domain environments; we describe an approach that allows determination of preferences when defining access control permissions over the shared objects. We handle such preferences by encoding access control constraints using fuzzy relations and we describe a prototype security architecture that implements the basic principles of our approach.",

If the understanding of the security requirements is not the same for all involved parties and the security mechanisms that will be implemented do not comply with some globally accepted rules and practices, then the system that will be designed will not necessarily achieve the desired security level and it will be very difficult to securely interoperate with other systems.

Several researches have shown that users disclose personal information within SNSs, while expressing privacy concerns. Users' inability to protect their privacy within SNSs, despite their recorded privacy concerns, constitutes the core of 'Privacy Paradox' and leads to privacy breaches or risks for themselves and other users. To reverse or at least minimise users' disclosure behaviour so as to protect themselves, researches underline the need for privacy awareness increase, focusing on the crucial role of education towards this. This research aims to explore the effects of a long-term university-based educational intervention for enhancing students' digital knowledge and skills to protect their privacy in SNSs efficiently.

As Internet telephony becomes more and more popular, attackers will attempt to exhaustively \"test\" implementations' robustness, transmitting various types of malformed messages to them. Since it is almost infeasible to avoid or predict every potential error caused during the developing process of these subsystems, it is necessary to specify an appropriate and robust, from the security point of view, framework that will facilitate the successful detection and handling of any kind of malformed messages aiming to destruct the provided \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper examines the importance of trust factors in the development and adoption of internet based cultural information systems. The proposed trust model identifies the relationship between user communication goals and trust parameters from both technical and social perspectives. To this end, it combines uses and gratifications theory as well as the notion of organisational reputation in order to identify the system\u2019s expected behaviour, ie, what things the system needs to do in order to be trusted by the users, together with a trust modelling methodology in order to explicitly model and analyse trust assumptions. The approach is explained through an example demonstrating how reasoning about trust relationships affects the development of cultural internet-based systems.",

Although admittedly enhanced in terms of security when compared to 2G systems, UMTS still has weaknesses that can lead to security incidents. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerabilities of the UMTS security architecture that can be exploited by a malicious individual to mount Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Our focus is on signaling-oriented attacks above the physical layer. We describe and analyze several novel attacks that can be triggered against both core UMTS architecture as well as hybrid UMTS/WLAN realms. An additional contribution of this paper is the presentation of an extensive survey of similar attacks in UMTS and related protocol infrastructures such as IP \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Grid is a promising new kind of computer interconnection that aims at coordinated resource sharing and problem solving. An entity that enters the Grid still remains bound to its native network and continues to abide by the corresponding security policy, while at the same time it is free to pursue its own security objectives since the Grid does not have any kind of centralized control mechanisms. As a result security management in the Grid faces three challenging new requirements: first, local security policies have to be matched to integrated Grid security policies; second, security policies are not imposed as in a top down approach, but are more of an arrangement between entities; finally, security policies are more dynamic than ever, since new entities join and leave the Grid in real time.We believe that all three abovementioned requirements can be addressed if Grid entities are provided with appropriate models, mechanisms and tools for acquiring, processing and sharing security policy related knowledge. In this perspective, in this paper we present an ontology-based framework for enhancing security management in the Grid through security policy conceptual representation. We introduce the notion of Security Policy Ontology (SPO) and use it in order to demonstrate the potential and capabilities of the proposed framework: two elementary security policies are used as input; their semantically incompatible representations are then \u201ctranslated\u201d to compatible OWL descriptions that can be used for further manipulation (eg security policy negotiation) in a real time perspective.",

In previous work we presented a framework for the selection of appropriate cloud provider based on security and privacy requirements criteria. However, the adoption of cloud includes release of control over valuable assets, which constitutes trust in the cloud provider of paramount importance. In this paper we extend the framework by incorporating trust and control concepts in its language and adding a new activity to properly identify and reason about trust assumptions during the selection of appropriate cloud provider. Also, the CASE tool was extended to support the new activity. A case study is used to illustrate the usefulness of our approach.",

SSDL provides the basis for a range of protocol description frameworks. At one end of the spectrum, such frameworks can be simple, SOAP-centric replacements for the Web Services Description Language. At the other end, they're a more expressive contract-definition language enabling formal verification of asynchronous application protocol properties. This is possible because SSDL focuses on the \"message\" abstraction as the building block for service-oriented applications.",

There are different deployment scenarios for clouds that heavily differ in the costs for deployment and maintenance, but also in the number of stakeholders involved in the cloud and the control over the data in the cloud. These additional stakeholders can introduce new privacy threats into a system. Hence, there is a trade-off between the reduction of costs and addressing privacy concerns introduced by clouds. Our contribution is a structured method that assists decision makers in selecting an appropriate cloud deployment scenario. Our method is based on the privacy requirements of the system-to-be. These are analyzed on basis of the functional requirements using the problem-based privacy threat analysis (ProPAn). The concept of clouds is integrated into the requirements \u2026",

The trust assigned to each data requestor is used to determine if the data or only a sample of it will be disclosed, or if the request will be rejected. The scheme allows the use of various mechanisms, including negative surveys, for publishing samples of data to partially trusted requestors. The proposed scheme has been \u2026",

Previous research has shown a positive relationship between Facebook usage intensity and users' perceptions of social capital. However, only few researches to date have tested these correlations empirically, showing how users' self-disclosure practices and digital privacy concerns interact with their anticipated benefits of social capital. To address this issue, an online survey was conducted, administrated to the staff of the University of the Aegean in Greece. The findings indicate that Facebook intensity use, self-disclosure and social capital are positively associated; privacy concerns affect users' disclosure though social capital benefits effect is greater.",

However, in order for these methodologies to be used and applied successfully from system engineers, it is important to be developed following a number of existing usability criteria for increasing designers' acceptance and performance. In this paper, we, initially, identify the set of usability criteria presented in the respective literature and examine how the existing privacy requirement engineering methodologies conform with these usability criteria. The results show that most methodologies conform with a number of criteria but still there are opportunities for further improvements.",

For example, in the case of the Technological Educational Institute of Athens, in the academic year 2012-2013, the percentage of graduates with a length of studies of more than 6 years was 53%. This \"problem\" becomes harder if we consider that according to the new legislation, the Greek Higher Education Institutes (HEI) must cut off access to the students who \"linger\" too long. This means that many of these graduates wouldn't be able to complete their studies. While many institutes have systems to quantify and report the length of studies of all graduates, far less attention is typically paid to each student's reason(s) for delayed graduation. In this paper, we focus on examining the question of why students delay in the completion of their studies using several data mining techniques. Through the \u2026",

This paper focuses on the steganalysis technique which aims to get the forensic of secrecy existing in multimedia carriers. A key concern for designing a blind steganalysis algorithm is the selection of statistic features. The Probability Density Function (PDF) moment and Characteristic Function (CF) moment are two typical kinds of statistic features commonly used in blind steganalysis. And generally, the features are computed from the subbands of transform domains, such as the wavelet coefficient subbands, the prediction subbands of wavelet coefficients, the prediction error subbands of wavelet coefficients, the wavelet coefficient subbands of image noise, and the log prediction error subbands of wavelet coefficients. To decide which feature is more sensitive to message embedding and useful for steganalysis is important and urgent. Till now, few \u2026",

This growth however has exposed mobile devices to an increasing number of security threats. Despite the variety of peripheral protection mechanisms described in the literature, authentication and access control cannot provide integral protection against intrusions. Thus, a need for more intelligent and sophisticated security controls such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is necessary. Whilst much work has been devoted to mobile device IDSs, research on anomaly\u2010based or behaviour\u2010based IDS for such devices has been limited leaving several problems unsolved. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we focus on anomaly\u2010based IDS for modern mobile devices.

In this paper we present a novel, simple and practical scheme that enable administrators to distinguish between genuine and falsified DNS replies. The proposed scheme, acts proactively by monitoring in real time DNS traffic and alerting security supervisors when necessary. It also acts reactively in co-operation with the firewalls by automatically updating rules to ban bogus packets.

Designing and modeling an Information System for the Cloud is a major and hard task that most of the traditional software engineering approaches fail to fulfill. In parallel, many respective organisations and respective researchers have highlighted a number of security and privacy challenges that are not present in traditional environments and need special attention when implementing or migrating information systems into a cloud environment.

            "Abstract": "Organizational culture plays a significant role in corporations. The introduction of new technologies creates significant changes and requires the contribution of an efficient organizational culture to produce positive results. The use of the various typologies of organizational culture can assist managers to identify the type of culture that is present in the organization and can provide useful guidelines on how to adapt to or change the existing culture, in order to make it more effective, particularly when introducing new technologies. Goffee and Jones (1996, 2003), based on the concepts of sociability and solidarity, proposed four types of culture:(a) networked,(b) mercenary,(c) communal, and (d) fragmented. This paper examines the development of these concepts and types of culture in a state-owned organization in Greece, following the organization\u2019s decision to introduce significant new technologies. This organization had a unique blend of characteristics. Quantitative research was conducted using a questionnaire compiled specifically for this case. Factor analysis was used for statistical analysis of the data. While the introduction of new technologies was successfully completed, the findings of this study highlight certain features of sociability and solidarity and the types of culture that contain them, which have contributed to the successful introduction and adoption of new technologies.",

            "Abstract": "Formulating governmental policies for the wider public cannot be an internal process. Embedding openness and participation principles in the policy formulation process can lead to initiatives that re-spond to the real needs and address the real challenges in a policy domain. This paper presents an overview of participation approaches in policy formulation and analyses the structured co-creation process applied by the Greek government to develop the National Action Plan on Open Government. The analysis of the bottom-up participatory approach reveals new insights into the new role of government \u2018as a platform\u2019towards the development and evolution of Government 3.0. The new communication channels, innovative collaboration procedures and digital tools that enabled the active participation of the relevant actors in the policy formulation process suggest a co-creation approach which can be of wide applicability to other policy domains. The paper also addresses the important but under-estimated challenge of actively involving the relevant actors in the implementation of a co-created public policy. The analysis suggests an approach according to which civil society organizations are effectively engaged in the full life cycle of a public policy and take an active role within its implementation.",

While this topic has been addressed in the literature to a great extent, only a handful of works examine the potential of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect DoS and even fewer do so in realtime. Spurred by this fact, the work at hand assesses the potential of 5 different ML-driven methods in nipping SIP-powered DDoS attacks in the bud. Our experiments involving 17 realistically simulated (D)DoS scenarios of varied attack volume in terms of calls/sec and user population, suggest that some of the classifiers show promising detection accuracy even in low-rate \u2026",

In this paper several statistical and model based features are presented. Specifically, an improvement of a statistical feature, the edge hinge distribution, is attempted. Furthermore, the combination of this feature with a model-based feature is explored, that is based on a codebook of graphemes. For the evaluation, the Fire maker DB was used, which consists of 250 writers, including 4 pages per writer. The best result for the statistical suggested approach, the skeleton hinge distribution, achieved accuracy of 90.8%, while the combination of this method with the codebook of graphemes reached 96%.",

            "Abstract": "Adaptive privacy and its preservation within Cloud Computing Environments is an emerging issue in contemporary societies. However, the inability of the existing privacy systems in Cloud to provide an adequate adaptive privacy framework associated with users' social and technological boundaries has been highlighted in previous literature. In order to address that issue, this chapter aims at highlighting the Adaptive Privacy Aware Cloud-based Systems (APACS) as an emerging interdisciplinary research area, where both social and technical aspects of privacy should be examined thoroughly. Through the correlative identification and examination of these social and technical factors, an integrated conceptual model is proposed, indicating that the key issue for the successful design of APACS is to encapsulate the emerging privacy requirements of both aspects, leading towards an integrated socio-technical approach.",

            "Abstract": "Until now the IEEE 802.16 technologies, also known as WiMAX, may not have had the adoption rate of 802.11, but will likely be the predominant technology for Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) deployments for the next decade. This is because WiMAX can support all-IP core network architecture, low latency, advanced Quality of Service (QoS) and sophisticated security [1]. The IEEE 802.16 working group on broadband wireless access standards, a unit of the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards committee (http://www/wirelessman. org/), is preparing and revising formal specifications for the global deployment of broadband Wireless MANs. The 802.16 security model was designed initially to support authentication, confidentiality and integrity services. This is in contrast to the key management model used in the original 802.11 specification. The initial 802.16-2001 version of the standards [2] employs X. 509 certificates for the authentication of devices on the network. Every subscriber device has its own certificate that identifies it uniquely to the 802.16 infrastructure. Of course, this allows providers to control which devices are authorized to use their networks. On the other hand, as in GSM networks, authentication is not mutual. Specifically, while the network can authenticate a subscriber device, the subscriber device has no way to authenticate the infrastructure. This leads to several attacks including man-in-the-middle, spoofing or replay attacks against the subscriber device. For link encryption, 802.16 uses",

Our analysis unveils the internal mechanics of iSAM and discusses the way all iSAM components contribute towards achieving its goals.

These are for example the electronic commerce, email communication, access to computers and networks, or digital identities for use in e-Government or the health care sector. The various PKI based applications have different requirements. These depend on the security level, the number of participants, the software or hardware devices, the complexity of the installation, and many other parameters. This work focuses on the certificate management in a PKI and proposes various solutions to meet these requirements in a flexible way. In order to deal with the problems related to certificate management we design the certificate management authority (CMA). This authority is specified as a new trust center component involved in organising the workflow and the tasks that remain after the creation of a PKI product, like a certificate or a revocation list. Its design and implementation is discussed. The certificate management plugins, that the CMA is based on, can be (re)used to provide interoperable PKI solutions. We also give a security analysis of the CMA. The new authority requires to rethink the communication possibilities within a trust center. A new protocol for communication inside a trust center is designed and implemented. It addresses the problems of communication of arbitrary trust center components. It enables human readability of the messages, security mechanisms like digital signatures and encryption, it supports dual control, and expresses typical data in a trust center. One basic task of the CMA is the distribution and dissemination of PKI information. Typical \u2026",

Towards this goal, we have grouped the WSNs application environments into two major categories (i.e., infrastructure-based and infrastructureless) and have examined: a) which of the cluster-based Group Key Agreement (GKA) protocols that appear in the literature are applicable to each category, and b) to which degree these protocols will impact the systems' performance and energy consumption. In order to answer these questions we have calculated the complexity of each protocol and the energy cost it will add to the system. The evaluation of all discussed protocols is presented in a generalized way and can therefore serve as a reference point for future evaluations and for the design of new, improved GKA protocols.",

The purpose of this paper is to present and analyze these privacy issues and propose two privacy enhanced context transfer schemes that alleviate these problems. In the first scheme the Mobile Node (MN) is responsible for the transmission of the context to the new domain. In the second scheme the Home Domain (HD) of the user forwards the context acting as a proxy between the old and the new domain. While the second scheme is expected to be more useful towards realizing seamless handovers, the first one poses less signaling load to the HD. In \u2026",

Centralised databases containing the relevant medical history of thousands of patients with an individual mental disease would be of great value for researchers, enabling techniques such as data mining to be applied. The major challenge in achieving this is anonymising the data to satisfy legal and ethical requirements without removing important clinical information. In this paper we propose a model that can be used to create a central repository of anonymised data for patients with bipolar disease. Knowledge obtained from the database is fed into an expert system which can guide clinicians in patient management.

This was the general understanding some decades ago but in recent years, with the emergence of the Internet of Services, more complex issues have arisen and the identity of users has become crucial. In early software systems, the identity of users was managed locally by the system administrator and was only valid for that particular application. In the Internet of Services, anyone can become a user of our applications and it is the users\u2019 responsibility to\" manage\" their identities in an appropriate manner.There are some concepts related with identity that can help us understand the scope of identity management and its key challenges.

While SIP is popular and a lot of research has been conducted, it still has some security issues, one of which is related to privacy and more particularly the protection of user identities (IDs). In the general case everybody can reveal the communicating parties IDs by simply eavesdropping on the exchanged SIP messages.

Such methods aim to provide end-entity authentication, communications integrity and privacy. When public key certificates schemes are deployed in MANETs, they must be accompanied by efficient mechanisms for certificate revocation and validation. In this paper we address this issue, and a distributed, on-demand, OCSP-based scheme is adapted to be applicable over MANETs. This scheme, called ADOPT, uses caches of OCSP responses that are distributed and stored on intermediate nodes. ADOPT takes into account the status of intermediate nodes, such as network topology, energy thresholds, and connectivity, to materialize the caching of OCSP responses. This paper uses different MANET con-figurations to evaluate the efficiency of ADOPT. The simulation results show that ADOPT manages to rapidly identify and locate the status of a certificate without introducing significant communication or storage costs.",

Due to the presence of conflicting requirements and specifications, the policy negotiation and policy merging processes call for the use of efficient techniques to resolve ambiguities. Constraints and constraint programming on the other hand, are useful means for representing a wide range of access control states and access control problems. In this paper we utilize constraints to represent access control policies in a multi-domain environment. In contrast to monolithic (crisp) constraint satisfaction techniques, we extend the applicability of constraints for access control, by examining soft constraints and partial constraint satisfaction. We also introduce a security framework based on fuzzy constraints that allows the determination of preferences for the participating domains.",

The number of potential users enrolling and using cloud services increases exponentially on a daily bases. The great demand from online users for cloud services along with the reduced operational costs that the latter offers has motivated many organisations and companies to consider migrating organizational services, data and applications on the Cloud. However, despite the various positive characteristics of all cloud service models like reduced costs, better availability insurance, on demand data storage and computation power, cloud migration may hinder various security and privacy issues that need to be considered before an organization or company decides to move on to the Cloud. This paper aims to reveal the major security and privacy concepts for all three cloud service models \u2026",

We propose an anonymization method for weighted graphs, i.e., for social networks where the strengths of links are important. This is in contrast with many previous studies which only consider unweighted graphs. Weights can be essential for social network analysis, but they pose new challenges to privacy preserving network analysis. In this paper, we mainly consider prevention of identity disclosure, but we also touch on edge and edge weight disclosure in weighted graphs. We propose a method that provides k-anonymity of nodes against attacks where the adversary has information about the structure of the network, including its edge weights. The method is efficient, and it has been evaluated in terms of privacy and utility on real word datasets.",

Related literature includes a number of privacy enhancing technologies for ensuring system privacy. However, each of the above technologies focuses on specific issues without providing an integrated solution for meeting all four basic privacy requirements (i.e., anonymity, pseudonymity, unlinkability, and unobservability). Current research in the area of security requirements engineering advocates that privacy requirements should be considered earlier in the system development process, during the design rather than the implementation level. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, called PriS, which aims to incorporate privacy requirements into the system design process adopting a goal-oriented approach. Each privacy requirement is treated as a separate \"goal\" to be met during the system design \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Over the last decade, cloud computing presents a rapid growth as an increasing number of individuals, private and public organizations tend to adopt cloud technologies for storing their data or providing their services. However, due to the fact that migration into cloud in most cases implies that data subjects lose control of their data, many people and several scientists raise issues about data security and privacy in a cloud infrastructure. However, most of research efforts presented so far deal with either security or privacy protection in the cloud. Raising the trustworthiness of a cloud service provided requires both satisfaction of the security on the cloud assets as well as privacy protection of the end users. This paper presents a conceptual meta-model taking into account the security and privacy concepts that need to be considered when designing cloud services or migrating services to the cloud. This paper is the first step towards the development of a framework that will holistically deal with security and privacy under a unified language thus assisting software engineers on modelling secure and privacy-aware services into the cloud.",

E-mail users find themselves targeted by massive quantities of unsolicited bulk e-mail, which often contains offensive language or has fraudulent intentions. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) on the other hand, have to face a considerable system overloading as the incoming mail consumes network and storage resources. Among the plethora of solutions, the most prominent in terms of cost efficiency and complexity are the text filtering approaches. Most of the approaches model the problem using linear statistical models. Despite their popularity\u2013due both to their simplicity and relative ease of interpretation\u2013the non-linearity assumption of data samples is inappropriate in practice. This is mainly due to the inability of other approaches to capture the apparent non-linear relationships, which characterize these samples. In this paper, we propose a margin \u2026",

It is envisaged that its impact will increase as it comprises a reliable and scalable solution to support authentication and secure service acquisition in the Next Generation Networks (NGN) era. This means however that security and privacy issues related to the protocol itself must be carefully considered. This paper proposes a novel two-level privacy framework, namely PrivaKERB, to address user privacy in Kerberos. Our solution offers two privacy levels to cope with user anonymity and service access untraceability. We detail how these modes operate in preserving user privacy in both single-realm and cross-realm scenarios. By using the extensibility mechanisms already available in Kerberos, PrivaKERB does not change the semantics of messages and enables future implementations to maintain \u2026",

However, transferring trust from the physical world to the electronic one is a process that requires a trust infrastructure. The current infrastructure, based on trusted third parties can be enhanced.

To address that, this paper proposes the development of an interdisciplinary measurement scale, embodying validated metrics from both privacy and sociological literature. The scale provides the thoroughly identification of users\u2019 social landscape interrelated with their privacy behaviours and its utilization is expected to lay the ground for the developers to meet efficiently both users\u2019 social requirements and systems\u2019 technical ones, before performing adaptive privacy mechanisms in cloud.",

We elaborate on 802.11 specific attacks and experimentally explore how these outbreaks can be effectively mitigated or thwarted by a properly designed WIDS. Among specially crafted software for both WIDS's modules as well as for attack generators, our test-bed embraces the majority of well known open source attack tools.

            "Abstract": "While mobile hosts are evolving into full-IP enabled devices, there is a greater demand to provide a more flexible, reconfigurable, and scalable security mechanism in mobile communication systems beyond 3G (B3G). Work has already begun on such an \"all-IP\" end-to-end solution, commonly referred to as 4G systems. Fully fledged integration between heterogeneous networks, such as 2.5G, UMTS, WLAN, Bluetooth, and the Internet, demands fully compatible, time-tested, and reliable mechanisms to depend on. SSL protocol has proved its effectiveness in the wired Internet and it will probably be the most promising candidate for future wireless environments. In this paper, we discuss existing problems related to authentication and key agreement (AKA) procedures, such as compromised authentication vectors attacks, as they appear in current 2/2.5G/3G mobile communication systems, and propose how SSL \u2026",

The RBF model is used for regression analysis tasks. The novel aspect of the proposed protocol lies to the fact that it assumes a malicious user model and does not use homomorphic cryptographic methods, which are inherently only suited for a semi-trusted user environment. The performance analysis shows that the communication overhead is low enough to warranty its use while the computational complexity is identical in most cases with the centralized computation scenario (e.g. a trusted third party). The accuracy of the output model is only marginally subpar to a centralized computation on the union of all datasets.",

The history of obfuscation in modern computing can be traced to two events that took place in 1976. The first was the publication of Diffie and Hellman\u2019s seminal paper on public-key cryptography [DH76]. This paper is famous, of course, for introducing the first (or, at any rate, first publicly known) public-key cryptosystem. It also appears to be the first paper to describe software obfuscation. Diffie and Hellman suggested that making the encryption program incomprehensible might be a good way of converting a symmetric cryptosystem into a public-key one. Such a program would be an example of \u201cwhite-box\u201d cryptography because it would remain secure\u2014in the sense that it would be hard for the adversary to invert the encryption function or to extract the symmetric key from it\u2014even if the program \u2026",

In order to secure RFID tags in a cost-efficient manner, the last few years several lightweight cryptography-based tag management protocols have been proposed. One of the most promising proposals is the  protocol, a lightweight authentication protocol that is supported by an elegant security proof against all passive and a subclass of active attackers based on the hardness of the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem. However, the  was shown to be weak against active man-in-the-middle (MIM) attacks and for that several variants have been proposed.

STM (Security and Trust Management) is a working group of ERCIM (European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics), and was established in 2005 to provide a platform for researchers in security and trust management to present and discuss their work and to foster cooperation. One of the means to achieve these goals is the organisation of a yearly workshop. The first workshop, STM 2005, was held in Milan (Italy).In response to the call for papers 27 papers from 15 different countries were submitted to the workshop. These papers were evaluated on the basis of their significance, novelty, and technical quality. Each paper was reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The program committee meeting was held electronically, holding intensive discussion over a period of two weeks. Of the papers submitted, 12 were selected for presentation at the conference. The program also includes invited talks by Javier Lopez on Security and Trust Requirements in Wireless Sensor Networks and by Alexander Pretschner on Distributed Usage Control.",

Solutions trying to address all aspects of security were proposed by most existing Grid projects and collaborations; however the results were not always satisfactory. In this paper we review some of the most widely accepted security solutions and we collect the most efficient ones. We emphasize on those addressing authentication and authorization issues, since these have been proved to be the most important aspects of security in the particular Grid computing environment and eventually the most vulnerable to security breaches.

            "Abstract": "The (n-1) attack is the most powerful attack against mix which is the basic building block of many modern anonymous systems. This paper aims to present a strategy that can be implemented in mix networks to detect and counter the active attacks, especially the (n-1) attack and its variants. Based on the analysis of the preconditions of a successful (n-1) attack and the limitations of previous countermeasures, this paper presents Regroup-And-Go mix (RG mix) for detecting and foiling the (n-1) attack. RG mix can help foil and detect the (n-1) attacks from both internal and external attackers because the grouping information for the other mixes is unavailable for them. They can only guess which messages can constitute a group and randomly select some messages to have a try. Analysis and experiments show that the probability of successful attack is low.",

Privacy incidents are, in a sense, unique as to the loss they can incur, as opposed to other security incidents whose impact may be objectively valued. For example, if due to some security incident the Internet site of a company is unavailable for an hour, then it is quite possible to estimate the financial value of this incident in an objective manner by estimating the possible number of clients and their potential buys within this period. The situation is more difficult when it comes to privacy. For instance, when somebody\u2019s telephone number is disclosed, then it is rather subjective whether one should care or not. When a bank uses the credit history of a client without her consent in order to issue a presigned credit card, then it is subjective whether the client will feel upset about it and press charges for breach of the Personal Data Act or not.

These theories were applied to Olympic, a former national airline. Data were collected using a questionnaire (N = 102), and multiple regression analysis was then used to statistically analyze the data.

The typical reaction of IT officials is to protect their systems through a series of technical security measures. However, in the absence of a scientifically sound methodology for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the security measures employed, the problem is that they are unable to quantify the security level of their system and thus to determine the appropriate amount that they should invest for its protection. Another option that organisations can explore is to insure their information systems against potential security incidents, aiming to balance the consequences that they will experience, in terms of financial losses, through the compensation that they will get from the insurance company.

            "Abstract": "This study critically examines the transition process followed by a state-owned airline in a major IT migration project (introduction of novel electronic services). The change management process proposed by Kotter (1995) is examined in relation to the different phases identified, based on an interview based qualitative research. Focusing on the project team leaders a set of results is identified/determined, which provides significant insight into the key factors, deficiencies and outcomes of the project, with reference to the characteristics of a state-owned company. Further elaboration of the proposed methodology is deemed to be applicable in the identification of the weak and strong points of similar change projects.",

            "Abstract": "Source code authorship analysis is the particular field that attempts to identify the author of a computer program by treating each program as a linguistically analyzable entity. This is usually based on other undisputed program samples from the same author. There are several cases where the application of such a method could be of a major benefit, such as tracing the source of code left in the system after a cyber attack, authorship disputes, proof of authorship in court, etc. In this paper, we present our approach which is based on byte-level n-gram profiles and is an extension of a method that has been successfully applied to natural language text authorship attribution. We propose a simplified profile and a new similarity measure which is less complicated than the algorithm followed in text authorship attribution and it seems more suitable for source code identification since is better able to deal with very small training sets. Experiments were performed on two different data sets, one with programs written in C++ and the second with programs written in Java. Unlike the traditional language-dependent metrics used by previous studies, our approach can be applied to any programming language with no additional cost. The presented accuracy rates are much better than the best reported results for the same data sets.",

This multidomain environment poses serious threats to the end user who has contract with, and trusts only a limited number of operators and service providers. One such threat is end users\u2019 privacy on which we will focus in this paper. Probably the most promising protocol for multimedia session management is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which is an application layer protocol and thus can operate on top of different lower layer technologies.

Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) should not only hide the identity of legitimate users but also provide means by which evidence of malicious activity can be gathered and revealed when necessary. This paper proposes a network forensics protocol called RPINA (respect private information, not abuser) which may operate over PETs, without violating the privacy of innocent users, but only the privacy of abusers. This approach introduces a new dimension in the relation between these two opposite-goal technologies, which enhances their viability in the global network environment",

Such data sets require special consideration since they may convey personal data, sensitive personal data, employee data, credit card data etc. Recent surveys have shown that people feel that their privacy is at risk from identity theft and erosion of individual rights. The result is that privacy violation is becoming an increasingly critical issue in modern societies. To this end, PriS, a new security requirements engineering methodology, has been introduced aiming to incorporate privacy requirements early in the system development process. In this paper, we extend the PriS conceptual framework by introducing privacy process patterns as a way for describing the effect of privacy requirements on business processes. In addition \u2026",

The framework, beyond previous    literature, supports the combination of privacy by design principles with    the newly introduced GDPR requirements in order to create a strong    elicitation process for deriving the set of the technical security and    privacy requirements that should be addressed.

The safe storage and efficient retrieval of d-dimensional data on an untrusted server has therefore crucial importance. The paper proposes a new encryption model which offers spatial order-preservation for d-dimensional data (SOPE model). The paper studies the operations for the construction of the encrypted database and suggests algorithms that exploit unique properties that this new model offers for the efficient execution of a whole range of well-known queries over the encrypted d-dimensional data. The new model utilizes well-known database indices, such as the B+-tree and the R-tree, as backbone structures in their traditional form, as it suggests no modifications to them for loading the data and for the efficient execution of the supporting query algorithms. An extensive experimental study that is also presented in the paper indicates the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed encryption model for real-life d-dimensional data applications.",

Knowledge Management (KM) systems have been effectively deployed for more than two decades, incorporating Information Retrieval techniques as well as tacit knowledge utilization. However, traditional KM systems have limited functionality, mainly because of their adaptation to the single-organizational model. When applied to distributed, intra-organizational coalition framework, consisting of cooperating organizations, they can significantly leverage the overall organization\u2019s performance. In this paper we present the extensions to the existing security models that must be realized prior to the employment of a distributed knowledge-exploiting architecture; moreover, heterogeneity, interoperability and scalability related issues are considered in order to handle the diverse set of platforms found in different Information Systems.

            "Abstract": "Day by day the provision of information technology goods and services becomes noticeably expensive. This is mainly due to the high labor cost for the service providers, resulting from the need to cover a vast variety of application domains and at the same time to improve or/and enhance the services offered in accordance to the requirements set by the competition. A business model that could ease the problem is the development or/and provision of the service by an external contractor on behalf of the service provider; known as Information Technology Outsourcing. However, outsourcing a service may have the side effect of transferring personal or/and sensitive data from the outsourcing company to the external contractor. Therefore the outsourcing company faces the risk of a contractor who does not adequately protect the data, resulting to their non-deliberate disclosure or modification, or of a contractor \u2026",

The literature provides examples of methods that focus on security and privacy individually but fail to provide evidence of information systems development methods that consider security and privacy in a unified framework. Security and privacy are very much related, in particular certain security properties and mechanisms support the achievement of privacy goals. Without a development framework to support developers to explicitly model that relationship, conflicts and vulnerabilities can be introduced to a system design that might endanger its security. In this paper, we present our work in developing a framework that supports the unified analysis of privacy and security. In particular, we present a meta \u2026",

Wireless local area networks, for instance, have been used in various environments, such as business, home, conference centers, airports and many more, allowing users to move from place to place, avoiding cabling restrictions and without being disconnected from the network.Ad hoc networks are collections of wireless computers communicating among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths, without the help of any infrastructure such as base stations or access points; these networks allow data synchronization with network systems and application sharing between devices. Mobile ad hoc networks are autonomous collection of mobile entities that communicate over relatively bandwidth constrained wireless links, establishing survivable, efficient, dynamic communication for emergency operations. Wireless ad hoc sensor networks consist of a number of sensors spread across a geographical area, offering certain capabilities and enhancements in operational efficiency in civilian applications, as well as assisting in international effort to increase alertness to potential threats.",

            "Abstract": "Mobile devices have evolved and experienced an immense popularity over the last few years. Nevertheless, this growth has exposed mobile devices to an increasing number of security threats. It is thus for sure that despite the variety of peripheral protection mechanisms described in the literature, and the (post) authentication and access control techniques imposed by the Operating Systems (OS) of such devices, integral protection against advanced intrusions cannot be adequately enforced. More specifically, sophisticated, powerful OSs, such as Android and iOS, and the services they can support bring new opportunities to attackers toward compromising the device and the data stored on it. This is along with the rise of mobile malware which is anticipated to comprise a serious threat in the near future. Therefore, the research community is constantly seeking for solutions to cope with these newly-introduced perils. Thus, a need for more intelligent and sophisticated security controls such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) is deemed necessary. However, whilst much work has been devoted to mobile device IDSs in general, research on anomaly-based or behavior-based IDS has been limited leaving several problems unsolved.Motivated by this fact, this doctoral thesis focuses on the design and development of advanced anomaly IDPS for modern mobile devices. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore, propose and evaluate modern advanced behavioral-based mechanisms and characteristics which can be used towards enchancing the security of mobile devices.",

            "Abstract": "In the global information society, avoiding privacy violation is becoming an increasingly critical issue. Related literature includes a number of Privacy Enhancing Technologies, such as the Anonymizer, Crowds, Onion Routing, Tor, GAP, Hordes, Dc-Nets and Mix-Nets, for ensuring system privacy. However, each of the above technologies focuses on specific issues without providing an integrated solution for meeting all four basic privacy requirements (ie, anonymity, pseudonymity, unlinkability, and unobservability). Current research in the area of security requirements engineering advocates that privacy requirements should be considered earlier in the system development process, during the design rather than the implementation level. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, called PriS, which aims to incorporate privacy requirements into the system design process adopting a goal-oriented approach. Each privacy requirement is treated as a separate \u201cgoal\u201d to be met during the system design process; goals are collaboratively realised by processes, which in turn are supported by IT systems. In this way, tracing between high-level organisational objectives and detailed support mechanisms is achieved. We argue that PriS provides a solution that overcomes some of the limitations of existing approaches.",

Nevertheless, their inherently insecure design make them prone to a plethora of attacks. This work concentrates on the detection of resource consumption attacks targeting SIP ecosystems. While this topic has been addressed in the literature to a great extent, only a handful of works examine the potential of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect DoS and even fewer do so in realtime. Spurred by this fact, the work at hand assesses the potential of 5 different ML-driven methods in nipping SIP-powered DDoS attacks in the bud. Our experiments involving 17 realistically simulated (D) DoS scenarios of varied attack volume in terms of calls/sec and user population, suggest that some of the classifiers show promising detection accuracy even in lowrate DDoS incidents. We also show that the performance of ML-based detection in terms of classification time overhead does not exceed 3.5 ms in average with a mean standard deviation of 7.7 ms.",

            "Abstract": "Security requirements, such as authentication, confidentiality, authorization, availability, integrity and privacy, are becoming extremely common in software development processes. However, in practical terms, it has been proved that only rarely the developed software fulfils the related security requirements. The reason for this is twofold. On one hand software developers are not security experts and thus they are not competent in selecting and applying the appropriate security countermeasures. On the other hand, many security requirements are intrinsically difficult to deal with. This paper aims to address both of the aforementioned issues and to introduce potential solutions. It starts by analysing the major security requirements, and goes on to explore how they can be mapped into concrete security solutions or/and mechanisms. Then, it examines how the fulfilment of security requirements influences the choice of development methodologies and paradigms (with the emphasis being on the design phase), so that the requirements are effectively satisfied. The discussion covers object-oriented and aspect-oriented programming, the Rational Unified Process, UML and UMLsec, as well as security patterns, with regard to the ways they can support the use of security solutions or/and mechanisms.",

The analysis draws from the BAN and related logics [2, 10] that are targeted to aid reasoning about authentication protocols, as well as from formal methods on PKIs [5, 6]. The family of protocols directly covered are built using selective disclosure certificates, blind signatures and oneway has functions as cryptographic primitives. The logic is able to proe that if the protocol's credentials are properly constructed and signed by trusted issuers, they should convince a verifier; furthermore, it provides a framework on which mechanized attacks against privacy may be attempted by an automatic theorem prover. The runner example is a protocol by Holt and Seamons, specified in [4].",

Such networks will naturally overlap each other and mobile users will need to frequently handoff among them for a number of reasons, including the quest for higher speeds and/or lower cost. Handoffs between such hybrid networks should be fast enough to support demanding applications, like multimedia content delivery, but also secure enough since different network providers are involved. This gets even more complicated considering that network providers may not simultaneously be multimedia service providers as it is the case today. In order to support security operations in a large scale the employment of an AAA protocol is mandated; however, this adds more delay to the handoff process. This article analyses and compares the prominent methods proposed so far that optimize the secure handoff process in terms of delay and are suitable for uninterruptible secure multimedia service delivery.",

            "Abstract": "In next generation networks one of the most challenging issues is the definition of seamless and secure handoffs in order to assure service continuity. In general, researchers agree on the use of EAP as an authentication framework independent of the underlying technology. To date, efforts have focused on optimizing the authentication process itself, leaving out other relevant but sometimes important aspects like privacy. In this paper we present a solution that provides a lightweight authentication process while preserving user anonymity at the same time. The goal is to define a multi-layered pseudonym architecture that does not affect the fast re-authentication procedure and that allows a user to be untraceable. Taking as reference our previous work in fast re-authentication, we describe the extensions required to support identity privacy. Moreover, results collected from an implemented prototype, reveal that the \u2026",

Thus, it is crucial for the administration of the institutions to set new strategies and plans for a better management of the current processes. Furthermore, the managerial decision is becoming more difficult as the complexity of educational entities increase. The purpose of this study is to suggest a way to support the administration of a HEI by providing new knowledge related to the educational processes using data mining techniques. This knowledge can be extracted among other from educational data that derive from the evaluation processes that each department of a HEI conducts. These data can be found in educational databases, in students\u2019 questionnaires or in faculty members\u2019 records. This paper presents the capabilities of data mining in the context of a Higher Education Institute and tries to discover new explicit knowledge by applying data mining techniques to educational data of Technological Educational Institute of Athens.

In fact, it can be argued that the whole Internet infrastructure depends on the smooth operation of the DNS service. Despite this fact, the original DNS design concentrated on availability, not security, and thus included no authentication. Nowadays, this security gap has been addressed by two cryptographic mechanisms: DNSSEC and DNSCurve. They both utilize public key cryptography and extend the core DNS protocol. Although the second mechanism is still in its infancy while the first is well-standardized, they are both promising and are quite likely to compete with each other in the near future to gain acceptance. This work aims to provide a comprehensive and constructive comparison between the aforementioned security mechanisms.

Thus the employment of the appropriate authentication framework is a crucial factor. This paper focuses on the way to determine the appropriate trust level of an electronic service. Specifically, it provides guidelines according to the data required for a transaction, as well as to the available authentication and registration mechanisms.

However, AUTH has two shortcomings. The security proof does not include man-in-the-middle (MIM) attacks and the communication complexity is high. The weakness against MIM attacks was recently verified as a very efficient key recovery MIM attack was introduced with only linear complexity with respect to the length of the secret key. Regarding the communication overhead, Kiltz et al. proposed a modified version of AUTH where the communication complexity is reduced at the expense of higher storage complexity. This modified protocol was shown to be at least as secure as AUTH.",

Although numerous publications can be found, most of them refer to prototypes and work in progress rather than to publicly available software that is ready to be widely used for the creation of such testbeds. The first contribution is the development of a framework that can be used to capture the main features of the available software. The second contribution is a literature review of state-of-the-art tools and their comparison under common criteria. This systematic analysis allows other researchers to make informed decisions about the usability of already available tools and decrease the initial cost of developing a new testbed, leading to an even wider use of such platforms.

The submissions were reviewed by at least three reviewers, in most cases by four, and for program committee (PC) papers at least? ve reviewers. This long and rigorous process was only possible thanks to the hard work of the PC members and additional reviewers, listed in the following pages. We would like to express our gratitude to the PC members, who were very supportive from the very beginning of this project. Thanks are also due to the additional expert reviewers who helped the PC to select the? nal 20 workshop papers for publication in the proceedings. Of course we highly appreciate the e? orts of all the authors who submitted papers to WISTP 2007. We hope they will contribute again to a future edition and encourage others to do so.",

Electronic healthcare records management can clearly benefit from the new challenges brought by this emerging technology, due to its low cost and high percentage of user adoption. Still, the sensitivity of medical data, poses new requirements in the design of a secure infrastructure based on the ad-hoc networking schema, which underlies pervasive environments. User authorization and controlled access to information is of outmost importance. This paper proposes a management system for electronic healthcare records satisfying the aforementioned security requirements.",

            "Abstract": "Over the last decades, the concept of integrating learning and entertainment appeared in the Information Technology (IT) field and shaped new terms including learning by playing, Educational entertainment (Edutainment) and Digital Game-based Learning (DGBL). Today, the latter term generally refers to the use of digital games to support teaching and learning. Such games can be played over the Internet, on personal computers, smartphones, or on specific mobile or traditional game consoles. From the time of legacy edutainment software being designed to serve educational purposes back in 1990s to modern educational game software, many researchers agreed on the value of DGBL to the learning process (Malone, 1981, Lepper and Malone, 1987, Burguillo, 2010, Yang, 2012, Woo, 2014).Nowadays, smart mobile devices have established themselves as one of the most developing markets worldwide. These devices are considered as context-sensitive and one of the most challenging technological fields in formal or lifelong learning due to their independent characteristics such as portability, connectivity, etc. Taking advantage of this technological trend, several researchers consider that e-Learning (Kambourakis et al., 2004) has given birth to an independent type of learning, known as mobile-Learning (m-Learning). Due to the undisputed mobility characteristics, this learning transformation supports just-in-time and just-in-place learning capabilities by allowing learners (and instructors) to have instant access to the learning content and course materials, as well as to collaborative activities anytime, and from arbitrary device types and \u2026",

There is a requirement for this autonomy: the sensor nodes must be able to configure themselves in the presence of adverse situations. Therefore, the nodes should make use of situation awareness mechanisms to determine the existence of abnormal events in their surroundings. This work approaches the problem by considering the possible abnormal events as diseases, thus making it possible to diagnose them through their symptoms, namely, their side effects. Considering these awareness mechanisms as a foundation for high-level monitoring services, this article also shows how these mechanisms are included in the blueprint of an intrusion detection system.",

Trust establishment frameworks provide the means for representing, evaluating, maintaining and distributing trust within the network, and serve as the basis for higher level security services. In this paper, we propose a trust establishment framework targeted sensor networks that can uniformly support the needs of nodes with highly diverse network roles and capabilities, by exploiting the pre-deployment knowledge on the network topology and the information flows. The framework allows for flexibility by combining aspects from alternative approaches on trust establishment on common evaluation metrics, and enables controlled trust evolution based on the network pre-configuration.

This architecture consists of a reference model, a functional architecture specification, and a set of technologies that can be used for implementing the functional units, along with all relevant standards. It was derived within the course of the KEYSTONE project, which was funded by the European Commission under the Electronic Trust Services II Programme. The proposed PKI architecture guarantees openness, scalability, flexibility, extensibility, integration with existing TTP and information infrastructure, transparency and, above all, security. Thus, it enjoys all the desirable characteristics and fulfils all those criteria that are essential for a PKI to constitute a successful framework for the development of inter-domain and international Trusted Services.",

The aim is to share among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions and resources in a flexible, secure, and coordinated manner. However, without an adequate understanding of the security implications of a Grid, both the owner who contributes resources to the Grid and the resource requestor can be subject to significant compromises in security. The basic prerequisite of establishing a secure Grid environment is the definition and implementation of a concrete security policy. Currently, in the existing Grid environments, security policy is often specified only by configuring access control lists associated with individual resources. It is obvious that significant work is needed in this area, which will lead to the specification of \u2026",

They constitute rich sources of information for public administrations (PA) redesign and eventually for the software delivery that must comply with normative regulations that are specified in laws and procedures. In order to facilitate the alignment between these elements, systematic methods and tools automating regulations modeling and analysis must be developed. In this paper, we propose the integration of process modeling (named VLPM) and goal-oriented (named Nomos) tool-supported methodologies to systematically model and analyze laws and procedures in public administration. We show that such integrated view would provide a framework that allows tracing and reasoning either top-down, from the principles to the implementation or, vice versa, bottom-up, from a change in the procedure to the principles. Finally, we also believe that this would provide a facility for interchanging models among different tools and for sharing models among different actors.",

What is it about that piece of code that suggests a particular author? What features in the code make one author more likely than another? In this study, we describe a means of identifying the high-level features that contribute to source code authorship identification using as a tool the SCAP method.

The authorization process is based on an automated policy framework, which handles negotiations between different organizational domains, and provides transparent access to knowledge assets. Users benefit from the system by acquiring knowledge not only from their domain, but by being able to query different organizations or different domains on grounds of a common for all co-operating domains security policy framework.

Nonetheless, transitioning between privacy concerns identified early during the system's design phase, and privacy implementing technologies to satisfy such concerns at the later development stages, remains a challenge. In order to overcome this issue, mainly caused by the lack of privacy-related expertise of software systems engineers, this work proposes a series of privacy process patterns. The proposed patterns encapsulate expert knowledge and provide predefined solutions for the satisfaction of different types of privacy concerns.

The underlying infrastructure of choice to support these transactions seems to be a distributed component architecture. Distributed component software (DCS) is the natural convergence of client/server network computing and object oriented technology in a mix providing reusability, scaleability and maintainability for software constructs. In DCS a client acquires references to objects provided by components located to remote machines and invokes methods of them as if they were located in its native environment. One implementation also provides the ability to pass objects by value, an approach recently examined also by others.

            "Abstract": "Sensor networks highly depend on the distributed cooperation among network nodes. Trust establishment frameworks provide the means for representing, evaluating, maintaining and distributing trust within the network, and serve as the basis for higher level security services. This paper provides a state-of-the art review of trust establishment frameworks for ad hoc and sensor networks. Certain types of frameworks are identified, such as behaviour-based and certificate-based, according to their scope, purpose and admissible types of evidence. The review is complemented by a comparative study built both on criteria specific to each category and on common criteria, grouped into three distinct classes: supported trust characteristics, complexity and requirements and deployment complexity and flexibility. We then present a trust establishment framework targeted for sensor networks that combines aspects from the two \u2026",

            "Abstract": "With the rapid development of communication technology, it becomes a reality to hear or watch anything, anywhere. Applications such as audio/video streaming, digital libraries, on-line businesses, and live camera remote surveillance are widely deployed. Users will be able to access these services anytime, anywhere, and using any computing device in a pervasive way. For example, a user may bring a PDA on a field trip, carry a laptop (with both wireless and wired network cards) on a business trip, use high performance workstations at work, and use desktop PCs at home (with dial-up, cable, or DSL connection). In another example, a user continues to watch the soccer game over home TV, while he watches the game through a mobile device out of home. Some other applications include mobile games and entertainment, mobile blog, mobile community, home network, smart home services, etc. Since these multimedia applications are constructed on the convergence of various networks, such as wired or wireless networks, broadcasting or multicasting networks, broadband or band-limited networks, and devices (e.g. PC, PDA, Cell Phone, TV, Camera, etc.), the new challenge in network management is to deal with heterogeneous client capabilities as well as dynamic end-to-end resources availability, and to ensure satisfactory service quality for every client. However, privacy and security issues are becoming increasingly important topics in network convergence. This special issue aims to expose the readership to the latest research results on multimedia networking and security in convergent environments. It is composed of 16 papers selected \u2026",

However, as security and privacy have been considered important aspects of an information system, many researchers presented methods that, through a number of specific steps, enable system designers to integrate security and privacy requirements at the early stage of system design. Different security and privacy engineering methods have been presented in order to be applied in traditional or cloud architectures. This paper reviews a number of security and privacy requirements engineering methods in both areas and presents a comparative study between these methods.",

The ERPINA protocol, introduced in this paper, allows an honest user communicating anonymously with a Server through a PET, while the identity of a dishonest user is revealed. Prior research failed to distinguish objectively between an honest user and an attacker; and a reliable and objective distinguishing technique is lacking. The ERPINA protocol addresses the reliability issue efficiently by defining from the beginning of the communication what is considered as malicious and what is not.",

A weak attacker, i.e. an attacker that has no access to the internal data of a tag, is able to impersonate a legitimate reader/server, and to desynchronize a tag. The attack is very efficient and has minimal computational complexity. Finally, we propose a simple solution to fix the flaw.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing is not just about resource sharing, cost savings and optimisation of business performance; it also involves fundamental concerns on how businesses need to respond on the risks and challenges upon migration. Managing risks is critical for a sustainable cloud adoption. It includes several dimensions such as cost, practising the concept of green IT, data quality, continuity of services to users and clients, guarantee tangible benefits. This paper presents a risk management approach for a sustainable cloud migration. We consider four dimensions of sustainability, ie, economic, environmental, social and technology to determine the viability of cloud for the business context. The risks are systematically identified and analysed based on the existing in house controls and the cloud service provider offerings. We use Dempster Shafer (DS) theory to measure the adequacy of controls and apply semi-quantitative approach to perform risk analysis based on the theory of belief. The risk exposure for each sustainability dimension allows us to determine the viability of cloud migration. A practical migration use case is considered to determine the applicability of our work. The results identify the risk exposure and recommended control for the risk mitigation. We conclude that risks depend on specific migration case and both Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and users are responsible for the risk mitigation. Inherent risks can evolve due to the cloud migration.
