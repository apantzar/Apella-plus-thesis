First, we describe analytically the dynamical regimes (depending on the gain/loss strengths), for finite-time collapse, decay, and global existence of solutions. Then, for all the above parametric regimes, we use direct numerical simulations to study the dynamics corresponding to algebraically decaying initial data. We identify crucial differences between the dynamics of vanishing initial conditions, and those converging to a finite constant background: in the former (latter) case we find strong (weak) collapse or decay, when the gain/loss parameters are selected from the relevant regimes. One of our main results, is that in all the above regimes, non-vanishing initial data transition through spatiotemporal, algebraically decaying waveforms.

The direct scattering problem for each case is formulated in a dyadic form. For two point sources, dyadic far-field pattern generators are defined and general scattering theorems and mixed scattering relations are presented. The direct scattering problem for a rigid circular disc is considered, and the exact Green function and the elastic far-field patterns of the radiating solution in the form of infinite series are obtained. Under the low-frequency assumption, approximations for the longitudinal and transverse far-field patterns of the scattered field are obtained, in addition to an asymptotic expansion for the corresponding scattering cross-section.

In treating such problems we assume that the temporal evolution of these fields is periodic, with a fixed and prescribed period \u03d6. This class covers a variety of important applications, such as wave guide problems, scattering problems, etc. Under the assumption of temporally periodic fields we may use the constitutive relations introduced in Section 2.3. 3, which do not contain the convolution terms. The absence of the convolution terms simplifies the treatment of the Maxwell equations,(PDEs) which in this case become partial differential equations depending only on the spatial variables. As we shall see in this chapter, these differential equations, after proper reductions, can lead to problems that can be treated using the theory of variational PDEs, and methods akin to those used in elliptic problems.In this \u2026",

Since our basic interest is the development of a mathematically rigorous framework for the study of this problem, our approach is to model random effects through the introduction of a general class of random fields1 into the system of equations that governs the evolution of the electromagnetic fields. We do not take up the question of self-consistent mathematical modelling of the random effects, starting from the starting point of first principles physical theory. Such a task, although extremely interesting and important, is well beyond the scope of this work. Instead, we assume that the randomness follows some rather general and reasonable qualitative assumptions, eg, Gaussian behaviour, etc., and use a well-founded mathematical model for it, in terms of the Wiener process \u2026",

This class of systems is the infinite-dimensional analogue of linear descriptor systems in finite dimensions. Under appropriate assumptions, the mild and strong well-posedness for the initial value problem are studied using elements of the semigroup theory and properties of the stochastic convolution. The final value problem is also examined and it is proved that this is uniquely strongly solvable and the solution is continuously dependent on the final data. Based on the results of the forward and backward problem, the conditions for the exact controllability are investigated for a special but important class of these equations. The abstract results are illustrated by applications in complex media electromagnetics, in the one-dimensional stochastic Dirac equation in the non-relativistic limit and in a potential \u2026",

These relations are considered as formal expressions of the physical laws that govern the electromagnetics of complex media. When they are introduced into the Maxwell equations, we obtain differential equations (PDEs) that govern the evolution of the electromagnetic fields; the treatment of these equations, in the rigorous mathematical sense, is the main object of this monograph.

The basic tool in the treatment is the set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator for the surface. The norm is obtained in view of an eigenvalue problem of a quadratic form containing the exterior Calder\u00f3n operator. The connection of the exterior Calder\u00f3n operator to the transition matrix for a perfectly conducting surface is analyzed.",

            "Abstract": "Nonlinearity is inherent in nature and accounts for a number of interesting phenomena. To keep within the context of electromagnetic media, nonlinearity appears in a number of cases in which the dispersion relations or equivalently the coefficients of the constitutive relations change as a function of the field amplitudes. This behaviour is very common in dielectrics, where it has been experimentally verified, theoretically studied, and widely studied mathematically. Furthermore, the interplay between dispersion and nonlinearity in dielectrics has led to the observation of solitary waves, which has important applications to optical communications. Regarding chiral media, although third-order nonlinear effects were predicted as early as 1967, nonlinear optical rotation experiments were not undertaken before 1993. Out of a long list, the papers [313] and [314] can serve as representative of related important experimental \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We show global well-posedness of certain type of strong-in-time and weak-in-space solutions for the Cauchy problem of the 1-dimensional nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, in various cases of open sets, bounded and unbounded. These solutions do not vanish at the boundary or at infinity.",
