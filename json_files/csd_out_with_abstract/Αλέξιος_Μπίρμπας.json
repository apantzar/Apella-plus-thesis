Recent experimental noise measurements with very short devices demonstrate the existence of suppressed shot noise, contrary to the predictions of classical channel thermal noise models. In this work we show that, as the dimensions continue to shrink, shot noise has to be considered when the channel resistance becomes comparable to the barrier resistance at the source-channel junction. By adopting a semi-classical approach and taking retrospectively into account transport, short-channel and quantum effects, we investigate the partitioning between shot and thermal noise, and formulate a predictive model that describes the noise \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The continuous penetration of renewable energy resources (RES) into the energy mix and the transition of the traditional electric grid towards a more intelligent, flexible and interactive system, has brought electrical load forecasting to the foreground of smart grid planning and operation. Predicting the electric load is a challenging task due to its high volatility and uncertainty, either when it refers to the distribution system or to a single household. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced which leverages the advantages of the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and specifically the Convolution Neural Nets (CNN). The main feature of the proposed methodology is the exploitation of the statistical properties of each time series dataset, so as to optimize the hyper-parameters of the neural network and in addition transform the given dataset into a form that allows maximum exploitation of the CNN algorithm\u2019s advantages. The proposed algorithm is compared with the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) technique which is the state of the art solution for electric load forecasting. The evaluation of the algorithms was conducted by employing three open-source, publicly available datasets. The experimental results show strong evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "The sensor values readout is a critical issue in Factory Automation systems and control applications in general. Analogue-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are the circuits that accept as input the analogue indication of the sensors and provide as output the corresponding digital code representation of the analogue value that can be exploited by the digital part of the controller. The most important parameters that affect the selection of an appropriate ADC are the conversion resolution, the sampling rate, the power consumption and the die area required. Several architectures have been proposed for ADCs that target different application requirements. For example, cable TV and PAL/NTSC decoders require 8-12bits resolution with 10-20MS/s sampling rate while high speed logic analyzers require 5-7bits resolution with multi-GS/s sampling rate. The industrial systems that require ADC conversion are production lines, command-control facilities, product quality measurement, communication networks, security systems etc. Industrial systems may use ADCs for the control of simple sensors like temperature, humidity, pressure, etc as well as for the interface of input devices with increased complexity like high speed and precision imagers. The most popular ADC architectures are the Flash, Pipeline, Successive Approximation, Sigma-Delta and Folding-Interpolation ones. The Flash ADCs achieve the highest speed but occupy large silicon area and consume high power. For this reason, their resolution is practically limited to less than 8-bits. Furthermore, special analogue front-end components or technology processes need to be employed to design Flash \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The indoor localisation of a mobile target is an important issue in many robotics, automation, virtual reality and pervasive computing environments. The most sophisticated method for indoor localisation is based on processing the images captured by cameras that are placed on the target in order to recognise familiar landmarks and their distance (Jin et al, 2004);(Porta & Krose, 2006);(Clerentin et al, 2005);(Tovar et al, 2006);(Se et al, 2002). Image processing in conjunction with other localisation approaches described below (Borenstein et al., 1996) is very popular in autonomous robotics applications making feasible the familiarisation of a robot with unknown areas. Stochastic processing is often applied in this case in order to evaluate an estimated position. Nevertheless, expensive sensors and processing units are required in order to support the high computational complexity of this approach.More popular lower cost approaches are based either on measuring the round trip time of a reflected wave or the strength of a signal. In the first case, the cost is higher if optical or laser scanning is employed since very short time intervals have to be measured with high precision (Miura et al, 2006);(Clerentin et al, 2005);(Victorino et al, 2003);(Arras et al, 2001). Ultrasonic signals can offer a lower cost alternative to this approach since the sonar waves travel with much lower speed than light but their main drawback is that this type of signal is not directional enough (Smith & Zografos, 2005);(Minami et al, 2004);(Tardos et al, 2002);(Bicho et al, 2000);(Baskent & Barshan, 1999).

            "Abstract": "Time to Digital Conversion (TDC) is an efficient technique to transform sensor readout signals into digital read out output through the measurement of a time duration. It is applicable into low frequency capacitive sensor readout circuits as well as in high frequency event-sensing circuits. The choice of the measuring time affects the sensitivity range for a specific physical species and is prone to jitter (noise). The noise itself stems from the readout circuitry and from various parasitic elements. The identification of the noise origin is necessary since it affects not only the range but also the resolution of the sensor, as it appears in the jitter. In high frequency applications the thermal noise behavior of the output noise diminishes jitter as a function of the measurement time while in low frequency capacitive sensor applications, the measurement time increase in order to extend the measurement range, leads to an increased \u2026",

These features have been estimated by post-layout simulations. In ordinary subrange architectures a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) generates an analog value from the digital coarse ADC output that is subtracted by the input in order to produce a residue that serves as input to the fine ADC stage. In such an approach, the linearity errors of the coarse ADC, the DAC and the subtractor are accumulated.

The function performed at the nodes of the binary tree is an integer division by a proper power of 2, that is implemented by a novel circuit. The developed ADC system is an asynchronous circuit operating in current mode needing only a small number of components. This fact in conjunction with the binary tree structure of the ADC architecture, lead to implementations with very low die area and power consumption (0.12mm2 and 72mW respectively for 12-bit resolution). The average sampling rate exceeds 140MS/s for 12-bit resolution. The proposed device can also be used in multi Gbps time-interleaved parallel ADC due to its very low die area and power consumption.",

The sources considered are low-cost conventional directly modulated lasers (DMLs), fabricated for operation at 2.5 Gb/s but modulated at 10 Gb/s. Performance improvement is achieved by means of electronic feed-forward and decision-feedback equalization (FFE/DFE) at the receiver end. Experimental studies consider both transient and adiabatic chirp dominated DMLs sources. The improvement is evaluated in terms of required optical signal-to-noise ratio (ROSNR) for bit-error-rate (BER) values of 10-3 versus launch power over uncompensated links of standard single mode fiber (SSMF).",

The calculation is based on the devices' nonlinear responses on the fundamental sinusoid and on computing the high harmonics response through a linear set of equations, considering the nonlinearities known. In that way we achieve higher accuracy avoiding the solution of a nonlinear system. Various effects (i.e. variable parallel resistance) can be included, thus increasing the accuracy further.

To deal with the vast diversity of power grids, being able to capture the dynamics of any given network, and create tools for network analysis, apparatus testing, and power grid management, an automatic design framework for real-time power system simulators is needed. In this article, a prototype of this approach is presented, employing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms due to their reconfigurability that enables low-power, low-latency, and high-performance designs, as a first attempt towards an open source platform, compatible with the majority of hardware design suites. It comprises two major parts:(i) a user-oriented section, built in Matlab/Simulink; and (ii) a hardware-oriented section, written in Matlab and Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC)-Hardware Description Language (VHDL) code. To verify its functionality, two test power networks were given in a schematic format, analyzed through Matlab code and turned into dedicated hardware simulators with the aid of the VHDL template. Then, simulation results from Simulink and the prototype were compared for error estimation. The results show the prototype\u2019s successful implementation with minimal resources utilization, high performance and low latency in the order of nanoseconds in Xilinx 6-and 7-series \u2026",

This physical system is usually a continuous-time one and its model execution requires resources far beyond existing embedded computing capabilities. The need for capturing the real time transient behavior of a physical system imposes additional burden in CPS in terms of computational time steps. In this work, we present that it is feasible to emulate a physical system (the Distribution Energy Grid in this case) by direct mapping it on hardware computational resources while maintaining its real time transient behavior. The hardware mapped physical system model can then act as a co-processing element to the CPS computational part.

The sampling rate adopted by the contemporary commercial PLC systems is less than 20-30MHz but the IEEE P. 1901 proposes sampling frequencies up to 100MHz. A resolution of 8-12bits with a sampling rate of less than 100MS/s is adequate for most existing PLC commercial systems. On the other hand, ADCs with low cost, area and power are always valuable for this kind of applications due to the large number of adaptors required at the outlets of the power lines and their small dimensions.The ADC presented in this paper, is implemented in CMOS technology (90nm TSMC) and is based on a binary tree structure where integer division by a power of 2 is performed at each node. The developed ADC system is an asynchronous circuit operating in current mode needing only a small number of components and having a configurable 4, 8 or 12-bits resolution. This implementation requires very low die area and power consumption (0.12 mm2 and 72mW respectively for 12-bit resolution). The average sampling rate exceeds 140MS/s for 12-bit resolution. The low die area and power consumption that characterize this ADC architecture make it ideal for use in time interleaved ADC in order to achieve higher speed.",

            "Abstract": "Neuromorphic devices performing synaptic processes in the analog domain are preferable from their digital hardware counterparts for the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The reason is their reduced area and power requirements. Charge Trap Transistors (CTT) have been recently proposed as analog neural network computing engines due to their CMOS compatibility as well. Gate controlled differential change of the threshold voltage related to charge storage into the high-k dielectric layer (traps) is the transduction mechanism for the non-volatile device operation; the same mechanism serves the learning process when it is employed as a synaptic element. The stochastic nature of the trapping (de-trapping) procedure produces low frequency noise of RTS type and modulates the channel current. This non-desirable but unavoidable counterintuitive effect (detrimental to the device performance) could be adhesive if this internal noise is used in order to induce stochastic resonance (SR) into the synaptic operation of the CTT. Indeed since the synaptic element is a non-linear system, SR at an engineered range of noise intensities can improve system performance (making information at the input visible at the output). This expands the learning capability of CTT into multilayer fully connected neural networks with non linear activation functions.",
