The analysis is twofold: first, exact solutions of the nonlocal equation with constant coefficients are found along with the appropriate conditions for their existence, and second, using a similarity transformation the distributed equation, ie the equations with varying coefficients, is reduced to the constant coefficients case; the solutions of the latter will be utilized in the construction of the solutions for the general case. This similarity transformation is also physically relevant as it allows for the physical parameters of the solution (amplitude, width, centre and phase) to vary in a specific way so that the constant coefficient system is a natural similarity reduction of the distributed case. Certain compatibility conditions needed for the consistency of this reduction are also deduced.",

The formation of these events gives rise to the same number of transient \u201ctriangular\u201d spatiotemporal patterns, each of which is reminiscent of the one emerging in the dynamics of the integrable NLS in its semiclassical limit, when supplemented with vanishing initial conditions. We find that the L 2-norm of the spatial derivative and the L 4-norm detect the appearance of rogue waves as local extrema in their evolution.

It is found that these solutions are well approximated by a finite sum of hyperbolic secants powers. The dependence of the soliton\u02bcs parameters (height, width, etc) to the parameters of the equation is also investigated. Second, by developing a multiple scale reduction of the RSPE to the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we are able to construct (both standing and traveling) envelope wave breather type solutions of the former, based on the solitary wave structures of the latter.

First, at an intermediate stage, a Boussinesq equation is derived, and then its far-field, in the form of a variety of Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvilli (KP) equations for right-and left-going waves, is found. KP models include versions of the KP-I and KP-II equations, in Cartesian and cylindrical geometry. Solitary waves solutions, planar or ring-shaped, and of dark or anti-dark type, are also predicted to occur. Their nature and stability is determined by a parameter defined by the physical parameters of the original nonlocal system. It is thus found that (dark) anti-dark solitary waves are only supported by a weak (strong) nonlocality, and are unstable (stable) in higher-dimensions.

The interested readers are referred to [1-3] where parts of this editorial were taken from. For more detailed information on the mathematical developments of the subject, we refer the reader to a recent review [4]. Rogue waves (also known as freak waves, monster waves, killer waves, extreme waves, and abnormal waves) are ocean waves with heights up to thirty meters which have been common elements in stories from people working at sea, as well as in popular fiction. It is not hard to imagine why: being on a small boat in a stormy sea swell and suddenly encountering a wave maybe three times as high as the surrounding waves is a terrifying experience (Figure 1).For centuries, seafarers have told tales of giant waves that can appear without warning on the high seas. These mountainous waves were said to be capable of destroying a vessel (Figure 2) or swallowing it beneath the surface, and then disappearing without the slightest trace. Until recently, these tales were thought to be mythical. In the mid-1990s, however, rogue waves proved very real when recorded for the first time by scientific measurements during an encounter at the Draupner oil platform in the North Sea (Figure 3). Although they are elusive and intrinsically difficult to monitor because of their fleeting existences, satellite surveillance has confirmed that rogue waves roam the open oceans, occasionally encountering \u2026",

In the focusing case, bright soliton pairs have been found to exist provided their amplitudes satisfy a specific condition. In our analytical approach, focused on the defocusing regime, we rely on a multiscale expansion methods, which reveals the existence of dark-dark and antidark-antidark solitons, obeying an effective Korteweg-de Vries equation, as well as dark-bright solitons, obeying an effective Mel'nikov system. These pairs are discriminated by the sign of a constant that links all physical parameters of the system to the amplitude of the stable continuous wave solutions, and, much like the focusing case, the solitons' amplitudes are linked, leading to mutual guiding.",

Simulations with the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal a noticeable, experimentally observable spread in individual soliton trajectories, attributed to inherent fluctuations in both phase and density of the underlying medium. Averaging over a number of such trajectories (as done in experiments) washes out such background fluctuations, revealing a well-defined temperature-dependent temporal growth in the oscillation amplitude. The average soliton dynamics is well captured by the simpler dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, both numerically and via an analytically-derived equation for the soliton center based on perturbation theory for dark solitons.",

The enhanced performance of these lasers has led to their widespread use. Increasingly compact, user-friendly, reliable, and economical instruments have allowed femtosecond lasers to expand beyond research environments and find new applications such as in multi-user biology facilities, medical clinics, manufacturing environments, and even in mobile facilities and aircraft. A modelocked (ML) fiber laser cavity with a passive polarizer is an example of a technologically and commercially promising ultrafast device. It can be expected that improved mathematical modeling of ultra-short pulse passively mode-locked laser devices will help speed their development. Mode-locked laser pulses can be generated actively by use of an external element or passively via the Kerr-lens mechanism. The latter produces shorter pulses and will be the focus here.A mode-locked laser refers to the frequency domain description of how ultra-short pulses are generated by a laser system. The requirement that the electromagnetic field be unchanged after one round trip in the laser means that lasing only occurs for frequencies such that the cavity length is an integer number of wavelengths. If multiple modes lase at the same time, then a short pulse can be formed, but only if the modes are locked in phase, ie, the laser is mode-locked. Passive mode-locking can be described in terms of a saturable absorber, ie, higher intensity is less \u2026",

One of our main results is that third-order dispersion has a dominant role in the development of such complex dynamics, since it can be chiefly responsible (even in the absence of other higher-order effects) for the existence of periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic spatiotemporal structures.

This is found to occur only when both equations are focusing. When at least one component is defocusing, the CNLS equations may still exhibit larger growth rates, compared to the scalar system, but that does not necessarily result in more or larger events. The birefringence angle for which the maximum number of events occurs is also identified and the nature of the rogue wave is described for the different cases.",

Notably, recent research has shown that solitons can be generated in mode-locked lasers. An interesting application of these lasers is the development of optical clocks which have the potential to be considerably more accurate than atomic clocks. Another important area of research in nonlinear optics is lattice dynamics where localized solitary wave or solitons can be obtained in periodic and irregular lattice systems. In honeycomb lattices, discrete and continuous nonlinear Dirac systems can be derived in certain parameter regimes; the Dirac systems describe conical diffraction, a phenomena observed in recent experiments. In water and internal waves the classical equations are reformulated as a system of coupled equations where the free surface equations are formulated as nonlocal equation and the depth variable is eliminated. These systems reduce to interesting asymptotic equations in suitable limits. A numerical method, termed spectral renormalization, is used to find solitary waves in nonlinear optics, water waves and multi-fluid systems.1. Introduction. Nonlinear waves in optics and water waves occur widely; the literature is extensive and in addition to research papers and memoirs there are many books which deal with this subject [16, 22, 56, 68]. Similarly, localized waves are of broad interest. One of the best known example goes back to J. Scott Russell [64] and his observation of solitary waves in shallow canals in Edinburgh, Scotland.

A rogue condition is introduced that links the angle of interaction with the group velocities of these waves: different angles of interaction can result in a major enhancement of rogue events in both numbers and amplitude. For a range of interacting directions, it is found that the CNLS system exhibits significantly more extreme wave amplitude events than its scalar counterpart. Furthermore, the rogue events of the coupled system are found to be well approximated by hyperbolic secant functions; they are vectorial soliton-type solutions of the CNLS system, typically not considered to be integrable. Overall, our results indicate that crossing states provide an important mechanism for the generation of rogue \u2026",

We find that single- and multiple-dark-soliton states can exist and are generically robust in the presence of long-range interactions. We analyze the modes of vibration of such excitations and find that their respective frequencies are significantly upshifted as the strength of the long-range interactions is increased.

In dispersion-managed (DM) systems, an asymptotic multiple-scale theory is used to analyze the dynamics. This equation, which describes solitons in the anomalous regime, also admits higher-order solitons, the so-called antisymmetric soliton or bisoliton, in both constant dispersion and DM systems.

Simulations with the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal a noticeable, experimentally observable spread in individual soliton trajectories, attributed to inherent fluctuations in both phase and density of the underlying medium. Averaging over a number of such trajectories (as done in experiments) washes out such background fluctuations, revealing a well-defined temperature-dependent temporal growth in the oscillation amplitude. The average soliton dynamics is well captured by the simpler dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, both numerically and via an analytically derived equation for the soliton center based on perturbation theory for dark solitons.",

In our analytical approach, focused on the defocusing regime, we rely on a multiscale expansion methods, which reveals the existence of dark-dark and antidark-antidark solitons, obeying an effective Korteweg-de Vries equation, as well as dark-bright solitons, obeying an effective Mel'nikov system.

In optics, the NLS system is used to model a unique balance between the critical effects that govern propagation in dispersive nonlinear media, namely dispersion/diffraction and nonlinearity. This balance leads to the formation of solitons, namely robust localized waveforms that maintain their shape even when they interact.

            "Abstract": "Quantum engineering of electronic energy states using nanoscale layers of semiconductor compounds allows the design and the observation of quantum phenomena which are typically observed in atomic structures. Furthermore, semiconductors are present in nearly all modern electronic devices and are a crucial component of integrated circuits. Due to the relatively high rate of manufacturing defects, it is crucial to have a method for testing new semiconductor formations without requiring a sample to be fabricated. A simple, fast and very accurate numerical technique is presented to calculate the eigenstates of such arbitrary quantum structures. The method is based on a high-order finite difference scheme which allows the use of sparse matrix algebra, thus, significantly reducing computational time and allowing for high precision results even for the high energy states.",
