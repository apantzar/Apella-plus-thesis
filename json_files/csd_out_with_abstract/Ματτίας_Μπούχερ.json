            "Abstract": "Standard CMOS Process Design Kits (PDKs) do not address degradation the technology incurs when exposed to high Total Ionizing Dose (TID). Front-end electronics for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider are expected to be exposed up to ten-fold doses. Bulk CMOS at 65 nm is a strong contender for such electronics due to a favorable trade-off among cost, performance, and TID-sensitivity. The present paper presents the extension of a foundry-provided PDK to cover also high TID effects. TID experiments have been carried out up to 500 Mrad. The PDK is based on binned BSIM4 models, which are adapted to different TID levels. Hence, designers may choose among different TID levels for their designs, contributing importantly to radiation-hard design practice.",

With the scaling of CMOS technology, optimum RF performance is shown to be shifted from higher moderate toward lower moderate inversion, providing important guidelines for RFIC design.

Transconductance-to-current ratio is obtained from MOSFET transfer characteristics measured at low to high drain voltage. Based on the charge-based modeling approach, a near-constant value of threshold voltage is obtained over the whole range of drain voltage for ideal, long-channel MOSFETs. The method reveals a distinct increase of threshold voltage versus drain voltage for halo-implanted MOSFETs in the low drain voltage range. The method benefits from moderate inversion operation, where high-field effects, such as vertical field mobility reduction and series resistances, are minimal. The present method is applicable over the full range of drain voltage, is fully analytical, easy to be implemented, and provides more consistent results when compared to existing methods.",

PMOS devices show higher 1/f noise than NMOS for input referred noise. The carrier number fluctuation model allows to well represent increased noise in strong inversion for either transistor type. Mobility fluctuation however is found to be significant in deep weak inversion. As a result, input referred noise shows a minimum in moderate inversion, and both carrier number and mobility fluctuation processes are required to represent noise over all the gate voltage range.

In the saturation region, the effects of series resistance, surface roughness scattering, channel length modulation, and saturation velocity were also considered. The proposed model has been validated by comparing the transfer and output characteristics with device simulations and with experimental results. The good accuracy and the symmetry of the model make it suitable for implementation in circuit simulation tools.",

In this paper, transistors with enclosed gate layout are examined and compared with standard layout transistors, with particular emphasis on weak inversion region. Enclosed gate transistors show an improved gate voltage mismatch in weak inversion. A compact MOSFET model for LFN and its variability, based on number fluctuation theory, is shown to cover well the behavior of either type of transistors. Lower levels of noise as well as lower variability of noise are observed in enclosed gate transistors.",

Bulk silicon CMOS at 65 nm offers appreciable advantages among cost, performance, and resilience to high Total Ionizing Dose (TID). In the present paper, geometrical scaling of key analog design parameters of MOS transistors irradiated at high TID is investigated. Experiments are carried out for TID of 100, 200 and up to 500 Mrad(SiO 2 ) and at -30\u00b0C, 0\u00b0C, and 25\u00b0C. We find that parameters are least degraded at -30\u00b0C. However, short-channel NMOSTs show a significant degradation of slope factor, which is more severe at 0\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C. In contrast, the slope factor in short-channel PMOSTs shows lowest sensitivity to high TID.",

Though measured data is limited, parameters related to carrier number fluctuation effect may be found. 50 V N-channel HV-MOSFETs are investigated for long as well as short channel lengths. The parameter extraction method is applied to a recently established 1/f noise model for HV-MOSFETs, showing a good agreement among model and experimental data.",

In smaller-sized devices, noise fluctuations are area-dominated. In moderate- to large-sized transistors (Area \u226b 1\u03bcm 2 ), normalized noise fluctuations are roughly independent of area, but show a distinct degradation towards weak inversion (subthreshold). A new model is proposed for the gate-voltage dependence of 1/f noise variations in moderately-sized transistors. We show that the gate-voltage dependence may be related to transconductance-to-current ratio g m /I D . Extensive measurements of low frequency noise variability in experimental 180nm CMOS confirm the newly proposed model.",

This knowledge can be used as a strong starting point for the design and optimization procedures. Initially, the LNA component values are extracted using the analytical model. The model does not fully take into consideration the parasitic behaviour of the components in a real design; thus, it produces an approximation of the optimum design. The final circuit fine tuning is achieved with the use of a genetic \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel charge-based approach to modeling bias-dependent noise in junction field-effect transistors (JFETs). Low frequency noise as well as thermal noise aspects are modeled within the recent charge-based model of the double-gate (DG) JFET. For low frequency noise, mobility fluctuations according to the Hooge model is addressed. Thermal noise is expressed within the charge-based modeling approach. The models are validated with respect to TCAD simulations and show correct dependence over a range of gate and drain bias. A custom setup for low frequency noise measurement of JFETs is described. Noise measurements of n-JFETs are discussed, and the compact model is compared with the measurement.",

A new approach to analytically modeling the polysilicon depletion effect on drain current and transconductances as well as node charges and transcapacitances is presented. The model is based on a clear physical analysis of the charges in the MOS transistor structure. Using the modeling framework and the fundamental variables of the EKV MOS transistor model formalism and that of the related charges models, a continuous model is achieved that is valid in all operating regions from weak inversion to strong inversion and from non-saturation to saturation.

In this paper, an analytical, charge-based model is established for the mobile charges, drain current, and transconductances of symmetric DG JFETs, covering all regions of device operation.

The same method is then extended to cover also the case when series resistance is present, while series resistance itself may be determined from the measurement from two FETs with different channel lengths. The key technological and design parameter is the threshold voltage, which may be unambiguously determined from the transconductance-to-current ratio with a constant-current method. The new methods are shown to be effective over a wide range of technical parameters, using technology computer-aided design simulations.",

Trade-offs in the design, such as noise figure, gain, linearity are explored, based on the inversion coefficient and channel length of the MOS transistors. The design accounts for the effect of induced gate noise in the MOSFETs using the EKV3 model and accounts for non-ideal inductors. It is clearly shown how reduced channel length also leads to lower levels of inversion for best LNA performance.",

The present work describes the new compact model of double gate (DG) JFETs which is compared to TCAD simulations of SiC and GaN JFETs over a wide temperature range up to 500oC. The compact model is shown to be predictive of device behavior, for static (current-voltage) as well as dynamic (capacitance-voltage) behavior of long-channel DG JFETs.",

Well-designed DG MOSFETs attain higher values of cut-off frequency for both lower and higher drain currents, whereas FinFETs offer higher intrinsic gain while compromising cutoff frequency. For longer channel lengths, SG MOSFETs show slightly higher cut-off frequency in comparison to multi-gate (MG) MOSFETs, whereas MG MOSFETs exhibit higher cut-off frequency for lower channel lengths. A unique figure of merit, gain transconductance frequency product (GTFP) for best trade-off among gain, transconductance, and speed is compared. DG MOSFETs exhibit higher GTFP over a wide range of device scaling, thus remain a good candidate for analog/RF applications. Furthermore, the RF linearity performance of these devices has been examined.",

In this paper, we report on the behavior of low frequency noise, including experimental characterization and compact modeling for NMOS and PMOS devices in 180 nm CMOS technology. Aspects of bias dependence and scaling are examined. Input referred noise shows an important increase in strong inversion and a minimum in moderate inversion. The compact model approach is based on the charge-based model, including carrier number fluctuation, mobility fluctuation and resistance fluctuation noise mechanisms. The low frequency noise model is related closely to the underlying charge-based model, and is implemented in the context of the EKV3 compact MOSFET model. As a result, 1/f noise bias dependence and scaling is covered over a wide range of geometry and \u2026",

The transistors exhibited high current handling capabilities (Direct Current density 330A/cm 2).

            "Abstract": "Variability of low frequency noise (LFN) in MOSFETs is bias-dependent. Moderate-to-large-sized transistors commonly used in analog/RF applications show 1/f-like noise spectra, resulting from the superposition of random telegraph noise. Carrier number and mobility fluctuations are considered as the main causes of LFN. While their effect on the bias-dependence of LFN has been well investigated, the way these noise mechanisms contribute to the bias-dependence of variability of LFN has been less well understood. LFN variability has been shown to be maximized in weak inversion (subthreshold), while increased drain bias also increases LFN variability. However, no compact model has been proposed to explain this bias-dependence in detail. In combination with the charge-based formulation of LFN, this paper proposes a new model for bias-dependence of LFN variability. Comparison with experimental data \u2026",

The optimum operation is defined by a figure of merit (FoM) that considers both the power efficiency and the RF performance of the device. This FoM suggests that the optimum region of operation lies in the moderate inversion. This knowledge can be used as a strong starting point for the design and optimization procedures. Initially, the LNA component values are determined using the analytical model. The analytical procedure does not account for all parasitics of the active and in particular the passive components, leading to a sub-optimal design. Therefore, the final LNA design is generated using full circuit simulation, where a genetic algorithm takes the analytical design as a starting point, aiming at faster convergence.

Front-end electronics for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider are expected to be exposed up to ten-fold doses. Bulk CMOS at 65 nm is a strong contender for such electronics due to a favorable trade-off among cost, performance, and TID-sensitivity. The present paper presents the extension of a foundry-provided PDK to cover also high TID effects. TID experiments have been carried out up to 500 Mrad. The PDK is based on binned BSIM4 models, which are adapted to different TID levels. Hence, designers may choose among different TID levels for their designs, contributing importantly to radiation-hard design practice.",

            "Abstract": "The double-gate (DG) junction field-effect transistor (JFET) is a classical electron device, with a simple structure that presents many advantages in terms of device fabrication but also its principle of operation. The device has been largely used in low-noise applications, but also more recently, in power electronics. Furthermore, co-integration of JFET with CMOS technology is attractive. Physics-based compact models for JFETs are however scarce. In this paper, an analytical, charge-based model is established for the mobile charges, drain current, transconductances and transcapacitances of symmetric DG JFETs, covering all regions of device operation, continuously from subthreshold to linear and saturation operation. This charge-based JFET model (called CJM) constitutes the basis of a full compact model of the DG JFET for analog, RF, and digital circuit simulation.",

A systematic analysis of scaling of transconductance, output conductance and intrinsic gain with technology, channel length but also bias conditions is presented for a deep submicron CMOS process. The analog properties are represented versus normalized current, so as to provide an easy means of interpretation and comparison. Measured transconductances and derived quantities such as intrinsic gain are investigated for NMOS and PMOS devices of an 110 nm CMOS technology, covering a large range of channel length and inversion conditions. This reveals novel properties of advanced CMOS technology and some useful guidelines for designers are given.",

            "Abstract": "This work presents an analysis of high frequency noise and linearity performance of a 90 nm CMOS process. Measurements are performed for a wide range of nominal gate lengths and bias points at high frequency. Modeling is based on the EKV3 compact model in Spectre RF circuit simulator from Cadence. The model shows correct scalability for noise and linearity accounting for short channel effects (SCEs), such as velocity saturation (VS) and channel length modulation (CLM). Results are presented versus a common measure of channel inversion level, named inversion coefficient. Optimum performance is shown to gradually shift from higher to lower levels of moderate inversion, when scaling from 240 nm to 100 nm. The same trend is observed from investigating the transconductance frequency product (TFP) of a common-source (CS) LNA for technology nodes ranging from 180 nm to 22 nm.",

Its basis is an ideal analytical charge-based model including static to non-quasistatic dynamic aspects and noise. The ideal model is extended to account for the major second-order effects in deep-submicron CMOS technologies resulting from technology scaling and from short-channel effects. It is shown how these nonidealities affect the ideal device characteristics. The increasingly important moderate and weak inversion operation are emphasized.

            "Abstract": "Variability of low frequency noise (LFN) in MOSFETs is both geometry- and bias-dependent. RTS noise prevails in smaller devices where noise deviation is mostly area-dominated. As device dimensions increase, operating conditions determine noise variability maximizing it in weak inversion and increasing it with drain voltage. This dependence is shown to be directly related with fundamental carrier number fluctuation effect. A new bias- and area-dependent, physics-based, compact model for 1/f noise variability is proposed. The model exploits the log-normal behavior of LFN. The model is shown to give consistent results for average noise, variance, and standard deviation, covering bias-dependence and scaling over a large range of geometry.",

The drift region model combined with the standard charge-sheet MOS model for the low-voltage part adds up to a complete HV-MOSFET model, which is verified against technology computer-aided design simulations and measurements of HV-MOS transistors. The comparisons demonstrate its accurate physics foundations and underline that this novel approach to the modeling of the drift region of the HV-MOSFET is promising.",

It is used below 200 K and is very well adapted to analog simulation in weak and moderate inversion regimes. It was successively applied on different CMOS processes from different foundries. The model's performance is demonstrated in this work for a 0.35 m N+ single gate process. Experimental results on the evolution of the low frequency noise and the transistor matching parameters between 300 K and 77 K are also presented. Contrary to the NMOS transistors, the threshold voltage differences of buried channel PMOS transistors are less scattered as the temperature is lowered. The same trend with temperature is observed on the flicker noise parameter.",

The progress has been driven by the downsizing of the active devices such as MOSFETs. Approaching these dimensions, MOSFET characteristics cannot be accurately predicted using classical modeling methods currently used in the most common MOSFET models such as BSIM, MM9 etc, without introducing large number of empirical parameters. Various physical effects that needed to be considered while modeling UDSM devices: quantization of the inversion layer, mobility degradation, carrier velocity saturation and overshoot, polydepletion effects, bias dependent source/drain resistances and capacitances, vertical and lateral doping profiles, etc. In this paper, we will discuss the progress in the CMOS technology and the anticipated difficulties of the sub-0.25 \u017em LSI downsizing. Subsequently, basic MOSFET modeling methodologies that are more appropriate for UDSM MOSFETs will be presented as well. The advances in compact MOSFET devices will be illustrated using application examples of the EPFL EKV model",

A rigorous derivation of simpler relations among inversion charge and applied external potentials is provided, using the technique of inversion charge linearization versus surface potential. The new concept of the pinch-off surface potential and a new definition of the inversion charge linearization factor are introduced. In particular, we show that the EKV charge-based model can be considered as an approximation to the more general approach presented here. An improvement to the EKV charge-based model is proposed in the form of a more accurate charge\u2013voltage relationship.

Low frequency noise of 50V N-and P-channel HV-MOSFETs was measured over a large range of gate and drain bias conditions. Drain voltage steps were chosen very small in linear region while enough points were also measured in saturation regime up to 20V. Recent work on characterization and modelling on flicker noise of HV devices proved that while the overall noise is mostly dominated by the noise originating in the channel, the drift-region-generated noise is apparent only in linear operation especially in strong inversion region of long channel devices. In order this to be clear, this work focuses on the behavior of flicker noise vs. drain bias for all inversion regime.",

SPICE parameters of transistors, including DC, AC, 1/f noise and matching parameters, are mandatory for design and simulation of such circuits. However CMOS foundries do not provide full sets of MOSFET parameters for simulation at temperature lower than-55 C (\u2248 220 K). So these MOSFET parameters must be extracted prior to circuit simulation. Furthermore the used MOSFET model must address the important weak and moderate inversion regimes where most of the transistors of the CMOS readout circuits are operating. In this work we use a specific model based on the EKV 2.6 compact charge model formalism [1]. This model was previously described and applied to different CMOS bulk processes such as 0.7 \u00b5m/5 V [2], 0.5-0.35 \u00b5m/3.3 V [3] and 0.21 \u00b5m/1.8 V [4] from different foundries optimized for room temperature operation. The model\u2019s performance is described in this paper for two commercial processes from the same foundry, namely a 0.35 \u00b5m/3.3 V and a 0.21 \u00b5m/1.8 V CMOS technology. As noise is a key concern in analog circuits, experimental results on the low frequency noise parameters for both NMOS and PMOS transistors at low temperature from these two processes are also presented.",
