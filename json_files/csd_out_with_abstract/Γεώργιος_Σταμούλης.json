The described platform serves and facilitates the structured data transferring between the Operational Vessel's unstable environment and the Office one. In addition, it can apply business processes not only to office side but also to Vessel's remote environment. \"InfoNet\" platform is multipurpose and can interface with multiple components and modules of any ERP, CRM or other structured platform that the organization uses in both sides (vessels and/or Office). We are using the \"InfoNet\" platform for various implementations. The platform is composed of two main modules, e-Forms (e-Applications) and e-SMS (e-Documents). All gathered data, apart the operation usage, have been also used for further analysis. We have used the produced information of the above data in combination \u2026",

            "Abstract": "As process geometries shrink below 45 nm, accurate and efficient gate-level timing analysis becomes even more challenging. Modern VLSI interconnects are more resistive, signals no longer resemble saturated ramps, and gate input pins exhibit a significant Miller effect. Over recent years, the semiconductor industry has adopted current source models (CSMs) for accurate gate modeling. Industrial gate models, however, are precharacterized assuming capacitive loads, which poses significant challenges to the approximation of the highly resistive load interconnect with an effective capacitance (   ). In fact, most related works are either computationally expensive or unable to approximate the output slew. Furthermore, they require additional precharacterization and ignore the Miller effect. In this article, we present an iterative methodology for fast and accurate gate delay estimation. The proposed approach accurately \u2026",

In this paper, we present a moment-matching method which is based on the extended Krylov subspace and exploits the superposition property in order to deal with many terminals.

In addition, anxiety is caused due to a stimulus that makes people feeling weak, because of an overall insecurity regarding what is going to happen. The difference between stress and anxiety lies in the fact that stress is an internal emotion as opposed to external psycho-compressive factors that constitute stress (ie such as a loss of a beloved person, a natural disaster, pressure in working conditions etc.). In this paper, we design, propose and test a wireless sensor system for measuring and transmitting biometric magnitudes of heart rate and blood oximetry. Parts of our system can be easily attached to a set of persons, who take part in an experimental process of controlled stress and anxiety environment and record stress biosignals.

To accomplish this goal, designers take into account the timing of the circuit critical path that provides an upper limit for the clock rate. However, that limit imposes heavy performance penalties on the design, since the critical path is not frequently excited during runtime. In contrast with the prevailing methodology, the better-thanworst-case (BTWC) paradigm treats the circuit timing requirements in a more flexible way, as it does not commit to serve the demands of the worst-case scenario. In this work we develop a novel timing analysis methodology inspired by the BTWC approach. Instead of performing the standard critical path analysis, we focus on analyzing the timing requirements of each operation separately.

The efficient simulation of the inductive effects requires sparsification of the dense inductance matrix, or its inverse (called reluctance matrix) which is diagonally dominant and more amenable to sparsification. However, direct truncation of matrix entries below a certain threshold introduces unacceptable error in transient analysis for the high sparsity ratios we are interested in. In this paper, we present a graph sparsification algorithm that preserves the eigenvalues of the reluctance matrix and results to sparse approximations that offer better and bounded accuracy in transient analysis. Experimental results indicate that sparsity ratios over 99% can be attained with a negligible error in transient analysis.",

Efficient clustering among sensor nodes seems a promising solution to evenly balance energy consumption and thus extend node and network lifetime. One of the most dominant clustering algorithms for energy efficient cluster formation is LEACH, because it balances node energy consumption. However, stochastic cluster head election of LEACH poses problems. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm, named Minimum Weighted Clustering Algorithm (MWCLA) and compare its effectiveness with LEACH. MWCLA functions as follows: 1) Selects cluster heads based on cost criterion and quantifies the suitability of candidate cluster head by applying weights and 2) Rotates cluster head roles among nodes in a deterministic way, based on residual energy levels. In our simulations, we compare MWCLA with \u2026",

The main aim of time series forecasting is to obtain reasonably accurate forecasts of future data from analyzing records of data. In the paper, we proposed an ensemble-based forecast combination methodology as an alternative approach to forecasting methods for time series prediction. The ensemble learning technique combines various learning algorithms, including SOGA (structure optimization genetic algorithm)-based FCMs, RCGA (real coded genetic algorithm)-based FCMs, efficient and adaptive ANNs architectures, and a hybrid structure of FCM-ANN, recently proposed for time series forecasting. All ensemble algorithms execute according to the one-step prediction regime. The particular forecast combination approach was specifically selected due to the advanced features of each ensemble component, where the findings of this work evinced the effectiveness of this approach, in terms of prediction accuracy, when compared against other well-known, independent forecasting approaches, such as ANNs or FCMs, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm as well.

The proposed architecture achieves high performance and can satisfy quad full high definition (QFHD) (3840middot2160@150Hz) coding. The transforms are implemented using only add and shift operations, which reduces the computation overhead. A modification in the quantization equations representation is suggested to remove the absolute value and resign operation stages overhead. Additionally, a post-scale Hadamard transform computation is presented. The architecture can achieve a reduction of about 20% in power consumption, compared to existing implementations.",

The aim of our study was to determine COVID-19's neuroinvasive potential in the community using the survey results from Carnegie Mellon University's Delphi Group.Methods:Data from December 2020's responders that had been tested for COVID-19 and received a positive/negative diagnosis (n= 48,629; 12,117 COVID-19 positive) were used in this study. Among available symptom data, we defined COVID-19 associated potential neuroinvasion (COVID 18/PNI; PNI) as the simultaneous presence of headache, fever and nausea. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of PNI among comorbidities, sex a nd age.Results:COVID-19/PNI was detected 1212 responders. A binary logistic regression model accounting for other symptoms, age, gender and comorbidities revealed that the major determinant of PNI was self-described immune system compromise, comprising the entirety of PNI (1,212/1,212). A multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for other symptoms, age and comorbidities revealed that PNI affected responders reporting all comorbidities except heart disease, sleep disturbances, sore throat, olfactory/gustatory symptoms, age between 65-74 years and non-binary gender/other gender (p-value< 0.05). Out of these responders, only 30 (0.2%) were hospitalized.Conclusion:Our study reveals a vulnerable population among in COVID-19/PNI affects immunocompromised patients, known to have subtle or atypical symptoms even in bona fide \u2026",

MOR techniques based on balanced truncation (BT) offer very good error estimates and can provide compact models with any desired accuracy over the whole range of frequencies (from dc to infinity). However, in most applications the circuit is only intended to operate at specific frequency windows, which means that the reduced-order model can become unnecessarily large to achieve approximation over all frequencies. In this article, we present a frequency-limited approach which, combined with an efficient low-rank sparse implementation of the extended Krylov subspace (EKS) method, can handle large input models and provably leads to reduced-order models that are either smaller or exhibit better accuracy than full-frequency BT.",

Cells must be placed inside rows without overlaps and without exceeding row boundaries. A final solution is obtained using at least two stages. In the first stage, often called global placement, cells are distributed so as to optimize the target function. This initial distribution might violate problem constraints, therefore at a second stage often referred to as detailed placement cells are assigned to rows and overlaps are alleviated.

The new method requires only a small amount of voltage values at the received eye center, which can be generated by running circuit/system level simulations or measuring fabricated I/O circuits, to predict link BERs. Unlike conventional techniques, no simplifying assumptions on link noise and interference sources are required making this approach extremely portable to any communication system operating with very low BER. Our experimental results show that the BER estimates from the proposed methodology are on the same order of magnitude as traditional time domain, transient eye diagram simulations for links with BER of 10 \u22126 \u2026",

In this direction, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) which constitute a powerful Neuro-fuzzy quasiquantitative modelling methodology, are the right candidate to address both complexity and non-linearity with respect to complex systems\u2019 behavior. Additionally, they can handle the lack of reliable quantitative data along with the presence of uncertain information, in terms of knowledge representation and reasoning during the simulation process. Moreover, they seem to be a promising tool to incorporate human experience and other existing knowledge as well as new aggregation participatory approaches for aggregating numerous individual models designed by experts or stakeholders, that will produce more reliable models for decision-making. Afterall, FCMs have found extreme and extensive applicability in multiple research domains which is proved by the enormous list of publications in the literature, over the last decade.In the context of policy-making, energy demand forecasting is another significant and challenging task for tailoring efficient policies towards energy sustainability management and planning. Thus, the selection of accurate forecasting techniques is important for policy-makers to apply precise forecasts highly essential for supporting them in choosing the right strategies.

However, current cognitive developmental neuropsychological studies suggest that not only the core numerical but also the cognitive skills of children with developmental dyscalculia present deficits. The main aim of the proposed research protocol was to construct a battery of six tests that can be delivered by computer in order to screen children\u2019s arithmetic and cognitive skills. The hypothesis of the study was that children that are already diagnosed by paper and pencil tests as dyscalculic will present lower scores and larger time latencies not only in mathematical but also in cognitive tasks. A total of 134 right handed children (74 male and 60 female, age range 8\u201312 years) participated in this study. The students with disorders in mathematics (N= 67, 37 male and 30 female age range 8\u201312 years M= 10.15 SD= 1.10) had a statement of dyscalculia after assessment at a Centre of Diagnosis, Assessment and Support, as it is required by Greek Law. A comparison group without any learning disabilities was individually matched with the dyscalculic group according to age, sex and grade (N= 67, 37 male and 30 female, age range 8\u201312 years old, M= 10.24 SD= 1.12). Statistical analysis revealed that children with dyscalculia had statistically significant lower mean scores of correct answers and larger time latencies in all tasks compared to their average peers that participated in the comparison group.

The detection of fraud has been a major concern for the banking industry due to the high impact on banks\u2019 revenues and reputation. Fraud can be related with an augmented financial risk, which is often underestimated until it is too late. Recently, deep learning models have been introduced to detect and forecast possible fraud transactions with increased efficiency compared to the conventional machine learning methods and statistics. Such methods gain significant popularity due to their ability to estimate the unknown distribution of the collected data, thus, increasing their capability of detecting more complex fraud events.

            "Abstract": "Efficient full-chip thermal simulation is among the most challenging problems facing the EDA industry today, due to the need for solution of very large systems of equations that require unreasonably long computational times. However, in most cases, temperature is not required to be computed at every point of the IC but only at certain hotspots, in order to assess the circuit's compliance with thermal specifications. This makes the thermal analysis problem amenable to Model Order Reduction techniques. System-theoretic techniques like Balanced Truncation offer very reliable bounds for the approximation error, which can be used to control the order and accuracy of the reduced models during creation, at the expense of greater computational complexity to create them. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient low-rank Balanced Truncation algorithm based on extended Krylov subspace method, which \u2026",

To address such issue researchers have proposed the near-data processing (NDP) paradigm in which the instruction execution is moved to the DRAM die thus, lowering the data movement between the processor and the DRAM. Previous NDP works focus on specific application types and thus the general purpose application execution paradigm is neglected. In this work we propose an NDP methodology for low power general purpose loop acceleration. For this reason we design and implement a hardware loop accelerator from the ground up to improve the throughput and lower the power consumption of general purpose loops.

Using the main parts of this design flow, in a system comprising hundreds of million gates, complicated mechanisms are shown to determine the performance of the system. With increasing number of dies, timing is shown to exhibit 4 distinct regions, where either temperature or voltage drop is the dominant limiting factor. Power consumption does not scale monotonically with increasing die number. As a consequence, optimum system performance is in no way achieved by minimizing temperature and voltage drop, as is assumed in the literature so far. The \u2026",

The flux-density of BZ is proportional to the DC component of the output signal, whereas the BX and BY components are proportional to the first harmonic of the output signal.

This function help us to control in MatLab environment the equipotential lines and to monitor the changes in biasing conditions.

Policymakers are in the quest of a powerful and easy-to-use tool for representing the perceived causal structure of a complex system that could help them choose and develop the right strategies. In this context, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) can serve as a soft computing method for modelling human knowledge and developing quantitative dynamic models. FCM-based modelling includes the aggregation of knowledge from a variety of sources involving multiple stakeholders, thus offering a more reliable final model. The average aggregation method for weighted interconnections among concepts is widely used in FCM modelling. In this research, we applied the OWA (ordered weighted averaging) learning operators in aggregating FCM weights, assigned by various participants/ stakeholders. Our case study involves a complex phenomenon of poverty eradication and socio-economic development strategies in rural areas under the DAY-NRLM ( Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -National Rural Livelihoods Mission) in India.

It is appropriate for differential, absolute, and ratiometric capacitance measurements, and shows robustness against interconnection parasitics, transistor dimensional mismatch, and process variations, which are an important feature in the case of sensor-die CMOS postprocessing",

Therefore, the Soft Error Rate (SER) evaluation represents a necessary process to design radiation-hardened ICs. A SPICE-oriented electrical masking analysis, combined with a TCAD characterization process, contributes to an accurate SER estimation. The impact of a Static Timing Analysis (STA) methodology on SER and the consideration of the actual interconnect delay are discussed.

Edge Computing (EC) can offer the necessary basis for storing locally the collected data and provide the required analytics on top of them limiting the response time.

A malicious user could easily capture a node and tamper the applications running on it, in order to perform different types of attacks. In this paper, we propose a 3-Tier Security Framework composed by physical security schemes, cryptography of communication channels and live forensics protection techniques that allows for secure WSN deployments. Each of the abovementioned techniques maximizes the security levels leading to a tamper proof sensor node. Even if the physical protection of the nodes is bypassed which is common in wireless sensor attacks, the attacker must surpass 2 more security tiers in order to perform a valid attack on the underlying network. By applying the proposed security framework, secure communication between nodes is guaranteed, identified captured nodes are silenced and their destructive effect on the rest of the network infrastructure is minimized due to the early measures applied. Our main concern is to propose a framework that balances its attributes between robustness, as long as security is concerned and cost effective implementation as far as resources (energy consumption) are concerned.",

The aim of our study was to determine COVID-19 syndromic phenotypes in a data driven manner using survey results extracted from Carnegie Mellon University9s Delphi Group. Methods Monthly survey results (>1 million responders per month; 320.326 responders with positive COVID-19 test and disease duration <30 days were included in this study) were used sequentially in identifying and validating COVID-19 syndromic phenotypes. Logistic Regression Weighted Multiple Correspondence Analysis (LRW MCA) was used as a preprocessing procedure, in order to weight and transform symptoms recorded by the survey to eigenspace coordinates (i.e. object scores per case / dimension), with a goal of capturing a total variance of >75%. These scores along with symptom duration were subsequently used by the Two Step Clustering algorithm to produce symptom clusters. Post-hoc logistic regression models adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities and confirmatory linear principal components analyses were used to further explore the data. The model created from 66.165 included responders in August, was subsequently validated in data from March to December 2020. Results Five validated COVID 19 syndromes were identified in August: 1.

Since latency is a key issue in data stream processing environments, the majority of the works existing in the literature focus on minimizing the latency experienced by the users. The aforementioned minimization takes place by assigning the data stream processing components close to data sources. Server consolidation is also a key issue for drastically reducing energy consumption in computing systems. Unfortunately, energy consumption and latency are two objective functions that may be in conflict with each other. Therefore, when the target function is to minimize energy consumption, the delay experienced by users may be considerable high, and the opposite.

Measurement sensitivity and span are easily regulated over a wide range of values by setting one-single design parameter. Attention is paid to avoid p\u2013n junction formation in order to improve the sensor robustness against temperature increase and allow high-temperature post-processing without doping profile degradation. The presented design allows the implementation of an ordinary p-well CMOS post-process.

Since the heavy lifting regarding processing is performed by global placers, fast legalization solutions are protruded in state-of-the-art design flows.

The heart of circuit simulation relies on the solution of huge systems resulting after the modelling using Modified Nodal Analysis. Matrices arising in those systems are sparse Symmetric Diagonally Dominant (SDD) matrices, and as a result, iterative methods for efficiently manipulating them are very crucial to the performance of the simulation. In recent years, the emphasis has been placed on preconditioning methods which reduce the number of iterations for solving such systems, while significant advancements have been accomplished in efficient implementations on massively parallel architectures like GPUs.

The JA model provides precise results in the case of isotropic, polycrystalline, multidomain magnetic devices, where flux-reversal is governed by pinning mechanisms. Dynamic response of such devices, including Eddy-current loss and magnetic resonance, can also be accurately modeled. However, JA theory is not applied for three-dimensional (3-D) magnetization simulations and does not account for anisotropy that affects severely hysteresis curves of single-domain, thin-film devices, which are usually incorporated in miniature inductive sensors and actuators. In that case, the Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) theory can be applied, which, however, does not account for dynamic response and incremental energy loss. In this work, we employ a virtual 3 \u2026",

Policymakers are in the quest of a powerful and easy-to-use tool for representing the perceived causal structure of a complex system that could help them choose and develop the right strategies. In this context, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) can serve as a soft computing method for modelling human knowledge and developing quantitative dynamic models. FCM-based modelling includes the aggregation of knowledge from a variety of sources involving multiple stakeholders, thus offering a more reliable final model. The average aggregation method for weighted interconnections among concepts is widely used in FCM modelling. In this research, we applied the OWA (ordered weighted averaging) learning operators in aggregating FCM weights, assigned by various participants/stakeholders. Our case study involves a complex phenomenon of poverty eradication and socio-economic development strategies in rural areas under the DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission) in India.

The bulk of a typical syllabus (eg, in the case of Greece) for computer programming courses at 5th and 6th grade primary school, consists of teaching structured programming concepts. While the comprehension of basic program flow concepts such as branch instructions and loops is of paramount importance, overextending the teaching of the basics may lead to students losing their interest due to lack of challenge. On the other hand, in a mixed classroom environment there exist both students with substantial skills in modern computer technology and others with smaller such experience, eg, due to societal and economic factors. To avoid discouraging both the talented pupils by re-visiting the same topics and the less experienced ones by not providing an alternative way of learning, we investigate instructing advanced computer programming concepts in a playful way using pair programming. Results reveal that teaching advanced programming concepts using pair programming can improve the overall programming skills of mixed classroom students.",

Given differences in culture, available infrastructures, as well as the age pupils are introduced to computer science, forming a computer science curriculum still remains a challenge. Towards this end, this study focuses on exploring the potential merits of introducing concurrent programming concepts early in the learning process. The basic premise is that although concurrent programming at its full details is a rather advanced topic even at university level, it is everyday practice to perform two or more tasks simultaneously that might need (or not) some sort of synchronization. Therefore, the tutor can capitalize on everyday experience to explain basic concepts on concurrency. Such correlation between life experience and concurrent programming challenges may expand the cognitive functions of the pupils and provide them with further background to improve analytical thinking. The proposed curriculum for fifth and sixth grade primary school was adopted in seven classes in Greece. Results indicate that uninitiated to programming pupils at the age of ten (fifth grade) were able to comprehend basic concurrency topics, while pupils at the age of eleven (sixth grade) with some programming familiarity were able to understand more advanced concepts.",

High precision models are generally used to confirm logic behavior and estimate power dissipation, which has become an extremely important design parameter. Unfortunately high precision analysis is expensive in computer execution time, and there is always a trade-off between accuracy and speed. This work proposes a new circuit simulation approach by storing a set of pre-characterized transition configurations for each standard library cell in a lookup table. The lookup table contains information about the voltage and the current transient waveform produced by SPICE simulation. The method achieves good accuracy levels for yielding the total or partial current waveform of a circuit in significantly less time compared to SPICE or other commercial tools.",

            "Abstract": "Participatory modelling is an emerging approach in the decision-making process through which stakeholders contribute to the representation of the perceived causal linkages of a complex system. The use of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) for participatory modelling helps policy-makers develop dynamic quantitative models for strategising development interventions. The aggregation of knowledge from multiple stakeholders provides consolidated and more reliable results. Average aggregation is the most common aggregation method used in FCMs-based modelling for weighted interconnections between concepts. This paper proposes a new aggregation method using learning OWA (ordered weighted averaging) operators for aggregating FCM weights assigned by various stakeholders. Besides, we report a comparative analysis of \u2018OWA learning aggregation\u2019 with the conventional average aggregation method, while evaluating the theory of change for the world\u2019s most extensive poverty alleviation programme in India. The results of the FCMWizard web-based tool show that the proposed method provides an opportunity to policy-makers for evaluating outcomes of proposed policies while addressing social resilience and economic mobility.",

            "Abstract": "Efficient full-chip thermal simulation is among the most challenging problems facing the EDA industry today, especially for modern 3D integrated circuits, due to the huge linear systems resulting from thermal modeling approaches that require unreasonably long computational times. While the formulation problem, by applying a thermal equivalent circuit, is prevalent and can be easily constructed, the corresponding 3D equations network has an undesirable time-consuming numerical simulation. Direct linear solvers are not capable of handling such huge problems, and iterative methods are the only feasible approach. In this paper, we propose a computationally-efficient iterative method with a parallel preconditioned technique that exploits the resources of massively-parallel architectures such as Graphic Processor Units (GPUs). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a speedup of 2.2\u00d7 in CPU execution and a 26.93\u00d7 speedup in GPU execution over the state-of-the-art iterative method.

The construction of the current space is performed via plain simulation and statistical extrapolation using results from extreme value theory. The method overcomes limitations of past methods which either relied on loosely bounding the worst-case voltage drop, or abstracted the current space in a vague and incomplete set of bound-type constraints.

These systems and their optimal exploitation require an effective supply chain management system, such as design of the network, collection, storage, or transportation of this energy resource, without disregarding a country\u2019s certain socio-economic and political conditions. In Brazil, the adoption of photovoltaic solar energy has been motivated not only by the energy matrix diversification but also from the shortages, problems, and barriers that the Brazilian energy sector has faced, lately. However, PSE development is affected by various factors with high uncertainty, such as political, social, economic, and environmental, that include critical operational sustainability issues. Thus, an elaborate modelling of energy management and a well-structured decision support process are needed to enhance the performance efficiency of Brazilian PSE supply chain management. This study focuses on the investigation of certain factors and their influence on the development of the Brazilian PSE with the help of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps.

The output of the first phase might violate alignment and overlap constraints, therefore in a second phase, called legalization, the target is to restore constraint violations while incurring minimal changes compared to global placement. Since legalization may also be a subcomponent of iterative global placers, efficient algorithms both in terms of solution quality and running time are of paramount importance.

A rigorous formulation based on linear circuit theory is established for the relevant constrained optimization problem, so that the resultant network occupies the minimum possible area under specific voltage drop constraints at all IC functional blocks. The necessary maximum current estimates for the optimization procedure are accurately obtained - by statistical means - from recent advances in the field of extreme value theory. Experimental tests include the design of power grid for a choice of different topologies and voltage drop tolerances in a typical benchmark circuit.",

In static timing analysis, clock frequency is set in accord with the worst-case delay in the circuit operation, regardless of the possible circuit inputs. Dynamic timing analysis approaches consider variations in the inputs, obtaining more accurate values for the clock speed. However, such methodologies are in general very slow. Recent research on static timing analysis is focused on better-than-worst-case algorithms, which attempt to introduce a dynamic flavor to the static approach. The work presented in this paper is concentrated on a certain aspect of better-than-worst-case timing analysis for processor design, obtaining a more optimistic clock speed than the one produced by pure static analysis. Certain variations of the inputs to the processor circuit are considered, in order to overcome the limitations \u2026",

Unfortunately, these result in a considerably higher encoder complexity that adversely affects speed and power, which are both significant for the mobile multimedia applications targeted by the standard. Therefore, it is of high importance to design architectures that minimize the speed and power overhead of the prediction modes. In this paper we present a new algorithm, and the logic transformations that enable it, that can replace the standard Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) approach in the two main prediction modes, and provide a power efficient hardware implementation without perceivable degradation in coding efficiency or video quality.",

The study and evaluation of the impact of such errors on ICs functionality, as well as the pursuit of techniques to mitigate Soft Error Rate (SER), tend to become an essential part of the design process. This paper presents a Monte-Carlo-based SER estimation method, taking into account all masking mechanisms, which determines the vulnerable areas of a circuit based on layout information.

The simplest, yet fastest method in the literature is the Tetris algorithm which is commonly used as a performance yardstick for other more efficient but computationally demanding methods. In this paper we propose and evaluate standalone variations to the basic Tetris algorithm that aim at significantly improving its performance sometimes at the expense of running time.

            "Abstract": "In standard cell placement, a circuit is given consisting of cells with a standard height,(different widths) and the problem is to place the cells in the standard rows of a chip area so that no overlaps occur and some target function is optimized. The process is usually split into at least two phases. In a first pass, a global placement algorithm distributes the cells across the circuit area, while in the second step, a legalization algorithm aligns the cells to the standard rows of the power grid and alleviates any overlaps. While a few legalization schemes have been proposed in the past for the basic problem formulation, few obstacle-aware extensions exist. Furthermore, they usually provide extreme trade-offs between time performance and optimization efficiency. In this paper, we focus on the legalization step, in the presence of pre-allocated modules acting as obstacles. We extend two known algorithmic approaches, namely Tetris and Abacus, so that they become obstacle-aware. Furthermore, we propose a parallelization scheme to tackle the computational complexity. The experiments illustrate that the proposed parallelization method achieves a good scalability, while it also efficiently prunes the search space resulting in a superlinear speedup. Furthermore, this time performance comes at only a small cost (sometimes even improvement) concerning the typical optimization metrics. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Algorithms for standard cell placement legalization have attracted significant research efforts in the past. A prominent member of this category is the Tetris algorithm which is a simple and particularly fast method for legalizing an initial placement containing overlaps. In the relevant literature sophisticated legalization schemes were proposed using Tetris as a performance yardstick. In order to achieve better performance such schemes usually sacrifice the fast running time of Tetris by a large margin. In this paper we turn our focus on simple Tetris variations that improve performance without seriously compromising running time. Specifically, we present five generic heuristic variations of the initial Tetris algorithm. Through experimental evaluation we conclude on the merits of each approach.",

Therefore it is very important to design video architectures that minimize the cost of the prediction modes in terms of area, power dissipation and design complexity.

Chip designers apply corner-based analysis and add guard-bands to design parameters in order to take into account the impact of process variation on timing. However, the aforementioned techniques are either too slow as the number of design parameters proliferates with the integration of more components into a chip or inaccurate due to the assumption that the worst case delay resides at the corners of design parameters. In this paper, we present a novel statistical methodology, which relies on Extreme Value Theory (EVT), to estimate the worst case delay of VLSI circuits under variations in gate/interconnect parameters.

In order to find the true worst case voltage drop that a power net of a design might suffer, the designer would have to check the voltage drops that occur from the simulation of all possible input vector pairs of a design. This is a prohibitive amount of simulations for modern ICs that have hundreds of inputs. Consequently, designers face two basic challenges, fast and accurate estimation of worst case voltage-drop and accurate modeling of the power distribution network.

In this work, a Monte-Carlo simulation-based methodology is presented taking into consideration the masking mechanisms and placement information. The proposed SER estimation tool exploits the results of a Single Event Transient (SET) pulse characterization process with HSPICE to obtain an accurate assessment of circuit vulnerability to radiation. A new metric, called Glitch Latching Probability, which represents the impact of the masking effects on a SET, is introduced to identify gate sensitivity and, finally, experimental results on a set of ISCAS\u201989 benchmarks are presented.

In this way the ALE server becomes an Auto-ID instead of RFID middleware, offering to capturing applications a unified view of the statements performed in a specific plant or warehouse, regardless of the technology used to capture these statements. The mechanism defines the notion of the generalized EPC, along with its corresponding generalized EPC pattern.",

            "Abstract": "The problem of optimum design of tree-shaped power distribution networks with respect to the voltage drop effect is addressed in this paper. An approach for the width adjustment of the power lines supplying the circuit's major functional blocks is formulated, so that the network occupies the minimum possible area under specific voltage drop constraints at all blocks. The optimization approach is based on precise maximum current estimates derived by statistical means from recent advances in the field of extreme value theory. Experimental tests include the design of power grid for a choice of different topologies and voltage drop tolerances in a typical benchmark circuit.",

            "Abstract": "Dyslexia is the most common learning disability and it is characterized by a persistent failure to acquire reading skills despite normal intelligence, adequate cognitive abilities, conventional instruction and sociocultural opportunities. The main target of the present study was to extend our previous dyslexia screener web application by constructing and embedding new tasks. An extended battery of tests was implemented, which included sentence comprehension, auditory working memory, syllable composition and word explanation skills. Moreover, another aim of the study was to incorporate these tests into our existing web application. Statistical analysis revealed that dyslexic children presented lower correct responses (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and larger time latency (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in comparison to their average peers in all four tasks of the web application. Additionally, the main purpose of delivering a screening procedure \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Fuzzy cognitive maps are graph-based models mostly constructed in a participatory setting either by experts to given domains or by a large number of stakeholders in various scientific areas of interest. Usually each expert or stakeholder designs individually a FCM based on his/her knowledge or opinion for the specific application domain. For scenario analysis and decision-making purposes, an overall FCM for the specific problem needs to be constructed, aggregating all individual FCMs designed by the experts and/or stakeholders. The average aggregation method for weighted interconnections among concepts is the most common method in FCM modeling, which is quite simple, regardless the inherent uncertainty induced by the different experts\u2019 or stakeholders\u2019 opinions. The aim of this research work is two-fold:(i) to propose an alternative aggregation method based on learning Ordered Weighted Average \u2026",
