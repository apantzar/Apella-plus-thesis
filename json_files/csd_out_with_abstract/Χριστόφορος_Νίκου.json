The locations of the candidate nuclei centroids in the image are detected with morphological analysis and they are refined in a second step, which incorporates a priori knowledge about the circumference of each nucleus. The elimination of the undesirable artifacts is achieved in two steps: the application of a distance-dependent rule on the resulted centroids; and the application of classification algorithms. In our method, we have examined the performance of an unsupervised (fuzzy C-means) and a supervised (support vector machines) classification technique. In both classification techniques, the effect of the refinement step improves the performance of the clustering algorithm.

It must be noted that the initial approximation of each snake position is obtained automatically, without any observer interference. For the final determination of the nuclei in our images, we perform a fuzzy C-means clustering, using a data set of patterns based on the characteristics of the area enclosed by the final position of the GVF snakes.

In this work, we propose to compute the initial histogram of the target using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) rather than impulses generated by simple counting. This mixture plays the role of a weighting function, in the histograms computed in subsequent frames, in order to make them smoother and increase the overlapping area with the initial histogram.

This model exploits the Dirichlet compound multinomial (DCM) probability density to model the mixing proportions (i.e., the probabilities of class labels) and a Gauss-Markov random field (MRF) on the Dirichlet parameters to impose smoothness. The main advantages of this model are two. First, it explicitly models the mixing proportions as probability vectors and simultaneously imposes spatial smoothness. Second, it results in closed form parameter updates using a maximum  a posteriori  (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Previous efforts on this problem used models that did not model the mixing proportions explicitly as probability vectors or could not be solved exactly requiring either time consuming Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or inexact variational \u2026",

The method relies on a principle due to Helmholtz stating that every large deviation from uniform noise should be perceptible, provided that the deviation is generated by an a contrario model of geometric structures. By assuming local linearity, we first employ a robust algorithm to model the local manifold of the corrupted data by local line segments. Our rationale is that long line segments should not be expected in a noisy set of points. This assumption leads to the modeling of the lengths of the line segments by a Pareto distribution, which is the adopted a contrario model for the observations.

To answer this question, we propose the fusion of RGB and depth information in a double-stream architecture. More specifically, RGB and depth images are fed into two separate networks by extracting features, which are subsequently fused at an intermediate layer of the ConvNet, implementing input-level fusion, feature-level fusion and score-level fusion.

The main idea is that a Gaussian component in the reference image corresponds to a Gaussian component in the image to be registered. If the images are correctly registered the total distance between the corresponding components is minimum. An advantage of the proposed method is that it may handle multidimensional (vector valued) images where histogram-based methods such as the widely used mutual information is not tractable due to the high dimension of the data. Also, experimental results indicate that, even in the case of images presenting low SNR, the proposed algorithm compares favorably to the histogram-based \u2026",

Specifically, we propose a method for age classification which integrates a frontalization algorithm before feature extraction.

Local as well as global motion in the low-resolution images is considered. The overall scheme consists of two steps. At first, the low-resolution images are registered by establishing correspondences between image features. The second step is to fine-tune the registration parameters along with the high-resolution image estimation, using the maximization of mutual information criterion.

Slice similarity is computed using the distance transform measure in both directions.

We extend FID by relaxing the Gaussian hypothesis of the related inception features and extend it for non-Gaussian, multimodal distributions. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are used to model data and model inception features, and the Wasserstein distance is employed as a pdf matching metric. We show that the proposed WInD metric inherits the desirable features of FID and correlates well with actual GAN performance.

According to this model, the pixel labels are random variables and a smoothness prior is imposed on them. The main novelty of this work is a new family of smoothness priors for the label probabilities in spatially variant mixture models. These Gauss-Markov random field-based priors allow all their parameters to be estimated in closed form via the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using the expectation-maximization methodology. Thus, it is possible to introduce priors with multiple parameters that adapt to different aspects of the data. Numerical experiments are presented where the proposed MAP algorithms were tested in various image segmentation scenarios. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed segmentation scheme compares favorably to both standard and previous spatially \u2026",

Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in addressing document indexing using word spotting which is reflected by the continuously increasing number of approaches. However, there exist very few comprehensive studies which analyze the various aspects of a word spotting system. This work aims to review the recent approaches as well as fill the gaps in several topics with respect to the related works.

These variations are computed in closed form by minimizing the differential EMD between Gaussian mixtures, yielding a very fast algorithm with high accuracy, without recurring to the EM algorithm in each frame. Moreover, we also propose a framework to handle occlusions, where the prediction for the object's location is forwarded to an adaptive Kalman filter whose parameters are estimated on line by the motion model already observed.

The statistically learned deformable model represents the relative location of head (skull and scalp) and brain surfaces in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) and accommodates their significant variability across different individuals. The head and brain surfaces of each volume are parameterized by the amplitudes of the vibration modes of a deformable spherical mesh. For a given MRI in the training set, a vector containing the largest vibration modes describing the head and the brain is created. This random vector is statistically constrained by retaining the most significant variation modes of its Karhunen-Loeve expansion on the training population.

This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a new model, called robust incremental hidden conditional random field (RI-HCRF). A hidden Markov model (HMM) is created for each observation paired with an action label and its parameters are defined by the potentials of the original HCRF graph. Starting from an initial number of hidden states and increasing their number incrementally, the Viterbi path is computed for each HMM. The method seeks for a sequence of hidden states, where each variable participates in a maximum number of optimal paths. Thereby, variables with low participation in optimal paths are rejected.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method to combine the advantages of both multi-task and curriculum learning in a visual attribute classification framework. Individual tasks are grouped based on their correlation so that two groups of strongly and weakly correlated tasks are formed. The two groups of tasks are learned in a curriculum learning setup by transferring the acquired knowledge from the strongly to the weakly correlated. The learning process within each group is performed in a multitask classification setup. The proposed method learns better and converges faster than learning all the tasks in a typical multi-task learning paradigm.

Additionally, since several measurements will not be available at test time in a real-life scenario, we opted for the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm. During training, we used as features, ratios from all the available anthropometric measurements, whereas at test time only ratios of measurable (i.e., observable) quantities were used. We show that by using the LUPI framework, the estimation of soft biometric characteristics such as gender is possible.

            "Abstract": "An algorithm for modeling a set of unordered two-dimensional points by line segments is presented. The points are modeled by highly eccentric ellipses, and line segments are extracted by the major axes of these elongated ellipses. At first, a single ellipse is fitted to points which is then iteratively split to a large number of highly eccentric ellipses to cover the set of points. Then, a merge process follows in order to combine neighboring ellipses with almost collinear major axes to reduce the complexity of the model. Experimental results on various databases show that the proposed scheme is an efficient technique for modeling unordered sets of points and shapes by line segments. A computer vision application of the method is also presented regarding the detection of retinal fundus image features, such as end-points, junctions, and crossovers.",

The main contribution of our method is that the trajectories are automatically extracted from the image sequence and they are provided directly to a model-based clustering approach. In most other methodologies, the latter constitutes a difficult part since the resulting feature trajectories have a short duration, as the key points disappear and reappear due to occlusion, illumination, viewpoint changes and noise. We present here a sparse, translation invariant regression mixture model for clustering trajectories of variable length. The overall scheme is converted into a maximum a posteriori approach, where the Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for estimating the model parameters.

This procedure is very important as it provides fundamental information for the detection of cancerous or precancerous lesions. For this reason several algorithms have been proposed in order to classify normal and abnormal cells in such images. However, it is a common phenomenon that each research group usually creates its own dataset of images, as well-established datasets are not publicly available. To overcome this obstacle and to assist the research progress in this field, we present an annotated image database of Pap smear images, in which the cells are categorized in five different classes, depending on their cytomorphological features.

In pursuing it, a 3D probabilistic physically based deformable model is defined. The statistically learned deformable model captures the spatial relationships between the different objects surfaces, together with their shape variations. The structures of interest in each volume are parameterized by the amplitudes of the vibration modes of a deformable spherical mesh. For a given 3D image in the training set, a vector containing the largest vibration modes describing the desired object is created. This random vector is statistically constrained by retaining the most significant variation modes of its Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion on the considered population. The surfaces of the modeled structures thus deform according to the variability observed in the training set. A preliminary \u2026",

In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for the separation of the cytoplasm area of overlapping cells. The proposed method is based on the fact that in isolated cells the pixels of the cytoplasm exhibit similar features and the cytoplasm area is homogeneous. Thus, the observation of intensity changes in extended subareas of the cytoplasm indicates the existence of overlapping cells.

The method relies on the modeling of the manifold of a shape by line segments. Then, encoding is performed by collecting the characteristic features of each line segment, namely the starting and ending points and the number of points contributing to the computation of the corresponding segment. The reconstruction of the shape may be obtained by uniform sampling of points from each line segment computed in the encoding process. Experimental analysis demonstrates that in case of employing a robust and efficient line segment detection algorithm, the proposed encoding/decoding scheme exhibits high compression rates, compared to widely used lossless compression methods, while providing low distortion values.",

The algorithm models both the object to be tracked and local background elements and handles scale changes in target's appearance. It is experimentally demonstrated that the algorithm runs in real time, and it is at least at the same performance level with the mean shift algorithm while it provides more accurate target localization in non trivial scenarios (e.g. shadows).",

Through the use of appropriate prior distributions, neighbouring points are constrained to have similar manifold coordinates as well as similar manifold geometry. A single set of latent coordinates is learned, common for all views. We show how to solve the model with variational inference. We also exploit the multiview aspect of the proposed model, by showing how to estimate missing views of unseen data.

In this paper, we set out to develop a 3D medical image compression method that extends the 3D wavelet difference reduction algorithm by computing the similarity of the pixels in adjacent slices and progressively compress only the similar slices.

The weights allow a mean shift-like gradient based optimization by maximizing the weighted likelihood, which would not be feasible in the context of a standard von Mises mixture.
