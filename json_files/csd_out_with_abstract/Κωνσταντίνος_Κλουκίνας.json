The pixel detector provides 3-dimensional space points in the region closest to the interaction point that allow for high-precision, charged-particle tracking and for vertex reconstruction [2, 3]. The pixel detector is located in a particularly harsh radiation environment characterized by a high track density. The original pixel detector [1] consisted of three barrel layers at radii of 44, 73, and 102 mm and two endcap disks on each end at distances of 345 and 465 mm from the interaction point. It was designed for a maximum instantaneous luminosity of 1\u00d7 1034 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1 and a maximum average pileup (number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing) of 25 in LHC operation with 25 ns bunch spacing.

            "Abstract": "For the Phase 2 upgrade of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), the CMS experiment needs a completely new silicon Outer Tracker (OT) detector able to cope with high pile-up conditions and withstand significantly higher radiation fluences. The future OT will be populated with two types of module, each one based on paired silicon sensors: the Pixel-Strip sensor pairs (PS modules) located in the innermost region of the OT tracker and the Strip-Strip sensor pairs (2S modules) in the outer part [1].The Concentrator Integrated Circuit ASIC (CIC) equips the Front-End Hybrids (FEH) of the modules and it is the only shared component between the two different type of FEH. The CIC role in the readout chain is to collect the digital data coming from 8 upstream FE chips (MPAs [2] in the case of PS, CBCs [3] in the case of 2S) and buffer, aggregate and format them into output packets to be transmitted to off-detector readout electronics, via the LpGBT and VTRX+ optical link. Two data streams are generated by the FE chips and are managed by the CIC. The first one, called the Trigger data stream, contains information necessary for the L1 trigger processing electronics to form a trigger decision. This information is collected by the CIC from 8 FE chips over eight 25 ns bunch crossings (BX), and is reconstructed and filtered to form a data packet that is sent synchronously over 8 periods of the 40 MHz clock through the 6-bit wide trigger output bus. The hit data from events passing the L1 trigger, buffered by the 8 FE chips, constitutes the second data stream called L1 data: it is transmitted by the CIC asynchronously, upon reception of the L1-accept signal.

Its discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force\u2014the W+, W\u2013, and Z0 bosons\u2014as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons. The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector. The probability of the observed signal being due to a random fluctuation of the background is about 1 in 3 \u00d7 106. The new particle is a boson with spin not equal to 1 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The radiation environment present in some of today's High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments and in space has a detrimental influence on the integrated circuits working in these environments. Special technologies, called radiation hardened, have been used in the past to prevent the radiation-induced degradation. In the last decades, the market of these special technologies has undergone a considerable shrinkage, rendering them less reliably available and far more expensive than today's mainstream technologies. An alternative approach is to use a deep submicron CMOS technology. The most sensitive part to radiation effects in a MOS transistor is the gate oxide. One way to reduce the effects of ionizing radiation in the gate oxide is to reduce its thickness, which is a natural trend in modern technologies. Submicron CMOS technologies seem therefore a good candidate for implementing radiation-hardened integrated circuits using a commercial, inexpensive technology. Nevertheless, a certain number of radiation-induced problems still need to be solved. These problems can be addressed with special layout rules and circuit architectures, as explained in the paper. The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated on several circuits which will be used for the experiments of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the new accelerator presently under construction at CERN.(24 refs).",

The upgraded CMS pixel detector is designed to cope with the higher instantaneous luminosities that have been achieved by the LHC after the upgrades to the accelerator during the first long shutdown in 2013-2014.

            "Abstract": "For the High Luminosity CMS Outer Tracker upgrade [1], the Pixel-Strip (PS) module is required to handle higher data-rates and readout bandwidths together with enhanced functionality compared to the current tracker, while keeping the Level-1 (L1) trigger rate at an acceptable level (< 1MHz) in the high pileup conditions of the HL-LHC. For this reason, the Outer Tracker detector modules will introduce the capability to perform on-detector fast recognition of interesting events by locally rejecting low transverse momentum particles and transmit for every event encoded information of high momentum particles to the L1 trigger decision electronics. To facilitate the on-detector particle momentum discrimination, the Outer Tracker PS modules adopt a double layer sensor topology which combines a pixel silicon sensor with a strip silicon sensor. The SSA, whose architecture is described in [2], is the 120-channel, Silicon Strip readout ASIC of the Outer Tracker PS module. It generates, in real time, the hit cluster coordinates necessary for the correlation with the information coming from the pixel layer that is readout by the Macro-Pixel ASIC (MPA)[3]. It stores full events in an embedded radiation-tolerant memory for a latency period of 12.8 \u00b5s. Full events are transmitted up to a average trigger rate of 1 MHz. More details of the PS module readout architecture can be found in [4]. The SSA ASIC incorporating already all the required functionality and performance characteristics for operation in the final readout system, has been prototyped for the first time using a 65 nm CMOS technology.

            "Abstract": "Calibration of the relative response of the individual channels of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS detector was accomplished, before installation, with cosmic ray muons and test beams. One fourth of the calorimeter was exposed to a beam of high energy electrons and the relative calibration of the channels, the intercalibration, was found to be reproducible to a precision of about 0.3%. Additionally, data were collected with cosmic rays for the entire ECAL barrel during the commissioning phase. By comparing the intercalibration constants obtained with the electron beam data with those from the cosmic ray data, it is demonstrated that the latter provide an intercalibration precision of 1.5% over most of the barrel ECAL. The best intercalibration precision is expected to come from the analysis of events collected in situ during the LHC operation. Using data collected with both electrons and pion beams \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034cm -2s-1 (1027cm-2s-1). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4\u03c0 solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudo-rapidity coverage to high values (|n | \u2264 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500t. \u00a9 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.",

            "Abstract": "The Higgs boson was postulated nearly five decades ago within the framework of the standard model of particle physics and has been the subject of numerous searches at accelerators around the world. Its discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force-the W+, W-, and Z 0 bosons-as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons. The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector. The probability of the observed signal being due to a random fluctuation of the background is about 1 in 3 x 106. The new particle is a boson with spin not equal to 1 and has a mass of about 1.25 giga-electron volts. Although its measured properties are, within the uncertainties of the present data, consistent with those expected of the Higgs boson, more data are needed to elucidate the precise nature of the new particle.",

            "Abstract": "For the nominal LHC design luminosity of 10 34 cm-2 s-1, an average of 17 events occurs at the beam crossing frequency of 25 ns. This input rate of 10 9 interactions every second must be reduced by a factor of at least 10 7 to 100 Hz, the maximum rate that can be archived by the on-line computer farm. CMS has chosen to reduce this rate in two steps. At the first level all data is stored for 3.2 \u00b5s, after which no more than 100 kHz of the stored events are forwarded to the High Level Triggers. This must be done for all channels without dead time. The Level-1 (L1) system is based on custom electronics. The High Level Trigger (HLT) system, relies upon commercial processors. The L1 system uses only coarsely segmented data from calorimeter and muon detectors, while holding all the high-resolution data in pipeline memories in the front-end electronics. The HLT is provided by a subset of the on-line processor farm which, in turn, passes a fraction of these events to the remainder of the on-line farm for more complete processing.The physical size of the CMS detector and underground caverns imposes constraints on signal propagation that combine with electronics technology to require 3.2 \u00b5s, equivalent to 128 25-ns beam crossings, for any primary decision to discard data from a particular beam crossing. During this 3.2 \u00b5s period, trigger data must be collected from the front end electronics, decisions must be developed that discard a large fraction of the data while retaining the small portion coming from interactions of interest and these decisions must be propagated to the readout electronics front end buffers.",

In order to investigate this effect we have developed a set-up for noise measurement on wafers and diced sensors that does not require bonding. The set-up is based on the DeltaStream chip coupled to a probe card with 32 pins at a pitch of 1.9 mm. All the digital electronics, including the analogue-to-digital converter and a microprocessor, is placed on a motherboard which communicates with a PC via an RS232 line. We have tested 45 sensors and found that some strips which have an above average noise, also have a higher relative current increase as a function of voltage,\u2206 \u0399/(I\u00d7\u2206 V), even though their leakage current is below 50 nA. We also observed that on these strips the breakdown occurs within about 60 V from the onset of the noise. The source of this noise is not yet clear and the investigation is going on.",

For the first time data coming from the Tracker will be used in the L1 trigger decision of a high luminosity hadron experiment. In parallel, a readout channel will transmit triggered events to the Data AcQuisition (DAQ) system at a nominal average trigger rate of 750kHz. A complete description of the CMS Outer Tracker upgrade can be found in the CMS Technical Proposal [1]. The Macro Pixel ASIC is the readout chip for the Pixel-Strip module which extracts hits (binary signals) from the pixelated sensor. The chip comprises a fast front-end with leakage current compensation and amplitude discriminator circuits with binary readout for a 120\u00d7 16 pixel sensor array with dimensions of 12.0 mm\u00d7 23.16 mm. The readout of 1920 channels per chip at a 40MHz BX rate provides a data throughput of\u223c 80Gbps per chip. Such an amount of data is combined in real time with the input data (2.56 Gbps) coming from the strip sensor layer. The latter is read out by another readout ASIC, called Short Strip ASIC (SSA). The on-chip data processing combines zero-suppression techniques with the capability of recognizing particles with high transverse momentum. The system achieves an almost lossless data transmission to the back-end with an output bandwidth of 1.6 Gbps per chip.

In order to meet the requirements of different front-end ASICs used in the experiments, it provides various user-configurable interfaces capable to perform simultaneous operations. It is designed employing radiation tolerant design techniques to ensure robustness against SEUs and TID radiation \u2026",

The material affects the reconstruction of events through multiple scattering, energy loss, electron bremsstrahlung, photon conversions, and nuclear interactions (NIs), of the particles produced in proton-proton collisions. The analysis presented here uses reconstructed NIs to precisely measure the positions of inactive elements surrounding the proton-proton collision point, such as the beam pipe and the inner mechanical structures of the pixel detector. This information is needed to validate simulations of the CMS detector and to identify any shifts in the positions of inactive elements. It can also be used in searches for long-lived particles with displaced vertices [2, 3].",

            "Abstract": "The Macro Pixel ASIC, namely MPA, is a 65 nm CMOS technology pixel readout chip featuring on-chip real-time particle discrimination with trigger-less and zero suppressed readout. The design is dedicated to the hybrid Pixel-Strip (PS) module of the CMS Outer Tracker upgrade for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The trigger-less readout is based on transverse momentum (pT) particle discrimination and it works in parallel with a triggered and zero suppressed readout with a programmable latency (up to 12.8 \u00b5s at 40 MHz event rate) which provides the entire event with a maximum trigger rate of 1 MHz.The pixel matrix features macro-pixels of 100\u00d7 1446 \u00b5m2 distributed in 118\u00d7 16 channels. These dimensions fulfil the CMS Outer Tracker requirements [1]. The front-end, which consists of a pre-amplifier with Krummenacher feedback for detector leakage compensation, a shaper and a two stages discriminator with hysteresis, features a binary readout. The latter, followed by particle cluster reduction (clustering) and zero suppression, provides 3.8 Gbps to the particle discrimination logic. This digital logic block combines the front-end data with the external data coming from 8 parallel links for a total input bandwidth of 2.56 Gbps. The output of the particle discrimination logic is the high-pT information that is continuously sent to the experiment back-end with 5 parallel links per chip for an output bandwidth of 1.6 Gbps. In parallel, a radiation tolerant Static RAM (SRAM) stores the full zero-suppressed event and provides it over a separated 320 Mbps serial link only when requested with an external trigger signal. One of the main challenges for this \u2026",

We have tested 45 sensors and found that the strips with an above average noise have a higher relative current increase as a function of voltage, DeltaI/(IDeltaV). We also observed that, on these strips, the breakdown occurs within about 60 V from the voltage at which the noise is observed. We describe our measurement method and present the results.",

            "Abstract": "A: During the high-luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC), planned to start in 2027, the accelerator is expected to deliver an instantaneous peak luminosity of up to 7.5\u00d7 1034 cm\u2212 2s\u2212 1. A total integrated luminosity of 3000 or even 4000 fb\u2212 1 is foreseen to be delivered to the general purpose detectors ATLAS and CMS over a decade, thereby increasing the discovery potential of the LHC experiments significantly. The CMS detector will undergo a major upgrade for the HL-LHC, with entirely new tracking detectors consisting of an Outer Tracker and Inner Tracker. However, the new tracking system will be exposed to a significantly higher radiation than the current tracker, requiring new radiation-hard sensors. CMS initiated an extensive irradiation and measurement campaign starting in 2009 to systematically compare the properties of different silicon materials and design choices for the Outer Tracker sensors. Several test structures and sensors were designed and implemented on 18 different combinations of wafer materials, thicknesses, and production technologies. The devices were electrically characterized before and after irradiation with neutrons, and with protons of different energies, with fluences corresponding to those expected at different radii of the CMS Outer Tracker after 3000 fb\u2212 1. The tests performed include studies with \u03b2 sources, lasers, and beam scans. This paper compares the performance of different options for the HL-LHC silicon sensors with a focus on silicon bulk material and thickness.",

            "Abstract": "The foreseen Phase-2 upgrades at the LHC present very challenging requirements for the front-end readout electronics of the CMS Outer Tracker detector. High data rates in combination with the employment of a novel technique for rejecting locally low transverse momentum particles as well as the strict low power consumption constraints require the implementation of an optimized readout architecture and specific interconnect synchronization schemes for its components. This work focuses on the development and the verification of the Concentrator IC (CIC) ASIC, a 65 nm digital chip featuring high input and output data rates, in the context of the readout chains incorporating all front-end ASICs: namely the Macro Pixel ASIC (MPA), Short Strip ASIC (SSA) for the Pixel-Strip (PS) modules and the CMS Binary Chip (CBC) for Strip-Strip (2S) Modules. The CIC ASIC receives high data rate (320 MHz) digital streams from eight Front-end ASICs via a total of 48 differential lines and transmits them through seven differential lines operating at 320 MHz or 640 MHz, depending on the occupancy of the detector module. A complex system level simulation environment based on the System-Verilog hardware description language and on the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) platform has been adapted and extended to help the CIC development and verification simulating the complete readout chains from the particle event to the output of the modules. The paper is composed of four sections: the first one describes the pT module concept, the second presents the UVM environment for MPA/SSA ASICs adapted and extended to include the CIC, the third \u2026",

To our knowledge, this is the widest range of momenta in which any calorimeter system has been studied. These tests, carried out at the H2 beam-line at CERN, provide a wealth of information, especially at low energies. The analysis of the differences in calorimeter response to charged pions, kaons, protons and antiprotons and a detailed discussion of the underlying phenomena are presented. We also show techniques that apply corrections to the signals from the considerably different electromagnetic (EB) and hadronic (HB) barrel calorimeters in reconstructing the energies of hadrons. Above 5 GeV/c, these corrections improve the energy resolution of the combined system where the stochastic term equals 84.7\u00b11.6% and \u2026",

For this reason, the entire tracking system will be replaced with new detectors featuring higher radiation tolerance and ability to handle higher data rates and readout bandwidths [1]. The possibility to identify particles with high transverse momentum (> 2 GeV/c) and provide primitives for the L1 trigger decision, was achieved by the adoption of double layer sensor modules, combining a pixel sensor with a strip one. Two different front-end ASICs were developed, the Short Strip ASIC (SSA) and the Macro-Pixel ASIC (MPA)[2], in order to readout the sensors hits and to locally process and reduce the total output data flow with a compression factor of around 20 [3]. The SSA is the front-end ASIC responsible of reading-out the Short-Strip silicon sensor and to provide encoded information for the particle momentum discrimination. It is a 120-channel ASIC with double-threshold binary readout architecture, utilizing a quick hit cluster finding logic to provide encoded hit information for particle momentum discrimination to the Macro Pixel ASIC (MPA) at the bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz, while allowing the full sensor readout at a nominal average trigger rate of 1MHz. To match the strict power requirement of 50 mW and the radiation tolerance up to a total ionizing dose of 200 Mrad, low power and radiation hardening techniques have been employed.

Single event hardening techniques are based on redundancy and may introduce significant overhead in power consumption. In applications as the pixel and strip readout ASICs for the CMS outer tracker high luminosity LHC upgrade [1], the readout frontend and the complex digital logic capable of performing on-chip real-time discrimination of particles based on transverse momentum, are required operating with a very tight power budget of less than 100 mW/cm2. The Macro Pixel ASIC, MPA [2], is a 65 nm CMOS technology pixel readout ASIC featuring on-chip real-time particle discrimination with trigger-less and zero suppressed readout. The Short Strip ASIC, SSA [3], is a strip readout ASIC, designed in the same technology, which provides real-time particle hit coordinates from a strip sensor to the MPA for the particle discrimination. A concentrator ASIC, called CIC [4], aggregates the information from multiple MPA ASICs. The SEE hardening techniques implemented in the design of the three ASICs need to be evaluated in relation to power requirements and tolerable error rates. It is essential to study how different parts of the design may benefit from different SEE protecting techniques, and eventually, which percentage of power consumption could be traded to reach higher radiation tolerance.",

The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking - through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task, CMS must be prepared to search for new particles, such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles, from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb-1 or less. The analysis tools that have been developed are applied to study in great detail and with all the methodology of performing an analysis on CMS data specific benchmark processes upon which to gauge the performance of CMS. These processes cover several Higgs boson decay channels, the production and decay of new particles such as Z\u2032 and supersymmetric particles, Bs production and processes in heavy ion collisions.

            "Abstract": "CMS is a general purpose experiment, designed to study the physics of pp collisions at 14 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007.The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking\u2014through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task, CMS must be prepared to search for new particles, such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles, from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb\u2212 1 or less. The analysis tools that have been developed are applied to study in great detail and with all the methodology of performing an analysis on CMS data specific benchmark processes upon which to gauge the performance of CMS. These processes cover several Higgs boson decay channels, the production and decay of new particles such as Z and supersymmetric particles, Bs production and processes in heavy ion collisions. The simulation of these benchmark processes includes subtle effects such as possible detector miscalibration and misalignment. Besides these benchmark processes \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Although the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has so far been tested to exquisite precision, it is considered to be an effective theory up to some scale \u039b\u2248 TeV. The prime motivation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is to elucidate the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking for which the Higgs mechanism is presumed to be responsible. The experimental study of the Higgs mechanism also can shed light on the mathematical consistency of the SM at energy scales above about 1 TeV. However, there are alternatives that invoke more symmetry such as supersymmetry or invoke new forces or constituents such as strongly-broken electroweak symmetry, technicolour, etc. An as yet unknown mechanism is also possible. Furthermore there are high hopes for discoveries that could pave the way towards a unified theory. These discoveries could take the form of supersymmetry or extra dimensions, the latter requiring modification of gravity at the TeV scale. Hence there are many compelling reasons to investigate the TeV energy scale. Hadron colliders are well suited to the task of exploring new energy domains, and the region of 1 TeV constituent centre-of-mass energy can be explored if the proton energy and the luminosity are high enough. The beam energy (7 TeV) and the design luminosity (L= 1034 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1) of the LHC have been chosen in order to study physics at the TeV energy scale. Hence a wide range of physics is potentially possible with the seven-fold increase in energy and a hundred-fold increase in integrated luminosity over the current hadron collider experiments. These conditions also require a very careful design of the \u2026",

Data were taken with a variety of incident electron energies, and three angles of incidence (to simulate different regions of the CMS endcaps). The prototype functioned well, with a very small startup period and operated successfully for the duration of the test (~ 1 week) without intervention. Good agreement has been found between data and a GEANT-3 based simulation, and the absolute results are promising.

The present paper presents the extension of a foundry-provided PDK to cover also high TID effects. TID experiments have been carried out up to 500 Mrad. The PDK is based on binned BSIM4 models, which are adapted to different TID levels.

            "Abstract": "Before the initiation of the RD49 project [1] in March 1997 it was widely believed that the electronics for the trackers and calorimeters of ATLAS and CMS would have to be built entirely from custom-developed ASICs using the relatively expensive radiation-hardened technologies available from only a few specialized, low-volume manufacturers. However, because of the very demanding requirements of the LHC front-end electronics, there was some concern about the stability and reproducibility of these dedicated rad-hard processes and the risk of some of them being withdrawn. At the same time it was also believed that the less severe radiation environments of the outer detectors would permit the trouble-free use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components and ASICs developed in standard, non-hardened technologies. However, many years of experience in the Space community showed that there were actually significant risks associated with such an approach.In view of all these uncertainties the RD49 project was approved in March 1997 with the dual objectives of first assessing a new approach to the development of radiation-tolerant ASICs for the outer detectors and secondly establishing collaboration with experienced radiation effects specialists in the Space agencies. It was hoped that, if a sufficiently high degree of radiation tolerance could be achieved, the RD49 approach could even provide a lower-cost, fall-back solution for the tracker and calorimeter electronics.",

A substantial increase of latency and trigger rate provides an improvement that is not sufficient to preserve the tracking performance of the current system. A possible solution consists of using tracking information for the event selection.Given a limited bandwidth, the use of tracking information for the event selection implies that the tracker has to send out self-selected information for every event.

In an effort to cover the needs for generic programmable components, often needed in the real world, an industry-compatible Programmable Logic Device (PLD) and an industry-compatible Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are now under development. This effort is targeted to small volume applications or to the cases where small programmable functions are required to fix a system application. The PLD is a fuse-based, 10-input, 8-I/O general architecture device compatible with a popular commercial part, and is fabricated in 0.25 \u03bcm CMOS. The FPGA under development is instead a 32\u00d7 32 logic block array, equivalent to\u2248 25k gates, to be fabricated in 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS. The work focusses on \u2026",

The circuit is optimized to operate with a 3 pF Si-microstrip detector and it exhibits an equivalent noise charge of 225e\u2212 rms with a slope of 45e\u2212/pF. The peaking time of the pulse at the output of the analog part is 28 ns and the circuit recovers to the baseline within 600 ns. Moreover, it has the ability of handling either positive or negative current pulses originating from the detector.

Front-end electronics for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider are expected to be exposed up to ten-fold doses. Bulk CMOS at 65 nm is a strong contender for such electronics due to a favorable trade-off among cost, performance, and TID-sensitivity. The present paper presents the extension of a foundry-provided PDK to cover also high TID effects. TID experiments have been carried out up to 500 Mrad. The PDK is based on binned BSIM4 models, which are adapted to different TID levels. Hence, designers may choose among different TID levels for their designs, contributing importantly to radiation-hard design practice.",

In order to investigate this effect we have developed a set-up for noise measurement on wafers and diced sensors that does not require bonding. The set-up is based on the DeltaStream chip coupled to a probe card. We have tested 45 sensors and found that the strips with an above average noise have a higher relative current increase as a function of voltage, \u0394I/(I\u0394V). We also observed that, on these strips, the breakdown occurs within about 60 V from the voltage at which the noise is observed. We describe our measurement method and present the results.",
