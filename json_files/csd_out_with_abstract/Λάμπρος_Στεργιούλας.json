Integrating learning-resource-related data in an automated way demands a flexible data model. The paper considers components of an educational market place model such as learning resources, agents, and delivery systems. It is aimed at contributing to the idea of a semantic web of universities. The paper is also concerned with the design and development of an \u201con-line\u201d assessment service for e-Learning Resources as part of an educational Brokerage System, and the use of this service as an integral part of a web-based exchange/brokerage system in order to provide users with useful, up-to-date information on available e-Learning Resources. Organisational, pedagogical and technical challenges are discussed. Results from real-life testing and user feedback are also reported and discussed and advanced technologies with significant potential for future enhancement of such systems are investigated.",

Currently, safety monitoring is expanding its evidence base, moving beyond traditional approaches towards sophisticated methods that can identify possible safety signals from multiple information sources, both structured and unstructured. In this context, health information posted online by patients represents a potentially valuable, yet currently left largely unexploited source of post-market safety data that could supplement data from traditional sources of drug safety information. As the use of social media data for pharmacovigilance is still in its infancy, the present paper explores the state of the art in the application of social data to adverse drug reaction detection; provides a thorough review of existing work in the field \u2026",

This paper proposes use of embedded IoT enabled sensing technology within all stages of a modular building lifecycle. An expanded four-phase model of intelligent assets use in construction is proposed along with an outline of the required data flows between the stages of a given building\u2019s entire lifecycle that need to be facilitated for a BIM (Buildings Information Modelling) representation to begin to describe a building project as a sustainable asset within the circular economy.

In order to ensure that the brokerage system offers Learning Resources of the highest quality, a characteristic that is crucial to its success, the system collects from users quality-related information, which can then be processed and displayed to users as need arises. This introduces a market-driven selection mechanism on learning resources and ensures that learning resource quality is continuously improved. This paper addresses the issues involved in the development of a generic \u201con-line\u201d evaluation engine for \u201clive\u201d,\u201cpackaged\u201d, as well as hybrid learning resources, and the use of this engine in providing useful, up-to-date information on available learning resources to users. Key to the development of such evaluation modality is the critical design trade-off between the contradictive requirements of complexity/completeness and the need for simplification in order to improve user satisfaction and user-friendliness. Results from real-life testing and user feedback are also reported and analyzed. The design/development process embraces a formative as well as a summative evaluation approach.",

As there has recently been a surge of a number of standards to address the challenge of representing competencies and there is a rising need to develop a common methodology, as well as methods and tools for developing, reusing, adapting, integrating such standards, this research is now becoming important and timely. We explore this within the context of the OpenScout project, which is building a federation of repositories with content in the areas of business and management. Thus this study is limited to metadata standards for competencies in the business and management fields, but it is aimed that the lessons from this domain can transfer to other fields and will inform the wider debate on the development and use of such standards. The paper revisits a set of standards for competence descriptions and provides recommendations as to which standard would suit better the nature of the repository, the requirements of stakeholders, and the Open Content resources. In particular, the paper proposes an adaptation and extension of the IEEE-RCD model, employing an application profiling approach, and taking into account the granularity of the European Qualifications Framework and the requirements of Open Content resources.",

Owing to the major transformation of traditional educational system in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), most of higher educational institutions are currently switching to eLearning system and the rest are expected to switch in the near future. Nowadays there is a universal need to investigate such Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that have significant impact on the adoption of eLearning. The aim of this paper is to identify and prioritise, in order of their importance, the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for the adoption of eLearning in educational institutions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Therefore, the chosen area of research for this paper holds importance in terms of considering the CSFs before and during the adoption of eLearning process especially at this time when KSA is ready to prepare for this educational reform. Although the significance of eLearning cannot be denied and its impact on the improvement of the traditional educational system is well-recognised, there are still gaps reported in the literature for the adoption of eLearning. In order to fully realise the potential of eLearning and understand the challenges in its adoption, it is imperative to identify the CSFs that affect the adoption of eLearning in KSA educational institutions. In order to do so, this paper identifies key success factors that affect the adoption of eLearning through extensive analyses of case studies and the existing literature.

This research aims to address the need for a new holistic evaluation framework for the purpose of the evaluation of the medical web applications. Over the last decade more and more, companies used accountancy techniques such as the frameworks analysed in this research. This new holistic framework that was developed will include also steps regarding the indirect and intangible costs and benefits identification and their incorporation in the evaluation process. Moreover the new emerging market of the medical websites and the embedded on them web applications requires also a new evaluation framework that will provide accurate results in the estimation of the efficiency of an investment on them. The paper first presents an introduction about why economic evaluation is important when evaluating the Information Technology in organizations. Various studies are reviewed, which highlight the ever increasing importance of integrating economic evaluation processes, such as Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Return on Investment (ROI), into systems and processes of organizations and economic organizations, and analyse the factors that govern their role. Finally, the evaluation frameworks and methods that are found in these studies should be used as a part of a proactive systematic action plan that the organizations could use to avoid budget \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Routine immunization (RI) of children is the most effective and timely public health intervention for decreasing child mortality rates around the globe. Pakistan being a low-and-middle-income-country (LMIC) has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world occurring mainly due to vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). For improving RI coverage, a critical need is to establish potential RI defaulters at an early stage, so that appropriate interventions can be targeted towards such population who are identified to be at risk of missing on their scheduled vaccine uptakes. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) based predictive model has been proposed to predict defaulting and non-defaulting children on upcoming immunization visits and examine the effect of its underlying contributing factors. The predictive model uses data obtained from Paigham-e-Sehat study having immunization records of 3,113 children. The \u2026",

Aim of the project is to facilitate the sustainable provision of integrated tele-education services and applications to a large number of distributed interconnected sites over a variety of telecommunication infrastructures and the investigation of the seamless integration of low-cost satellite telecommunications infrastructures with broadband terrestrial systems. The project will integrate satellite communication technologies with various terrestrial network infrastructures. An integrated end-to-end system will be implemented in order to provide tele-education services to remote, distributed and isolated rural areas and maritime users where satellite communication technologies have a potential edge over terrestrial infrastructures. Both of these user groups are typical examples of economic sectors and activities that can benefit greatly by a wider deployment and use of satellite communications essentially due to the usually large distances which separate them from broadband terrestrial telecom infrastructures.",

Many of the commonly accepted realisations of \"Digital Literacy\" are concerned with the indisputable part-and-parcel relation of digital literacy to the phenomenon of 'digital divide'. Yet, one needs to ask: \"Which may be the components and the characteristics of such a unique 'curriculum' that could be responsive to such a major socio-economical and political goal?\". This paper attempts to consider in theoretical and practical terms the process of developing an educational framework for digital literacy through the embracement of participatory, bottom-up approaches. In particular, it is argued that the multifaceted task of developing a pan-European digital literacy framework may rest upon the construction of a functional and multifaceted network of education key-stakeholders, which will enable researchers \u2026",

The interoperability of such diverse networks imposes a number of challenges regarding service provision and management. The end-to-end quality of service (QoS) management implies that features such as service scalability between different networks have to be available. On the other hand, wireless QoS capabilities provide a promising diversity for a wide range of seamless applications. However, differences in QoS properties between both the wired and the wireless applications have a considerable effect on the quality level as well as platform and application dimensions of network interoperability. This paper examines the so-called interoperability requirements in integrated uses of satellite communication technology together with terrestrial (wireless) network technology \u2026",

The thrust of this paper is to explore the potential use of a) Cost-Benefit Analysis and b) Simulation and Modeling methods in estimating the value of Health Information System (HIS) projects. These methods were chosen for consideration as the most appropriate, primarily because CBA can measure delivered value of HIS interventions by weighting cost and benefits and identifying what is more socially desirable, while Simulation and Modeling tools can be used to estimate the future value of health care changes concerning HIS. The paper discusses these two families of methods, their evaluation potential is analyzed, and arguments for and against the use of each method are presented. Finally, methodological considerations and limitations are discussed and areas for future research are suggested.",

In an attempt to model human decision-making behaviour, the vast number of potential parameters raises the question of how this complexity can be harnessed. This paper proposes a data-driven approach, with which dependencies or associations are extracted from the data itself. The complex and dynamic nature of modern business processes makes this approach more suitable, as the design of competent rule-based models or expert systems would be cumbersome, expensive or even infeasible. A hybrid behaviour-modelling method, based on both statistical component analysis and sensitivity analysis, is proposed to directly model decision behaviour. The derived model is the outcome of an optimisation process, where model-data matching is \u2026",

Both deterministic and stochastic nonlinearities are included in the system model, where the stochastic nonlinearities are described by statistical means that could reflect the multiplicative stochastic disturbances. The phenomenon of measurement missing occurs in a random way and the missing probability for each sensor is governed by an individual random variable satisfying a certain probability distribution over the interval [0, 1]. Such a probability distribution is allowed to be any commonly used distribution over the interval [0, 1] with known conditional probability. The aim of the addressed filtering problem is to design a filter such that, in the presence of both the stochastic nonlinearities and multiple missing measurements, there exists an upper bound for \u2026",

This study is a preliminary step towards this goal. This paper presents some results from a systematic literature survey on applications of M&S in the commerce and defence domains that could inspire some improvements in the healthcare. Interim results show that in the commercial sector Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) has been the most widely used technique with System Dynamics (SD) in second place. However in the defence sector, SD has gained relatively more attention. SD has been found quite useful for qualitative and soft factors analysis. From both the surveys it becomes clear that there is a growing trend towards using hybrid M&S approaches.",

Actor Network Theory has been deployed in various environments to achieve a better understanding of the roles of not only the humans but also the artifacts that constitute, in this case, healthcare networks of services and organisations. The theory is used as a means of supporting real world interventions, providing a richer understanding of complexities involved and thereby helps management to make better decisions. This study also explores Latour\u2019s concept of machines as machinations, whose role is to translate other actors into the network. We propose ICRS as a fruitful empirical context for the use of ANT to support decision making for actors in health care provision. Actor Network Theory (ANT) is well-suited for use in the socio-technical evaluation of IS into the ICRS project because this approach treats human and non-human actors symmetrically. This approach facilitates a more thorough examination of the ways in which information technology is enabled or restricted in social processes.",

This paper presents an overview of the past and ongoing efforts towards realizing this convergence, its potential benefits and the risks involved and measures to avoid them. Furthermore, we argue that if this convergence is unsuccessful, with future WSs moving away from Grid-oriented principles and implementations, the concept of Grids might fade gradually away, giving way to the \u2026",

Presently e-Government is pursued as both a way of increasing government productivity and efficiency and as a key enabler of citizen-centric, cooperative,\" seamless\", but polycentric, modern governance.

From this starting point, this paper investigates e-Government from a citizen\u2019s perspective under the light of both Government-to-Citizen (G2C) and Citizen-to-Government (C2G) relations. Such a \u201cjoined-up government\u201d approach, which builds G2C and C2G relationships on a backbone of good G2G synergy, may be pivotal for improving of the services offered to citizens.

The process is repeated until all signal components are extracted. Finally, the Wigner distributions of pure auto-terms are superimposed to yield a high readability representation",

The review is characterised by three factors: wide coverage, broad scope of the simulation techniques, and a focus on real-world applications. A structured methodology was followed to narrow down the search from around 20,000 papers to 281. Results include interesting trends and patterns. For instance, although discrete event simulation is the most popular technique, it has lower stakeholder engagement than other techniques, such as system dynamics or gaming. This is highly correlated with modelling lead time and purpose. Considering application areas, modelling is mostly used in scheduling.

The main purpose of these reviews is to see whether there are lessons to learn from the first two sectors to be applied in the health-care sector. Results of our reviews show that, simulation has been commonly used in the three sectors; however, there is clear evidence of lack of consistency in the level of implementation. More specifically, healthcare lags behind the other two sectors, particularly in terms of stakeholder engagement and, consequently, in terms of implementation of simulation outcomes.

Grids hold the promise to provide global interoperability and interconnectivity at a level considered impossible a few decades ago. In practice, there is not much difference between the existing Grid and Web infrastructures; in fact, a Grid infrastructure could be built by making few modifications to a Web infrastructure. The implementation of Web-based Grids or a partially-Gridified Web is one of the potential solutions to Grid infrastructure problems. This can be done by sharing Grid services across the Grid infrastructure using the underlying Web services as vehicles or transporters of these services. In this study we argue that Grids should be developed using the underlying Web infrastructure and Grid services could be integrated with Web services using inheritance techniques to produce Grid-supported Web services. Furthermore, this approach seems to deal effectively with the problems of resource discovery in such partially-Gridified Web environments.",

The mixed time delays consist of both the discrete and the distributed delays. The time-varying delays are allowed in state. By employing the idea of delay fractioning and constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the stability of the system dynamics in the specified sliding surface by solving a certain semidefinite programming problem.

This paper presents results from a systematic literature survey on applications of modelling simulation techniques in the Aerospace & Military. The knowledge gained or lessons learned from the survey were finally used to analyze the potential applications of the simulation modelling techniques to the healthcare sector. Results show that in the defence sector, Distributed Simulation has now become a widely adopted technique. However, System Dynamics (SD) and Discrete Event Simulation (DSE) have also gained relative attention. From this survey it becomes clear that various simulation modelling techniques are useful for specific purposes and have potential applications in the healthcare sector.",

We use ontologies to resolve the semantics of complex health care data. The use of the method is demonstrated through a pregnancy case identification method.

To better characterize this condition, clinicians have classified patients sharing certain symptomatic characteristics, such as symptom intensity and history of exacerbations, into distinct phenotypes. In recent years, the growing use of machine learning algorithms, and cluster analysis in particular, has promised to advance this classification through the integration of additional patient characteristics, including comorbidities, biomarkers, and genomic information. This combination would allow researchers to more reliably identify new COPD phenotypes, as well as better characterize existing ones, with the aim of improving diagnosis and developing novel treatments.

Our analysis shows that while the policy makers acting upon the application of details related to the implementation of the system, the potential users are far behind the innovation decision process, namely at the knowledge or persuasion stages. We use data from a local heath authority from a county close to London. The research explores, compares, and evaluates contrasting views on the systems implementation at the local as well as national level. We believe that our analysis is useful for NCRS implementation strategies, in particular, and technology diffusion in large organisations, in general.",

The algorithm performs time-frequency filtering in the Wigner representation, to deal efficiently with the non-stationarities caused by such impacts, and adjusts the parameters of its time-frequency filtering function so that the filtering process adapts to the individual characteristics of the signal in hand. Performance analysis and comparative evaluation with experimentally acquired kinematic impact signals demonstrated a higher accuracy, with performance advantages over two widely used conventional automatic methods: linear phase autoregressive model-based derivative assessment (LAMBDA) and generalised cross-validation using quintic splines (GCVQS).

There is a need for health information systems to be fully integrated with each other and provide interoperability across various organizational domains for ubiquitous access and sharing. The emerging technology of HealthGrids holds the promise to successfully integrate health information systems and various healthcare entities onto a common, globally shared and easily accessible platform. This chapter presents a systematic taxonomy of different types of HealthGrid resources, where the specialized resources can be categorised into three major types; namely, Data or Information or Files (DIF); Applications & Peripherals (AP); and Services. Resource discovery in HealthGrids is an emerging challenge comprising many technical issues encapsulating performance, consistency, compatibility, heterogeneity, integrity, aggregation and security of life-critical data. To address these challenges, a systematic search strategy could be devised and adopted, as the discovered resource should be valid, refined and relevant to the query. Standards could be implemented on domain-specific metadata. This chapter proposes potential solutions for the discovery of different types of HealthGrid resources and reflects on discovering and integrating data resources.",

This effect is of interest as by making comparisons with change detection, it may be informative of the brain activity that occurs during visual awareness. This paper proposes a wavelet coherence analysis for measuring the degree of synchronisation of multi-channel electroencephalograph (EEG) signals during experiments of change detection and change blindness in picture pairs presented between blank inter-stimulus intervals. The magnitude of wavelet coherence is found to exhibit significant differences between the hit and miss visual states. The ANOVA test verified the statistical significance of coherence differences (p < 0.01) between hits (change detection) and misses (change blindness) in cross-channel synchronization",

Following a concise presentation of the ISAR imaging method used in this work, as well as of the theory of the bilinear TF transforms involved in our numerical simulations, extended numerical results are presented for a reference simulated radar target and for various noise conditions. The constructed ISAR images are presented and analyzed quantitatively using an entropy cost function criterion, while corresponding run-time considerations have also been taken into account. As a result, it appears that the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville (SPWV) distribution provides us with images of superior quality. Furthermore, the analysis of the results demonstrates the usefulness of bilinear TF methods in ISAR imaging and showcases the relative performance advantages and disadvantages of the various distributions.

The objective of this study is to introduce a new method for analyzing the P300 component, when performing a given cognitive task, in this case, a two-choice reaction time task. The discrete wavelet transform with Daubechies wavelet is employed to detect the presence of P300 in individual trials. Wavelet filtering is applied to remove noise and unwanted frequency components from discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients based on prior knowledge of event-related potentials (ERPs). The filtering mask is computed from the grand-average of wavelet coefficients over all participants. With this filtering, the P300 component is accurately localized in both time and scale. The findings suggest the procedure to have considerable potential for the analysis of time-series data in the behavioral neurosciences",

This paper presents an overview of evaluation in health informatics and information systems.Methods: Literature review on discourses, dimensions and methods of HIS and IS evaluation. A critical appraisal of selected HIS and IS evaluation frameworks is undertaken in order to identify HIS evaluation dimensions and measures. The frameworks are compared based on their inclusion of human, organizational and technological factors. Results: We found that an increasing number of evaluation studies deal with two distinct trends of HIS: one considers human and organizational issues and the other is concerned with the employment of a subjectivist approach. Our review indicates that current evaluation methods complement each other in that they evaluate different aspects of HIS and they can be improved upon.Conclusions: Evaluation is complex; it is easy to measure many things but not necessarily the right ones. Nevertheless, it is possible to consider, a HIS evaluation framework with more comprehensive and specific measures that would incorporate technological, human and organizational issues to facilitate HIS evaluation.\u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Major reasons include lack of awareness, parental forgetfulness regarding schedules, and misinformation regarding vaccines. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and distancing measures, routine childhood immunization (RCI) coverage has been adversely affected, as caregivers avoid tertiary care hospitals or primary health centers. Innovative and cost-effective measures must be taken to understand and deal with the issue of low immunization rates. However, only a few smartphone-based interventions have been carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to improve RCI.The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether a personalized mobile app can improve children\u2019s on-time visits at 10 and 14 weeks of age for RCI as compared with standard care and to determine whether an artificial intelligence model can be incorporated into the app. Secondary objectives are to determine the perceptions and attitudes of caregivers regarding childhood vaccinations and to understand the factors that might influence the effect of a mobile phone\u2013based app on vaccination improvement.A mixed methods randomized controlled trial was designed with intervention and control arms. The study will be conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital vaccination center. Caregivers of newborns or infants visiting the center for their children\u2019s 6-week vaccination will be recruited. The intervention arm will have access to a smartphone app with text, voice, video, and pictorial messages \u2026",

The system matrices are functions of mutually independent stochastic variables that obey uniform distributions over known finite ranges. Attention is focused on the construction of a time-varying filter such that the prescribed H\u221e performance requirement can be guaranteed with probability constraint. By using the difference linear matrix inequalities (DLMIs) approach, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the desired performance of the designed finite-horizon filter.

The thrust of this paper is to explore the potential use of a) Cost-Benefit Analysis and b) Simulation and Modeling methods in estimating the value of Health Information System (HIS) projects. These methods were chosen for consideration as the most appropriate, primarily because CBA can measure delivered value of HIS interventions by weighting cost and benefits and identifying what is more socially desirable, while Simulation and Modeling tools can be used to estimate the future value of health care changes concerning HIS. The paper discusses these two families of methods, their evaluation potential is analyzed, and arguments for and against the use of each method are presented.

A large memory bandwidth is required to transfer the required pixel data from external memory to the processing unit. On-chip image buffers are employed to reduce this data transfer rate. Conventional image buffers, implemented either by using FPGA logic resources or embedded memories are resource inefficient. They exhaust the limited FPGA resources quickly. Consequently, hardware implementation of neighborhood operations becomes expensive, and integrating them in resource constrained devices becomes unfeasible. This paper presents a resource efficient FPGA based on-chip buffer architecture.

This paper presents results from a systematic literature survey on applications of modelling simulation techniques in the Aerospace & Military. The knowledge gained or lessons learned from the survey were finally used to analyze the potential applications of the simulation modelling techniques to the healthcare sector. Results show that in the defence sector, Distributed Simulation has now become a widely adopted technique. However, System Dynamics (SD) and Discrete Event Simulation (DSE) have also gained relative attention. From this survey it becomes clear that various simulation modelling techniques are useful for specific purposes and have potential applications in the healthcare sector.",

Lack of awareness, forgetting about vaccination schedule, and vaccine misconception/misinformation are a few of the major drivers that mitigate the rates of immunization. The current COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of immunization. The significant reductions in regular childhood vaccination during pandemic have increased the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Concerns among parents over possibly exposing their children to COVID-19 during child visits may have contributed to the reported declines. Innovative and cost-effective mHealth interventions must be implemented in order to address the problem of inadequate immunization rates. In addition, it is also critical to understand the end user needs in order to reflect on the highly relevant essence of the customized healthcare experience. Objective: The aim of this study was to learn about caregivers\u2019 attitudes toward the usability and acceptability of behavior-change smartphone applications (mobile phones) for improving immunization coverage in Pakistan. Methods: A mixed-method design was employed for this study. The study was conducted at Aga Khan University, Hospital. Parents visiting the Community Health Center for 6-week vaccination of their children were recruited. The study was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 consisted of qualitative interviews that grasped the parent\u2019s attitudes and challenges to immunization, as well as their acceptability and accessibility of the smartphone-based behavior-change application to increase \u2026",

A critical appraisal of selected HIS and IS evaluation frameworks is undertaken in order to identify HIS evaluation dimensions and measures. The frameworks are compared based on their inclusion of human, organizational and technological factors.We found that an increasing number of evaluation studies deal with two distinct trends of HIS: one considers human and organizational issues and the other is concerned with the employment of a subjectivist approach.

However, notwithstanding recent advances in e-Learning, from both technological and pedagogical perspectives, there are very few, if any, recognised methodologies for user-led design of satellite-based e-learning infrastructures. In this paper, we present a methodology for designing a satellite and wireless based network infrastructure and learning services to support distance learning for such isolated communities. This methodology entails (a) the involvement of community members in the development of targeted learning services from an early stage, and (b) a service-oriented approach to learning solution deployment.

The nonlinear descriptions quantify the maximum possible derivations from a linear model, and the system states are allowed to be immeasurable. Attention is focused on the design of a discrete\u2010time SMO such that the asymptotic stability as well as the H\u2009\u221e\u2009 performance requirement of the error dynamics can be guaranteed in the presence of nonlinearities, time delay and external disturbances.

Then, by constructing a new Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional based on the idea of \u2018delay fractioning\u2019 and by introducing some appropriate free\u2010weighting matrices, a sufficient condition is established to guarantee the desired performance of the error dynamics in the \u2026",

With fresh demand for new services and applications, it is becoming essential that wireless network architecture seamlessly interoperate with new and existing technologies, protocols and standards. This paper presents recent work on the use of hybrid wireless network infrastructures for delivering tele-education and e-learning applications to remote communities by combining a variety of satellite, terrestrial and wireless technologies, and provides the results from live scenarios carried out employing various methods of interoperability testing. The analysis of the results examines a number of different issues such as delay, jitter, packet loss, latency, throughput measurement, and bandwidth. By combining satellite and terrestrial (wireless) technologies, full coverage and high capacity can be achieved for true broadband services for delivering educational content. The interoperability among such diverse networks imposes a number of challenges regarding service provision and management.",

The chapter discusses Grid services as another type of Grid resources, examines possible ways to integrate Grid services and Web services, and explores how this will support Grid resource discovery. It is argued that Grids should be developed using the underlying Web infrastructure and Grid services could be integrated with Web services using inheritance techniques to produce Grid-supported Web services. Furthermore, this approach seems to deal effectively with the problems of resource discovery in such partially-Gridified Web environments.

SDEV is managed based on the triple-bottom line approach which stresses the importance of achieving a balance between economic, environmental and social impacts. In the context of management decision making, this implies that operational and strategic decisions in an organization must not be limited to the fulfillment of KPIs associated with productivity alone, but should also include metrics that are associated with the environment and society. Modeling & simulation (M&S) lends itself towards evaluation of the three, often competing, metrics. There are several M&S approaches like Discrete-event and System Dynamics; which of the existing techniques is the choice for modelling SDEV? Or, is a combined hybrid approach a better solution?

Inability to share, integrate and access critical healthcare information is a challenge for the healthcare IT. Moreover, semantic interoperability of health-related heterogeneous data sources is a challenging issue and healthGrids are expected to address this challenge in a systematic manner. This paper proposes a new architecture: ASIDS (architecture for semantic integration of data sources), that could be a potential candidate for solving the challenge of semantic interoperability of geographically distributed heterogeneous data sources. ASIDS has three main components that are loosely coupled (through interfaces) in a distributed manner. This architecture sets the basis for future research in terms of implementing a healthGrid application in real environments.",
