            "Abstract": "The problem of sequentially detecting a moving anomaly is studied, in which the anomaly affects different parts of a sensor network over time. Each network sensor is characterized by a pre-and post-change distribution. Initially, the observations of each sensor are generated according to the corresponding pre-change distribution. After some unknown but deterministic time instant, a moving anomaly emerges, affecting different sets of sensors as time progresses. Our goal is to design a stopping procedure to detect the emergence of the anomaly as quickly as possible, subject to false alarms constraints. The problem is studied in a quickest change detection framework where it is assumed that the evolution of the anomaly is unknown but deterministic. A modification of Lorden\u2019s detection delay is proposed to account for the trajectory of the anomaly that maximizes the detection delay of a detection procedure. It is \u2026",

It is known that finding the optimal sequential estimator is an intractable problem with a general stopping time that is adapted to the complete observation history [1]. By properly restricting the search space to stopping times that are adapted to a specific subset of the complete observation history we derive the optimal sequential estimator under two different formulations of the problem. In the first formulation, the (unconditional) covariance of the estimator is used to assess its accuracy, as a common practice. In the second formulation, the conditional covariance is used for the same purpose, which is preferred over the former when there is an auxiliary statistic whose distribution does not depend on the parameters to be estimated [2]. Our analytical results show that the optimal stopping rule in the conditional formulation is a simple one-dimensional threshold rule for any number of parameters to be estimated. On the other hand, the optimal stopping rule in the unconditional formulation for n parameters is characterized by a hypersurface in a n2+ n",

When the sensors take discrete time observations, the proposed test achieves order-1 asymptotic optimality, i.e., the ratio of its performance over the optimal performance tends to 1. Moreover, we show theoretically and corroborate with simulations that the performance of the suggested test in discrete time can be significantly improved when the sensors sample their underlying continuous time processes more frequently, a property which is not enjoyed by other centralized or decentralized tests in the literature.",

Although such joint problems are not infrequent, there exist no systematic analysis in the literature that treats them effectively. Existing approaches consider the detection and the estimation subproblems separately, applying in each case the corresponding optimum strategy. As it turns out the overall scheme is not necessarily optimum since the criteria used for the two parts are usually incompatible. In this article we propose a mathematical setup that considers the two problems jointly. Specifically we propose a meaningful combination of the Neyman-Pearson and the Bayesian criterion and we provide the optimum solution for the joint problem. In the resulting optimum scheme the two parts interact with each other, producing detection/estimation structures that are completely novel. Notable side-product of our work is the proof that the well known GLR test is finite-sample-size optimum under this combined sense.",

A novel sequential detection rule is proposed that requires communication from the sensors at random times and transmission of only low-bit messages, on which the fusion center runs in parallel a CUSUM test. The second-order asymptotic optimality of the proposed scheme is established both in discrete and in continuous time. Specifically, it is shown that the inflicted performance loss (with respect to the optimal detection rule that uses the complete sensor observations) is asymptotically bounded as the rate of false alarms goes to 0, for any fixed rate of communication.

The first reveals an important property of these filters and can lead to a numerical solution that is of the size of the number of constraints imposed instead of the size of the filter. With the second method, using a different parametrization of the filter coefficients, it is possible to obtain closed form expressions for the optimum filter coefficients and for the minimum output noise power, in the general case. Previous approaches were successful in providing closed forms expressions only for special cases.",

In this setting, one is presented with a list of candidates drawn according to a Gaussian-like distribution for permutations and the goal is to identify the highest ranked candidate through a sequential interview process that does not allow rejected candidates to be revisited. The new modeling assumption consists in being able to query a Genie at the time a selection is to be made. The query provides an answer indicating if the candidate in question is the highest-ranked or not. If the Genie confirms the query, the selection process terminates. Otherwise, the sequential examinations continue until a new potentially optimal candidate is identified. Our results include optimal interview strategies for a bounded number of queries that can be exactly determined through numerical evaluations as well as the expected number of interviews until the optimal candidate is identified or the interview process completed. Although the problem exhibits similarities with the Dowry problem with multiple choices of Gilbert and Mosteller, the proposed Genie-based model substantially differs from it as it allows for early stopping and addresses nonuniform candidate interview distributions.",

In this work we consider a particular new version where during reviewing one is allowed to query an external expert to improve the probability of making the correct decision. Unlike existing formulations, we consider experts that are not necessarily infallible and may provide suggestions that can be faulty. For the solution of our problem we adopt a probabilistic methodology and view the querying times as consecutive stopping times which we optimize with the help of optimal stopping theory. For each querying time we must also design a mechanism to decide whether we should terminate the search at the querying time or not.

As a performance measure an extended Lorden's criterion is proposed. When the possible drifts, assumed after the change, have the same sign, the \\hbox{CUSUM} rule, designed to detect the smallest in absolute value drift, is proven to be the optimum. If the drifts have opposite signs, then a specific 2-\\hbox{CUSUM} rule is shown to be asymptotically optimal as the frequency of false alarms tends to infinity.",

The first, using second order statistics, is responsible for whitening the measured signals, whereas the second, based on nonlinear statistics, imposes independence and achieves the final separation. In this work we show that this two-part scheme is in fact not necessary. By proposing a general nonlinear adaptation model, we find conditions that lead to source separation and guarantee an overall desirable symmetric behavior of the algorithm. Furthermore, using a local performance measure, we optimize the general adaptation scheme and obtain algorithms that have optimum convergence rate. Finally we show that the proposed optimum schemes, except for trivial cases, cannot be put under the two-part classical scheme of the literature, suggesting that the latter is suboptimum.",

The objective is to raise an alarm as quickly as possible subject to a proper false alarm constraint. We show that under sampling control, a simple myopic-sampling-based sequential change-point detection strategy is second-order asymptotically optimal when the number M of processes is fixed. This means that the proposed detector, even by sampling with a rate 1/M of the full rate, enjoys the same detection delay, up to some additive finite constant, as the optimal procedure.

            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of detecting an abrupt change in a discrete-time Markov process which is observed sequentially. A detector in this case is simply a stopping time (the time we stop and declare that a change took place) which is adapted to the observations. We assume that the pre-and postchange probability measures describing the statistical behavior of the observations are known, but the time of change is unknown. As performance measure for our detector we adopt the criterion proposed by Lorden [1971] which, for each fixed deterministic change-time, evaluates the average detection delay conditioned on the worst possible data before the change and then considers the worst possible deterministic change-time. Our goal is to minimize this worst-case scenario subject to the false alarm constraint that the average period of false alarms is no smaller than some minimal tolerable value. The solution of this problem when the observations are iid before and after the change with different pdfs, gives rise to the well-known CUSUM test (Lorden [1971], Moustakides [1986]). We extend this exact optimality result to cover data that are homogeneous Markov before and after the change with different conditional pdfs. We demonstrate that the optimum detection strategy is CUSUM-like containing two univariate functions that must be properly specified. For these two functions we provide equations that are sufficient for their determination but we also show that the same equations play a crucial role in the proof of optimality of the proposed scheme. Concluding, we should mention that this problem has been open for over thirty years.Acknowledgement \u2026",

Although convergence of Remez: is theoretically assured, its practical implementations may fail to converge in \"difficult\" design problems when classical initialization is used.

At the same time, a randomized extension of the Shiryaev-Roberts test proposed by Pollak, enjoys a very strong asymptotic minimax property with respect to Pollak\u2019s supremum metric. We conjecture that a deterministically initialized version of the Shiryaev-Roberts test can compete with the latter procedure very efficiently. We propose a numerical scheme for the systematic comparison of these detection procedures in both settings, ie, minimax and for detecting changes that occur in the distant future. Our goal is accomplished by deriving a set of integral equations for the performance metrics of interest, which are solved numerically.

Our fast implementation of DPM preserves the simple structure of the original DPM having also a considerably lower computational complexity. The proposed version provides orthonormal vector estimates of the subspace basis which are numerically stable. In other words, our scheme does not accumulate roundoff errors and therefore preserves orthonormality in its estimates. In fact, our scheme constitutes the only numerically stable, low complexity, algorithm \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Opportunistic detection rules (ODRs) are variants of fixed-sample-size detection rules in which the statistician is allowed to make an early decision on the alternative hypothesis opportunistically based on the sequentially observed samples. From a sequential decision perspective, ODRs are also mixtures of one-sided and truncated sequential detection rules. Several results regarding ODRs are established in this paper. In the finite regime, the maximum sample size is modeled either as a fixed finite number, or a geometric random variable with a fixed finite mean. For both cases, the corresponding Bayesian formulations are investigated. The former case is a slight variation of the well-known finite-length sequential hypothesis testing procedure in the literature, whereas the latter case is new, for which the Bayesian optimal ODR is shown to be a sequence of likelihood ratio threshold tests with two different thresholds \u2026",

The fusion center in turn uses the sequentially acquired information to perform a CUSUM test in order to decide whether a change took place or not. We prove that the average detection delay of the proposed test differs from the optimum centralized CUSUM test only by a constant. This fact suggests order-2 asymptotic optimality as compared to existing schemes that are optimal of order-1.",

We argue that this framework is not very informative, as the corresponding asymptotic optimality property cannot differentiate between universal and parsimonious rules. We propose an asymptotic framework in which the number of sensors also goes to infinity, and we show that in this context universal rules may fail to be asymptotically optimal when the number of streams is not very small.

Each sensor in the network is characterized by a non-anomalous and an anomalous data-generating distribution, and these distributions could be different across the sensors. Initially, the observations at all the sensors are generated according to their corresponding non-anomalous distribution. After some unknown but deterministic time instant, a dynamic anomaly emerges in the network, affecting a different sensor as time progresses. The observations generated by the affected sensor follow the corresponding anomalous distribution. The goal is to detect the onset of the dynamic anomaly as quickly as possible, subject to constraints on the frequency of false alarms. This detection problem is posed in a quickest change detection framework where candidate \u2026",

The fusion center in turn uses the received information to perform a centralized SPRT in order to make the final decision. The expected time for a decision of the proposed scheme differs from the optimum continuous-time centralized SPRT only by a constant. This fact suggests order-2 asymptotic optimality of our test as compared to existing schemes that are optimal of order-1.

As a result, the creation of such a global data view resorts to approximate joins. In this paper, an optimal solution is proposed for the matching or the linking of database record pairs in the presence of inconsistencies, errors or missing values in the data. Existing models for record matching rely on decision rules that minimize the probability of error, that is the probability that a sample (a measurement vector) is assigned to the wrong class.

Alternatively, in event-based sampling, some predefined events on the signal to be sampled trigger the sampling mechanism; that is, sampling times are determined by the signal and the event space. Such an alternative mechanism, setting the sampling times free, can enable simple (eg, binary) representations in the event space. In real-time applications, the induced sampling times can be easily traced and reported with high accuracy, whereas the amplitude of a time-triggered sample needs high data rates for high accuracy. In this chapter, for some statistical signal processing problems, namely detection (ie, binary hypothesis testing) and parameter estimation, in resource-constrained distributed systems (eg, wireless sensor networks), we show how to make use of the time dimension for data/information fusion, which is not possible through the traditional fixed-time sampling.",

            "Abstract": "This paper has been withdrawn by the authors. Please see arXiv:1302.6058. We consider the sequential joint detection and estimation problem. Minimizing the average stopping time subject to a combination of detection and estimation constraints we obtain the optimal triplet of stopping time, detector and estimator. In the joint detection and estimation problem the primary goal is to detect and estimate together, as opposed to the conventional testing of composite hypotheses where the primary goal is to detect only. For the first time in the literature we develop optimal solution to the sequential joint detection and estimation problem. In the sequential version of the problem, different from the fixed sample size version, optimal stopping time is also sought, complicating the solution considerably.",
