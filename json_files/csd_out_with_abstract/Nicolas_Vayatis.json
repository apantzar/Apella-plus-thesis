            "Abstract": "The fact that almost one third of population >65 years-old has at least one fall per year, makes the risk-of-fall assessment through easy-to-use measurements an important issue in current clinical practice. A common way to evaluate posture is through the recording of the center-of-pressure (CoP) displacement (statokinesigram) with force platforms. Most of the previous studies, assuming homogeneous statokinesigrams in quiet standing, used global parameters in order to characterize the statokinesigrams. However the latter analysis provides little information about local characteristics of statokinesigrams. In this study, we propose a multidimensional scoring approach which locally characterizes statokinesigrams on small time-periods, or blocks, while highlighting those which are more indicative to the general individual\u2019s class (faller/non-faller). Moreover, this information can be used to provide a global score in order to evaluate the postural control and classify fallers/non-fallers. We evaluate our approach using the statokinesigram of 126 community-dwelling elderly (78.5 \u00b1 7.7 years). Participants were recorded with eyes open and eyes closed (25 seconds each acquisition) and information about previous falls was collected. The performance of our findings are assessed using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the area under the curve (AUC). The results show that global scores provided by splitting statokinesigrams in smaller blocks and analyzing them locally, classify fallers/non-fallers more effectively (AUC = 0.77 \u00b1 0.09 instead of AUC = 0.63 \u00b1 0.12 for global analysis when splitting is not used). These promising results \u2026",

We introduce the Laplace Hazard matrix and show that its spectral radius fully characterizes the dynamics of the contagion both in terms of influence and of explosion time. Using this concept, we prove tight non-asymptotic bounds for the influence of a set of nodes, and we also provide an in-depth analysis of the critical time after which the contagion becomes super-critical. Our contributions include formal definitions and tight lower bounds of critical explosion time. We illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results through several examples of information cascades used in epidemiology and viral marketing models.

            "Abstract": "Under the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) model, an administrator has the mission to allocate dynamically a limited budget of resources to the nodes of a network in order to reduce a diffusion process (DP) (e.g. an epidemic). The standard DRA assumes that the administrator has constantly full information and instantaneous access to the entire network. Towards bringing such strategies closer to real-life constraints, we first present the Restricted DRA model extension where, at each intervention round, the access is restricted to only a fraction of the network nodes, called sample. Then, inspired by sequential selection problems such as the well-known Secretary Problem, we propose the Sequential DRA (SDRA) model. Our model introduces a sequential aspect in the decision process over the sample of each round, offering a completely new perspective to the dynamic DP control.

            "Abstract": "In the Sequential Selection Problem (SSP), immediate and irrevocable decisions need to be made while candidates from a finite set are being examined one-by-one. The goal is to assign a limited number of b available jobs to the best possible candidates. Standard SSP variants begin with an empty selection set (cold-starting) and perform the selection process once (single-round), over a single candidate set. In this paper we introduce the Multi-round Sequential Selection Problem (MSSP) which launches a new round of sequential selection each time a new set of candidates becomes available. Each new round has at hand the output of the previous one, ie its b selected employees, and tries to update optimally that selection by reassigning each job at most once. Our setting allows changes to take place between two subsequent selection rounds: resignations of previously selected subjects or/and alterations of the quality score across the population. The challenge for a selection strategy is thus to efficiently adapt to such changes. For this novel problem we adopt a cutoff-based approach, where a precise number of candidates should be rejected first before starting to select. We set a rank-based objective of the process over the final job-to-employee assignment and we investigate analytically the optimal cutoff values with respect to the important parameters of the problem. Finally, we present experimental results that compare the efficiency of different selection strategies, as well as their convergence rates towards the optimal solution in the case of stationary score distributions.",

Such signals are multivariate observations carrying measurements corresponding to the nodes of an unknown graph, which we desire to infer. They are assumed to enjoy a sparse representation in the graph spectral domain, a feature which is known to carry information related to the cluster structure of a graph. The signals are also assumed to behave smoothly with respect to the underlying graph structure. For the graph learning problem, we propose a new optimization program to learn the Laplacian of this graph and provide two algorithms to solve it, called IGL-3SR and FGL-3SR. Based on a 3-step alternating procedure, both algorithms rely on standard minimization methods\u2013such as manifold gradient descent or linear programming\u2013and have lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. While IGL-3SR ensures convergence, FGL-3SR acts as a relaxation and is significantly faster since its alternating process relies on multiple closed-form solutions. Both algorithms are evaluated on synthetic and real data. They are shown to perform as good or better than their competitors in terms of both numerical performance and scalability. Finally, we present a probabilistic interpretation of the proposed optimization program as a Factor Analysis Model.",

The data stream is in essence composed by multiple streams, possibly of different nature that depends on each node. At a given moment , a change-point occurs for a subset of nodes , signifying the change in the probability distribution of their associated streams. In this paper we propose an online non-parametric method to infer  based on the direct estimation of the likelihood-ratio between the post-change and the pre-change distribution associated with the data stream of each node. We propose a kernel-based method, under the hypothesis that connected nodes of the graph are expected to have similar likelihood-ratio estimates when there is no change-point.

However, in the case where there are some additional assumptions on the underlying probability distribution, the exponential rate of convergence can be fairly improved. Alexander [1] and Massart [15] have found better exponential rates (similar to those in Bennett\u2013Bernstein inequalities) under the assumption of a control on the variance of the empirical process. In this paper, the case of a particular distribution is considered for the empirical process indexed by a family of sets, and we provide the exact exponential rate based on large deviations theorems, as predicted by Azencott [2].",

The introduction of efficient classification algorithms, such as boosting and Support Vector Machines, coping with high-dimensional data, generated new questions that Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory could not answer. The Empirical Risk Minimization principle does not account for practical learning algorithms and the VC dimension is not the appropriate concept to explain the generalization ability of such methods. In the first chapter, we recall the interpretations of boosting algorithms as implementations of convex risk minimization principles and we study their properties under this viewpoint. In particular, we show the importance of regularization in order to obtain consistent strategies. We also develop a new class of algorithms called the Mirror Averaging Algorithm and we evaluate their performance through simulation experiments. After presenting the fundamental ideas underlying boosting, we study, in the second chapter, more advanced issues such as oracle inequalities. Thus, we propose some fine calibration of the penalty function according to the cost function being used and present non-asymptotic results on the performance of penalized boosting estimators, with refinements such as fast rates of convergence under Mammen-Tsybakov margin conditions. We also describe the approximation properties of boosting using decision stumps. The third chapter explores the ranking problem. In applications such as information retrieval or credit scoring, ranking the instances can be much more significant than simply classifying them. We propose a simple formulation of this \u2026",

This algorithm leverages the weak temporal dependency of the convolution to reduce the interprocess communication to a few local messages. We prove that this algorithm converges to the optimal solution and that it scales with superlinear speedup, up to a certain limit. These properties are illustrated with numerical experiments and our algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art methods used for convolutional sparse coding.",

It is the goal of this paper to propose a statistical learning method for constructing a scoring function with nearly optimal ROC curve.

We propose a discretization approach, consisting of building a finite sequence of N classifiers by constrained empirical risk minimization and then constructing a piecewise constant scoring function s  N (x) by overlaying the resulting classifiers.

The advantages of this model are threefold. First, by using tensor algebra, this model takes into account the underlying structure of the data. Second, this model allows for complex atoms but enforces fewer activations to decompose the data, resulting in an improved summary (dictionary) and a better reconstruction of the original multivariate signal. Third, the number of parameters to be estimated are greatly reduced by the low-rank constraint. We exhibit the associated optimization problem and propose a framework based on alternating optimization to solve it. Finally, we evaluate it on both synthetic and real data.",

Experiments on random and a real-world network show that the dynamic problem is significantly different from vaccination, since the latter strategies can lead to disastrous results, and that the proposed heuristic is an effective strategy under various initial infection conditions.",

Under this perspective, an efficient DRA strategy for a given network can be designed by learning a proper linear arrangement of its nodes. In our theoretical analysis, we derive upper and lower bounds for the extinction time of the diffusion process that reveal the role of the maxcut of the considered linear arrangement. Accordingly, we highlight that the cutwidth, which is the minimum maxcut of all possible linear arrangements for a network, is a fundamental network property that determines the resource budget required to suppress the epidemic under priority planning.

We combined individual clinical risk predictions with epidemic modelling to examine simulations of  isolation and exit policies. Methods: We developed a method to include personalised risk predictions in epidemic models based on data science principles. We extended a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model to account for predictions of severity, defined by the risk of an individual needing intensive care in case of infection. We studied example isolation policies using simulations with the risk-extended epidemic model, using COVID-19 data and estimates in France as of mid April 2020 (4 000 patients in ICU, around 7 250 total ICU beds occupied at the peak of the outbreak, 0.5% percent of patients requiring ICU upon infection).  We considered scenarios varying in the discrimination performance of a risk prediction model, in the degree of social distancing, and in the severity rate upon infection. Confidence intervals were obtained using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach. The framework may be used with other epidemic models, with other risk predictions, and for other epidemic outbreaks. Findings: Based on the data for France as of mid April 2020, simulations indicated that an exit policy considering clinical risk predictions starting on May 11, as planned by the government, could enable to immediately relax restrictions for an extra 10% (6 700 000 people) or more of the lowest-risk population, and consequently relax the \u2026",

However, in the case where there are some additional assumptions on the underlying probability distribution, the exponential rate of convergence can be fairly improved. Alexander [1] and Massart [15] have found better exponential rates (similar to those in Bennett-Bernstein inequalities) under the assumption of a control on the variance of the empirical process. In this paper, the case of a particular distribution is considered for the empirical process indexed by a family of sets, and we provide the exact exponential rate based on large deviations theorems, as predicted by Azencott [2].",

This explains why there is no gold standard for monitoring the Depth of Anesthesia (DoA) and why experimental studies may use several electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, ranging from 2 to 128 EEG-channels. Our study aimed at finding the scalp area providing valuable information about brain activity under general anesthesia (GA) to select the more optimal EEG channel to characterized the DoA. We included 30 patients undergoing elective, minor surgery under GA and used a 32-channel EEG to record their electrical brain activity. In addition, we recorded their physiological parameters and the BIS monitor. Each individual EEG channel data were processed to test their ability to differentiate awake from asleep states. Due to strict quality criteria adopted for the EEG data and the difficulties of the real-life setting of the study, only 8 patients recordings were taken into consideration in the final analysis. Using 2 classification algorithms, we identified the optimal channels to discriminate between asleep and awake states: the frontal and temporal F8 and T7 were retrieved as being the two bests channels to monitor DoA. Then, using only data from the F8 channel, we tried to minimize the number of features required to discriminate between the awake and asleep state. The best algorithm turned out to be the Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes (GNB) requiring only 5 features (Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC- of 0.93 +/- 0.04).

Then, a pairwise aggregation procedure based on Kendall tau is introduced to relate learning rules dedicated to bipartite ranking and solutions of the K-partite ranking problem. Criteria reflecting ranking performance under these conditions such as the ROC surface and its natural summary, the volume under the ROC surface (VUS), are then considered as targets for empirical optimization.

However, whether they offer protection from tsunamis is unclear. Do islands act as natural barriers? Recent post-tsunami survey data, supported by numerical simulations, reveal that the run-up on coastal areas behind small islands was significantly higher than on neighbouring locations not affected by the presence of the islands. To study the conditions of this run-up amplification, we solve numerically the nonlinear shallow water equations. We use the simplified geometry of a conical island sitting on a flat seafloor in front of a uniform sloping beach. By doing so, the experimental set-up is defined by five physical parameters, namely the island slope, the beach slope, the water depth, the distance between the island and \u2026",

The purpose of this paper is to examine both theoretical and practical issues related to the statistical estimation of PR curves based on classification data. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the empirical counterpart of the PR curve in sup norm are rigorously established. Eventually, the issue of building confidence bands in the PR space is considered and a specific resampling procedure based on a smoothed and truncated version of the empirical distribution of the data is promoted. Arguments of theoretical and computational nature are presented to explain why such a bootstrap is preferable to a\" naive\" bootstrap in this setup.",

The latter problem has recently received much attention in the statistical learning literature. From the elementary observation that, in the two-sample problem setup, the null assumption corresponds to the situation where the area under the optimal ROC curve is equal to 1/2, we propose a two-stage testing method based on data splitting. A nearly optimal scoring function in the AUC sense is first learnt from one of the two half-samples. Data from the remaining half-sample are then projected onto the real line and eventually ranked according to the scoring function computed at the first stage. The last step amounts to performing a standard Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test in the one-dimensional framework. We show that the learning step of the procedure does not affect the consistency of the test as well as its properties in terms of power, provided the ranking produced is accurate enough in the AUC sense. The results of a numerical experiment are eventually displayed in order to show the efficiency of the method.",

The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine if an inertial sensor-based method could provide simple features that correlate with the severity of lower limb osteoarthritis evaluated by the WOMAC index without the use of step detection in the signal processing. Forty-eight patients with lower limb osteoarthritis formed two severity groups separated by the median of the WOMAC index (G1, G2). Twelve asymptomatic age-matched control subjects formed the control group (G0). Subjects were asked to walk straight 10 meters forward and 10 meters back at self-selected walking speeds with inertial measurement units (IMU) (3-D accelerometers, 3-D gyroscopes and 3-D magnetometers) attached on the head, the lower back (L3-L4) and both feet. Sixty parameters corresponding to the mean and the root mean square (RMS) of the recorded signals on the various sensors (head, lower back and feet), in the various axes, in the various frames were computed. Parameters were defined as discriminating when they showed statistical differences between the three groups. In total, four parameters were found discriminating: mean and RMS of the norm of the acceleration in the horizontal plane for contralateral and ipsilateral foot in the doctor\u2019s office frame. No discriminating parameter was found on the head or the lower back. No discriminating parameter was found in the sensor linked frames.

In this first study, the conditions do not seem easy to verify and for this reason, we show in this paper how to verify these conditions in the toy example of the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes.

The graph is observed through the time sequence of its adjacency matrix and only the presence of edges is observed. The absence of an edge on a certain snapshot cannot be distinguished from a missing entry in the adjacency matrix. Additional information can be provided by examining the dynamics of the graph through a set of topological features, such as the degrees of the vertices. We develop a novel methodology by building on both static matrix completion methods and the estimation of the future state of relevant graph features. Our procedure relies on the formulation of an optimization problem which can be approximately solved by a fast alternating linearized algorithm whose properties are examined. We show experiments with both simulated and real data which reveal the interest of our methodology.",

            "Abstract": "It is the primary purpose of this paper to set the goals of ranking in a multiple-class context rigorously, following in the footsteps of recent results in the bipartite framework. Under specific likelihood ratio monotonicity conditions, optimal solutions for this global learning problem are described in the ordinal situation, i.e. when there exists a natural order on the set of labels. Criteria reflecting ranking performance under these conditions such as the ROC surface and its natural summary, the volume under the ROC surface (VUS), are next considered as targets for empirical optimization. Whereas plug-in techniques or the Empirical Risk Maximization principle can be then easily extended to the ordinal multi-class setting, reducing the K-partite ranking task to the solving of a collection of bipartite ranking problems, following in the footsteps of the pairwise comparison approach in classification, is in contrast more challenging. Here we consider a concept of ranking rule consensus based on the Kendall distance and show that, when it exists and is based on consistent ranking rules for the bipartite ranking subproblems defined by all consecutive pairs of labels, the latter forms a consistent ranking rule in the VUS sense under adequate conditions. This result paves the way for extending the use of recently developed learning algorithms, tailored for bipartite ranking, to multi-class data in a valid theoretical framework. Preliminary experimental results are presented for illustration purpose.",

The  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) oste- oarthritis index is the most largely used score in rheumatology  for lower limb osteoarthritis. It is based on clinical observation  and it assesses pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients  with hip and knee osteoarthritis. It is valid, reliable, and sen- sitive to evaluate osteoarthritis and adapted to doctor\u2019s office  (Bellamy 2002). However, clinical scores are inherently subjective and they  depend from the patient\u2019s impression and from the clinician\u2019s  interpretation. Gait analysis in modern gait laboratories with  force plates and photogrammetry is a good tool to have an objec- tive, quantified, and precise insight in osteoarthritis (Astephen  et al. 2008). For practical reasons, skin-mounted inertial sensors are well  suited for investigating gait kinematics (Auvinet et al. 2002). In  accelerometer-based gait analysis, aging is also known to affect  gait parameters (Oberg et al. 1993). To have a clinical measure of  osteoarthritis, it is essential to find a technique that is independ- ent from aging. Footwear can also affect walking parameters  (Chambon et al. 2014). Since it is too time consuming to ask the  patient to take off his shoe for the measurement, it is essential to  find a method independent from the shoe type. Walking ten meters go and ten meters back on a level sur- face at comfortable walking speed is a well-suited protocol for  clinical situations.

In this paper we formulate the ranking problem in a rigorous statistical framework. The goal is to learn a ranking rule for deciding, among two instances, which one is\" better,\" with minimum ranking risk. Since the natural estimates of the risk are of the form of a U-statistic, results of the theory of U-processes are required for investigating the consistency of empirical risk minimizers. We establish in particular a tail inequality for degenerate U-processes, and apply it for showing that fast rates of convergence may be achieved under specic noise assumptions, just like in classication. Convex risk minimization methods are also studied.",

            "Abstract": "The ROC curve is the gold standard for measuring the performance of a test/scoring statistic regarding its capacity to discriminate between two statistical populations in a wide variety of applications, ranging from anomaly detection in signal processing to information retrieval, through medical diagnosis. Most practical performance measures used in scoring/ranking applications such as the AUC, the local AUC, the p-norm push, the DCG and others, can be viewed as summaries of the ROC curve. In this paper, the fact that most of these empirical criteria can be expressed as two-sample linear rank statistics is highlighted and concentration inequalities for collections of such random variables, referred to as two-sample rank processes here, are proved, when indexed by VC classes of scoring functions. Based on these nonasymptotic bounds, the generalization capacity of empirical maximizers of a wide class of ranking performance criteria is next investigated from a theoretical perspective. It is also supported by empirical evidence through convincing numerical experiments.",

            "Abstract": "In the Sequential Selection Problem (SSP), immediate and irrevocable decisions need to be made while candidates from a finite set are being examined one-by-one. The goal is to assign a limited number of b available jobs to the best possible candidates. Standard SSP variants begin with an empty selection set (cold-starting) and perform the selection process once (single-round), over a single candidate set. In this paper we introduce the Multi-round Sequential Selection Problem (MSSP) which launches a new round of sequential selection each time a new set of candidates becomes available. Each new round has at hand the output of the previous one, ie its b selected employees, and tries to update optimally that selection by reassigning each job at most once. Our setting allows changes to take place between two subsequent selection rounds: resignations of previously selected subjects or/and alterations of the quality score across the population. The challenge for a selection strategy is thus to efficiently adapt to such changes. For this novel problem we adopt a cutoff-based approach, where a precise number of candidates should be rejected first before starting to select. We set a rank-based objective of the process over the final job-to-employee assignment and we investigate analytically the optimal cutoff values with respect to the important parameters of the problem. Finally, we present experimental results that compare the efficiency of different selection strategies, as well as their convergence rates towards the optimal solution in the case of stationary score distributions.",

The paper introduces novel meta-algorithms for global optimization which rely on the choice of any bipartite ranking method. Theoretical properties are provided as well as convergence guarantees and equivalences between various optimization methods are obtained as a by-product. Eventually, numerical evidence is given to show that the main algorithm of the paper which adapts empirically to the underlying ranking structure essentially outperforms existing state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms in typical benchmarks.",

These so-called epistemic uncertainties can then be reduced by acquiring relevant information from dedicated experiments. The classical method, within the framework of probabilities, uses the Bayes theorem to get the subsequent probability of the parameters from the available information. The article presents an alternative approach derived from classification techniques based on the use of score functions measuring the adequacy of the response obtained by the candidate model to a set of experimental data. These score functions allow the prioritizing of the sets of parameters issued from a set of candidate models in order to select the best ones. This methodology has been applied to the calculation of variance-covariance matrices of neutron cross sections, which quantify the interaction between a neutron and an isotope for a given type of nuclear reaction.(authors)",

By developing a protocol to record synchronously all these parameters we aim at having this evaluation made by an algorithm. Our hypothesis was that the standard parameters recorded during anesthesia (without EEG) could provide a good insight into the consciousness level of the patient.

For this purpose, we propose to estimate the neighborhood of each node by maximizing a penalized version of its conditional log-likelihood. The objective of the penalization is twofold: it imposes sparsity in the learned graphs and, thanks to a fused-type penalty, it also enforces them to evolve piece-wise constantly. Using few assumptions, we provide two change-points consistency theorems. Those are the first in the context of unknown number of change-points detection in time-varying Ising model. Finally, experimental results on several synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset demonstrate the performance of our method.",

The latter problem has recently received much attention in the statistical learning literature. From the elementary observation that, in the two-sample problem setup, the null assumption corresponds to the situation where the area under the optimal ROC curve is equal to 1/2, we propose a two-stage testing method based on data splitting. A nearly optimal scoring function in the AUC sense is first learnt from one of the two half-samples. Data from the remaining half-sample are then projected onto the real line and eventually ranked according to the scoring function computed at the first stage. The last step amounts to performing a standard Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test in the one-dimensional framework. We show that the learning step of the procedure does not affect the consistency of the test as well as its properties in terms of power, provided the ranking produced is accurate enough in the AUC sense. The results of a numerical experiment are eventually displayed in order to show the efficiency of the method.",

In this paper, we formulate a hybrid approach that simultaneously learns the structure of the graph and predicts the values of the node-related functions. Our approach is based on the optimization of a joint regularization objective. We empirically test the benefits of the proposed method with both synthetic and real data.

Such a tool could be useful to engineers or decision makers for specification, design and study of offshore oil facilities. We present a first step towards the creation of such a tool. Our current simulator is based on new Modelica components to simulate fluid flows and on stochastic simulation at a higher level, for modeling risk and costs. Modelica components implement physical models for single and two-phase flows in some typical devices of an offshore field. The risk simulation uses Markov chains and statistical indicators to assess performance and resilience of the system over several months or years of operation.",

We introduce an UCB algorithm which builds a cascade of discretization trees based on generic chaining in order to render possible his operability over a continuous domain. The theoretical framework applies to functions under weak probabilistic smoothness assumptions and also extends significantly the spectrum of application of UCB strategies. Moreover generic regret bounds are derived which are then specialized to Gaussian processes indexed on infinite-dimensional spaces as well as to quadratic forms of Gaussian processes. Lower bounds are also proved in the case of Gaussian processes to assess the optimality of the proposed algorithm.",

            "Publication url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0020",
            "Abstract": "In the liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping industry, the phenomenon of sloshing can lead to the occurrence of very high pressures in the tanks of the vessel. The issue of modelling or estimating the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of such extremal pressures is now crucial from the risk assessment point of view. In this paper, heavy-tail modelling, widely used as a conservative approach to risk assessment and corresponding to a worst-case risk analysis, is applied to the study of sloshing. Multivariate heavy-tailed distributions are considered, with Sloshing pressures investigated by means of small-scale replica tanks instrumented with d >1 sensors. When attempting to fit such nonparametric statistical models, one naturally faces computational issues inherent in the phenomenon of dimensionality. The primary purpose of this article is to overcome this barrier by introducing a novel methodology. For d-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions, the structure of extremal dependence is entirely characterised by the angular measure, a positive measure on the intersection of a sphere with the positive orthant in Rd. As d increases, the mutual extremal dependence between variables becomes difficult to assess. Based on a spectral clustering approach, we show here how a low dimensional approximation to the angular measure may be found. The nonparametric method proposed for model sloshing has been successfully applied to pressure data. The parsimonious representation thus obtained proves to be very convenient for the simulation of multivariate heavy-tailed distributions, allowing for the implementation of Monte-Carlo simulation schemes \u2026",

We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional H\u00f6lder like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization.",

            "Abstract": "The objective of this work is to provide a sophisticated but accessible compartmental epidemic model. Our algorithm is highly inspired from the compartmental model developed by Sofonea and al. in 2020. This model has been used as a reference for several working groups in France during the Covid-19 crisis. Each individual is allocated to a compartment according to her age, her current state with respect to the disease, as well as the length of time she has been in that state. The model then reproduces the mechanisms of transition from one state to another: mathematically, this translates into a system of recurrence relations. It captures how much individuals interact with one another through a parameter that estimates compliance with hygiene measures and lifestyle habits. The present work aims to make the model implementation fully transparent as well as the corresponding code available and give control to users so that they are able to test the model in total transparency. Focus has been put on reproducibility and explanation of the various parameters. The hard-coded parameters correspond to the data for the Covid-19 epidemic in France.",

Our objective is to find small sets of codes (called itemsets or patterns) that occur shortly before failures. Current prediction methods either produce patterns at a high computational cost or resort to kernel approaches which are often difficult to interpret. We introduce Bayesian Pattern Feature Discovery (BPFD), a new generic algorithm for pattern discovery. Our method, based on a pattern mining technique, produces informative and explainable features and is computationally efficient. The performance of BPFD is highlighted on real-world data sets, showing that enriching the feature space with the discovered patterns improves significantly the prediction power of a broad range of predictors and offers useful insight on the predictive maintenance task.",

In particular, being able to predict the number of nodes that will be reached at the end of the spread when that starts from a known set of initial infection seeds (ie seeds\u2019 influence) is of broad interest. Taking preparatory measures by acting on the network, so as to reduce the reach of a possible future diffusion, is a core administration problem. Traditionally, that has been studied as a way to improve public healthcare (eg through vaccination), recently though it has attracted a lot of attention due to the concerns raised by cases of malicious information propagation in social networks (eg fake news, rumors). In the existing literature the role of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix representing the underlying network has been largely highlighted as a quantity tightly connected with the epidemic threshold over which the reach of the diffusion explodes and becomes comparable with the network size [8, 4, 1]. Various studies have been presented for virus propagation models and influence maximization [10, 6, 5]. In this paper we present a brief overview of our recent work on partial node immunization in Continuous-Time Information Cascade Model (CT IC)[7]. CT IC [2] is a stochastic model allowing propagation rates along edges to vary in time. Relying on previous work, we use the concept of Hazard radius introduced in [4], that is highly correlated to the influence and helps us in deriving upper bounds for the influence under the CT IC.

Consequently, a major challenge in the coming years will be to test people over the age of 60 years to detect pre\u2010frailty at the earliest stage and to return them to robustness using the targeted interventions that are becoming increasingly available. This challenge requires individual longitudinal monitoring (ILM) or follow\u2010up of community\u2010dwelling older persons using quantitative approaches. This paper briefly describes an effort to tackle this challenge. Extending the detection of the pre\u2010frail stages to other population groups is also suggested.

            "Abstract": "Falling in Parkinsonian syndromes (PS) is associated with postural instability and consists a common cause of disability among PS patients. Current posturographic practices record the body's center-of-pressure displacement (statokinesigram) while the patient stands on a force platform. Statokinesigrams, after appropriate signal processing, can offer numerous posturographic features, which however challenges the efforts for valid statistics via standard univariate approaches. In this work, we present the ts-AUC, a non-parametric multivariate two-sample test, which we employ to analyze statokinesigram differences among PS patients that are fallers (PSf) and non-fallers (PSNF). We included 123 PS patients who were classified into PSF or PSNF based on clinical assessment and underwent simple Romberg Test (eyes open/eyes closed). We analyzed posturographic features using both multiple testing with p-value adjustment and the ts-AUC. While the ts-AUC showed significant difference between groups (p-value = 0.01), multiple testing did not show any such difference. Interestingly, significant difference between the two groups was found only using the open-eyes protocol. PSF showed significantly increased antero-posterior movements as well as increased posturographic area, compared to PSNF. Our study demonstrates the superiority of the ts-AUC test compared to standard statistical tools in distinguishing PSF and PSNF in the multidimensional feature space. This result highlights more generally the fact that machine learning-based statistical tests can be seen as a natural extension of classical statistical approaches and should be \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a robust nonparametric density estimator combining the popular Kernel Density Estimation method and the Median-of-Means principle (MoM-KDE). This estimator is shown to achieve robustness to any kind of anomalous data, even in the case of adversarial contamination. In particular, while previous works only prove consistency results under known contamination model, this work provides finite-sample high-probability error-bounds without a priori knowledge on the outliers. Finally, when compared with other robust kernel estimators, we show that MoM-KDE achieves competitive results while having significant lower computational complexity.",

In the paper, we propose a statistical method for directly optimizing the ROC curve. The target is known to be the regression function up to an increasing transformation and this boils down to recovering the level sets of the latter. We propose to use classifiers obtained by empirical risk minimization of a weighted classification error and then to construct a scoring rule by overlaying these classifiers. We show the consistency and rate of convergence to the optimal ROC curve of this procedure in terms of supremum norm and also, as a byproduct of the analysis, we derive an empirical estimate of the optimal ROC curve.",

In this paper the Kullback-Leibler distance is proposed for the quality quantification of a covariance matrix estimation and its inverse. It is based on the distance to the true covariance matrix. A method based on the bootstrap is presented for the estimation of this criterion, which can be applied with most methods for covariance matrix estimation and without the knowledge of the true covariance matrix.

            "Abstract": "This paper focuses on active 3D object recognition by an autonomous visual agent in an unknown environment. In this problem, the central issue concerns the choice of the next viewpoint in the dynamical exploration of the object given the information collected until the present state of the agent. Numerous exploration strategies have been proposed and they were shown to outperform random viewpoint planification. Some are based on the maximization of an entropy measure which accounts for the dissimilarity between objects as in [3, 1], or they attempt to find the viewpoint the most favorable in terms of discrimination ability [4]. An agent-based approach was also proposed in the context of reinforcement learning framework [2]. The latter approach accounts for the interaction between the agent and the environment through the update of a planning function. However, these strategies are not robust with respect to the number of classes objects and they may even turn to be infeasible when there are many distinct classes. In the present paper, we propose to unify both approaches in order to deal with a very large number of classes of objects. We define a planning function based on an entropy measure which is adaptive in two senses:(i) it takes into account the knowledge acquired by the agent until its present state, and (ii) it progressively filters the classes with high confidence. We present simulation results for our adaptive exploration strategy on a car image database. These results illustrate the impact on performance with respect to both the number of classes and the duration of the exploration process.",

This paper proposes a novel fall detection monitoring system based on a sensitive floor sensor made out of a piezoelectric material and a machine learning approach. The detection is done by a combination between a supervised Random Forest and an aggregation of its output over time. The database was made using acquisitions from 28 volunteers simulating falls and other behaviours. Unlike existent fall detection systems, our solution offers the advantages of having a passive sensor (no power supply is needed) and being completely unobtrusive \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The problem of ranking/ordering instances, instead of simply classifying them, has recently gained much attention in machine learning. In this paper we formulate the ranking problem in a rigorous statistical framework. The goal is to learn a ranking rule for deciding, among two instances, which one is \u201cbetter,\u201d with minimum ranking risk. Since the natural estimates of the risk are of the form of a U-statistic, results of the theory of U-processes are required for investigating the consistency of empirical risk minimizers. We establish, in particular, a tail inequality for degenerate U-processes, and apply it for showing that fast rates of convergence may be achieved under specific noise assumptions, just like in classification. Convex risk minimization methods are also studied.",

In this study, an innovative active experimental approach is presented to predict the behaviour of theWECs in arrays.

            "Abstract": "Falling in Parkinsonian syndromes (PS) is associated with postural instability and consists a common cause of disability among PS patients. Current posturographic practices record the body\u2019s center-of-pressure displacement (statokinesigram) while the patient stands on a force platform. Statokinesigrams, after appropriate processing, can offer numerous posturographic features. This fact, although beneficial, challenges the efforts for valid statistics via standard univariate approaches. In this work, 123 PS patients were classified into fallers (PSF) or non-faller (PSNF) based on the clinical assessment, and underwent simple Romberg Test (eyes open/eyes closed). We developed a non-parametric multivariate two-sample test (ts-AUC) based on machine learning, in order to examine statokinesigrams\u2019 differences between PSF and PSNF. We analyzed posturographic features using both multiple testing with p-value adjustment and ts-AUC. While ts-AUC showed significant difference between groups (p-value = 0.01), multiple testing did not agree with this result (eyes open). PSF showed significantly increased antero-posterior movements as well as increased posturographic area compared to PSNF. Our study highlights the superiority of ts-AUC compared to standard statistical tools in distinguishing PSF and PSNF in multidimensional space. Machine learning-based statistical tests can be seen as a natural extension of classical statistics and should be considered, especially when dealing with multifactorial assessments.",

The main result of the paper is an upper bound for the expected accuracy of the proposed estimator. This bound is of the order    with an explicit and small constant factor C, where M is the dimension of the problem and t stands for the sample size. A similar bound is proved for a more general setting, which covers, in particular, the regression model with squared loss.",

The approach developed in this paper is based on the assumption that the task on the target domain can be efficiently learned by adequately reweighting the source instances during training phase. We introduce a novel formulation of the optimization objective for domain adaptation which relies on a discrepancy distance characterizing the difference between domains according to a specific task and a class of hypotheses. To solve this problem, we develop an adversarial network algorithm which learns both the source weighting scheme and the task in one feed-forward gradient descent. We provide numerical evidence of the relevance of the method on public data sets for regression domain adaptation through reproducible experiments.",

            "Abstract": "In the liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping industry, the phenomenon of sloshing can lead to the occurrence of very high pressures in the tanks of the vessel. The issue of modelling or estimating the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of such extremal pressures is now crucial from the risk assessment point of view. In this paper, heavy-tail modelling, widely used as a conservative approach to risk assessment and corresponding to a worst-case risk analysis, is applied to the study of sloshing. Multivariate heavy-tailed distributions are considered, with Sloshing pressures investigated by means of small-scale replica tanks instrumented with d >1 sensors. When attempting to fit such nonparametric statistical models, one naturally faces computational issues inherent in the phenomenon of dimensionality. The primary purpose of this article is to overcome this barrier by introducing a novel methodology. For d-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions, the structure of extremal dependence is entirely characterised by the angular measure, a positive measure on the intersection of a sphere with the positive orthant in Rd. As d increases, the mutual extremal dependence between variables becomes difficult to assess. Based on a spectral clustering approach, we show here how a low dimensional approximation to the angular measure may be found. The nonparametric method proposed for model sloshing has been successfully applied to pressure data. The parsimonious representation thus obtained proves to be very convenient for the simulation of multivariate heavy-tailed distributions, allowing for the implementation of Monte-Carlo simulation schemes \u2026",

We prove the convergence of this algorithm and highlight its computational speed-up which is super-linear in the number of cores used.

            "Abstract": "In the Sequential Selection Problem (SSP), immediate and irrevocable decisions need to be made as candidates randomly arrive for a job interview. Standard SSP variants, such as the well-known secretary problem, begin with an empty selection set (cold-start) and perform the selection process once over a single candidate set (single-round). In this paper we address these two limitations. First, we introduce the novel Warm-starting SSP (WSSP) setting which considers at hand a reference set, a set of previously selected items of a given quality, and tries to update optimally that set by (re-)assigning each job at most once. We adopt a cutoff-based approach to optimize a rank-based objective function over the final assignment of the jobs. In our technical contribution, we provide analytical results regarding the proposed WSSP setting, we introduce the algorithm Cutoff-based Cost Minimization (CCM) (and the low failures-CCM, which is more robust to high rate of resignations) that adapts to changes in the quality of the reference set thanks to the translation method we propose. Finally, we implement and test CCM in a multi-round setting that is particularly interesting for real-world application scenarios.",

The usual propagation error method to estimate the covariances is based on the Taylor expansion of the experimental cross section formula. However it is difficult to use in most cases and the lack of data prevents from using the direct empirical estimator. Thus an alternative method is presented which exploits a regression model of the experimental cross section to generate pseudo-measurements. Thereby this allows an estimation of experimental covariances and this estimation is then improved using shrinkage. This later improvement is pointed out on numerical examples with a toy model (whose quantities are all known) and the convenience of the method is illustrated on real cross-section data measurements.",

            "Abstract": "The notion of a boosting algorithm was originally introduced by Valiant in the context of the \u201cprobably approximately correct\u201d(PAC) model of learnability [19]. In this context boosting is a method for provably improving the accuracy of any \u201cweak\u201d classification learning algorithm. The first boosting algorithm was invented by Schapire [16] and the second one by Freund [2]. These two algorithms were introduced for a specific theoretical purpose. However, since the introduction of AdaBoost [5], quite a number of perspectives on boosting have emerged. For instance, AdaBoost can be understood as a method for maximizing the \u201cmargins\u201d or \u201cconfidences\u201d of the training examples [17]; as a technique for playing repeated matrix games [4, 6]; as a linear or convex programming method [15]; as a functional gradient-descent technique [8, 13, 14, 3]; as a technique for Bregman-distance optimization in a broader framework that includes logistic regression [1, 10, 12]; and finally as a stepwise model-fitting method for minimization of the exponential loss function, an approximation of the negative log binomial likelihood [7]. The current papers add to this list of perspectives, giving a view of boosting that is very different from its original interpretation and analysis as an algorithm for improving the accuracy of a weak learner. These many different points of view add to the richness of the theory of boosting, and are enormously helpful in the practical design of new or better algorithms for machine learning and statistical inference. Originally, boosting algorithms were designed expressly for classification. The goal in this setting is to accurately predict the classification of a \u2026",

We derive generalization error bounds for such active learning strategies in terms of Rademacher average and localized discrepancy for general loss functions which satisfy a regularity condition. A practical K-medoids algorithm that can address the case of large data set is inferred from the theoretical bounds. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm is competitive against other state-of-the-art active learning techniques in the context of domain adaptation, in particular on large data sets of around one hundred thousand images.",

Although the obtained spectral representation is sparse in real applications, to the best of our knowledge this property has not been much exploited in the existing related literature. Our main contribution is a change-point detection algorithm that adopts a model selection perspective, which takes into account the sparsity of the spectral representation and determines automatically the number of change-points.

These weights are learned from the data, thus allowing the use of signal anti-correlation on connected nodes in order to perform a more robust interpolation.

In ranking, the pursued goal is global: based on past data, define an order on the whole input space X, so that positive instances take up the top ranks with maximum probability. The most natural way to order all instances consists of projecting the input data onto the real line through a real-valued scoring function s and use the natural order on R. The accuracy of the ordering induced by a candidate  s  is classically measured in terms of the ROC curve or the AUC. Here we discuss the design of tree-structured scoring functions obtained by recursively maximizing the AUC criterion. The connection with recursive piecewise linear approximation of the optimal ROC curve both in the L 1 -sense and in the L infin -sense is highlighted.

It is shown through oracle inequalities that this method is model adaptive. The rate of convergence of the probability of misclassification is investigated. It is shown that for quite a large class of distributions, the probability of error converges to the Bayes risk at a rate faster than n\u2212(V+ 2)/(4 (V+ 1)) where V is the VC dimension of the \u201cbase\u201d class whose elements are combined by boosting methods to obtain an aggregated classifier. The dimension-independent nature of the rates may partially explain the good behavior of these methods in practical problems. Under Tsybakov\u2019s noise condition the rate of convergence is even faster. We investigate the conditions necessary to obtain such rates for different base classes. The special case of boosting using decision stumps is studied in detail. We characterize the class of classifiers realizable by aggregating decision stumps. It is shown that some versions of boosting work especially well in high-dimensional logistic additive models. It appears that adding a limited labelling noise to the training data may in certain cases improve the convergence, as has been also suggested by other authors.",

Here, each of these classifiers is the empirical solution of a specific minimum-volume set (MV-set) estimation problem. The major novelty arises from the fact that the levels of the MV-sets to recover are chosen adaptively from the data to adjust to the variability of the target curve. The ROC curve of the estimated scoring rule may be interpreted as an adaptive spline approximant of the optimal ROC curve. Error bounds for the estimate of the optimal ROC curve in terms of the L \u2009\u221e\u2009-distance are also provided.",

Several software tools are available to simulate individual components of offshore facilities, for instance to compute the flow dynamics in a particular device. There is however no tool to simulate the facility at the system level, i.e. to simulate the general behavior of the facility. The paper presents a framework for such a system-level simulator, which includes one layer for physics and one for risk simulation. The physical part uses the equation-based language Modelica[1]. Modelica components are defined to model typical devices of an installation. The risk simulation usesMarkov chains and statistical indicators to assess performance and resilience of the system. It runs with an external language (C or Scilab) and data from the \u2026",

We first formulate particular (distributiondependent) VC bounds in which a special attention has been given to the exact exponential rate of convergence. We show indeed that the most significant contribution in such bounds is due to the \u201cworst\u201d elements of the model class (designated as the critical sets). We then explain how these results can lead to a rigorous framework for computer simulations involving speed-up techniques for rare event simulation (importance sampling) as well as parameter estimation (linear regression). We thus obtain accurate empirical estimates of the complexity measure and of the multiplicative constant in VC bounds. In particular, we develop the idea of a local complexity characterization associated to every critical set.",

The issue of modelling or estimating the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of such extremal pressures is now crucial from the risk assessment point of view since the probability of failure of the system depends of the area of the sloshing impact. Multivariate heavy-tailed distributions are considered, with sloshing pressures investigated by means of small-scale replica tanks instrumented with d\u2265 1 sensors. When attempting to fit such nonparametric statistical models, one naturally faces computational issues inherent in the phenomenon of dimensionality. The primary purpose of this article is to overcome this barrier by introducing a novel methodology.

In this work, we develop a novel framework for activity shaping under the Continuous-Time Information Cascades Model which allows the administrator for local control actions by allocating targeted resources that can alter the spread of the process. Our framework employs the optimization of the spectral radius of the Hazard matrix, a quantity that has been shown to drive the maximum influence in a network, while enjoying a simple convex relaxation when used to minimize the influence of the cascade. In addition, use-cases such as quarantine and node immunization are discussed to highlight the generality of the proposed activity shaping framework. Finally, we present the NetShape influence minimization method which is compared favorably to baseline and state-of-the-art approaches through simulations on real social networks.",

Their aim is to control an undesired diffusion process by distributing resources to the contagious nodes of the network according to a predefined priority-order. In our analysis, we reduce the DRA problem to the linear arrangement of the nodes of the network. Under this perspective, we shed light on the role of a fundamental characteristic of this arrangement, the maximum cutwidth, for assessing the quality of any priority planning strategy. Our theoretical analysis validates the role of the maximum cutwidth by deriving bounds for the extinction time of the diffusion process. Finally, using the results of our analysis, we propose a novel and efficient DRA strategy, called Maximum Cutwidth Minimization, that outperforms other competing strategies in our simulations.",

            "Abstract": "Almost one third of population 65 years-old and older faces at least one fall per year. An accurate evaluation of the risk of fall through simple and easy-to-use measurements is an important issue in current clinic. A common way to evaluate balance in posturography is through the recording of the centre-of-pressure (CoP) displacement (statokinesigram) with force platforms. A variety of indices have been proposed to differentiate fallers from non fallers. However, no agreement has been reached whether these analyses alone can explain sufficiently the complex synergies of postural control. In this work, we study the statokinesigrams of 84 elderly subjects (80.3+\u2212 6.4 years old), which had no impairment related to balance control. Each subject was recorded 25 seconds with eyes open and 25 seconds with eyes closed and information pertaining to the presence of problems of balance, such as fall, in the last six months, was collected. Five descriptors of the statokinesigrams were computed for each record, and a Ranking Forest algorithm was used to combine those features in order to evaluate each subject\u2019s balance with a score. A classical train-test split approach was used to evaluate the performance of the method through ROC analysis. ROC analysis showed that the performance of each descriptor separately was close to a random classifier (AUC between 0.49 and 0.54). On the other hand, the score obtained by our method reached an AUC of 0.75 on the test set, consistent over multiple train-test split. This non linear multi-dimensional approach seems appropriate in evaluating complex postural control.",

Most practical performance measures used in scoring applications such as the AUC, the local AUC, the p-norm push, the DCG and others, can be seen as summaries of the ROC curve. This paper highlights the fact that many of these empirical criteria can be expressed as (conditional) linear rank statistics.

We prove the strong consistency of the approximated estimator and find the order of the error. Most importantly, we give a parameter tuning result which relates the number of data, the number of time-steps used in the approximation process, the number of the Monte Carlo simulations and the bandwidth size of the kernel density estimation.",

            "Abstract": "In the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) problem, an administrator has to allocate a limited amount of resources to the nodes of a network in order to reduce a diffusion process (DP) (e.g. an epidemic). In this paper we propose a multi-round dynamic control framework, which we realize through two derived models: the Restricted and the Sequential DRA (RDRA, SDRA), that allows for restricted information and access to the entire network, contrary to standard full-information and full-access DRA models. At each intervention round, the administrator has only access -- simultaneous for the former, sequential for the latter -- to a fraction of the network nodes. This sequential aspect in the decision process offers a completely new perspective to the dynamic DP control, making this work the first to cast the dynamic control problem as a series of sequential selection problems. Through in-depth SIS epidemic simulations we compare the performance of our multi-round approach with other resource allocation strategies and several sequential selection algorithms on both generated, and real-data networks. The results provide evidence about the efficiency and applicability of the proposed framework for real-life problems.",

Each individual is categorized depending on his actual status with respect to the disease-moderate or severe symptoms-, and the level of risk predicted-low or high. This idea leads to a 4-fold extension of the ODE model in classical SEAIR. This model offers the possibility for policy-makers to explore differentiated containment strategies, by varying sizes for the low risk segment and varying dates for'progressive release'of the population, while exploring the discriminative capacity of the risk score, for instance through its AUC. Differential contact rates for low-risk/high-risk compartments are also included in the model. The demo allows to select contact rates and time-depending exit strategies. The hard-coded parameters correspond to the data for the Covid-19 epidemic in France, and the risk refers to the probability of being admitted in ICU upon infection.
