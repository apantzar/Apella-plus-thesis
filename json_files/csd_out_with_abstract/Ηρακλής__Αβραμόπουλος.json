The scheme is compared with alternative pattern suppression techniques based on optical gain saturation and electro-optical feed-forward injection for the stringent requirements of next-generation access networks, namely, an extended loss budget and high upstream data rates.

            "Abstract": "The use of digital equalization is advocated for the cost-sensitive datacom environment, to compensate for the limited bandwidth of the commodity optoelectronic components typically employed in such systems. The need for equalization is exacerbated by the adoption of advanced, multi-level modulation formats such as PAM-4 and PAM-8, which are gaining momentum among research and industrial circles as the means of keeping up with the surging demand for throughput. FPGAs can be considered as an attractive solution to deal with the huge bandwidth demands of the present-day datacenters. This is, due to their highly parallel processing and real-time intelligence to be assimilated into the diverse infrastructure operations. This work presents a real-time feed-forward equalizer (FFE) hardware architecture to support state-of-the-art optical interconnects in rack-torack communication for datacenters. We describe design and implementation techniques to efficiently exploit the inherent parallelism of FFE. We implement the proposed architecture on a Virtex7 XC7VH580T FPGA device and we provide results that confirm the increased efficiency of our design, which achieves a very high throughput rate of up to 20 GSa/s.",

Plasmonics comes indeed as a disruptive technology that enables seamless interoperability between light beams and electronic control signals through the underlying metallic layer, providing thereby an inherent energy-efficient platform for merging broadband optical links with intelligent electronic processing. In ICT PLATON project we are aiming to the exploitation of plasmonics for the demonstration of novel hybrid Si-plasmonic router prototypes for chip-to-chip and on-chip interconnection, starting with a 2\u00d7 2 WDM-traffic router with up to 640 Gb/s capacity and proceeding to a 4\u00d7 4 router with up to 1.12 Tb/s throughput. In this article, we will present preliminary results of a 2\u00d7 2 Si-plasmonic router that employs two 81 Si-ring-based multiplexers followed by a novel hybrid Si-plasmonic Mach Zehnder Interferometer switch with a record low power x time constant product.\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present the development of a photonic biosensor device for cancer treatment monitoring as a complementary diagnostics tool. The proposed device combines multidisciplinary concepts from the photonic, nano-biochemical, micro-fluidic and reader/packaging platforms aiming to overcome limitations related to detection reliability, sensitivity, specificity, compactness and cost issues. The photonic sensor is based on an array of six asymmetric Mach Zender Interferometer (aMZI) waveguides on silicon nitride substrates and the sensing is performed by measuring the phase shift of the output signal, caused by the binding of the analyte on the functionalized aMZI surface. According to the morphological design of the waveguides, an improved sensitivity is achieved in comparison to the current technologies (< 5000 nm/RIU). This platform is combined with a novel biofunctionalization methodology that involves material-selective surface chemistries and the high-resolution laser printing of biomaterials resulting in the development of an integrated photonics biosensor device that employs disposable microfluidics cartridges. The device is tested with cancer patient blood serum samples. The detection of periostin (POSTN) and transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBI), two circulating biomarkers overexpressed by cancer stem cells, is achieved in cancer patient serum with the use of the device.

            "Abstract": "We present a multiwavelength ring laser source using an uncoated semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) for providing both gain as well as the comb-like filtering function in the cavity. A SOA-based ring laser source oscillates over a wide bandwidth range due to heterogeneous spectral broadening and the broad gain spectrum of the SOA. Multi-wavelength operation can be obtained by inserting comb-like filters inside the cavity. Fig. 1 (a) shows the relative simple experimental setup used. Gain was provided by a bulk, 500\u00b5m long, InGaAsP/InP ridge waveguide SOA (OptoSpeed, SA) with facets tilted at 10oand without AR-coatings. The reflectance of the uncoated facets was calculated to be about 0.3. A polarization controller was incorporated to adjust polarization state and an isolator to ensure unidirectional oscillation in the ring cavity. Output was obtained via a 50: 50 fused fiber coupler. The total length of the cavity was 11, 45m corresponding to a fundamental ring frequency of 16.9 MHz. The oscillating spectrum was defined by the Fabry-Perot modes of the uncoated SOA whose free spectral range was 65GHz. At the output of the ring laser a 1.5 mm SOA was used for amplification and a fiber Fabry-Perot for individual channel isolation and detection in an optical or electrical spectrum analyzer. Multi-wavelength operation is possible even by using the reflection coated SOA alone considered as a linear, 500 um long, cavity, providing lasing lines determined by the Fabry-Perot modes that experience the highest gain. However, due to gain compression caused by the extreme low cavity losses, its performance as a multiwavelength source is \u2026",

Cascaded second-order RRs equipped with microheaters were integrated on a silicon-on-insulator platform with the radii of MUX1 and MUX2 being ~12 and ~9 \u03bcm, respectively. The resonances of the two MUXs were thermooptically tuned in order to achieve 100-GHz channel spacing, revealing a tuning efficiency of 43 and 36 \u03bcW/GHz/RR for MUX1 and MUX2, respectively, and 352 mW total power consumption. Lower than 18 dB crosstalk and higher than 40-GHz 3-dB bandwidth was obtained for the tuned channels of the MUXs. The signal integrity when using these devices in multiplexing and demultiplexing operations was evaluated for a 4 \u00d7 10 Gb/s non-return-to-zero data stream (i.e., 10 Gb/s line rate) via bit-error-rate \u2026",

Experimental results confirm the successful generation of THz radiation in the range of 0.2-2 THz, verifying the enhanced frequency tunability properties of the proposed system.

The geometrical parameters of the interface are varied in order to identify the ones leading to optimum performance, i.e., maximum coupling efficiency. Fabrication tolerances about the optimum parameter values are also assessed. In addition, the effect of a longitudinal metallic stripe gap on coupling efficiency is quantified, since such gaps have been observed in fabricated structures. Finally, theoretical results are compared against insertion loss measurements, carried out for two distinct sets of samples comprising rib and wire SOI waveguides, respectively.",

We propose a novel technique for optical generation of four-level signals by means of polarization multiplexing, leveraging the single-polarization operation of a double-mesa single-mode VCSEL with 20.5 GHz 3-dB bandwidth. The scheme obviates the need for linear electronic drivers and circumvents the requirement for driving the VCSEL in its linear regime. Experimental results verify the scheme, exhibiting BER within FEC standards at 28 Gb/s. Comparison with an electrical PAM-4 modulated VCSEL demonstrates superior performance of the proposed concept.",

We demonstrate the operation of a mechanism and evaluate its performance and effectiveness for the Network Simulation application in a Grid environment. The network simulator (ns-2), that was implemented, is used for simulation of high speed optical networks. In order to be able to meet the requirements of commercial business processes on the Grid, and especially network simulation tasks, we present a toolkit for centralized job submission and access. The approach has been implemented within the framework of the GRIA IST project that was originally designed for industrial based applications.",

Luckily optical TDM technology has demonstrated very impressive results both at the device level, system performance in transmissions and overall maturation towards field use. For such higher capacity networks to benefit fully from the advantages of ultra high speed TDM technology, information will have to be kept in the optical domain so that some, low level signal processing at the line rate will be necessary.

In this approach however, a significant shortcoming is the high sensitivity of error-performance to the relative polarization of optical-signals, which imposes rigid tuning requirements. To make conversion insensitive to random fluctuations of polarization, we employ a standard outband-FEC method, in combination with a novel inband-FEC method. The latter, called ldquoFOCUSrdquo, is best suited for combating burst-form errors. This particular property of ldquoFOCUSrdquo matches the error-distribution generated by the associated outband-FEC code, when the two are combined in serial-concatenation. We demonstrate the corrective-power of this FEC-concatenation scheme in protecting a 10 Gb/s lightwave-channel, which undergoes \u2026",

Even more, the need for disaggregation of data storage and processing resources significantly increases the capacity and dimensioning requirements of such networks. In this context, a novel datacenter network architecture that combines space and wavelength switching functionalities is demonstrated experimentally. The architecture leverages slotted TDMA/WDM switching to realize dynamic resource allocation with sub-wavelength granularity, thus realizing a low cost and power consumption, scalable datacenter network. Dynamic reconfiguration of the slotted network vouches for low latency operation of the data plane and hence, it fulfils the requirements of the envisaged disaggregated datacenter infrastructure \u2026",

            "Abstract": "There is considerable interest in predicting the efficiency of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols when one of their implementation quantities is modified. One significant imperfection that affects the efficiency of the setup is the afterpulse phenomenon which consists in the spontaneous detections triggered by trapped carriers after previous avalanches at the detectors. While it is widely studied in bibliography for various QKD protocols, it has been reported much more scarcely for the well-known decoy-state QKD protocols and for dual detectors only. We develop a theoretical analysis of afterpulsing effect on the decoy-state QKD protocols for multiple detectors, delivering results which can be used as a guide for every practical decoy-state QKD protocol implementation in real-world deployments. A new formula connecting the baseline system error rate and the afterpulse probability is derived which may hold for all protocols as it is consisted of only setup-related quantities. Numerical simulations addressing the significance of breaking down the quantities pertaining to the decoy-state QKD protocols are being made, focusing on the weak+vacuum decoy-state QKD protocol as a characteristic subcase.",

Using this laser platform, we demonstrate picosecond pulsetrain generation at repetition rates up to 40 GHz, either in single or multiwavelength operation mode. In particular, using rational harmonic mode locking, 2.5-ps pulses were obtained up to a 40-GHz repetition rate, while output pulses and output power were constant over a 20-nm tuning range.

            "Abstract": "The increasing demand for high capacity in optical networking is posing ambitious targets in all segments of the network. In the metro/access networks the focus of attention is on re-configurability, whereas in the core networks research is targeting both transmission bit rate and advanced modulation formats. It is widely accepted that a viable route to achieve such performance requirements with reasonable cost is through photonic integration. In this rationale, the target is to increase the scale of integration both horizontally (increase on-chip functionality) and vertically (increase on-chip channels) so as to develop complex largescale Photonic Integrated Circuits. So far, large-scale PICs have been fabricated through monolithic [1] or hybrid [2, 3] integration techniques. European project APACHE aims at creating the methodology in order to blend these technologies and combine their merits. In this \u201cmonolithic-on-hybrid\u201d approach, arrays of monolithic components (lasers, modulators, amplifiers) are passively assembled on a silicon submount (daughterboard) which is in turn passively assembled into the planar silica motherboard (figure 1). By fine tuning the balance between monolithic and hybrid integration (select the size and number of the monolithic arrays on the hybrid chip) device yield can be optimized, whereas different types of PICs can be fabricated without the need for a complete re-design. This paper describes the software tools that are under development in order to facilitate the design and fabrication of \u201cmonolithic-on-hybrid\u201d large-scale PICs.Succesfull research and development of micro and nano engineered products relies on an \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of saturated semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)-based interferometric switching arrangements. For the first time, it is shown that such devices can provide enhanced intensity modulation reduction to return-to-zero (RZ) formatted input pulse trains, when the SOA is saturated with a strong continuous-wave (CW) input signal. A novel theoretical platform has been developed in the frequency domain, which reveals that the intensity modulation of the input pulse train can be suppressed by more than 10 dB at the output. This stems from the presence of the strong CW signal that transforms the sinusoidal transfer function of the interferometric switch into an almost flat, strongly nonlinear curve. This behavior has also been verified experimentally for both periodically and randomly degraded, in terms of intensity modulation, signals at 10 Gb/s using the ultrafast \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We propose a novel concept for the implementation of 2-dimensional (2D) optical phased arrays (OPAs) with end-fire waveguides as antenna elements (AEs), and we present its theoretical model and experimental proof. The concept is based on the use of 3-dimensional (3D) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with multiple waveguiding layers on the PolyBoard platform. In their simplest form, the 3D PICs comprise AEs at different layers, vertical and lateral couplers for the distribution of light among the AEs, and phase shifters for the execution of the 2D beam scanning process. Using the field equivalence principle, we model the radiated field from the single-mode waveguide of the platform at 1550 nm, and we find that the expected beam width is 12.7o. We also investigate the perturbation that is induced into propagating fields inside parallel waveguides in proximity, and we conclude that waveguide spacings down to 6 \u00b5m can be safely used for development of uniform OPAs in the PolyBoard platform. For OPAs with 6 \u00b5m pitch and 4 AEs, we find that the maximum steering angle is 14.0o and the expected angular clearance, wherein the main radiation lobe is higher than any grating lobe by at least 3, 6 and 10 dB is 10.8o, 7.6o and 2.8o, respectively. Based on our simulations, we design and fabricate single-and 2-layer PICs with 1\u00d7 4 and 2\u00d7 4 OPAs. The lateral pitch of the OPAs ranges from 10 down to 6 \u00b5m, while the vertical pitch is 7.2 \u00b5m. We experimentally characterize these OPAs and validate the potential of the 2-layer PICs for 2D beam scanning on the azimuthal and elevation plane.

            "Abstract": "Modern IoT and 5G applications are driving the growth of Internet traffic and impose stringent requirements to datacenter operators for keeping pace with the increasing bandwidth and low-latency demands. At the same time, datacenters suffer from increasing number of interconnections dictating the deployment of novel architectures and high-radix switches. The ratification of 400 GbE standard is driving the market of optical transceivers nevertheless, a technology upgrade will be soon necessary to meet the tremendous traffic growth. In this paper, we present the development of 800 Gb/s and 1Tb/s optical transceivers migrating to 100 Gbaud per lane and employing wafer-scale bonding of InP membranes and InP-DHBT electronics as well as advanced co-packaging schemes. The InP membrane platform is also exploited for the development of novel ultra-fast optical space switches based on a modular architecture \u2026",

In this communication we report on the implementation of all-optical 40 Gb/s 3R regeneration and label/payload separation sub-systems, operating with different-length packet-mode traffic and how these sub-systems find application in future AOLS networks.

On a larger scale, thermo-optic elements, thin-film elements and an InP gain chip have been integrated on the polyboard to realize a colorless, dual-polarization optical 90 hybrid as the frontend of a coherent receiver.

It relies on a simple delay interferometer with frequency periodicity twice as high as the input symbol rate and a subsequent optical band-pass filter. Simulation results at 40 Gbaud indicate the compatibility of the technique with a variety of advanced modulation formats. RZ-to-NRZ conversion of 40 Gb/s differential phase shift keying signals is experimentally demonstrated with 1.5 dB power penalty compared to the back-to-back measurement.",

Devices with these attributes are key elements for achieving network flexibility, fine granularity and efficient bandwidth-on-demand use. To this end, a header/payload separation circuit operating with IP-like packets, a clock and data recovery circuit handling asynchronous packets and a burst-mode receiver for bursty traffic are presented.

            "Abstract": "Flexible electronics have emerged as a very promising alternative of CMOS compatible electronics for a plethora of applications. Laser microfabrication techniques, such as selective laser patterning and sintering are compatible with flexible substrates and have demonstrated impressive results in the field of flexible electronic circuits and sensors. However, laser based manufacturing of radio frequency (RF) passive components or devices is still at an early stage. In this work we report on the all-laser fabrication of Silver Co-Planar Waveguides (CPWs) on polyethylene-naphthalate (PEN) substrates employing flat-top optics to achieve uniform laser fluence and thus high fabrication precision and reproducibility but also to mitigate the thermal effects of nanosecond laser pulses. The CPWs have been fabricated to match the impedance of 50 \u03a9 ports of an Anritsu vector network analyzer operating from 40 MHz to 40 GHz \u2026",

In today\u2019s \u201cstate of the art\u201d, it is possible to implement all-optical WC quite efficiently using Silicon Optical Amplifiers (SOA). Yet, the high sensitivity of error-performance to the randomly fluctuating relative-polarization of SOA optical-inputs, imposes rigid tuning requirements. In order to relax these requirements, a sufficient performance-margin must be provided to the channel. Obtaining this margin by means of Forward Error Correction (FEC) is commonplace nowadays. Inevitably though, existing/legacy FEC-methods will become insufficient as optical transparency scales. To substantially upgrade the performance of already-deployed SDH/SONET channels at an affordable overall cost, we propose a hybrid FEC-scheme.

The contribution of the project in the progress of a functional photonic integration is outlined, from device fabrication to device application focusing on photonic routing using multielement photonic chips. Specifically, we report on the transition from single-element to multielement photonic devices with the fabrication of hybrid integrated arrays of optical switches exploiting and upgrading the silica-on-silicon hybrid photonic integration. We demonstrate how the enhanced processing power and capacity of these components can be exploited to implement key functionalities required in next-generation fully integrated terabits per second photonic routers.",

The source operates at room temperature and uses an SOA as gain medium, a polarization maintaining fiber based Lyot filter and two nonlinear optical loop mirrors, which form a linear cavity. By using NOLMs as reflectors to form a linear cavity and by using only low loss, fibre components, the end-to-end loss in the cavity is minimised and thus, more channels may oscillate.",

First, a resilience node is evaluated for fast protection switching in 10.7 ms at the feeder segment. Optical switching is further exploited for the purpose of dynamic allocation of spectral slices and routing in a new class of reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer. The spectral bandwidth of drop segments can be extended on demand while intranetwork communication among different segments of the access network is also enabled.

Connections are overprovisioned so that they remain uninterrupted over several (e.g., 10) years, using high physical-layer margins to cover the evolution of the physical conditions and modeling uncertainties. As a first step, we can increase the efficiency without sacrificing network reliability by removing uncertainties and reducing long-term margins, observing and adjusting them at intermediate periods. This requires certain automation steps in monitoring and data processing. Increasing the efficiency further, and thus further reducing the margins, comes at a trade-off in reliability, and should be done according to service classes and the level of network automation.

We thoroughly investigate the integration of a BB84-QKD link, operating at telecom band, delivering quantum keys for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption engines of a packetized fronthaul layer interconnecting multiple 5G terminal nodes. Secure Key Rate calculations are studied for both dedicated and shared fiber configurations to identify the attack surface of AES-encrypted data links in each deployment scenario. We also propose a converged fiber-wireless scenario, exploiting a mesh networking extension operated by mmWave wireless links. In addition to the quantum layer performance, emphasis is placed on the strict requirements of 5G-oriented optical edge segments, such as the latency and the availability of quantum keys. We find that for the dark fiber case, secret keys can be distilled at fiber lengths much longer than the maximum fiber fronthaul distance corresponding to the round-trip latency barrier, for both P2P and P2MP topologies. On the contrary, the inelastic Raman scattering makes the simultaneous transmission of quantum and classical signals much more challenging. To counteract the contamination of noise photons, a resilient classical/QKD coexistence scheme is adopted. Motivated by the recent advancements in quantum technology roadmap, our analysis aims to introduce the QKD blocks as a pillar of the quantum-safe security framework of the 5G/B5G-oriented fronthaul infrastructure.

The PHOTOPOLIS consortium has identified polymer technology as the ideal solution for producing low-cost devices. The paper aims to discuss the status of polymer photonic components and subsystems able to generate, transmit and manage optical information in a cost effective manner.",

Optically switched, flatter network architectures more efficiently handle the east-west traffic profiles of modern data centers. Limitations in the port count and reconfiguration speed of optical switches require novel network designs offering network scalability and dynamicity. Interaction of the optically switched data plane with a software-defined control and orchestration framework, meeting current common practices in data centers, necessitates the design of custom network control algorithms and software modules as well as the integration of novel functionalities. The approach of the European project NEPHELE is presented, offering an endto- end solution that addresses the optical data plane, the control plane, and its interaction with the application layer.",

We experimentally demonstrate the ability of the ORCHESTRA solution for early detection and localization of failures, to preventively mitigate their impact, and thus guarantee smooth network operation. Then, leveraging machine learning for live performance estimation and closed-loop software-defined network control, we demonstrate a fully automated reconfiguration of marginless connections undergoing critical performance variations over 228 km of field-deployed fiber.",

For the first time, to our knowledge, the contribution of electrostriction to the generated crosstalk level in such systems is included in an analytical model. The critical parameters of the system are defined and analyzed and their impact on the formation of the nonlinear crosstalk is examined. The comparison between the theoretical results and the experimental data reveals very good agreement and has allowed the optimization of the performance of the system in terms of its critical parameters. For fixed channel numbers, twofold reduction in channel spacing increases the crosstalk by 3 dB/ch. For fixed channel spacing, doubling the number of channels results in 1 dB/ch crosstalk increase.",

Optical switching is gaining traction as a promising path for sustaining the explosive growth of DCNs; however, its practical deployment necessitates extensive modifications to the network architecture and operation, tailored to the technological particularities of optical switches (i.e. no buffering, limitations in radix size and speed). European project NEPHELE is developing an optical network infrastructure that leverages optical switching within a software-defined networking (SDN) framework to overcome the bandwidth and energy scaling challenges of datacenter networks.

We start our analysis from an optical signal with amplitude modulation by discrete microwave tones, and confirm the possibility to translate its optical phase shifts inside the matrix into equivalent phase shifts in the microwave domain. We show this is possible when the input is an optical single-side band signal and the optical carrier is reinserted before photodetection. We extend the conclusions to the case of an optical signal carrying a microwave with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and the case of simultaneous inputs at the M input ports.

Besides their limited capacity, electrical wiring technologies impose great energy and size limitations originating from the requirements to handle the vast amount of information that needs to be exchanged across all hierarchical communication levels within Data Centers and HPCs, ie rack-to-rack, backplane, chip-to-chip and on-chip interconnections. This reality has inevitably led to a clearly shaped roadmap for bringing optics into the spotlight and replacing electrical with optical interconnects, thereby overtaking the bottleneck in traffic exchange imposed by electrical wires [1]. Hence, the optical technology should penetrate into intra-rack and board-to-board transmission links, considering that the optical fiber as a large-bandwidth transmission medium [2] is used only in commercial systems for rack-torack communication [3].",

Their main benefit is that they allow access via an optical fiber from the top and therefore there is no need to dice the chip and prepare the facets crucially. In the PLATON project grating couplers were designed to couple TM mode into and out of the SOI waveguides. Simulations came up with a grating coupler layout capable of theoretical coupling losses lower than 3dB for 1550 nm in TM configuration. A fully etched grating structure was chosen for fabrication simplicity and the optimal filling factor was found. The structures were fabricated using proximity error correction (PEC) and show a uniform coupling efficiency for all couplers. Therefore they are well-suited for all applications which demand for stable fiber-to-chip coupling. The spectral response of the structures was measured from 1500 to 1580 nm with 2 nm step and measuring the fiber \u2026",

The study aims to explore the imposed limitations considering the coexistence of weak quantum channels with realistic traffic flows of classical streams through shared fiber infrastructures. Based on a `plug and play' phase coding DV-QKD implementation, we conducted numerical simulations of the QBER and the secure key rate for fiber distances up to 10 km. The reported results suggest that in a fixed C-band grid, the spectral isolation between classical and quantum channels is essential at dense grids. By removing the leakage noise through stronger spectral isolation, the photons linked with the Raman scattering become the dominant noise source, since this mechanism covers an ultra-broadband \u2026",

In this backdrop, optical switching is gaining momentum as a potential path for gracefully scaling datacenter networks, due to its inherent speed, energy efficiency and transparency to bitrate and protocol. European project NEPHELE is developing an optical network infrastructure that leverages optical switching within a software-defined networking (SDN) framework to overcome the bandwidth and energy scaling challenges of datacenter networks. Within this project, a vertically integrated optical datacenter network test-bed prototype was set up and its operation was demonstrated in lab environment. Different scenarios \u2026",

The Lab-on-Chip was tested on milk (aflatoxin M1, antibiotics and lactose), olive oil (pesticides and metals), nuts (aflatoxin B1) and dehydrated fruits (ochratoxin A). BIOFOS combines the most promising concepts from the photonic, biological, nanochemical and fluidic parts of Lab-on-Chip systems, aiming to achieve low sensitivity and high specificity, excellent reliability and compactness. Current methodologies for detection of food contamination based on heavy analytical tools cannot guarantee a safe and stable food supply. The reasons are the complexity, the long time-to-result (2-3 days) and the cost of these tools, which limit the number of samples that can be practically analyzed at food processing and storage sites.

            "Abstract": "Concept Despite the promise of Silicon Photonics (SiPh) towards next-generation deployments seamlessly combining the on-chip advanced optical functionality with efficient E/O and O/E conversion, their wide penetration across all communication layers is currently hindered by the lack of efficient and scalable optical input-outputs (I/O) that can be realized using standard low-cost assembly equipment. To this end, diffraction-based structures, such as grating couplers, have been lately superseded by in-place coupling solutions employing inverse tapers [1] or metamaterial waveguides [2] in order to achieve coupling to SMFs through spot-size conversion. Nevertheless, those structures suffer from either increased fabrication complexity, including material engineering and undercut waveguide sections, or considerable losses due to poor mode matching. Recently, a very interesting concept was presented by Soganci et al.[3], proposing a compliant polymer interface between SMFs and nanophotonic waveguides, relying on adiabatic coupling. The first experimental demonstration of the interface [4] revealed the necessity of a well-defined, angled adhesive gap so as contain the scattering loss at the chip edge that is degrading the performance. However, considering the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the polymer and the SiPh chip, such an accurate control over the adhesive gap will significantly increase the intricacy of the assembly process.In the current manuscript we propose and simulate, an adiabatic coupling scheme between a 2 degrees angled 3D glass waveguide and a SiPh platform, as shown in Fig. 1.

The use of the cyclomer loading having a higher TO coefficient than polymethyl methacrylate has resulted to the smallest footprint among plasmonic MZI TO switches reported so far.",

Ongoing advancements in network infrastructure that ride on Moore\u2019s law are unable to keep up, necessitating the introduction of multiplexing and advanced modulation formats for optical interconnects in order to overcome bandwidth limitations, and scale lane speeds with energy- and cost-efficiency to 100 Gb/s and beyond. While the jury is still out as to how this will be achieved, schemes relying on intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) are regarded as particularly attractive, due to their inherent implementation simplicity. Moreover, the scaling-out of datacenters calls for longer transmission reach exceeding 300 m, requiring single-mode solutions. In this work we advocate using 16-QAM sub-cycle Nyquist-SCM as a simpler alternative to discrete multitone (DMT), but which is still more bandwidth-efficient than PAM-4.
