We prove the highly nontrivial result that cut is a derived rule in GLTS, a result that is unavailable in other known first-order extensions of GL. This leads to proofs of weak reflection and the related conservation result for ML 3, as well as proofs for Craig\u2019s interpolation theorem for GLTS. Turning to semantics we prove that ML 3 is sound with respect to arithmetical interpretations and that it is also sound and complete with respect to converse well-founded and transitive finite Kripke models. This leads us to expect that a Solovay-like proof of arithmetical completeness of ML 3 is possible.",

We obtain this result here for a complete Logic.

            "Abstract": "The authors of [11] initiated the (syntactic) proof theoretic study of the first-order modal logics M3 and BM that were originally introduced in [5, 14, 15]. The principal tool in [11] was the \u201cGentzenisation\u201d of said logics, in the paradigm of [8, 9, 16], and cut elimination. In this paper we introduce a new technique based on formula to formula mappings that we call \u201cformulators\u201d, which preserve provability. As applications we present both positive and negative metatheoretical results for three logics: the aforementioned M3; another logic, ML3, that we introduce here as a first-order counterpart of the logic GL (of [2, 6, 8, 9, 16]); and for the quantified version of GL, QGL, obtained from classical first order logic by adding the GL axiom-schemata without requiring\u2013as we do for M3 and ML3\u2013that DA is always closed. QGL is a logic that does not allow cut elimination ([1])\u2013that is, its natural Gentzen equivalent does not\u2013and this demonstrates the significance of the formulator tool; not only allows simple proofs, bypassing two highly non trivial steps for the logic under study\u2013namely, Gentzenisation and cut elimination\u2013but it also finds application to predicative modal logics, such as QGL, where cut elimination is provably impossible. Among the positive results we prove that the weak reflection property and the conservation property hold for all of M3, ML3 and QGL. We also establish the negative results that neither A\u2192 DA nor DA\u2192 A are provable in any of the",

A wealth of programming-like examples and easy-to-follow explanations build the general theory gradually, which guides readers through the modeling and mathematical analysis of computational phenomena and provides insights on what makes things tick and also what restrains the ability of computational processes. Recognizing the importance of acquired practical experience, the book begins with the metatheory of general purpose computer programs, using URMs as a straightforward, technology-independent model of modern high-level programming languages while also exploring the restrictions of the URM language. Once readers gain an understanding of computability theory\u2014including the primitive recursive functions\u2014the author presents automata and languages, covering the regular and context-free languages as well as the machines that recognize these languages. Several advanced topics such as reducibilities, the recursion theorem, complexity theory, and Cook's theorem are also discussed.

            "Abstract": "Reference [12] introduced a novel formula to formula translation tool (\u201cformula-tors\u201d) that enables syntactic metatheoretical investigations of first-order modallogics, bypassing a need to convert them first into Gentzen style logics in order torely on cut elimination and the subformula property. In fact, the formulator tool, as was already demonstrated in loc. cit., is applicable even to the metatheoreticalstudy of logics such as QGL, where cut elimination is (provably,[2]) unavailable. This paper applies the formulator approach to show the independence of the axiom schema\u2610 A\u2192\u2610\u2200 x A of the logics M 3 and ML 3 of [17, 18, 11, 13]. This leads to the conclusion that the two logics obtained by removing this axiom are incomplete, both with respect to their natural Kripke structures and to arithmetical interpretations. In particular, the so modified ML 3 is, similarly to QGL, an arithmetically incomplete first-order extension of GL, but, unlike QGL, all its theorems have cut free proofs. We also establish here, via formulators, a stronger version of the disjunction property for GL and QGL without going through Gentzen versions of these logics (compare with the more complexproofs in [2, 8]).",

            "Abstract": "A well established technique toward developing the proof theory of a Hilbert-style modal logic is to introduce a Gentzen-style equivalent (a Gentzenisation), then develop the proof theory of the latter, and finally transfer the metatheoretical results to the original logic (eg,[1, 6, 8, 18, 10, 12]). In the first-order modal case, on one hand we know that the Gentzenisation of the straightforward first-order extension of GL, the logic QGL, admits no cut elimination (if the rule is included as primitive; or, if not included, then the rule is not admissible [1]). On the other hand the (cut-free) Gentzenisations of the first-order modal logics M3 and ML3 of [10, 12] do have cut as an admissible rule. The syntactic cut admissibility proof given in [18] for the Gentzenisation of the propositional provability logic GL is extremely complex, and it was the basis of the proofs of cut admissibility of the Gentzenisations of M3 and ML3, where the presence of quantifiers and quantifier rules added to the complexity and length of the proof. A recent proof of cut admissibility in a cut-free Gentzenisation of GL is given in [5] and is quite short and easy to read. We adapt it here to revisit the proofs for the cases of M3 and ML3, resulting to similarly short and easy to read proofs, only slightly complicated by the presence of quantification and its relevant rules.",

It can be used as a text in an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course in mathematics, computer science, or philosophy. The volumes are written in a user-friendly conversational lecture style that makes them equally effective for self-study or class use. Volume II, on formal (ZFC) set theory, incorporates a self-contained'chapter 0'on proof techniques so that it is based on formal logic, in the style of Bourbaki. The emphasis on basic techniques will provide the reader with a solid foundation in set theory and provides a context for the presentation of advanced topics such as absoluteness, relative consistency results, two expositions of Godel's constructible universe, numerous ways of viewing recursion, and a chapter on Cohen forcing.",

            "Abstract": "A comprehensive and user-friendly guide to the use of logic in mathematical reasoning Mathematical Logic presents a comprehensive introduction to formal methods of logic and their use as a reliable tool for deductive reasoning. With its user-friendly approach, this book successfully equips readers with the key concepts and methods for formulating valid mathematical arguments that can be used to uncover truths across diverse areas of study such as mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. The book develops the logical tools for writing proofs by guiding readers through both the established\" Hilbert\" style of proof writing, as well as the\" equational\" style that is emerging in computer science and engineering applications. Chapters have been organized into the two topical areas of Boolean logic and predicate logic. Techniques situated outside formal logic are applied to illustrate and demonstrate significant facts regarding the power and limitations of logic, such as: Logic can certify truths and only truths. Logic can certify all absolute truths (completeness theorems of Post and G\u00f6del). Logic cannot certify all\" conditional\" truths, such as those that are specific to the Peano arithmetic. Therefore, logic has some serious limitations, as shown through G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem. Numerous examples and problem sets are provided throughout the text, further facilitating readers' understanding of the capabilities of logic to discover mathematical truths. In addition, an extensive appendix introduces Tarski semantics and proceeds with detailed proofs of completeness and first incompleteness theorems, while also providing a self-contained \u2026",
