We also provide conditions, for the global existence of solutions. Our results, consider both the conservative and the linearly damped lattice. Similarities and differences with the continuous counterparts, are remarked. We also make a short comment, on the existence of excitation thresholds, for forced solutions of damped and parametrically driven, Klein-Gordon lattices.",

The numerical studies performed indicate that these bounds behave as thresholds for the existence of periodic solutions. The fixed point method considers the case of infinite lattices. Through this method, the existence of a threshold is proved in the case of saturable nonlinearity and an explicit theoretical estimate which is independent on the dimension is given. The numerical studies, testing the efficiency of the bounds derived by both methods, demonstrate that these thresholds are quite sharp estimates of a threshold value on the power needed for the the existence of a breather solution.

We also distinguish between the excitation threshold (the positive minimum of the power observed when the dimension of the lattice is greater or equal to some critical value) and explicit analytical lower bounds on the power (predicting the smallest value of the power a discrete breather one-parameter family), which are valid for any dimension. Extended numerical studies in one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices justify that the theoretical bounds can be considered as thresholds \u2026",

Theoretical and numerical results are presented, concerning the existence and nonexistence of periodic solutions. The existence results obtained via constrained minimization problems or by a fixed point argument, refer to the DNLS equation, in multidimensional lattices, supplemented with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and sometimes also in infinite lattices. Explicit upper and lower bounds on the total power of the periodic solutions are derived, and numerical studies are performed which test their efficiency. The bounds and thresholds derived for the DNLS equation with saturable and power nonlinearity, are also discussed in comparison with the existing results on the existence of excitation thresholds for periodic solutions, and their dependence on the dimension of the lattice.",

By using energy arguments, it is found that the collapse dynamics is chiefly controlled by the linear/nonlinear gain/loss strengths. We identify a critical value of the linear gain, separating the possible decay of solutions to the trivial zero-state, from collapse. The numerical simulations, performed for a wide class of initial data, are found to be in very good agreement with the analytical results, and reveal long-time stability properties of localized solutions. The role of the higher-order effects to the transient dynamics is also revealed in these simulations.",

These differences concern the coexistence or the existence of staggered and unstaggered breather profile patterns. We also distinguish between the excitation threshold (the positive minimum of the power observed when the dimension of the lattice is greater or equal to some critical value) and explicit analytical lower bounds on the power (predicting the smallest value of the power a discrete breather one-parameter family), which are valid for any dimension. Extended numerical studies in one, two and three dimensional lattices justify that the theoretical bounds can be considered as thresholds for the existence of the frequency parametrized families. The discussion reviews and extends the issue of the excitation threshold in lattices with nonlinear impu- rities while lower bounds, with respect to the kinetic energy, are also discussed for traveling waves in FPU periodic lattices.",

We find that the competition between the third-order dispersion and stimulated Raman scattering effects gives rise to rich dynamics: this extends from Poincar\u00e9-Bendixson\u2013type scenarios, in the sense that bounded solutions may converge either to distinct equilibria via orbital connections or to space-time periodic solutions, to the emergence of almost periodic and chaotic behavior. One of our main results is that third-order dispersion has a dominant role in the development of such complex dynamics, since it can be chiefly responsible (even in the absence of other higher-order effects) for the existence of periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic spatiotemporal structures. Suitable low-dimensional phase-space diagnostics are devised and \u2026",

Given the periodic structure of the latter, we compute the corresponding Floquet multipliers, and examine them in the limit where the period of the orbit tends to infinity. This way, we extrapolate towards the stability of the limiting structure, namely the Peregrine soliton.

            "Abstract": "In this work, a systematic study, examining the propagation of periodic and solitary waves along the magnetic field in a cold collision-free plasma, is presented. Employing the quasi-neutral approximation and the conservation of momentum flux and energy flux in the frame co-traveling with the wave, the exact analytical solution of the stationary solitary pulse is found analytically in terms of particle densities, parallel and transverse velocities, as well as transverse magnetic fields. Subsequently, this solution is generalized in the form of periodic waveforms represented by cnoidal-type waves. These considerations are fully analytical in the case where the total angular momentum flux L, due to the ion and electron motion together with the contribution due to the Maxwell stresses, vanishes. A graphical representation of all associated fields is also provided.",

For a conservative system, we consider the global in time solvability and the question of existence of standing wave solutions. Similarities and differences with the continuous counterpart (NLS-partial differential equation) are pointed out. For a dissipative system we prove existence of a global attractor and its stability under finite-dimensional approximations. Similar questions are treated in a weighted phase space. Finally, we propose possible extensions for various types of DNLS equations.",

When the domain is whole space, there are many results concerning the nonexistence of global solutions (or existence of blow-up solutions) for the equation. For the case of a general domain, there are few studies of blowing-up conditions. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the nonexistence of global solutions in a deformed tube-shaped domain which is not star-shaped.",

            "Abstract": "We propose analytical lower and upper estimates on the excitation threshold for breathers (in the form of spatially localized and time periodic solutions) in DNLS lattices with power nonlinearity. The estimation depending explicitly on the lattice parameters, is derived by a combination of a comparison argument on appropriate lower bounds depending on the frequency of each solution with a simple and justified heuristic argument. The numerical studies verify that the analytical estimates can be of particular usefulness, as a simple analytical detection of the activation energy for breathers in DNLS lattices.",

For our Schr\u00f6dinger chain example, we present rigorous arguments that establish necessary conditions and corresponding parametric bounds for the transition between linear decay and nonlinear persistence of a defect mode. The proofs combine a contraction mapping approach applied to the fully dynamical problem in the case of a 3D-lattice, together with variational arguments for the derivation of parametric bounds for the creation of stationary states associated with the expected fate of the self-trapping dynamical transition. The results are relevant for both power law nonlinearities and saturable ones. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical computations. The latter are performed for cases of different dimension.",

Although the AL model possesses an explicit time-periodic solution known as the Kuznetsov\u2013Ma (KM) breather, the existence of time-periodic solutions away from the integrable limit has not been studied as of yet. It is thus the purpose of this work to shed light on the existence and stability of time-periodic solutions of the Salerno model. In particular, we vary the homotopy parameter of the model by employing a pseudo-arclength continuation algorithm where time-periodic solutions are identified via fixed-point iterations. We show that the solutions transform into time-periodic patterns featuring small, yet non-decaying far-field oscillations. Remarkably, our \u2026",
