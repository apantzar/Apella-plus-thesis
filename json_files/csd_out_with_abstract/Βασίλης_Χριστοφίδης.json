            "Abstract": "In order to cope with the expected size of the Semantic Web (SW) in the coming years, we need to benchmark existing SW tools (e.g., query language interpreters) in a credible manner. In this paper we present the first RDFS schema generator, termed PoweRGen, which takes into account the morphological features that schemas frequently exhibit in reality. In particular, we are interested in generating synthetically the two core components of an RDFS schema, namely the property (relationships between classes or attributes) and the subsumption (subsumption relationships among classes) graph. The total-degree distribution of the former, as well as the out-degree distribution of the Transitive Closure (TC) of the latter, usually follow a power-law. PoweRGen produces synthetic property and subsumption graphs whose distributions respect the power-law exponents given as input with a confidence ranging \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this article we present RoSeS (Really Open Simple and Efficient Syndication), a generic framework for content-based RSS feed querying and aggregation. RoSeS is based on a data-centric approach, using a combination of standard database concepts like declarative query languages, views and multi-query optimization. Users create personalized feeds by defining and composing content-based filtering and aggregation queries on collections of RSS feeds. Publishing these queries corresponds to defining views which can then be used for building new queries/feeds. This naturally reflects the publish-subscribe nature of RSS applications. The contributions presented in this article are a declarative RSS feed aggregation language, an extensible stream algebra for building efficient continuous multiquery execution plans for RSS aggregation views, a multi-query optimization strategy for these plans and a running prototype based on a multi-threaded asynchronous execution engine.",

            "Abstract": "The Linked Data Paradigm is one of the most promising technologies for publishing, sharing, and connecting data on the Web, and offers a new way for data integration and interoperability. However, the proliferation of distributed, inter-connected sources of information and services on the Web poses significant new challenges for managing consistently a huge number of large datasets and their interdependencies. In this paper we focus on the key problem of preserving evolving structured interlinked data. We argue that a number of issues that hinder applications and users are related to the temporal aspect that is intrinsic in linked data. We present a number of real use cases to motivate our approach, we discuss the problems that occur, and propose a direction for a solution.",

Typically, a digital library is a vast collection of objects, which are stored and maintained by multiple information sources, including databases, image banks, file systems, e-mail systems, the WWW, and others. These information sources are typically heterogeneous, in terms of how the objects are stored, organized and managed, and may exist on different platforms. Furthermore, the information sources in digital libraries are evolutionary in the sense that they may be included to or removed from the system. Thus, there is a need to provide the users with the ability to seamlessly and transparently access digital library objects in spite of the heterogeneity and dynamism among the information sources.",

            "Abstract": "This book presents perspectives on the knowledge creation metaphor of learning, and elaborates the trialogical approach to learning. The knowledge creation metaphor differs from both the acquisition and the participation metaphors. In a nutshell trialogical approaches seek to engage learners in joint work with shared objects and artefacts mediated by collaboration technology. The theoretical underpinnings stem from different origins, including Bereiter and Scardamalia\u2019s theory on knowledge building and Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s activity theory. The authors in this collection introduce key concepts and techniques, explain tools designed and developed to support knowledge creation, and report results from case studies in specific contexts. The book chapters integrate theoretical, methodological, empirical and technological research, to elaborate the empirical findings and to explain the design of the knowledge creation tools. The target audiences for this book are researchers, teachers and Human Resource developers interested in new perspectives on collaborative learning, technology-mediated knowledge creation, and applications of this in their own settings, for higher education, teacher training and workplace learning. The book is the result of joint efforts from many contributors who took part in the Knowledge-practices Laboratory (KP-Lab) project (2006-2011) supported by EU FP6.",

            "Abstract": "Personalized access and content syndication involving diverse conceptual representations of information resources are two of the key challenges of Semantic Web (SW) applications. In this paper, we investigate how these goals can be achieved using view definition primitives over RDF/S bases. We introduce a full-fledged view definition language, RVL, for creating virtual RDF/S resource descriptions and schemas from (meta)classes, properties, and resource descriptions, and we illustrate how RVL views can be composed with structured RDF/S queries expressed in a query language like RQL, by means of an internal logical framework capturing the semantics of the RDF/S model, RQL queries and RVL views.",

Despite the plethora of SW languages (eg, RDF/S, OWL) recently proposed for supporting large-scale information interoperation, the vast majority of legacy sources still rely on relational databases (RDB) published on the Web or corporate intranets as virtual XML. In this article, we advocate a first-order logic framework for mediating high-level queries to relational and/or XML sources using community ontologies expressed in a SW language such as RDF/S. We describe the architecture and reasoning services of our SW integration middleware, termed SWIM, and we present the main design choices and techniques for supporting powerful mappings between different data models, as well as reformulation and optimization of queries expressed against mediator ontologies and views.",

            "Abstract": "Metadata are widely used in order to fully exploit information resources available on corporate intranets or the Internet. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) aims at facilitating the creation and exchange of metadata as any other Web data. The growing number of available information resources and the proliferation of description services in various user communities, lead nowadays to large volumes of RDF metadata. Managing such RDF resource descriptions and schemas with existing low-level APIs and file-based implementations does not ensure fast deployment and easy maintenance of real-scale RDF applications. In this paper, we advocate the use of database technology to support declarative access, as well as, logical and physical independence for voluminous RDF description bases. We present RDFSuite, a suite of tools for RDF validation, storage and querying. Specifically, we introduce a formal data model for RDF description bases created using multiple schemas. Next, we present the design of a persistent RDF Store (RSSDB) for loading resource descriptions in an ORDBMS by exploring the available RDF schema knowledge. Our approach preserves the flexibility of RDF in refining schemas and/or enriching descriptions at any time, whilst it outperforms, both in storage volumes and query execution time, other approaches using a monolithic table to represent resource descriptions and schemas under the form of triples. Last, we briefly present RQL, a declarative language for querying both RDF descriptions and schemas, and sketch query evaluation on top of RSSDB.",

Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) have been proposed to support sophisticated facilities in exchanging, querying and integrating (semi-)structured data hosted by peers. In this paper, we are interested in routing graph queries in a very large PDMS, where peers advertise their local bases using fragments of community RDF/S schemes (i.e., views). We introduce an original encoding for these fragments, in order to efficiently check whether a peer view is subsumed by a query. We rely on this encoding to design an RDF/S view lookup service featuring a statefull and a stateless execution over a DHT-based P2P infrastructure.

Entity Resolution (ER) aims to identify descriptions of the same real-world entity within one or across knowledge bases in the Web of data. To reduce the required number of pairwise comparisons among descriptions, ER methods typically perform a pre-processing step, called blocking, which places similar entity descriptions into blocks and thus only compare descriptions within the same block. We experimentally evaluate several blocking methods proposed for the Web of data using real datasets, whose characteristics significantly impact their effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed experimental evaluation framework allows us to better understand the characteristics of the missed matching entity descriptions and contrast them with ground truth obtained from different kinds of relatedness links.",

Given the limitations of Fog in terms of limited computational resources that can also be shared among multiple analytics with continuous operators over data streams, we introduce a holistic cost model that accounts both the network and computational resources available in the Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture. Then, we propose scheduling algorithms RCS and SOO-CPLEX for placing continuous operators for data stream analytics at the network edge. The former dynamically places continuous operators between the Cloud and the Fog according to the evolution of data streams rates and uses as less as possible Fog computational resources to satisfy the constraints regarding the usage of both computational and network resources.

In this context, addressing the evolution of RDF/S knowledge bases while respecting associated constraints is a challenging issue, yet to receive a formal treatment. We provide a theoretical framework for dealing with both schema and data change requests. We define the notion of a rational change operator as one that satisfies the belief revision principles of Success, Validity and Minimal Change. The semantics of such an operator are subject to customization, by tuning the properties that a rational change should adhere to. We prove some interesting theoretical results and propose a general-purpose algorithm for implementing rational change operators in knowledge bases with integrity constraints, which allows us to handle uniformly any possible change request in a provably rational and consistent \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Real-scale Semantic Web applications, such as Web Portals and E-Marketplaces, require the management of voluminous metadata repositories containing descriptive information (ie, metadata) about the available Web resources and services. Better knowledge about the meaning, usage, accessibility or quality of these resources and services will considerably facilitate the automated processing of both Web content and services. In this context, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) enables the creation and exchange of metadata as any other Web data. Although large volumes of RDF descriptions are already appearing (eg, as exported Portal catalogs or service descriptions), sufficiently expressive declarative languages for querying both RDF descriptions and schemas are still missing. In this paper, we propose RQL, a new RDF query language, relying on a formal graph model that permits the interpretation of superimposed resource descriptions. RQL is an OQL-inspired adaptation of XML query languages to the peculiarities of RDF but, foremost, is an extension of this functionality for uniformly querying both descriptions and schemas. We illustrate the syntax, semantics and core functionality of RQL by means of a set of benchmark queries and report on the performance of RSSDB, our persistent RDF Store, for storing and querying voluminous RDF descriptions.",

            "Abstract": "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is a rapidly rising subfield of Machine Learning. AutoML aims to fully automate the machine learning process end-to-end, democratizing Machine Learning to non-experts and drastically increasing the productivity of expert analysts. So far, most comparisons of AutoML systems focus on quantitative criteria such as predictive performance and execution time. In this paper, we examine AutoML services for predictive modeling tasks from a user\u2019s perspective, going beyond predictive performance. We present a wide palette of criteria and dimensions on which to evaluate and compare these services as a user. This qualitative comparative methodology is applied on seven AutoML systems, namely Auger. AI, BigML, H2O\u2019s Driverless AI, Darwin, Just Add Data Bio, Rapid-Miner, and Watson. The comparison indicates the strengths and weaknesses of each service, the needs that it covers, the segment of users that is most appropriate for, and the possibilities for improvements.",

Furthermore, we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either on-the-fly (ISA, NOISA, Hybrid), or by precomputing the transitive closure of subsumption relationships (MatView, URI, ID). The main conclusion drawn from our experiments is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over RDF/S stores utilizing the Hybrid and MatView \u2026",

Various ontologies and knowledge bases with millions of RDF triples from Wikipedia and other sources, mostly in e-science, have been created and are publicly available. Recording provenance information of RDF triples aggregated from different heterogeneous sources is crucial in order to effectively support trust mechanisms, digital rights and privacy policies. Managing provenance becomes even more important when we consider not only explicitly stated but also implicit triples (through RDFS inference rules) in conjunction with declarative languages for querying and updating RDF graphs. In this paper we rely on colored RDF triples represented as quadruples to capture and manipulate explicit provenance information.",

In this work, we provide a comprehensive and cohesive overview of the key research results in the area of entity resolution. We are interested in frameworks addressing the new challenges in entity resolution posed by the Web of data in which real world entities are described by interlinked data rather than documents. Since such descriptions are usually partial, overlapping and sometimes evolving, entity resolution emerges as a central problem both to increase dataset linking, but also to search the Web of data for entities and their relations. We focus on Web-scale blocking, iterative and progressive solutions for entity resolution. Specifically, to reduce the required number of comparisons, blocking is performed to place similar descriptions into blocks and executes comparisons to identify matches only between \u2026",

Compared to logic frameworks formulating course sequencing as a planning problem, our work relies on a set-theoretic framework for generating course sequences using preference-based queries. We introduce the concept of ordered partition for sequencing, and the ordered product of partitions, when it is necessary to combine more than one preference orderings. In our context, ordered partitions originate from preferences expressed over general relations, rather than on functional attributes of traditional database tuples (or objects) addressed by other approaches.

These expressions capture accurately the meaning of its navigation steps through the class (or property) subsumption and/or associations.

Alternatively, abstract provenance models can capture the relationship between query results and source data by taking into account the employed query operators. The authors argue the benefits of the latter for settings in which query results are materialized in several repositories and analyzed by multiple users.

In order to identify and link meaningful and relevant information, clustering algorithms have been used to partition the user generated content. We have identified though that these algorithms exhibit various shortcomings when they have to deal with social media textual information, which is dynamic and streaming in nature. Thus we explore the idea to estimate the algorithms\u2019 parameters based on observations on the clusters\u2019 properties\u2019 (like the centroid, shape and density) evolution. By experimenting with the clusters\u2019 properties, we propose a methodological framework that detects the evolution of the clusters\u2019 centroid, shape and density and explores their role in parameters\u2019 estimation.",

When a user addresses a query to the library, the library returns the URLs of documents satisfying the query.

Extensive work on similar applications for relational data and queries has shown that data provenance can be used in order to compute trustworthiness, reputation and reliability of query results, based on the source data and query operators involved in their derivation. In particular, abstract provenance models can be employed to record information about source data and query operators during query evaluation, and later be used e.g., to assess trust for individual query results. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which relational provenance models can be leveraged for capturing the provenance of SPARQL queries over linked data, and identify their limitations.

Unfortunately, it is not trivial, in general, to understand why a given sample (record) is labelled as an anomaly and thus diagnose its root causes. We propose the following reduced-dimensionality, surrogate model approach to explain detector decisions: approximate the detection model with another one that employs only a small subset of features. Subsequently, samples can be visualized in this low-dimensionality space for human understanding. To this end, we develop PROTEUS, an AutoML pipeline to produce the surrogate model, specifically designed for feature selection on imbalanced datasets. The PROTEUS surrogate model can not only explain the training data, but also the out-of-sample (unseen) data. In other words, PROTEUS produces predictive explanations by approximating the \u2026",

The main purpose of this work is thus to thoroughly investigate a mapping between established and recently proposed objective metrics and user QoE. We obtain ground truth QoE via user experiments where we collect and analyze 3,400 Web accesses annotated with QoS metrics and explicit user ratings in a scale of 1 to 5, which we make available to the community.

In this paper, we present sound and complete algorithms for the containment and minimization of RDF/S query patterns. More precisely, we consider two widely used RDF/S query fragments supporting pattern matching at the data, but also, at the schema level. To this end, we advocate a logic framework for capturing the RDF/S data model and semantics and we employ well-established techniques proposed in the relational context, in particular, the Chase and Backchase algorithms.",

            "Abstract": "A cornerstone issue in the realization of the Semantic Web (SW) vision is the achievement of semantic interoperability among legacy data sources spread worldwide. In order to capture information semantics in a machine processable way, various ontology-based formalisms have been recently proposed (eg, RDF/S [20, 5], DAML+ OIL [27], OWL [10]). However, the vast majority of existing legacy data is not yet in RDF/S or any other SW language [23, 25]. As a matter of fact, most of the data is physically stored in relational database (RDB) systems and actually published on the Web or corporate intranets as virtual XML. SW applications, however, require to view data as virtual RDF, valid instance of a domain or application specific RDF/S schema, and to be able to manipulate them with high-level query languages, such as RQL [18] or RVL [24]. Therefore, we need middleware systems that can either republish XML as RDF, or publish RDB data directly as RDF, or-even better-be capable of doing both. Sometimes the practical solution will be to rely just on the virtual XML schema and XML query interface of an existing XML publishing system. At other times, the SW publishing middleware will be built as an alternative to the XML publishing system, taking advantage of direct access to the underlying RDB management system (RDBMS). It is also possible that the SW middleware will have to integrate data in some RDBMS with data in native XML storage. We need to deal flexibly with all these situations in a uniform framework. A decade of experience with information integration architectures based on mediators [8, 29, 26, 21] suggests that it is highly \u2026",

These data sets are valuable and many of them are either impossible to reproduce (e.g. climate and demographic data) or can only be recovered at enormous costs (e.g. data from high energy physics experiments). While substantial investment has been made in archiving and preserving conventional forms of these objects, such as documents, images and numerical data in some file format, the need to preserve entire databases has only recently emerged. Databases differ from fixed digital objects studied in the past, in that they change over time, they have internal structure, and they include schemas and integrity constraints, which are basic for the current and future interpretation of the data. Increasingly, database technology is being used in the storage of large numerical scientific data sets.",

We advocate for the use of labeling schemes for modeling these hierarchies in order to efficiently answer queries such as subsumption check, descendants, ancestors or nearest common ancestor, which usually require costly transitive closure computations. We first give a qualitative comparison of three main families of schemes, namely bit vector, prefix and interval based schemes. We then show that two labeling schemes are good candidates for an efficient implementation of label querying using standard relational DBMS, namely the Dewey prefix scheme and an interval scheme by Agrawal et al. We compare their storage and query evaluation performance for the 16 ODP hierarchies using the PostgreSQL engine.",

            "Abstract": "Query optimization in RDF Stores is a challenging problem as SPARQL queries typically contain many more joins than equivalent relational plans, and hence lead to a large join order search space. In such cases, cost-based query optimization often is not possible. One practical reason for this is that statistics typically are missing in web scale setting such as the Linked Open Datasets (LOD). The more profound reason is that due to the absence of schematic structure in RDF, join-hit ratio estimation requires complicated forms of correlated join statistics; and currently there are no methods to identify the relevant correlations beforehand. For this reason, the use of good heuristics is essential in SPARQL query optimization, even in the case that are partially used with cost-based statistics (ie, hybrid query optimization). In this paper we describe a set of useful heuristics for SPARQL query optimizers. We present these in the context of a new Heuristic SPARQL Planner (HSP) that is capable of exploiting the syntactic and the structural variations of the triple patterns in a SPARQL query in order to choose an execution plan without the need of any cost model. For this, we define the variable graph and we show a reduction of the SPARQL query optimization problem to the maximum weight independent set problem. We implemented our planner on top of the MonetDB open source column-store and evaluated its effectiveness against the state-ofthe-art RDF-3X engine as well as comparing the plan quality with a relational (SQL) equivalent of the benchmarks.",

            "Abstract": "This demonstration presents MeowsReader, a real-time news ranking and filtering prototype. MeowsReader illustrates how a general class of continuous top-k queries offers a suitable abstraction for modeling and implementing real-time search services over highly dynamic information streams combining keyword search and realtime web signals about information items. Users express their interest by simple text queries and continuously receive the best matching results in an alert-like environment. The main innovative feature are dynamic item scores which take account of information decay, real-time web attention and other online user feedback. Additionally, a trends detection mechanism automatically generates trending entities from the input streams, which can smoothly be added to user profiles in form of keyword queries.",

Key areas for study are identified, including behavioral service signatures, verification and synthesis techniques for composite services, analysis of service data manipulation commands, and XML analysis applied to service specifications. We give a sample of the relevant results and techniques in each of these areas.",

However, the proliferation of distributed, interconnected linked data sources on the Web poses significant new challenges for consistently managing the vast number of potentially large datasets and their interdependencies. In this article we focus on the key problem of preserving evolving structured interlinked data. We argue that a number of issues, which hinder applications and users, are related to the temporal aspect that is intrinsic in Linked Data. We present three use cases to motivate our approach, we discuss problems that occur, and propose a direction for a solution.",

In this work, we focus on entity resolution in the Web of data, i.e., identifying descriptions that refer to the same real-world entity. To reduce the required number of pairwise comparisons, methods for entity resolution perform blocking as a pre-processing step. A blocking technique places similar entity descriptions into blocks and executes comparisons only between descriptions within the same block. We experimentally evaluate blocking techniques proposed for the Web of data and present dataset characteristics that determine the effectiveness and efficiency of such methods. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the missed matching entity descriptions and examine different types of links that blocking techniques can potentially identify.",

In addition, RUL supports fine-grained updates at the class and property instance level, set-oriented updates with a deterministic semantics and takes benefit of the full expressive power of RQL for restricting the range of variables to nodes and arcs of RDF graphs.",

To efficiently handle this ever increasing amount of data streams, the emerging Edge/Fog computing paradigms is used as the middle-tier between the Cloud and the IoT devices to process data streams closer to their sources and to reduce the network resource usage and network delay to reach the Cloud. In this paper, we account for the fact that both network resources and computational resources can be limited and shareable among multiple DSPA applications in the Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture, hence it is necessary to ensure their efficient usage. In this respect, we propose a resource-aware and time-efficient heuristic called SOO that identifies a good DSPA operator placement on the Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture towards optimizing the trade-off between the computational and network resource usage. Via thorough simulation experiments, we show that the solution provided by SOO is very close to the optimal one while the execution time is considerably reduced.",

The heterogeneity of these devices, which range from low-end sensors to smart TVs, make securing home IoT particularly challenging. To make matters worse, many consumer-IoT devices are hard or impossible to secure because device manufacturers fail to adopt security best practices (eg, regular software patches). In this paper we propose a novel, cooperative system between the home gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to provide data driven security solutions for detecting and isolating IoT security attacks. Our approach is based on a combination of a large-scale view from the ISP (using powerful machine learning techniques on traffic traces), and the fine-grained view of the per-device activity from the home (using edge processing techniques) to provide efficient, yet privacy-aware IoT security services.",

By employing the concepts of p-values of conditional independence tests and meta-analysis techniques, PFBP relies only on computations local to a partition while minimizing communication costs, thus massively parallelizing computations. Similar techniques for combining local computations are also employed to create the final predictive model. PFBP employs asymptotically sound heuristics to make early, approximate decisions, such as Early Dropping of features from consideration in subsequent iterations, Early Stopping of consideration of features within the same iteration, or Early Return of the winner in each iteration.

Recording provenance information of RDF triples aggregated from different heterogeneous sources is crucial in order to effectively support trust mechanisms, digital rights and privacy policies.

In P2P systems a very large number of autonomous computing nodes (the peers) pool together their resources and rely on each other for data and services.

Such information can be easily captured by emerging Semantic Web languages such as RDF/S. However, a fully-fledged framework for evaluating semantic queries over peer RDF/S bases (materialized or virtual) is missing. In this paper we present the ICS-FORTH SQPeer middleware for routing and processing RQL queries and RVL views. The novelty of SQPeer lies on the use of intensional active schemas for determining relevant peer bases, as well as, constructing distributed query plans. In this context, we consider optimization \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The necessity for ontology building, annotating, integrating and learning tools is uncontested. However, the sole representation of knowledge and information is not enough. Human information consumers and web agents have to use and query ontologies and the resources committed to them, thus the need for ontology storage and querying tools arises. However, the context of storing and querying knowledge has changed due to the wide acceptance and use of the Web as a platform for communicating knowledge. New languages for querying (meta) data based on web standards (eg, XML [23], RDF [17], Topic Maps [16]) have emerged to enable the acquisition of knowledge from dispersed information sources, while the traditional database storage techniques have been adapted to deal with the peculiarities of the (semi) structured data on the web.The purpose of this chapter is to briefly present and evaluate a set of query languages and associated tools for ontology/resource storage and querying aiming to support large-scale Semantic Web [3] applications, the next evolution step of the Web. This list of languages and tools is by no means complete and the tools presented are indicative of the tendency to provide full storage and query support to web-based ontology/metadata standards, such as RDF [17], RDFS [4], Topic Maps [16], DAML+ OIL [9] or the forthcoming Web Ontology Language [15]. Our work in this chapter focuses on the evaluation of querying languages designed for Semantic Web related knowledge representation formalisms rather than general-purpose querying languages (eg, SQL, Datalog, F-logic).

We advocate for the use of labeling schemes for modeling these hierarchies in order to efficiently answer queries such as subsumption check, descendants, ancestors or nearest common ancestor, which usually require costly transitive closure computations. We first give a qualitative comparison of three main families of schemes, namely bit vector, prefix and interval based schemes. We then show that two labeling schemes are good candidates for an efficient implementation of label querying using standard relational DBMS, namely, the Dewey Prefix scheme [6] and an Interval scheme by Agrawal, Borgida and Jagadish [1]. We compare their storage and query evaluation performance for the 16 ODP hierarchies using the PostgreSQL engine.",

The evolution summarizes the changes that are occurring on the topics over a given time horizon inside the evolving data stream. For instance, some topics may disappear at some point in time due to lack of users' interest, while others are retained over time adopting either a stable or an evolving behaviour. The analysis and storage of such dynamic and massive content with spatio-thematic properties poses new challenges for research.",

Although topic maps and RDF can also be represented in XML, many have held that their many possible syntactic forms make them extremely difficult to query using an XML query language, and that they can only be queried using special-purpose query languages with built-in knowledge of their semantics, including the ability to exploit RDF schema information. This talk shows that XQuery can, in fact, be used to solve the kinds of queries for which RDF and topic map query languages were designed, though with a loss of type safety.The approach taken is to transform instances of RDF and topic maps to a syntactic representation that closely models their underlying logical models, and to use function libraries written in XQuery to directly support operations specific to RDF or topic maps. Schema level information is also incorporated in this representation, and is supported in the library, so queries can exploit type hierarchies and perform joins across predicates.",

One of the major issues for building Z39.50 wrappers is to map this unstructured list of APs to the underlying source data structure and semantics. For highly structured sources (e.g., database management systems, knowledge base systems) this mapping is quite complex and considerably affects the quality of the retrieved data.

            "Abstract": "This deliverable presents specifications of three components responsible for advanced manipulation with the knowledge stored in the KP-Lab Semantic Web Knowledge Middleware (SWKM). It starts with motivating scenarios defined within various Working Knots (WKs), extracting relevant functional requirements and mapping them on the high-level requirements, of particular driving objectives and user tasks (described in deliverable [D2.4]). The first component is Knowledge Matchmaker (V2.0), which utilizes various text mining, information extraction, and heuristic methods for advanced access to and manipulation with shared knowledge artefacts according to the explicit meaning of artefacts expressed by their textual content, as well as metadata, including semantic tagging. This second version presents a set of completely new services supporting miscellaneous functionalities such as support for semantic tagging process, search for similar artefacts, information extraction capabilities, as well as recommendation services. Next two components are completely new. The Knowledge Synthesizer (V1.0) can be used to combine information found in multiple sources; this feature is necessary to allow automated merging of the conceptualizations modeled in independently edited conceptualizations. The Analytical and Knowledge Mining Services (V1.0) provide means for analyzing participation and activities within past or running knowledge creation processes, as well as for support of knowledge evolution analysis (e.g. via identification of critical patterns in selected knowledge creation processes).",

            "Abstract": "An increasing number of scientific communities rely on Semantic Web ontologies to share and interpret data within and across research domains. These common knowledge representation resources are usually developed and maintained manually and essentially co-evolve along with experimental evidence produced by scientists worldwide. Detecting automatically the differences between (two) versions of the same ontology in order to store or visualize their deltas is a challenging task for e-science. In this paper, we focus on languages allowing the formulation of concise and intuitive deltas, which are expressive enough to describe unambiguously any possible change and that can be effectively and efficiently detected. We propose a specific language that provably exhibits those characteristics and provide a change detection algorithm which is sound and complete with respect to the proposed language \u2026",

The purpose of this chapter is to present RQL\u2019s formal data model and type system and illustrate its expressiveness by means of exemplary queries. RQL\u2019s formal foundations capture the RDF/S modeling primitives and provide a well-founded semantics for a declarative query language involving recursion and functional composition over complex description graphs.",

By considering deltas as sets of change operations, in this article we introduce various RDF/S differential functions which take into account inferred knowledge from an RDF/S knowledge base. We first study their correctness in transforming a source to a target RDF/S knowledge base in conjunction with the semantics of the employed change operations (i.e., with or without side-effects on inferred knowledge). Then we formally analyze desired properties of RDF/S deltas such as size minimality, semantic identity, redundancy elimination, reversibility, and \u2026",

In this paper, the authors propose an uncertainty-aware data management system capable of monitoring interrelations between large and heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. To this end, an efficient similarity function is employed instead of the typical correlation coefficient to monitor dynamic phenomena for timely alerting notifications, and to guarantee the validity of detected extreme events.

Discrete services typically have short duration, and cannot respond to external asynchronous events. Session-oriented services have longer duration (perhaps hours), and typically can respond to asynchronous events (e.g., the ability to add a new participant to a teleconference). When composing discrete e-services it usually suffices to use a process model and engine that composes the e-services as relatively independent tasks. But when composing session-oriented e-services, the engine must be able to receive asynchronous events and determine how and whether to impact the active sessions.

This process consists of the determination of the allowed change operations, the identification of the inconsistencies that could be caused by each such operation as well as the various alternatives to deal with each such inconsistency, and, finally, some (manual or automatic) selection mechanism that allows the determination of the \u201cbest\u201d of these alternatives. Unfortunately, most ontology evolution algorithms implement these steps using a case-based, ad-hoc methodology, which is cumbersome and error-prone. In this paper we propose a general framework for ontology change management that generalizes the methodology employed by existing tools. The introduction of this framework allows us to devise a whole class of ontology evolution algorithms, which, due to their formal underpinnings, avoid many of the problems exhibited by ad-hoc frameworks. We exploit this framework by implementing a specific ontology evolution algorithm for RDF ontologies.",

MinoanER leverages a token-based similarity of entities to define a new metric that derives the similarity of neighboring entities from the most important relations, indicated only by statistics. For high efficiency, similarities are computed from a set of schema-agnostic blocks and processed in a non-iterative way that involves four threshold-free heuristics. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of MinoanER is comparable to existing ER tools over real KBs exhibiting low heterogeneity in terms of entity types and content.

            "Abstract": "Numerous algorithms have been proposed for detecting anomalies (outliers, novelties) in an unsupervised manner. Unfortunately, it is not trivial, in general, to understand why a given sample (record) is labelled as an anomaly and thus diagnose its root causes. We propose the following reduced-dimensionality, surrogate model approach to explain detector decisions: approximate the detection model with another one that employs only a small subset of features. Subsequently, samples can be visualized in this low-dimensionality space for human understanding. To this end, we develop PROTEUS, an AutoML pipeline to produce the surrogate model, specifically designed for feature selection on imbalanced datasets. The PROTEUS surrogate model can not only explain the training data, but also the out-of-sample (unseen) data. In other words, PROTEUS produces predictive explanations by approximating the decision surface of an unsupervised detector. PROTEUS is designed to return an accurate estimate of out-of-sample predictive performance to serve as a metric of the quality of the approximation. Computational experiments confirm the efficacy of PROTEUS to produce predictive explanations for different families of detectors and to reliably estimate their predictive performance in unseen data. Unlike several ad-hoc feature importance methods, PROTEUS is robust to high-dimensional data.",

In this setting, we need to process continuous top-k text queries combining both static and dynamic scores.

In this paper, we propose three heuristic algorithms for detecting sensing contexts such as in/out-pocket, under/over-ground, and in/out-door for crowdsourced datasets that are destined for human mobility mining. These are unsupervised binary classifiers with a small memory footprint and execution time. Using a segment of the Ambiciti real dataset - a feature-limited crowdsourced dataset - we report that our algorithms perform equally well in terms of balanced accuracy (within 4.3%) when compared to machine learning (ML) models reported by an AutoML tool.",

An international effort is underway to formulate standards that will enable Learning Object (LO) reuse and exchange among multiple educational settings, instructors, courses and institutions. The scope of this deliverable is to appropriately define the notion of learning content available on corporate networks or the Internet, as well as, to provide the core information modeling constructs of e-Learning applications. Hence, we survey several e-Learning standards and consider the feasibility of expressing them using Semantic Web languages, like RDF/S. We conclude our deliverable with the most important pedagogical limitations of existing standards, which are crucial for deploying a full-fledged Self e-Learning Network.",

Accelerometer's precision can vary considerably depending on whether the phone is in-pocket or out-pocket, i.e., held in hand. GPS accuracy can be very low in places like underground metro stations. Further, jump-lengths are shorter and have higher frequency when a person is indoor. Hence, we focus on contexts such as in/out-pocket, under/over-ground, and in/out-door that can be essential for reliably inferring human mobility attributes and properties (e.g., location, jump-length, and mobility activity like walking or driving) from crowdsensed data. Our work is motivated by the fact that most of the publicly available crowdsensing datasets (e.g. PRIVA'MOV and Beijing taxi dataset) do not include data from specialized sensors such as light, barometer, etc. considered by state-of-the-art algorithms for detecting the above mentioned contexts. Therefore, we focus on mining context from the limited features available in the publicly available mobility related crowdsensing datasets. Moreover, as ground truth is typically not available in these datasets, we pay special attention to minimizing the training or tuning efforts of the introduced algorithms. Our algorithms are unsupervised binary classifiers with a small memory footprint and execution time. As the lack of certain features prohibits us to consider state-of-the-art algorithms as baselines, we compare the performance of our heuristic algorithms against Machine Learning (ML) models built by an AutoML tool using the same set of features.

P2P DLs can operate without a central coordination and offer important advantages such as a very dynamic environment where peers can join and leave the network at any time, while the network can scale up to a large number of peers. The advanced structuring and retrieval functionality of peers poses new challenges in query routing and processing over autonomous, distributed and dynamic networks of DL. The paper considers two fundamental aspects of P2P Digital Libraries (P2P DLs): query routing and processing. Specifically, we design and implement effective and efficient query routing in P2P DLs, exploiting intensional indexing of DL node views. Also, we study interleaved query routing and processing algorithms in P2P DLs to produce as quickly as possible the first query results.",

In this work, we focus on entity resolution in the Web of data, i.e., identifying descriptions that refer to the same real-world entity. To reduce the required number of pairwise comparisons, methods for entity resolution perform blocking as a pre-processing step. A blocking technique places similar entity descriptions into blocks and executes comparisons only between descriptions within the same block. We experimentally evaluate blocking techniques proposed for the Web of data and present dataset characteristics that determine the effectiveness and efficiency of such methods. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the missed matching entity descriptions and examine different types of links that blocking techniques can potentially identify. I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, knowledge bases (KBs) offer comprehensive, machine-readable descriptions of a large variety of real-world entities (e.g., persons, places) published on the Web as Linked Data (LD). Although KBs (e.g., DBpedia, Freebase) may be derived from the same data source (e.g., Wikipedia), they may provide multiple descriptions of the same entities. This is mainly due to the different information extraction tools and curation policies [3] employed by KBs, resulting to complementary and sometimes conflicting descriptions. Entity resolution (ER) aims to identify descriptions that refer to the same entity within or across KBs [2], [4]. Compared to data warehouses, the new ER challenges stem from the openness of the Web of data in describing entities by an unbounded number of KBs, the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The analysis of temporal behavioral patterns of home network users can reveal important information to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and help them to optimize their networks and offer new services (e.g., remote software upgrades, troubleshooting, energy savings). This study uses time series analysis of continuous traffic data from wireless home networks , to extract traffic patterns recurring within, or across homes, and assess the impact of different device types (fixed or portable) on home traffic. Traditional techniques for time series analysis are not suited in this respect, due to the limited stationary and evolving distribution properties of wireless home traffic data. We propose a novel framework that relies on a correlation-based similarity measure of time series , as well as a notion of strong stationarity to define motifs and dominant devices. Using this framework, we analyze the wireless traffic collected from 196 home gateways over two months. The proposed approach goes beyond existing application-specific analysis techniques, such as analysis of wireless traffic, which mainly rely on data aggregated across hundreds, or thousands of users. Our framework, enables the extraction of recurring patterns from traffic time series of individual homes, leading to a much more fine-grained analysis of the behavior patterns of the users. We also determine the best time aggregation policy w.r.t. to the number and statistical importance of the extracted motifs, as well as the device types dominating these motifs and the overall gateway traffic. Our results show that ISPs can exceed the simple observation of the aggregated gateway traffic and better understand \u2026",

One step towards this goal is the ability to specify educational needs or to describe educational material according to personalized e-learning terminologies and conceptualisations. In this deliverable we investigate how this goal can be achieved in a declarative way using language primitives for defining views over distributed, autonomous RDF bases holding learning object descriptions and schemas. Based on these primitives, we introduce a fully-fledged view definition language, called RVL, for creating not only virtual resource descriptions, but also virtual RDF/S schemas from (meta) classes, properties, and resource descriptions available on a SeLeNe. Furthermore, we illustrate how RVL views can be composed with structured RDF/S queries expressed in a query language like RQL, by means of an internal logical framework (linear Datalog rules) capturing the semantics of the RDF/S model, as well as of RQL queries and RVL views. To the best of our knowledge, RVL is the first declarative view definition language offering such functionality. Finally, we present how the RQL/RVL query processing can be implemented in three different architectural alternatives: the centralized, the mediated and the autonomic scenarios as presented in Deliverable 5.",

More precisely, the KPLab Semantic Web Knowledge Middleware (SWKM) aims to facilitate knowledge creation processes by supporting advanced interactions of collaborating learners (or workers) with knowledge artefacts (i.e. discovery, access, evolution, recommendation and mining). In this deliverable we present the high-level functionality of SWKM along with the Service-Oriented Software Architecture of the prototype system that will be developed by M12 (V 1.0) and the subsequent phases of the project. The proposed architecture broadly distinguishes three generic modules of the SWKM, i.e. the Knowledge Repository    responsible for the provision of scalable persistence services for large volumes of knowledge artefacts   descriptions and ontologies; the Knowledge Mediator    responsible for the provision of services handling the main registry, discovery and evolution for KP-Lab knowledge artefacts; and the Knowledge Matchmaker    responsible for the provision of services that support interactions of KP-Lab users with knowledge artefacts employing their semantic descriptions. The services corresponding to each one of these modules are described along with the proposed functionality for each one, based upon the motivating scenarios and the subsequent definition of the key concepts of Trialogical Learning.",

            "Abstract": "The Internet and Web are revolutionizing the way companies interact with their suppliers, partners, and clients, by enabling substantial automation of the full spectrum of their business activities. In the 21st century economy, the primary form of automation will be B2B e-commerce, in which enterprises interact with each other through entirely automated means. As an example, consider an electronic market place in a vertical industry segment, in which suppliers and buyers tie into a common IT infrastructure to exchange goods and services. This forms a supply chain in which buyers investigate possible suppliers,(b) check the terms and conditions under which suppliers can do business,(c) interoperate with the suppliers\u2019 enterprise support systems, ie, workflows, and (d) monitor ordering/purchasing for possible delays, unexpected events, react to such events, etc. This paper presents a new framework for specifying, enacting and supervising e-services on the Web, based on XML and rules-based support for products/services description and workflow mediation across organizations. Traditionally, WorkFlow Management Systems (WFMS) have focused on homogeneous and centrally controlled environments for binding people and processes within the boundary of a single organization. In the context of B2B e-commerce, WFMSs need to support collaboration between various autonomous parties, some of which may even have conflicting business goals. More precisely, they must cope with heterogeneous enterprise support environments (eg, through different WF systems), to model the interaction of independent partners by abstracting the internal \u2026",

In such cases, cost-based query optimization often is not possible. One practical reason for this is that statistics typically are missing in web scale setting such as the Linked Open Datasets (LOD). The more profound reason is that due to the absence of schematic structure in RDF, join-hit ratio estimation requires complicated forms of correlated join statistics; and currently there are no methods to identify the relevant correlations beforehand. For this reason, the use of good heuristics is essential in SPARQL query optimization, even in the case that are partially used with cost-based statistics (ie, hybrid query optimization). In this paper we describe a set of useful heuristics for SPARQL query optimizers. We present these in \u2026",

The two components were defined in [D5.1] as Knowledge Mediator and Knowledge Matchmaker. The Knowledge Mediator services (change, comparison, versioning and registry) aim at providing functionalities to support evolving ontologies and RDF Knowledge Bases (KBs). Upon a change request, the change service will automatically determine the effects and side-effects of the request and present it to the caller for validation. A comparison service is necessary to allow one to compare two versions of an ontology or RDF KB and identify their differences. The above functionalities are coupled with a versioning system, which is used to make different versions of the same ontology (or RDF KB) persistent, and with the registry service, which allows the user to classify the stored ontologies, using some related metadata for easy access and manipulation. The Knowledge Matchmaker supports advanced mining and notification services for knowledge artefacts. It essentially enables to cluster/classify available information resources with respect to the employed ontologies, as well as, to notify about changes to content items produced/consumed within a group of learners according to explicitly subscribed preferences [DoWB]. The Notification service supports access to the knowledge repository for KP-Lab users (i.e. individual human users as well as various tools or software components) by keeping them aware of changes \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Curated ontologies and semantic annotations are increasingly being used in e-science to reflect the current terminology and conceptualization of scientific domains. Such curated Knowledge Bases (KBs) are usually backended by relational databases using adequate schemas (generic or application/domain specific) and may satisfy a wide range of integrity constraints. As curated KBs continuously evolve, such constraints are often violated and thus KBs need to be frequently repaired. Motivated by the fact that consistency is mostly enforced manually by the scientists acting as curators, we propose a generic and personalized repairing framework for assisting them in this arduous task. Our framework supports a variety of useful integrity constraints using Disjunctive Embedded Dependencies (DEDs) as well as complex curator preferences over interesting features of the resulting repairs (eg, their size and type) that can capture diverse notions of minimality in repairs. Moreover, we propose a novel exhaustive repair finding algorithm which, unlike existing greedy frameworks, is not sensitive to the resolution order and syntax of violated constraints and can correctly compute globally optimal repairs for different kinds of constraints and preferences. Despite its exponential nature, the performance and memory requirements of the exhaustive algorithm are experimentally demonstrated to be satisfactory for real world curation cases, thanks to a series of optimizations.",

            "Abstract": "Content syndication has become a popular way for timely delivery of frequently updated information on the Web. Today, web syndication technologies such as RSS or Atom are used in a wide variety of applications spreading from large-scale news broadcasting to medium-scale information sharing in scientific and professional communities. However, they exhibit serious limitations for dealing with information overload in Web 2.0. There is a vital need for efficient realtime filtering methods across feeds, to allow users to effectively follow personally interesting information. We investigate in this paper three indexing techniques for users' subscriptions based on inverted lists or on an ordered trie for exact and partial matching. We present analytical models for memory requirements and matching time and we conduct a thorough experimental evaluation to exhibit the impact of critical parameters of realistic web syndication \u2026",
