Recommendation algorithms have to address several problems, such as information sparsity, scalability of algorithms, concept drift etc. ln this dynamic and complex environment, it is important to provide solutions that enrich information when it is necessary to fill the gaps and at the same time to scale solutions so that they can handle the ever increasing data sizes and flows. ln this work, we extend our previous work on recommender systems for social networks that studied global influence and trust metrics and their applications.

This restricted view of the clinical trials\u2019 context is quite often the reason behind unsuccessful trials and/or successful ones which, however, underestimate drugs\u2019 unwanted effects and thus their results are of low external validity in the much more complicated environment of clinical healthcare. In this paper, we present a context-aware approach, which has been developed in the PONTE project, for effectively guiding medical researchers during clinical trial protocol design and allowing for more efficient and effective access to scientific literature. The suggested approach incorporates intelligent services and advanced text mining mechanisms for scientific literature querying and mining during protocol design, taking into account the study context (ie active substance, target and disease) and the domain context in literature.",

In this work, we go one step beyond and examine whether this blended learning model can be fully implemented online, with MUVEs replacing the face to face interaction. This is ideal for open learning communities, whose members are able to meet only online, and can hardly meet in the same classroom. For an open learning community, we investigate whether the existence of a MUVE can be combined smoothly and productively with the already established tools for online learning communities support and the first user experiences are positive: users prefer to use LMS because of its simplicity and are attracted from the 3D virtual environment and the interactivity it offers.",

As a result, the traditional usage-based approach to generate recommendations that takes as input the navigation paths recorded on the Web page level, is not as effective. Moreover, most of the content available online is either explicitly or implicitly characterized by a set of categories organized in a taxonomy, allowing the page-level navigation patterns to be generalized to a higher, aggregate level. In this direction, the authors present the Frequent Generalized Pattern (FGP) algorithm. FGP takes as input the transaction data and a hierarchy of categories and produces generalized association rules that contain transaction items and/or item categories. The results can be used to generate association rules and subsequently recommendations for the users. The algorithm can be applied to the log files of a typical Web site \u2026",

This is highlighted by the inefficiency of energy saving measures that have recently been set owing to the the marketability failure and unsuccessful design integration of existing ICT based solutions. Specifically, the factors that affect energy efficiency comprise natural and socio-economic restrictions, technological advances, and last but not least the human behavior. Energy efficiency based on behavioral change has attracted an increasing interest in the recent years, unfortunately, solutions in this area suffer from the lack of marketability because of the absence of both prospective studies and consumer awareness. This work, focuses on a key cost-effective technology for monitoring power consumption and for contributing to the behavioral change through smart, personalized, and on the moment, action recommendations. In order to examine the marketability of the proposed solution, we begin with a market and research analysis of the domain of energy efficiency systems in the building sector that target behavioral change. Moving forward, various factors that affect the commercialization of the final product are considered before proceeding with recommended actions to ensure its successful marketability via conducting a Go/No-Go analysis. Finally, based on the comprehensive commercialization study, a GO decision is concluded for the subject technology.",

In this research, we propose an innovative and high-accurate text stream classification model that is designed in an elastic distributed way and is capable to service text load with fluctuated frequency. In this classification model, text is represented as N-Gram Graphs and the classification process takes place using text preprocessing, graph similarity and feature classification techniques following the supervised machine learning approach. The work involves the analysis of many variations of the proposed model and its parameters, such as various representations of text as N-Gram Graphs, graph comparisons metrics and classification methods in order to conclude to the most accurate setup. To deal with the scalability, the availability and the timely response in case of high frequency text we employ the Beam programming model. Using the Beam programming model the classification process occurs as a sequence of distinct tasks and facilitates the distributed implementation of the most computational demanding tasks of the inference stage. The proposed model and the various parameters that constitute it are evaluated experimentally and the high frequency stream emulated using two public datasets (20NewsGroup and Reuters-21578) that are commonly used in the literature for text classification",

This amplified the old problem of fake news, which became a major concern nowadays due to the negative impact it brings to the communities. In order to tackle the rise and spreading of fake news, automatic detection techniques have been researched building on artificial intelligence and machine learning. The recent achievements of deep learning techniques in complex natural language processing tasks, make them a promising solution for fake news detection too. This work proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks for fake news classification. The model was successfully validated on two fake news datasets (ISO and FA-KES), achieving detection results that are significantly better than other non-hybrid baseline \u2026",

Despite its ease of use, BOW representation cannot handle word synonymy and polysemy problems and does not consider semantic relatedness between words. In this paper, we overcome the shortages of the BOW approach by embedding a known WordNet-based semantic relatedness measure for pairs of words, namely Omiotis, into a semantic kernel. The suggested measure incorporates the TF-IDF weighting scheme, thus creating a semantic kernel which combines both semantic and statistical information from text. Empirical evaluation with real data sets demonstrates that our approach successfully achieves improved classification accuracy with respect to the standard BOW representation, when Omiotis is embedded in four different classifiers.",

We apply two different approaches: the first utilizes clustering as a pre-processing step to the creation of many local models; the second builds upon splines to predict the target value. Given the above, we show that clustering can improve performance and demonstrate how the number of clusters affects the outcome.

This article addresses the problem of searching semantic trajectories, using stop-and-move sequence expressions. The article first proposes a formal framework to define semantic trajectories and introduces stop-and-move sequence expressions, with well-defined syntax and semantics, which act as an expressive query language for semantic trajectories.

With new services, applications and devices, it promises to enrich our web experience, and to establish an environment where virtual medical communities may flourish away from private interests and financial expectations. This article performs a bird\u2019s eye view of Web 2.0 novelties, portrays the structure of a medical community and describes how medical information can be exploited in favor of the community. It discusses the merits and necessities emanating from various approaches and tools and gives emphasis on the intelligent information management inside \u2026",

In the blended e-learning paradigm, knowledge is delivered using a combination of online and traditional distant education practices. The purpose of this paper is to propose a set of criteria for the evaluation of the educational process in blended e-learning communities. The systematic surveying and evaluation of the various parameters that affect the educational outcome is the primary aim of the quality assurance process. Existing evaluation methods provide general guidelines, which fail to cover the traditional distant education procedures (e.g. educational material, sporadic face-to-face meetings) that accompany e-learning activities. The key reason for the success of a blended e-learning approach is the balance between computer based and face-to-face interactions and the harmonic merge of the two. First, we review the \u2026",

Such studies have huge impact to the pharmaceutical industry, but in the same time require large investments on wet-lab experiments. The respective in-silico experiments have a significantly smaller cost and minimize the expenses for the subsequent lab experiments. However, the process of finding similar protein targets for an existing drug, passes through protein structural similarity and is a highly demanding in computational resources task. In this work, we propose several algorithms that port the protein similarity task to a parallel high-performance computing environment. The differences in size and complexity of the examined protein structures raise several issues in a naive parallelization process that significantly affect the overall time and required memory.

In order to support this process for relational repositories we developed the X-Database system. The base of this system is an XML-Schema file that describes the logical model of interchanged information. Initially, the system analyses the syntax of the XML-Schema file and generates the relational database. Then it handles the decomposition of valid XML files according to that Schema and the composition of XML documents from the information in the database. Finally the \u2026",

In this context, the local binary pattern (LBP) and other variants are investigated on their ability to extract histograms of 2D binary patterns of power signals. Specifically, by moving to a 2D representation space, each power sample is surrounded by eight neighbors at least. This can help extracting pertinent characteristics and providing more possibilities to encode power signals robustly. Moreover, the proposed identification technique has the main advantage of accurately recognizing the electrical devices \u2026",

The process of online federated learning can be employed in order to maximise the potential of federated learning by re-training a shared model on the edge nodes and merging the updated models centrally. This approach allows edge nodes to exchange knowledge without exchanging their own training data, thus preserving their privacy. In this work, we examine the online federated learning approach in an extreme case of imbalanced class distribution between the central and the edge nodes. We examine the effects of different parameters of the online federated learning process and propose a technique that boosts the classification performance above that of the baseline centralised learning approach.",

Several frameworks and algorithms have been proposed for the management of vessel trajectory data, which focus on data compression, data clustering, classification and visualization, offering a wide variety of solutions from vessel monitoring to automatic detection of complex events. This work builds on our previous work in the topic of automatic detection of Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, by developing and evaluating a methodology for classifying the trajectories of vessels that possibly participate in such missions. The proposed solution takes advantage of a synthetic trajectory generator and a classifier that combines a genetic algorithm (GENDIS) for the extraction of informative shapelets from training data and a transformation to the shapelets\u2019 feature space. Using the generator and several SAR patterns that are formally described in naval operations bibliography, it generates a synthetic dataset that is used to train the classifier.

Based on the output of this analysis, the system synchronizes with the user activities and presents personalized energy efficiency recommendations at the right moment and place. The recommendation algorithm considers user preferences, energy goals, and availability in order to maximize the acceptance of a recommended action and increase the efficiency of the recommender system. The results from the evaluation on a publicly available dataset comprising energy consumption data from multiple devices shows that micromoments repeatedly occur within user\u2019s timeline (covering more than 35% of user future activities) and can be learned from user logs.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents WordRank, a new page ranking system, which exploits similarity between interconnected pages. WordRank introduces the model of the 'biased surfer' which is based on the following assumption: \"the visitor of a Web page tends to visit Web pages with similar content rather than content irrelevant pages\". The algorithm modifies the random surfer model by biasing the probability of a user to follow a link in favor of links to pages with similar content. It is our intuition that WordRank is most appropriate in topic based searches, since it prioritizes strongly interconnected pages, and in the same time is more robust to the multitude of topics and to the noise produced by navigation links. This paper presents preliminary experimental evidence from a search engine we developed for the Greek fragment of the World Wide Web. For evaluation purposes, we introduce a new metric (SI score) which is based on \u2026",

The combination of smart meters that provide high-frequency readings of consumption and enhanced data analytics have enabled studies to uncover energy usage patterns of households. However, an accurate understanding of consumer behavior requires a more comprehensive approach. Henceforth, we present a novel data simulator that generates appliance-based datasets based on real data. By proper fusion of real smart meter data and periodic energy consumption habits, which are represented by micro-moments, we were able to simulate realistic domestic energy consumption scenarios. Pre-processing the aggregated readings and the application of a k-means clustering algorithm, user actions were detected (switch on/off) per appliance. Based on these records and using a apriori itemset extraction algorithm we obtained appliance usage patterns. A minute-averaged dataset was simulated for three rooms and nine appliances, monitored for a 47-month period. We managed to extract frequent usage patterns at appliance-level, taking into account contextual parameters such as room occupancy. Moreover, the simulated datasets can be expanded to any size to a variety of energy saving applications such as micro-moment classification and goal-based recommender systems for energy saving.",

Being an emerging technology, several challenges still need to be tackled in order to make UAS suitable for real-world applications, which impose strict performance, dependability and privacy requirements. In the light of the above, this paper provides an in depth survey of current UAS technologies for Beyond the Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) UAS operations and highlight the main technological challenges and requirements that arise. We also focus on the emerging and future BVLOS UAS features and the technological advances that render their expansion in various industrial sectors promising.",

They contain rich information, which can be analyzed across different dimensions(e.g., author, year, venue, topic) and can be exploited in multiple ways. The representation and visualization of bibliographic databases as graphs and the application of data mining techniques can help us uncover interesting knowledge concerning potential synergies between researchers, possible matchings between researchers and venues, or even the ideal venue for presenting a research work. In this paper, we propose a novel representation model for bibliographic data, which combines co-authorship and content similarity information, and allows for the formation of scientific networks.

            "Abstract": "The computation of relatedness between two fragments of text in an automated manner requires taking into account a wide range of factors pertaining to the meaning the two fragments convey, and the pairwise relations between their words. Without doubt, a measure of relatedness between text segments must take into account both the lexical and the semantic relatedness between words. Such a measure that captures well both aspects of text relatedness may help in many tasks, such as text retrieval, classification and clustering. In this paper we present a new approach for measuring the semantic relatedness between words based on their implicit semantic links. The approach exploits only a word thesaurus in order to devise implicit semantic links between words. Based on this approach, we introduce Omiotis, a new measure of semantic relatedness between texts which capitalizes on the word-to-word semantic relatedness measure (SR) and extends it to measure the relatedness between texts. We gradually validate our method: we first evaluate the performance of the semantic relatedness measure between individual words, covering word-to-word similarity and relatedness, synonym identification and word analogy; then, we proceed with evaluating the performance of our method in measuring text-to-text semantic relatedness in two tasks, namely sentence-to-sentence similarity and paraphrase recognition. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms every lexicon-based method of semantic relatedness in the selected tasks and the used data sets, and competes well against corpus-based and hybrid approaches.",

In an attempt to exploit these features and assist any specialized blog search engine to provide a better ranking of blogs, we propose a rating mechanism, which capitalizes on the hyperlinks between blogs.

A key factor for the success of a VLC is not only the skills of its members but the whole learning process. Consequently an evaluation of this process is needed in order to have successful VLCs. Influenced by the e-Learning Maturity Model, this paper attempts to introduce a framework for the evaluation of VLCs. The framework consists of 4 categories with a total of 18 individual criteria which can be objectively assessed using a Likert scale. Formal evaluation of the framework in practice is necessary to determine its merits and any drawbacks.",

The present research studies the use of language in websites of European Union (EU) member states, in order to collect data about the prevalence of the English language in the different countries and regions of the European Union. To achieve a realistic representation of today\u2019s landscape of the European Web, this study uses a vast population of websites and a representative sampling size and methodology. By analyzing and processing the findings from over 100,000 websites from every country in the EU, a solid foundation is set that is used to explore the dominance of the English language in the European World Wide Web in general. This is the first study that examines the presence of English content in the websites of all EU member countries and provides statistical evidence regarding the ratio of English content availability for each country. Conclusively, the results of the research demonstrate that the English language is available on more than one quarter of all websites of non-English speaking EU member states. Moreover, it is available in the vast majority of multilingual and bilingual websites, while at the same time being the only language that is available in a number of monolingual websites.

            "Abstract": "Excessive domestic energy usage is an impediment towards energy efficiency. Developing countries are expected to witness an unprecedented rise in domestic electricity in the forthcoming decades. A large amount of research has been directed towards behavioral change for energy efficiency. Thus, it is prudent to develop an intelligent system that combines the proper use of technology with behavior change research in order to sustainably transform end-user behavior at a large scale. This paper presents an overview of our AI-based energy efficiency framework for domestic applications and explains how micro-moments can provide an accurate understanding of user behavior and lead to more effective recommendations. Micro-moments are short-term events at which an energy-saving recommendation is presented to the consumer. They are detected using a variety of sensing modules placed at prominent \u2026",

Social networking applications generate a huge amount of data on a daily basis and social networks constitute a growing field of research, because of the heterogeneity of data and structures formed in them, and their size and dynamics. When this wealth of data is leveraged by recommender systems, the resulting coupling can help address interesting problems related to social engagement, member recruitment, and friend recommendations.In this work we review the various facets of large-scale social recommender systems, summarizing the challenges and interesting problems and discussing some of the solutions.",

Approaches for detecting such anomalies vary from extracting normality models to searching for individual cases, such as AIS switch-off or collision avoidance maneuvers.

The iMPROVE study recruited overweight and obese Greek adults and investigated the effect of gene\u2013diet interactions on weight management when adhering to a six-month, randomized nutritional trial including two hypocaloric diets of different macronutrient content. The present paper displays the design of the intervention and the baseline findings of the participants\u2019 dietary habits and their baseline anthropometric and biochemical characteristics. Methods: Baseline available data for 202 participants were analyzed and patterns were extracted via principal component analysis (PCA) on 69-item Food-Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ). Relationships with indices at baseline were investigated by multivariate linear regressions. A Lifestyle Index of five variables was further constructed. Results: PCA provided 5 dietary patterns. The \u201cMixed\u201d pattern displayed positive associations with logBMI and logVisceral fat, whereas the \u201cTraditional, vegetarian-alike\u201d pattern was nominally, negatively associated with body and visceral fat, but positively associated with HDL levels.

            "Abstract": "This paper aims to introduce a useful approach on the combined use of template based publishing tools (ie for blogs and wikis) and content personalization services. The approach considers that the original developers of web content have limited awareness on accessibility issues, and they are facilitated and guided by the editing interface. The publishing mechanism is responsible for storing web content in a flexible representation, where structured content is separated from the formatting information. Intermediate brokering services (ie aggregators, mediators or simply the portal software) produce multiple versions of the same content in order to increase content accessibility. Finally, end-users are able to set their preferences on how the content will be presented and get a homogeneous representation of the community content. The different versions may comprise multiple languages, audio and text representations etc and be based on a single version of the original content. The structured nature of content produced by template based tools allows intermediate services to intervene and reproduce the original content in various formats and client tools to filter and present information according to user needs and capabilities. The paper presents the focal points of the suggested approach, details on the underlying architecture and presents the required supporting infrastructure.",

The large scale, but also the complexity, of these types of networks constitutes the need for efficient graph mining algorithms. In both examples, one of the most important tasks is to identify closely connected network components comprising nodes that share similar properties. In the case of biological networks, this could mean the identification of proteins that bind together to carry their biological function, while in the social networks, this can be seen as the identification of communities.

            "Abstract": "The academic excellence of universities around the globe has always been a matter of extended study and so has the quality of an institution\u2019s presence in the World Wide Web. The purpose of this research is to study the extent to which a university\u2019s academic excellence is related to the quality of its web presence. In order to achieve this, a method was devised that quantified the website quality and search engine optimization (SEO) performance of the university websites of the top 100 universities in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) Shanghai list. A variety of tools was employed to measure and test each website and produced a Web quality ranking, an SEO performance ranking, as well as a combined overall web ranking for each one. Comparing these rankings with the ARWU shows that academic excellence is moderately correlated with website quality, but SEO performance is not. Moreover, the overall web ranking also shows a moderate correlation with ARWU which seems to be positively influenced by website quality and negatively by SEO performance. Conclusively, the results of the research indicate that universities place particular emphasis on issues concerning website quality, while the utilization of SEO does not appear to be of equal importance, indicating possible room for improvement in this area.

To achieve that, we suggest the development of technologies for systematically & automatically updating, dynamic knowledge maps of healthcare domain. These maps will act as advanced business intelligence support for market, products & technology watch and will represent a novel knowledge management practice (technology evolution assessment).

Health-related indices provide a reliable way of measuring a person\u2019s behavioral or clinical health in an accurate and reliable way. From a mathematical perspective, health-related indices are quantitative variables composed by component variables, namely features that represent different aspects of a health status aiming to evaluate clinical behaviors or behavioral characteristics. A variety of statistical multidimensional techniques with sufficient performance can be used for the valid classification of individuals as healthy or nonhealthy, apart from using health-related indices.

Nevertheless, most edutainment scenarios are usually limited in terms of interactivity, design and aesthetics, a fact that may be attributed to the task complexity, which requires an integrated approach addressing all related fields. This work introduces a conceptual/operational framework for the development of edutainment scenarios, which is both game-based and rich-media oriented. The proposed framework, which for the main part must be considered an educational effort, combines theoretical background-within the fields of human-computer communication, interaction/educational design and entertainment studies-and practical solutions and techniques regarding software and digital games development, for the creation of custom edutainment scenarios. These abstract and more or less theoretical scenarios due to the seamless embodiment of technical practices may be easily developed as fully fledged products, be them games, applications or any kind of digital media that provide the unified service of education and entertainment. In such a case the end product (a digital system) permits the user to interact with the environment in a game-like manner, which enhances learnability and contributes to knowledge acquirement as the underlying objective. The framework, although not a rigid one but rather subjected to ad hoc adjustments, consists of well-defined stages, which include modern educational theories and state-ofthe-art development \u2026",

In an attempt to exploit these features, this paper proposes a personalized recommendation model, which capitalizes on a collaborative rating mechanism that exploits the hyperlinks between blogs.

One technique by which this can be achieved is through the development of communities of practice. This concept was conceived over 15 years ago and refers to the process of social learning that occurs when people who have a common interest in some subject or problem collaborate over an extended period to share ideas, find solutions, and build innovations. Applied to healthcare this technique can be used to bring together patients, their families, doctors and nurses into self-supportive communities, where doctors disseminate their scientific knowledge, nurses provide practical advice and families exchange empirical knowledge. The approach exploits the merits of the internet and extends group-therapy in two ways:(i) universal (distant) membership,(ii) asynchronous consultations and support. In this paper we describe the structure, roles and services of self-supportive \u201cweb communities of patients\u201d.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we present FGP, an algorithm that combines the powers of an association rule mining algorithm (FP-Growth) and a generalized pattern mining algorithm (GP-Close) in order to efficiently generate rules from transaction data. Our Frequent Generalized Pattern (FGP) algorithm considers that all items that appear in a set of transactions, belong to categories organized in a taxonomy. It takes as input the transaction database and the taxonomy of categories and produces generalized association rules that contain transaction items and/or item categories. This algorithm is particularly useful for personalizing web sites with continuously updated content, such as, blog aggregators, or news portals. In this context, the transaction database contains user click-stream information and the hierarchy of item types is a thematic taxonomy of web pages. The algorithm generates frequent itemsets comprising of both web pages and categories. The results are used to generate association rules and consequently recommendations for the users. We experimentally evaluate the proposed algorithm using web log data collected from a newspaper web site.",

Text snippets, extracted from the retrieved pages, are an indicator of the pages' usefulness to the query intention and can be used to focus the scope of search results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatically extracting web page snippets that are highly relevant to the query intention and expressive of the pages' entire content. We show that the usage of semantics, as a basis for focused retrieval, produces high quality text snippet suggestions. The snippets delivered by our method are significantly better in terms of retrieval performance compared to those derived using the pages' statistical content. Furthermore, our study suggests that semantically-driven snippet generation can also be used to augment traditional passage retrieval algorithms based on word overlap or statistical weights, since they typically differ in coverage and produce different results. User clicks on the query relevant snippets can be used to refine the query results and promote the most comprehensive among the relevant documents.",

The predictability of methods and the statistical significance of the results are evaluated using Monte-Carlo cross validation. Results: Results indicate that specific classification methods outperform all others in almost all the validity criteria and they also perform better than multivariate indices in certain cases, with regards to the data distribution, the number of features used and the number of their possible values.

In order to support attendance and inform people on the topics, requirements and aims of programs we need a flexible program structure and an infrastructure that delivers information, training material, and support on demand, in a daily basis. We believe that a single institute is not always capable in coordinating such a composite effort and we capitalize on the building of a virtual community for education. Community will comprise training institutes, educators and trainees who will interact and co-operate in order to achieve maximum gain and flexibility.",

The paper attempts a review of existing standards for healthcare information, analyses their deficiencies and focuses on the need for interoperability. Healthcare information, in order to be useful, has to be well formed, valid and flexible. Healthcare information standards are the pre-requisites for well-formed ness and validity of information. Flexibility expects \u201cplug-and-play\u201d information, which will be operable in any system, any time and any place. A standard that will be accepted world-wide and will cover all possible aspects of healthcare information needs sounds both infeasible and inconvenient due to its size and complexity. A more practicable solution is to provide an interconnection mechanism on top of all existing and future standards. This work specifies the two fundamental problems of information interoperability, which are structure and semantics, and suggests a mechanism that facilitates the integration of existing information, the mutation and transfer of information between healthcare information systems and eases interoperability.",

In this article, we present a methodology for creating a network abstraction of the trajectories of multiple vessels, which uses only the information collected from the vessels\u2019 Automatic Identi cation System (AIS). The resulting network abstraction contains rich information about the vessel behavior in an area and can be processed with network analysis and other data mining techniques in order to uncover hidden outliers, even in an unsupervised manner.

            "Abstract": "As the amount of content that is created on social media is constantly increasing, more and more opinions and sentiments are expressed by people in various subjects. In this respect, sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques can be valuable for the automatic analysis of huge textual corpora (comments, reviews, tweets etc.). Despite the advances in text mining algorithms, deep learning techniques, and text representation models, the results in such tasks are very good for only a few high-density languages (e.g., English) that possess large training corpora and rich linguistic resources; nevertheless, there is still room for improvement for the other lower-density languages as well. In this direction, the current work employs various language models for representing social media texts and text classifiers in the Greek language, for detecting the polarity of opinions expressed on social media. The experimental results on a related dataset collected by the authors of the current work are promising, since various classifiers based on the language models (naive bayesian, random forests, support vector machines, logistic regression, deep feed-forward neural networks) outperform those of word or sentence-based embeddings (word2vec, GloVe), achieving a classification accuracy of more than 80%. Additionally, a new language model for Greek social media has also been trained on the aforementioned dataset, proving that language models based on domain specific corpora can improve the performance of generic language models by a margin of 2%. Finally, the resulting models are made freely available to the research community.",

However, in the last two decades this phenomenon of academic deception has turned into an academic plague. Undoubtedly, the rapid expansion of the Web and the vast amount of publicly available information and documents facilitate the unethical malpractice of computer-aided plagiarism, which in turn has inflated the problem. Anti-plagiarism techniques build upon technological solutions and especially the development of task-specific software. The role of anti-plagiarism software for text is to process a document and identify the pieces of text that have been reproduced from another source. This work presents a semantic-based approach to text-plagiarism detection which improves the efficiency of traditional keyword matching techniques. Our semantic matching technique is able to detect a larger variety of paraphrases, including the use of synonym terms, the repositioning of words in the sentences etc. We evaluate our methodology in a dataset comprising positive and negative plagiarism samples and present comparative results of both supervised and unsupervised methods.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents how Virtual Learning Communities can be used for the Education and Training of executive personnel of Health Units. More specifically it gives an overview of the various e-learning methods and designates how they can be combined to support the learning process inside a Virtual Learning Community. The community approach provides flexible and promising ways of education, training, communication and collaboration among people working in health sector and other involved in this, independent from geographic and time restrictions imposed by their working conditions. After some virtual communities are presented, a sequence of steps for developing a VLC for the Greek health system is proposed, and the steps that should be followed are discussed. Afterwards two use cases for educational procedures are presented. Finally a critical discussion with the factors of success, the advantages and disadvantages of this undertaking takes place.",

            "Abstract": "Domestic user behavior shapes overall power consumption, necessitating the development of systems that analyze and help foster energy efficient behavior. The most important step in the process is the collection and management of comprehensive data on end-user power consumption behavior. This paper presents an appliance-based energy data collection system for domestic households. It revolves around the concept of micro-moments, which are short-timed and energy-based events that form the overall energy behavior of the end-user. The system comprises sensing modules for recording energy consumption, occupancy, temperature, humidity, and luminosity storing recordings on a database server. Sensing parameters were tested in terms of connection stability and measurement accuracy. High stability and accuracy benchmarks have been reached with future work focused on deploying the system for \u2026",

In a secure and reliable environment, patients share their medical data with doctors, expect confidentiality and demand reliable medical consultation. Apart from a concrete policy framework, several ethical, legal and technical issues must be considered in order to build a trustful community. This research emphasises on security issues, which can arise inside a virtual healthcare community and relate to the communication and storage of data. It capitalises on a standardised risk management methodology and a prototype architecture for healthcare community portals and justifies a security model that allows the identification, estimation and evaluation of potential security risks for the community.

            "Abstract": "The digitisation and annotation of audiovisual programs results in a huge amount of information that becomes useful only if it is properly organized and if the appropriate query mechanisms exist. Usually audiovisual information and meta-information is stored in relational database schemata that consist of decades of tables, relationships and constraints that complicate the information querying tasks. The PANORAMA1 platform has been developed to cover needs for manipulating video information, by attaching meta-information for both audio and visual content of video sources. This paper presents this meta-information model and the database interface developed in terms of the PANORAMA platform. The model works as keystone in the creation of the database and the database interface implements a mechanism for converting XML documents to relational data. This mechanism allows information users to use a more understandable way to communicate with the database.",

            "Abstract": "N-gram models have been an established choice for language modeling in machine translation, summarization and other tasks. Recently n-gram graphs managed to capture significant language characteristics that go beyond mere vocabulary and grammar, for tasks such as text classification. This work proposes an efficient distributed implementation of the n-gram graph framework on Apache Spark, named ARGOT. The implementation performance is evaluated on a demanding text classification task, where the n-gram graphs are used for extracting features for a supervised classifier. A provided experimental study shows the scalability of the proposed implementation to large text corpora and its ability to take advantage of a varying number of processing cores.",

In this manner, we avoid the need for trained domain-specific lexical resources, which hinder the scalability of semantic annotation. More specifically, the proposed method maps the content of the document to concepts of the ontology, using the WordNet lexicon and Wikipedia. The method comprises a novel combination of measures of semantic relatedness and word sense disambiguation techniques to identify the most related ontology concepts for the document. We test the method on two case studies: (a) a set of summaries, accompanying environmental news videos, (b) a set of medical abstracts. The results in both cases show that the proposed method achieves reasonable performance, thus pointing to a promising path for \u2026",

Evaluation committees often need to search in several repositories in order to deliver their evaluation summary report for an individual. However, it is extremely difficult to infer performance indicators that pertain to the evolution and the dynamics of a scholar. In this paper we propose a novel computational methodology based on unsupervised machine learning that can act as an important tool at the hands of evaluation committees of individual scholars. The suggested methodology compiles a list of several key performance indicators (features) for each scholar and monitors them over time. All these indicators are used in a clustering framework which groups the scholars into categories by automatically discovering the optimal number of clusters using clustering validity metrics.
