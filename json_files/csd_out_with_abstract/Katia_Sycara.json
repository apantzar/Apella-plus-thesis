            "Abstract": "Price matching policies have been widely adopted in retailing and other industrial markets. The flourishing online channels have made price comparison and matching much easier. Previous research on price matching policy focuses on how this policy impacts the competition among sellers based on simultaneous pricing games. However, besides the role to match the competitors' current price during a purchase (ie concurrent price matching), price matching policy usually has another role: to match a seller's own price or the competitors' price if the price drops within a specified period after the purchase (ie posterior price matching). This role has important implication for consumers' purchasing behavior. Rational consumers may delay purchasing, hoping for possible markdowns that come later. This delayed purchasing behavior, however, may harm a seller's profit. Posterior price matching allows a seller to induce \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Collaborative decision making among agents in a team is a complex activity, and tasks to achieve individual objectives may conflict in a team context. A number of argumentation-based models have been proposed to address the problem, the rationale being that the revelation of background information and constraints can aid in the discovery and resolution of conflicts. To date, however, no empirical studies have been conducted to substantiate these claims. In this paper, we discuss a model, grounded on argumentation schemes, that captures potential conflicts due to scheduling and causality constraints, and individual goals and norms. We evaluate this model in complex collaborative planning problems and show that such a model facilitates the sharing of relevant information pertaining to plan, goal and normative conflicts. Further, we show that this focussed information sharing leads to more effective conflict resolution, particularly in the most challenging problems.",

            "Abstract": "Sentiment Analysis of microblog feeds has attracted considerable interest in recent times. Most of the current work focuses on tweet sentiment classification. But not much work has been done to explore how reliable the opinions of the mass (crowd wisdom) in social network microblogs such as twitter are in predicting outcomes of certain events such as election debates. In this work, we investigate whether crowd wisdom is useful in predicting such outcomes and whether their opinions are influenced by the experts in the field. We work in the domain of multi-label classification to perform sentiment classification of tweets and obtain the opinion of the crowd. This learnt sentiment is then used to predict outcomes of events such as: US Presidential Debate winners, Grammy Award winners, Super Bowl Winners. We find that in most of the cases, the wisdom of the crowd does indeed match with that of the experts, and in cases where they don't (particularly in the case of debates), we see that the crowd's opinion is actually influenced by that of the experts.",

            "Abstract": "Organisations often form collaborative teams for sharing knowledge and resources in order to accomplish complex tasks. For example, a team involving non-governmental organisations, civil and military institutions may be formed rapidly in response to humanitarian crisis. In another context, a company may collaborate with a team of service providers in fulfilling its requirements. Collaboration enhances the capabilities of individuals. However, working in a team requires a great effort from the individuals to overcome to differences in, for example, knowledge, instruments, and culture. Incompatible objectives in addition to internal policies increase the complexity of cooperation in decision-making. For effective teamwork, team members engage in discussion to agree on a common plan of activities, but often positive outcomes are hampered by conflicts of opinion among partners on the way to proceed. Software agents, employing mechanisms that support a discussion regarding a shared plan, have the potential to facilitate conflict resolution among partners. We believe that the use of argumentation-based models to support dialogues would aid team members to identify effective justifications and more favourable agreements.Recent work on argumentation for deliberative dialogues in multi-agent system has shown that argumentation is a promising approach for generating consistent collaborative plans [1, 2]. On the other hand, some earlier research has exploited agent support for policy advice in producing more cost/time efficient plans within a team planning context [7].

Pain displays vary, with some patients highly expressive regarding their pain and others exhibiting minimal discomfort. Given myriad individual differences among patients, their families, and healthcare providers, pain is often poorly assessed, which can result in improper treatment. An automatic and reliable assessment of the onset, intensity, and pattern of occurrence of pain would help ensure the best possible treatment. Given these potential medical implications, increasing efforts are underway to develop intelligent systems to enable objective measurement and monitoring of pain.",

Under the assumption of a disc model of communication, we show that the problem can be formulated as a convex optimization (or feasibility) problem (actually a second order cone program). Thus, the problem can be solved in polynomial time by centralized interior point algorithms. However, this requires the robot to have knowledge of the position of all the nodes in the network.

            "Abstract": "In the application domain of stock portfolio management, software agents that evaluate the risks associated with the individual companies of a portfolio should be able to read electronic news articles that are written to give investors an indication of the nancial outlook of a company. There is a positive correlation between news reports on a company's nancial outlook and the company's attractiveness as an investment. However, because of the volume of such reports, it is impossible for nancial analysts or investors to track and read each one. Therefore, it would be very helpful to have a system that automatically categorizes news reports that re ect positively or negatively on a company's nancial outlook. To accomplish this task, we treat the unsupervised reading and understanding of news articles as an automatic text classi cation problem. In this paper, we propose a text classi cation method that we call,\\domain experts\" and\\self-con dent\" sampling technique, and compare it with naive Bayes with expectation maximization (EM). We evaluate these learning techniques in terms of how well they improve with unlabeled data after being initially trained on a small number of human-labeled articles and how well they classify the latest nancial news articles. The signi cance of this work lies in the new classi cation method that we propose and in the sampling technique we used for improving classi cation accuracy.",

In this paper we develop a sequential game theory model to capture the interactions among crowdfunders, the solar farm owner, and an electricity company who purchases renewable energy generated by the solar farm in a multi-period framework. By characterizing a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, andcomparing it with a benchmark model without crowdfunding, we find that under crowdfunding although the farm owner reduces its investment level, the overall green energy investment level is increased due to the contribution of crowdfunders. We also find that crowdfunding can increase the penetration of green energy in consumption and thus reduce the energy procurement cost of the electricity company. Finally, the numerical results based on real data indicates crowdfunding is a simple but effective way to boost green generation.",

However, all these methods work only for vector spaces; that is, they require that objects be represented as vectors within feature spaces. Moreover, their implied query regions are typically convex. This research paper explains our solution. We propose a novel method that is designed to handle disjunctive queries within metric spaces. The user provides weights for positive examples; our system \"learns\" the implied concept and returns similar objects. Our method differs from existing relevance-feedback methods that base themselves upon Euclidean or Mahalanobis metrics, as it facilitates learning even disjunctive, concave models within vector spaces, as well as arbitrary metric spaces. Our main contributions are two-fold. Not only do we present a novel way to estimate the dissimilarity of an object to a set of desirable objects, but we support it with an algorithm that shows how to exploit metric indexing structures that support range queries to accelerate the search without incurring false dismissals. Our empirical results demonstrate that our method converges rapidly to excellent precision/recall, while outperforming sequential scanning by up to 200%.",

            "Abstract": "This paper considers the problem of parameter identification for a multirobot system. We wish to understand when is it feasible for an adversarial observer to reverse-engineer the parameters of tasks being performed by a team of robots by simply observing their positions. We address this question by using the concept of persistency of excitation from system identification. Each robot in the team uses optimization-based controllers for mediating between task satisfaction and collision avoidance. These controllers exhibit an implicit dependence on the task's parameters which poses a hurdle for deriving necessary conditions for parameter identification, since such conditions usually require an explicit relation. We address this bottleneck by using duality theory and SVD of active collision avoidance constraints and derive an explicit relation between each robot's task parameters and its control inputs. This allows us to derive the main necessary conditions for successful identification which agree with our intuition. We demonstrate the importance of these conditions through numerical simulations by using (a) an adaptive observer and (b) an unscented Kalman filter for goal estimation in various geometric settings. These simulations show that under circumstances where parameter inference is supposed to be infeasible per our conditions, both these estimators fail and likewise when it is feasible, both converge to the true parameters.

In this paper, we use a low fidelity simulation to evaluate several approaches to overcoming this initial congestion and identify heuristics that might allow the robots to most quickly clear the entry area and begin their actual mission. Our results show that unless the exits to the initial entry area are small, over a wide range of parameters, the most effective technique was for every robot to move in the direction of the longest open space it  senses.

This distinction has been highlighted in recent literature, and theoretical reasons why the psychological experience of humans interacting with autonomy may vary and affect subsequent collaboration outcomes are beginning to emerge (de Visser, Pak, & Shaw, 2018; Wynne & Lyons, 2018). In this review, we do a deep dive into human-autonomy teams (HATs) by explaining the differences between automation and autonomy and by reviewing the domain of human-human teaming to make inferences for HATs. We examine the domain of human-human teaming to extrapolate a few core factors that could have relevance for HATs. Notably, these factors involve critical social elements within teams that are central (as argued in this review) for HATs. We conclude by highlighting some research gaps that researchers should strive toward answering, which will ultimately facilitate a more nuanced and complete understanding of HATs in a variety of real-world contexts.",

These ontologies are used to describe the security requirements and capabilities of web services providers and requesting agents. A reasoning engine decides whether agents and web service have comparable security characteristics. Our prototypical implementation uses the Java Theorem Prover from Stanford for deciding the degree to which the requirements and capabilities match based on our matching algorithm.

To directly monitor the performance of human players, we developed a customized version of Unreal Tournament that records position and orientation of all the team members through time as they participate in a simulated MOUT scenario of a firing team moving through an urban area. Behavior recognition is performed offline using a set of hidden Markov models on short movement sequences that are translated into a canonical reference frame; the behavior model with the highest log likelihood for a given sequence is identified as correct. We believe that accurate offline recognition of team behaviors is an important prerequisite towards building virtual training environments for teamwork tasks.",

Intelligent agents must balance network costs with the harm that can be inflicted by adversaries who are in turn acting rationally to maximize harm while trading off against their own costs to attack. Furthermore, agents must choose their strategies even without full knowledge of their adversaries\u2019 capabilities, costs, or incentives.In this paper we model this problem as a non-zero sum game between two players, a sender who chooses flows through the network and an adversary who chooses attacks on the network. We advance the state of the art by:(1) moving beyond the zero-sum games previously considered to non-zero sum games where the adversary incurs attack costs that are not incorporated into the payoff of the sender;(2) introducing a refinement of the Stackelberg equilibrium that is more appropriate to network security games than previous solution concepts; and (3) using Bayesian games where the sender is uncertain of the capabilities, payoffs, and costs of the adversary. We provide polynomial time algorithms for finding equilibria in each of these cases. We also show how our approach can be used for games where there are multiple adversaries.",

While those models can be abstracted directly from human data, limitations on the amount and reliability of data can lead to over-fitting and lack of generalization. We introduce a methodology for deriving formal models of human control of cyberphysical systems based on the use of cognitive models. Analytical models such as Markov models can be derived from an instance-based learning model of the task built using the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The approach is illustrated in the context of a robotic control task involving the choice of two options to control a robotic swarm. The cognitive model and various forms of the analytical model are validated against each other and against human performance data. The current limitations of the approach are discussed as well as its implications for the automated validation of cyber-physical systems.",

In the fully autonomous LOA, the swarm is redirected automatically by changing headings using a search algorithm. In the mixed-initiative LOA, if performance declines, control is switched from human to swarm or swarm to human. The result of this work extends the current knowledge on human factors in swarm supervisory control. Specifically, the finding that the relationship between trust and performance improved for passively monitoring operators (i.e., improved situation awareness in higher LOAs) is particularly novel in its contradiction of earlier work.

Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) sensors on board the UAVs measure the strength of RF signals across a range of frequencies. The signals, although noisy and ambiguous due to structural noise, eg, multipath effects, overlapping signals and sensor noise, allow estimates to be made of emitter locations.

First, it is widely assumed, in the prior work, that agents' utility functions are explicitly given (e.g. [1, 2, 9, 19]). Although this assumption avoids the diffculty of exhaustive preference elicitation, it neglects the fact that usually in reality both parties (or at least one of the parties) may have no prepared utility functions before the negotiation starts. For example, when an individual goes to a dealer to buy a car, she seldom can have an explicit utility function over the characteristics of the car and various accessorial packages, although the dealer may possibly have a prepared utility function since she normally has a big organization and is the designer of the contracts. In such situations, the existing negotiation models may not be able to be directly \u2026",

In these environments, it may be difficult for agents to form stable trust relationships necessary for confident interactions. Societies may break down when trust between agents is too low to motivate interactions. In such settings, agents should make decisions about who to interact with, given their degree of trust in the available partners. We propose a decision-theoretic model of trust decision making allows controls to be used, as well as trust, to increase confidence in initial interactions. We consider explicit incentives, monitoring and reputation as examples of such controls. We evaluate our approach within a simulated, highly-dynamic multi-agent environment, and show how this model supports the making of delegation decisions when trust is low.",

In this design, there are mechanisms for ensuring secure communication among agents and secure naming and resource location services.

The use of xml at various levels of web services standards poses challenges to the above process. OWL-S is a service ontology and language, whose semantics are based on OWL. The semantics provided by OWL support greater automation of service selection, invocation, translation of message content between heterogeneous services, and service composition. The development and consumption of an OWL-S based web service is time consuming and error prone. OWL-S IDE assists developers in the semantic web service development, deployment and consumption processes. In order to achieve this the OWL-S IDE uses and extends existing web service tools. In this paper we will look in detail at the support for discovery for semantic web services. We also present the matching schemes, the implementation \u2026",

Constraints and capabilities are at the heart of representing policies that govern the behavior of Web services. Because policies regulate the behavior of different parties they are effective if and only if they are unambiguously understood by all the parties that they regulate. To achieve this level of common understanding policies should be expressed in terms of shared ontologies that are based on a logic shared by every party. For this reason, we believe that the starting point of any activity on expressing policies, capabilities and constraints should take into account the work that has been developed in the context of Semantic Web services, and specifically OWL-S.",

Advances in deep neural networks are now making it possible to replace laborious handcrafted features and control code by learning control policies directly from high-dimensional sensor inputs. Because Atari games, where these capabilities were first demonstrated, replicate the robotics problem, they are ideal for investigating how humans might come to understand and interact with agents who have not been explicitly programmed.

The DARPA Agent Markup Language for Services (DAML-S) provides a mechanism that begins to bridge the gap between the Web services infrastructure and the Semantic Web.",

After running those experiments, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) when no traction control is considered, results show the rover gets entrapped or makes a shorter progress than when traction control is applied; (2) the proposed traction controllers demonstrate a proper balance between slip-compensation (lowest mean slip) and reduction of wheel fighting effects (less aggressive control actions); (3) after considering \u2026",

This paper presents initial steps towards an approach that would allow a single operator to utilize data from several UAVs and interact with the data in a more natural and less stressful way. The concept is to paint video directly onto a 3D model of the environment and allow the operator to interact with the model as they would a computer game. The location of any of the UAVs need not be known to the operator. The operator might eventually mark areas of the environment to be searched more or less carefully or often and allow the UAVs to cooperatively and autonomously determine paths that achieve this.",

            "Abstract": "The use of distributed POMDPs for cooperative teams has been severely limited by the incredibly large joint policy-space that results from combining the policy-spaces of the individual agents. However, much of the computational cost of exploring the entire joint policy space can be avoided by observing that in many domains important interactions between agents occur in a relatively small set of scenarios, previously defined as coordination locales (CLs)[11]. Moreover, even when numerous interactions might occur, given a set of individual policies there are relatively few actual interactions. Exploiting this observation and building on an existing model shaping algorithm, this paper presents D-TREMOR, an algorithm in which cooperative agents iteratively generate individual policies, identify and communicate possible interactions between their policies, shape their models based on this information and generate new policies. D-TREMOR has three properties that jointly distinguish it from previous DEC-POMDP work:(1) it is completely distributed;(2) it is scalable (allowing 100 agents to compute a\\good\" joint policy in under 6 hours) and (3) it has low communication overhead. D-TREMOR complements these traits with the following key contributions, which ensure improved scalability and solution quality:(a) techniques to ensure convergence;(b) faster approaches to detect and evaluate CLs;(c) heuristics to capture dependencies between CLs; and (d) novel shaping heuristics to aggregate effects of CLs. While the resulting policies are not globally optimal, empirical results show that agents have policies that effectively manage uncertainty and the \u2026",

In doing so, fewer robots are required to change motion than if the whole swarm were diverted, thereby minimizing the job's overall effect on the swarm's main goal. We explore the problem of removing the required number of robots from the swarm, while maintaining overall swarm connectivity. By preserving connectivity, robots are able to successfully rejoin the swarm upon completion of their assigned job. These robots are then made available for reallocation. We propose a decentralized and asynchronous method for breaking off sub-swarm groups and rejoining them with the main swarm using the swarm's communication graph topology.

Our social networks constitute a particularly potent source of bio-external scaffolding: one that shapes, constrains and influences the profile of much of our daily cognitive activity. However, the precise way in which networks enable a group of agents to coordinate their thoughts and actions in cognitively-productive ways is still something of which we have, as yet, very little understanding. This paper is an attempt to review the status of our current understanding of network-enabled collective cognition and to explore ways in which our current understanding might be improved. The primary targets for discussion are the dynamics of belief propagation and collective problem-solving in multi-agent systems. These phenomena, we suggest, provide potent examples of collective cognition in terms of both cognitive state fluctuations (belief propagation) and cognitive processing (collective problem solving). In addition to reviewing the literature in these areas, we also present a number of ideas to help guide future research efforts.",

Because controlling multiple robots places additional demands on the operator, removing the forced pace for reviewing camera video might reduce workload and improve performance. In the reported experiment participants operated four robot teams performing a simulated urban search and rescue (USAR) task using either conventional streaming video plus a map interface or an experimental interface without streaming video but with the ability to store panoramic images on the map to be viewed at leisure. Search performance was somewhat better using the conventional interface, however, ancillary measures suggest that the asynchronous \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cognitive social simulation is a computer simulation technique that aims to improve our understanding of the dynamics of socially-situated and socially-distributed cognition. Cognitive architectures are typically used to support cognitive social simulation; however, the most widely used cognitive architecture - ACT-R - has, to date, been the focus of relatively few cognitive social simulation studies. The current paper reports on the results of an ongoing effort to develop an experimental simulation capability that can be used to undertake studies into socially-distributed cognition using the ACT-R cognitive architecture. An ACT-R cognitive model is first presented that demonstrates one approach to solving a task previously used to investigate sensemaking performance within teams of human subjects. An approach to the implementation of an ACT-R cognitive social simulation capability is then described. The approach relies on the use of a variety of custom ACT-R modules and memory-resident Lisp databases. The custom modules enable ACT-R agents to exchange information with each other during the course of their sensemaking activities. The Lisp databases, in contrast, are used to store information about communicative transactions, the experimental setup and the structure of the communication network. The proposed solution provides the basic elements required to run cognitive social simulation experiments into collective sensemaking using the ACT-R architecture; however, further work needs to be undertaken in order to address a number of limitations associated with agent communication capabilities and the ability of agents to interact with \u2026",

We prove that the size of the Earley graph created for any given HTN is bounded by the total number of tasks in the HTNs and show that from the Earley graph we can construct a plan for a given task that has the maximum expected utility when it is executed in an MDP environment.",

Currently ADOPT uses depth-first search (DFS) trees for that purpose. For certain classes of tasks DFS ordering does not exploit the problem structure as compared to pseudo-tree ordering [3]. Also the variables are currently ordered by using a centralized scheme, which requires global information about the problem structure. We present a variable ordering algorithm, which is both decentralized and makes use of pseudo-trees, thus exploiting the problem structure when possible. This allows to apply ADOPT to domains, where global information is unavailable, and find solutions more efficiently. The worst-case pseudo-tree depth \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Leader-follower navigation is a popular class of multi-robot algorithms where a leader robot leads the follower robots in a team. The leader has specialized capabilities or mission critical information (e.g. goal location) that the followers lack which makes the leader crucial for the mission's success. However, this also makes the leader a vulnerability - an external adversary who wishes to sabotage the robot team's mission can simply harm the leader and the whole robot team's mission would be compromised. Since robot motion generated by traditional leader-follower navigation algorithms can reveal the identity of the leader, we propose a defense mechanism of hiding the leader's identity by ensuring the leader moves in a way that behaviorally camouflages it with the followers, making it difficult for an adversary to identify the leader. To achieve this, we combine Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks and adversarial training. Our approach enables the multi-robot team to optimize the primary task performance with leader motion similar to follower motion, behaviorally camouflaging it with the followers. Our algorithm outperforms existing work that tries to hide the leader's identity in a multi-robot team by tuning traditional leader-follower control parameters with Classical Genetic Algorithms. We also evaluated human performance in inferring the leader's identity and found that humans had lower accuracy when the robot team used our proposed navigation algorithm.",

The reported study investigates multirobot foraging to identify aspects of the task most suitable for automation. Background: Many envisioned applications of robotics involve multirobot teams. One of the simplest of these applications is foraging, in which robots are operated independently to explore and discover targets. Depending on levels of autonomy and task, operators have been found able to manage 3 to 12 robots. Method: The foraging task can be functionally subdivided into visiting new regions and identifying targets. In the reported experiment, full-task foraging performance was compared with exploration and perceptual search performance for 4-, 8-, and 12-robot teams in a between-groups repeated measures design. Results: Operators in the full-task condition could not successfully manage 12 robots, finding only half as many victims as perceptual search operators. Exploration performance was roughly the same in the fulltask and exploration conditions, suggesting that performance of this subtask was limiting the number of robots that could be controlled. Conclusion: Performance and workload measures indicate that exploration (navigation) tasks are the limiting factor in multirobot foraging. This finding suggests that robot navigation is the best candidate for automation. Application: Search tasks, such as foraging or perimeter control, account for many of the near-term applications envisioned for multirobot teams.

            "Abstract": "We study the phenomenon of evolution of cooperation in a society of self-interested agents using repeated games in graphs. A repeated game in a graph is a multiple round game, where, in each round, an agent gains payoff by playing a game with its neighbors and updates its action (state) by using the actions and/or payoffs of its neighbors. The interaction model between the agents is a two-player, two-action (cooperate and defect) Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma (PD) game (a prototypical model for interaction between self-interested agents). The conventional wisdom is that the presence of network structure enhances cooperation and current models use multiagent simulation to show evolution of cooperation. However, these results are based on particular combination of interaction game, network model and state update rules (eg, PD game on a grid with imitate your best neighbor rule leads to evolution of cooperation). The state-of-theart lacks a comprehensive picture of the dependence of the emergence of cooperation on model parameters like network topology, interaction game, state update rules and initial fraction of cooperators. We perform a thorough study of the phenomenon of evolution of cooperation using (a) a set of popular categories of networks, namely, grid, random networks, scale-free networks, and small-world networks and (b) a set of cognitively motivated update rules. Our simulation results show that the evolution of cooperation in networked systems is quite nuanced and depends on the combination of network type, update rules and the initial fraction of cooperating agents. We also provide an analysis to support our simulation results.",

The algorithm, called NCBB, is branch and bound search with modifications for efficiency in a multiagent setting. Two main features of the algorithm are:(a) using different agents to search non-intersecting parts of a search space concurrently, and (b) communicating lower bounds on solution cost every time there is a possibility the bounds might change due to changed variable assignments. The first leads to a better utilization of computational resources of multiple participating agents, while the second provides for more efficient pruning of search space. Experimental results show that NCBB has significantly better performance than another polynomial-space algorithm, ADOPT, on random graph coloring problems. Under assumptions of cheap communication it also has comparable performance with \u2026",

The adversary is expected to use deception to prevent the sensor team from performing its tasks. We employ a game theoretic model to analyze the expected strategy of the adversary and find the best response. More specifically we consider that the adversary deceptively changes the importance that agents give to targets in the area. The opponent is expected to use camouflage in order to create confusion among the sensors regarding the importance of targets, and reduce the team\u2019s efficiency in target coverage. We represent a Mobile Sensor Team problem using the Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) framework. We propose an optimal method for the selection of a position of a single agent facing a deceptive adversary. This method serves as a heuristic for agents to select their position in a full scale problem with multiple agents in a large area. Our empirical study demonstrates the success of our model as compared with existing models in the presence of deceptions.",

In particular, the information leaders refer to a small subset of robots that are near the boundary of the swarm and suffice to characterize the swarm boundary information. The leader selection problem is formulated as finding a core set that can be used to compute the Minimum-Volume Enclosing Ellipsoid (MVEE) representing the swarm boundary. Our algorithms extract this core set in a fully distributed manner and select core set members as information leaders, thus extending abstract centralized MVEE core set algorithms for robotic swarm applications.

            "Abstract": "Research in deep reinforcement learning (RL) has coalesced around improving performance on benchmarks like the Arcade Learning Environment. However, these benchmarks conspicuously miss important characteristics like abrupt context-dependent shifts in strategy and temporal sensitivity that are often present in real-world domains. As a result, RL research has not focused on these challenges, resulting in algorithms which do not understand critical changes in context, and have little notion of real world time. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces the game of Space Fortress as a RL benchmark which incorporates these characteristics. We show that existing state-of-the-art RL algorithms are unable to learn to play the Space Fortress game. We then confirm that this poor performance is due to the RL algorithms' context insensitivity and reward sparsity. We also identify independent axes along which to vary context and temporal sensitivity, allowing Space Fortress to be used as a testbed for understanding both characteristics in combination and also in isolation. We release Space Fortress as an open-source Gym environment.",

These papers touch on many of the themes outlined above, and each paper makes a significant contribution to this exciting, emerging area of research. We hope that the reader will be inspired by these papers to explore and participate in this dynamic and growing field of study.The first paper titled\" A Framework for Evaluating Deployed Security Systems: Is There a Chink in your ARMOR?\" by Matthew E. Taylor, Christopher Kiekintveld, Craig Western and Milind Tambe, addresses the challenges of evaluating deployed security systems, using the ARMOR system as a case study to raise many of the issues involved in evaluating security systems in general. In addition to discussing these issues, the paper lays out a framework for guiding the evaluation process, giving insights into the different types of analyses that are possible and the kinds of evaluations that could further improve knowledge of a given systems' utility. The second paper titled\" Application of Microsimulation to the Modeling of Epidemics and Terrorist Attacks\" by Ian Piper, Daniel Keep, Tony Green and Ivy Zhang describes a simulation tool for agent-based simulation. The authors describe the benefits of this tool and evaluate the tool on a case study, modeling the spread of an infectious disease in a community, based on real historical incident. In addition to the relevance of this study for biological attacks, the authors describe some other possible uses for this tool in \u2026",

We show how a planner can incorporate this cost model into the planning process to select between equivalent goal-achieving plans. We explore the utility of our model in three different capacities: 1) modeling other agents in the environment; 2) representing heterogeneous agents with different physical capabilities; 3) modeling agent physical states (eg, wounded or tired agents). This technique can be incorporated into applications where human-like, high-fidelity physical models are important to the agents\u2019 reasoning process, such as virtual training environments.",

In such situations it is natural to model the environment as a Markov decision process (MDP). We show that using Earley graphs, it is possible to bridge the gap between HTNs and MDPs. We prove that the size of the Earley graph created for given HTNs is bounded by the total number of tasks in the HTNs and show that from the Earley graph we can then construct a plan for a given task that has the maximum expected value when it is executed in an MDP environment.",

Complex multi-agent tasks typically require dynamic teams where the team membership changes over time. Teams split into subteams to work in parallel, merge with other teams to tackle more demanding tasks, and disband when plans are completed. We introduce a new multi-agent plan representation that explicitly encodes dynamic team membership and demonstrate the suitability of this formalism for plan recognition. From our multi-agent plan representation, we extract local temporal dependencies that dramatically prune the hypothesis set of potentially-valid team plans. The reduced plan library can be efficiently processed to obtain the team state history. Naive pruning can be inadvisable when low-level observations are unreliable due to sensor noise and classification errors. In such conditions, we eschew pruning in favor of prioritization and show how our scheme can be extended to rank-order the hypotheses. Experiments show that this robust pre-processing approach ranks the correct plan within the top 10%, even under conditions of severe noise.",

In contrast to other generative augmentation techniques, where the distribution over input images are learnt, we propose to learn the probability distribution over the image transformation parameters which are easier and quicker to learn. Our technique is fully differentiable which enables its extension to versatile data-sets and base models. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple base-networks and 2 data-sets to establish the robustness and efficiency of this method. We obtain an improvement of nearly 4% by adding our augmentation module without making any change in network architectures. We also make the code readily available for usage by the community.",

A dynamic priority based scheme is proposed to deal with pair-wise inter-robot collision constraints. In particular, we model the assignment of priority into a minimum linear ordering problem (MLOP). We prove that the objective function of the MLOP is supermodular and propose a decentralized supermodular linear ordering algorithm that interleaves dynamic priority assignment and planning for the robots, such that the overall path length and the danger of deadlock are both minimized \u2026",

We focus on the NP-hard problem of determining the minimum number of supplemental nodes needed to meet the known communication requirements of an ad hoc network. We formulate the problem as a mixed \u2026",

However, it is challenging for 3D place retrieval methods to be accurate, efficient, and robust to the variant viewpoints differences. In this letter, we propose FusionVLAD, a fusion-based network that encodes a multi-view representation of sparse 3D point clouds into viewpoint-free global descriptors. The system consists of two parallel branches: a spherical-view branch for orientation-invariant feature extraction, and the top-down view branch for translation-insensitive feature extraction. Furthermore, we design a parallel fusion module to enhance the combination of region-wise feature connection between the two branches. Experiments on two public datasets and two generated datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art with robust \u2026",

OWL-S allows us to semantically describe web services in terms of capabilities offered and to perform logic inference to match the capabilities requested with the capabilities offered. We propose OWL-S/UDDI matchmaker that combines the better of two technologies. We also implemented and analyzed its performance.",

            "Abstract": "Tweet classification has attracted considerable attention recently. Most of the existing work on tweet classification focuses on topic classification, which classifies tweets into several predefined categories, and sentiment classification, which classifies tweets into positive, negative and neutral. Since tweets are different from conventional text in that they generally are of limited length and contain informal, irregular or new words, so it is difficult to determine user intention to publish a tweet and user attitude towards certain topic. In this paper, we aim to simultaneously classify tweet purpose, i.e., the intention for user to publish a tweet, and position, i.e., supporting, opposing or being neutral to a given topic. By transforming this problem to a multi-label classification problem, a multi-label classification method with post-processing is proposed. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and the results outperform the individual classification methods.",

We have developed the ANTicipatory Information and Planning Agent (ANTIPA) to manage information adaptively in order to mitigate user cognitive overload. To this end, the agent brings information to the user as a result of user requests but most crucially, it proactively predicts the user's prospective information needs by recognizing the user's plan; pre-fetches information that is likely to be used \u2026",

We introduce fractured subteams as a novel formalism for modeling breakdowns in communication. We present a hybrid approach that employs distributed coordination mechanisms to provide robustness to these communication breakdowns and exploits opportunistic centralization. By modeling the problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem, we are able to apply constraint optimization techniques to efficiently find optimal or near optimal solutions to the difficult class of time critical tight coordination team planning problems. We then demonstrate that explicitly reasoning about communication failures through the incorporation of selective disruption minimization significantly improves team performance.",

Operators are utilized for identifying victims, by means of camera feeds from the robot, and for helping with navigation when autonomy is insufficient. As the size of these robot teams increase, the mental workload on operators increases dramatically, and robots may find themselves in precarious situations with no assistance for resolution. This paper presents an approach that utilizes multiple levels of autonomy to allow a robot to consider a range of options, including asking for operator assistance, for dealing with problematic situations to maximize efficient use of the operator\u2019s time. Individual robots use self awareness to determine failures in task progression, a form of local autonomy. Upon this trigger, the robot evaluates decisions to properly route asking for help, consensus autonomy. A queue system alerts the operator (s) to incoming requests for assistance. This results in a better use of operator time by focusing attention where it is needed. Experiments explore the effectiveness of agents\u2019 decisions, both local and team-level, with multiple simulators. A high fidelity simulator and user interface further evaluate how effective robot information is relayed to the operator, through human trials.",

This cost profile enabled us to make the following observations:(1) the satisfiability thresholds are identified in the narrow region on the x-y plane (where the x-axis is the number of intra-agent constraints and the y-axis is the number of inter-agent constraints) in which the sum of intra-and interagent constraints is constant, and problem instances in the region (called the crossover belt) are likely to be expensive in terms of the median cost;(2) among problem instances on the crossover belt, those with a smaller number of intra-agent constraints and a larger number of inter-agent constraints may be more expensive; and (3) for a fixed total number of variables, problem instances on the crossover belt may be more expensive as the number of agents increases or the number of variables per agent decreases.

In order to strengthen the description of web resources, so that they are more meaningful to both humans and machines, web semantics have been proposed. These allow better annotation, understanding, search, interpretation and composition of these-sources. The growing importance of these has brought about a great increase in research into these issues. We propose a series of books that will address key issues in web semantics on an annual basis. This book series can be considered as an extended journal published annually. The series will combine theoretical results, standards, and their realizations in applications and implementations. The series is titled \u201cAdvances in Web Sem-tics\u201d and will be published periodically by Springer to promote emerging Semantic Web technologies. It will contain the cream of the collective contribution of the Int-national Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Web Semantics Working Group; WG 2. 12 & WG 12. 4. This book, addressing the current state of the art, is the first in the series. In subsequent years, books will address a particular theme, topic or issue where the greatest advances are being made. Examples of such topics include:(i) process semantics,(ii) web services,(iii) ontologies,(iv) workflows,(v) trust and reputation,(vi) web applications, etc. Periodically, perhaps every five years, there will be a scene-setting state of the art volume.",

Canadian, Chinese and Indian participants engaged in an intracultural dyadic interaction using a virtual decision making game, FireSim, where they had to protect their village and its assets from seasonal fires with the option of requesting help and/or providing help to a neighboring village (counterpart). The results illustrate that Canadians (individualists) were less influenced by the situation, as their helping behavior was not significantly affected by partner's helping behavior, compared to Chinese and Indian individuals (collectivists).

            "Abstract": "Collision avoidance for multirobot systems is a well studied problem. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed for synthesizing controllers guarantee collision avoidance and goal stabilization for multiple robots. However, it has been noted reactive control synthesis methods (such as CBFs) are prone to deadlock, an equilibrium of system dynamics causes robots to come to a standstill before reaching their goals. In this paper, we formally derive characteristics of deadlock in a multirobot system uses CBFs. We propose a novel approach to analyze deadlocks resulting from optimization based controllers (CBFs) by borrowing tools from duality theory and graph enumeration. Our key insight is system deadlock is characterized by a force-equilibrium on robots and we show how complexity of deadlock analysis increases approximately exponentially with the number of robots. This analysis allows us to interpret deadlock as a subset of the state space, and we prove this set is non-empty, bounded and located on the boundary of the safety set. Finally, we use these properties to develop a provably correct decentralized algorithm for deadlock resolution which ensures robots converge to their goals while avoiding collisions. We show simulation results of the resolution algorithm for two and three robots and experimentally validate this algorithm on Khepera-IV robots.",

Two salient factors responsible for violence in multi-cultural societies (that are identified in the social sciences literature) are (a) ethno-religious identity of the population and (b) spatial structure(distribution) of the population. It has also been experimentally shown by Lumsden that multi-cultural conflict can be viewed as a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. Using the above observations, we model the multi-cultural conflict problem as a variant of the repeated PD game in graphs. The graph consists of labeled nodes corresponding to the different ethno-religious types and the topology of the graph encode the spatial distribution and interaction of the population. The agents play the game with neighbors of their opponent type and they update their strategies based on neighbors of their same type. This strategy \u2026",

Simulation results show that the belief dynamics of a large team have the properties of a Self-Organizing Critical system. A key property of such systems is that they regularly enter critical states, where one additional input can cause dramatic, system wide changes. In the belief sharing case, this criticality corresponds to a situation where one additional sensor input causes many agents to change their beliefs.

In a team with many autonomous vehicles and many sensors, there is a large volume of information available from which to create that view. However, typically communication bandwidth limitations prevent all sensor readings being shared with all other team members. This paper presents three policies for sharing information in a large team that balance the value of information against communication costs. Analytical and empirical evidence of their effectiveness is provided. The results show that using some easily obtainable probabilistic information about the team dramatically improves overall belief sharing performance. Specifically, by collectively estimating the value of a piece of information, the team can make most efficient use of its communication resources.",

            "Abstract": "Data in real world applications is often subject to some kind of uncertainty, which can be due to incompleteness, unreliability or inconsistency. This poses a great challenge for ontology-based data access (OBDA) applications, which are expected to provide a meaningful answers to queries, even under uncertain domains. Several extensions of classical OBDA systems has been proposed to address this problem, with probabilistic, possibilistic, and fuzzy OBDA being the most relevant ones. However, these extensions present some limitations with respect to their applicability. Probabilistic OBDA deal only with categorical assertions, possibilistic logic is better suited to make a ranking of axioms, and fuzzy OBDA addresses the problem of modelling vagueness, rather than uncertainty. In this paper we propose Subjective DL-Lite (SDL-Lite), an extension of DL-Lite with Subjective Logic. Subjective DL-Lite allows us to model uncertainty in the data through the application of opinions, which encapsulate our degrees of belief, disbelief and uncertainty for each given assertion. We explore the semantics of Subjective DL-Lite, clarify the main differences with respect to its classical DL-Lite counterpart, and construct a canonical model of the ontology by means of a chase that will serve as the foundation for a future construction of an OBDA system supporting opinions.",

In these applications, each robot collects a large amount of task-specific data that must be sent to the human periodically to keep the human aware of task progress. It is often the case that the human-robot communication links are extremely bandwidth constrained and/or have significantly higher latency than inter-robot communication links, so it is impossible for all robots to send their task-specific data together. Thus, only a subset of robots, which we call the knowledge leaders, can send their data at a time.

The cognitive workload is significantly increased when a user must not only cope with a complex environment, but also with a set of unaccustomed rules that prescribe how the coalition planning process must be carried out. In this context, we develop a prognostic assistant agent that takes a proactive stance in assisting cognitively overloaded human users by providing timely support for normative reasoning\u2013reasoning about prohibitions and obligations. Existing work on automated norm management relies on a deterministic view of the planning model [1], where norms are specified in terms of classical logic; in this approach, violations are detected only after they have occurred, consequently assistance can only be provided after the user has already committed actions that caused the violation [3]. By contrast, our agent predicts potential future violations and proactively takes action to help prevent the user from violating the norms.Here, we introduce the notion of prognostic normative reasoning so that the agent can reason about norm-compliant planning in advance. In order for that, we use probabilistic plan recognition to predict the user\u2019s future plan steps based on the user\u2019s current",

There has been recent interest in safe operations of robotic swarms under human control. Verification and validation techniques for these human-machine systems could be deployed to provide formal guarantees of safe performance. A current limitation that hinders practical significant applications of verification to human-machine systems is the lack of analytic models of the human operator that include realistic cognitive constraints. Our research aims to develop high fidelity analytic human models via abstraction of cognitive models based on ACT-R. In this paper, we report on results from the first step in this process. We designed a 2-choice control task of a robotic swarm, obtained data from human operators and compared the fit of these data to two analytic models and an ACT-R based cognitive model. We present the experimental results and discuss our future plans on how the analytic model will be derived from the cognitive model so that the whole human-swarm system could be amenable to verification techniques.",

In this paper we report 1) a pilot study illustrating the susceptibility of the current faultline measures to subjective evaluations, and 2) an online study illustrating how people\u2019s surface (e.g. age, gender, race) and deep (e.g. personality, cultural norms) level diversity attributes impact their preference and selection of team members, as a proxy of faultline formation.

Some research has identified the roles that agents could play in hybrid teams: supporting individual team members, being a teammate, or supporting the team as a whole [99]. Some other work [57] has investigated trust concepts as the fundamental building block for effective human-agent teamwork or posited the types of shared knowledge that promote mutual understanding between cooperating humans and agents [9, 68]. However, many of the facets of human agent teamwork models, such as communication protocols for forming mutual intelligibility, performing team monitoring to assess progress, forming joint goals, addressing task interdependencies in hybrid teamwork are still unexplored. In this report, we address the following questions: 1. what factors affect human team task performance and cognition? 2. how can agent coordination mechanisms be adapted for human-agent teams? 3. with current technologies, what roles can agents successfully fill in hybrid human-agent teams?4. what are the barriers to human-agent interaction?",

            "Abstract": "Over the last decade, research in agent-based systems (ABS) has spawned a multi-faceted field, addressing a broad range of challenges and generating a varied array of technical approaches. Web service technologies, in contrast, have arisen in a more incremental fashion, with more modest aims, although the vision statements associated with Web services sometimes overlap significantly with those of ABS. Work on Semantic Web services aims to provide richer specifications of services, so as to enable fuller, more flexible automation of service provision and use, support the construction of more powerful tools and methodologies, and promote the use of semantically well-founded reasoning about services. This chapter provides an overview of OWL-S, a Semantic Web services ontology, and discusses its connections with work on agent-based systems. We argue that OWL-S takes some significant \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been some outstanding work on applying deep reinforcement learning to multi-agent settings. Often in such multi-agent scenarios, adversaries can be present. We address the requirements of such a setting by implementing a graph-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. In this work, we consider the scenario of multi-agent deception in which multiple agents need to learn to cooperate and communicate in order to deceive an adversary. We have employed a two-stage learning process to get the cooperating agents to learn such deceptive behaviors. Our experiments show that our approach allows us to employ curriculum learning to increase the number of cooperating agents in the environment and enables a team of agents to learn complex behaviors to successfully deceive an adversary.

In this paper, we report on the development of an assistant agent architecture that integrates plan recognition, current and future user information needs, workload estimation and adaptive information presentation to aid an emergency response manager in making high quality decisions under time stress, while avoiding cognitive overload. We describe the main components of a full implementation of this architecture as well as a simulation developed to evaluate the system. Our evaluation consists of simulating various possible executions of the emergency response plans used in the real world and measuring the expected time taken by an unaided human user, as well as one that receives information assistance from our system. In the experimental condition of agent assistance, we also examine the effects of different error rates in the agent's estimation of user's stat or information needs.",

Through a human factors lens, the present research builds on earlier HSwI work and investigates the effect of swarm asset degradations on trustworthiness perceptions, reliance intentions, and reliance behaviors. Results showed that trustworthiness perceptions of and intentions to rely on swarms (but not reliance behaviors) were correlated, demonstrating the relation between theoretically relevant antecedents to trust in HSwI contexts. Contrary to past work, the results showed no statistical evidence that asset degradations differentially affect trustworthiness perceptions, reliance intentions, or reliance behaviors. Limitations of the current work (e.g., heterogeneity of post-intervention foraging behavior, sample size) are discussed and followed with future research suggestions.",

However, many realistic queries cannot be matched by individual services and only a combination of several services can satisfy such queries. Allowing service combinations or proper compositions of primitive services as a valid match introduces problems such as unwanted side-effects (i.e., producing an effect that is not requested), effect duplicities (i.e., producing some effect more than once) and contradictory effects (i.e., producing both an effect and its negation). Also the ranking of matched services has to be reconsidered for service combinations.

In this paper, motivated by modeling of conflict scenarios in societies with multiple ethno-religious groups, we study repeated PD games in graph with multiple types of agents. In our model with two types of agents, agents play PD game with neighbors of the other type and their strategy update neighborhood can consist of either (a) neighbors of their own type or (b) neighbors of both type.

In our model, each robot can do a fixed number of tasks and obtains a benefit (or incurs a cost) for each task. The tasks are divided into groups and each robot can do only one task from each group. These constraints arise when the robots have to do a set of tasks that have precedence constraints and each task takes the same time to be completed.

Unlike existing approaches, which are either computationally expensive or communication intensive, the presented approach allows large numbers of vehicles to plan independently with low communication overhead. The key to the algorithm is to observe that, in sparse environments, collisions are exceptional and that most of the time vehicles will simply not hit each other. Hence, it is reasonable to allow vehicles to plan independently and then resolve the small number of conflicts. We operationalize this by having each vehicle send their planned paths to a small number of their team mates via tokens. Each team member is required to check for conflicting paths that they have been informed about via a token and inform those involved when any conflict is detected. Both analytic and \u2026",

Our objective is to design coordination algorithms to minimize the cost of electricity consumption of the consumer collective while allowing the consumers to make their own consumption decisions based on their private consumption constraints and preferences. Minimizing the cost is not only of interest to the consumers but is also socially desirable because it reduces the consumption at times of peak demand (since differential pricing mechanisms like time-of-use pricing is usually used by electricity companies to discourage consumption at times of peak demand). We develop an iterative coordination algorithm in which the coordinator makes the storage decision and shapes the demands of the consumers by designing a virtual price signal for the agents. We prove that our algorithm converges, and it achieves the optimal solution under realistic conditions We also present simulation results based on real world consumption data to quantify the performance of our algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "Recently, there has been increasing interest in transparency and interpretability in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. Verbal explanations, as the most natural way of communication in our daily life, deserve more attention, since they allow users to gain a better understanding of the system which ultimately could lead to a high level of trust and smooth collaboration. This paper reports a novel work in generating verbal explanations for DRL behaviors agent. A rule-based model is designed to construct explanations using a series of rules which are predefined with prior knowledge. A learning model is then proposed to expand the implicit logic of generating verbal explanation to general situations by employing rule-based explanations as training data. The learning model is shown to have better flexibility and generalizability than the static rule-based model. The performance of both models is evaluated quantitatively through objective metrics. The results show that verbal explanation generated by both models improve subjective satisfaction of users towards the interpretability of DRL systems. Additionally, seven variants of the learning model are designed to illustrate the contribution of input channels, attention mechanism, and proposed encoder in improving the quality of verbal explanation.",

Research shows trust is critical in the development of appropriate reliance on automation. To examine how trust mediates the human-automation relationships across cultures, the present study investigated the influences of cultural factors on trust in automation. Theoretically guided empirical studies were conducted in the U.S., Taiwan and Turkey to examine how cultural dynamics affect various aspects of trust in automation.

            "Publication url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08963",
            "Abstract": "The current landscape of multi-agent expert imitation is broadly dominated by two families of algorithms - Behavioral Cloning (BC) and Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL). BC approaches suffer from compounding errors, as they ignore the sequential decision-making nature of the trajectory generation problem. Furthermore, they cannot effectively model multi-modal behaviors. While AIL methods solve the issue of compounding errors and multi-modal policy training, they are plagued with instability in their training dynamics. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a novel self-supervised loss that encourages the discriminator to approximate a richer reward function. We employ our method to train a graph-based multi-agent actor-critic architecture that learns a centralized policy, conditioned on a learned latent interaction graph. We show that our method (SS-MAIL) outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on real-world prediction tasks, as well as on custom-designed synthetic experiments. We prove that SS-MAIL is part of the family of AIL methods by providing a theoretical connection to cost-regularized apprenticeship learning. Moreover, we leverage the self-supervised formulation to introduce a novel teacher forcing-based curriculum (Trajectory Forcing) that improves sample efficiency by progressively increasing the length of the generated trajectory. The SS-MAIL framework improves multi-agent imitation capabilities by stabilizing the policy training, improving the reward shaping capabilities, as well as providing the ability for modeling multi-modal trajectories.",

Therefore, the Matchmaker was developed to enhance the UDDI search functionality by using semantics such as ontology and constraints. However, for Web Services as e-Business platform, compliance with the standard specification such as SOAP, WSDL, UDDI is the key. Thus, our goal of this experiment is to seamlessly combine semantic search with those standards, and investigate the feasibility of using semantics with Web Services.

While planning for joint action in these scenarios is already a complex problem for human planners, it is made more difficult or even impossible under such policy constraints, especially if policy conflicts exist between them. In this paper we propose that agents could be used to support human planners in coalitions, and present our work in the area of agent support for coalition mission planning under such policy constraints. We define a taxonomy of policies and outline the different types of support that agents can provide to human planners. We describe an experimental framework within which different types of agent support can be empirically evaluated within the context of a human planning problem.",

High Throughput Phenotyping (HTP) uses robotic technologies to analyze crops in order to determine species with favorable traits, however, the current practices rely on exhaustive coverage and data collection from the entire crop field being monitored under the breeding experiment. This works well in relatively small agricultural fields but can not be scaled to the larger ones, thus limiting the progress of genetics research. In this work, we propose an active learning algorithm to enable an autonomous system to collect the most informative samples in order to accurately learn the distribution of phenotypes in the field with the help of a Gaussian Process model. We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the current practices on sorghum phenotype data collection.",

            "Abstract": "Robotic swarms are decentralized multi-robot systems whose members use local information from proximal neighbors to execute simple reactive control laws that result in emergent collective behaviors. In contrast, members of a general multi-robot system may have access to global information, all- to-all communication or sophisticated deliberative collabora- tion. Some algorithms in the literature are applicable to robotic swarms. Others require the extra complexity of general multi- robot systems. Given an application domain, a system designer or supervisory operator must choose an appropriate system or algorithm respectively that will enable them to achieve their goals while satisfying mission constraints (e.g. bandwidth, energy, time limits). In this paper, we compare representative swarm and general multi-robot algorithms in two application domains - navigation and dynamic area coverage - with respect to several metrics (e.g. completion time, distance trav- elled). Our objective is to characterize each class of algorithms to inform offline system design decisions by engineers or online algorithm selection decisions by supervisory operators. Our contributions are (a) an empirical performance comparison of representative swarm and general multi-robot algorithms in two application domains, (b) a comparative analysis of the algorithms based on the theory of information invariants, which provides a theoretical characterization supported by our empirical results.",

A non-biased mediator, who applies query learning to maintain near Pareto-efficiency without heavy computation, is adopted in the model.

Swarms comprise assets, which operate as a unified group to complete goals like target foraging and shape configuration for asset movement optimization. Though the algorithmic specifications of swarm operations make them robust to individual asset loss, it is unknown how viewing asset degradations affects operator trust towards swarms. To investigate this relationship, modifications to an extant simulator of swarm foraging behaviors were implemented to portray functional asset degradation. Participants viewed recordings of swarms foraging, each comprising a randomized percentage of asset degradation. After each recording, participants rated their intentions to rely on the swarms in a target foraging task.

One major question is how to turn a team of experts into an expert team. Several strategies such as task-related cross-training have emerged. In addition to traditional behaviorally based methods for facilitating team development, advances in computer science and robotics are now allowing the introduction of artificial intelligence (ie, intelligent agents) into teamwork in a variety of roles and functions. This advent of agent technologies raises two questions:(a) what kinds of assistance can be provided and (b) what kinds of assistance prove beneficial. The reported research attempts to answer these questions through technology demonstrations to document what is possible and behavioral experiments to identify what may be helpful.(PsycInfo Database Record \u2026",

The operator's situation awareness is likely to degrade as an increasing number of surveillance videos must be viewed and integrated. The Picture-in-Picture display (PiP) provides one solution for integrating multiple UAV camera video by allowing the operator to view the video feed in the context of surrounding terrain.

We introduce the cut-loop routine that discards looping behavior, and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically within a simplified NEO (non-combatant evacuation operation) domain. This domain consists of several agents which ferry groups of evacuees to one of several shelters. We demonstrate that the cut-loop routine makes the Profit-sharing approach adaptive and robust within a dynamic and uncertain domain, without the need for predefined knowledge or subgoals. We also compare it empirically with the popular Q-learning approach.",

Teams with many vehicles and sensors generate a large amount of information from which to create those views. However, bandwidth limitations typically prevent exhaustive sharing of this information. As team size and information diversity grows, it becomes even harder to provide agents with needed information within bandwidth constraints, and it is impractical for members to maintain any detailed information for every team mate. Building on previous token-based algorithms, this chapter presents an approach for efficiently sharing information in large teams. The key distinction from previous work is that this approach models differences in how agents in the team value knowledge and certainty about features.

This makes cognitive social simulation techniques particularly appealing as a means to undertake experiments into socially-distributed cognition. The current paper reports on the results of an ongoing effort to develop a cognitive social simulation capability that can be used to undertake studies into team cognition using the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The focus of the cognitive modeling effort associated with the development effort is a particular team-based problem solving task that forms part of the Experimental Laboratory for Investigating Collaboration, Information-sharing, and Trust ELICIT experimentation framework. This task has been used with human subjects to investigate the effect of different command and control organizational structures on collective problem solving performance. The results of the cognitive modeling effort are presented and future work to extend both the simulation capability and the cognitive model are outlined. By comparing the results obtained with the ACT-R simulation capability with those obtained from previous experiments using the ELICIT experimentation framework, it should be possible to evaluate the extent to which ACT-R agents exhibit performance profiles similar to those of their human counterparts. This will support the effort to evaluate the extent to which cognitive social simulation experiments with ACT-R can be used to generate findings of predictive relevance to future studies using the ELICIT experimentation \u2026",

In cases where the swarm is tasked with monitoring wildfire containment, for example, failing to send vehicles to douse a newly ignited brush fire could result in the loss of wildfire containment. As a direct consequence, additional area may be burned, negatively affecting local populations and wildlife. Each newly sensed job requires the swarm to break off and send a vehicle or group of vehicles to the job site for a specific amount of time. The number of vehicles and the service time are determined by the type of job that is sensed.

In this paper we study vertical specialization as a reason for hierarchical structures. In vertically specialized systems, more highly skilled agents are also more costly. By using less capable agents to initially process tasks and forwarding only exceptional tasks to more capable agents, such systems may be able to economize on the number of highly capable agents. The result is a hierarchical structure with least capable agents at the bottom. However, such a structure increases the delay in completing some tasks, because they must pass through multiple levels of control. Thus, vertical specialization presents a tradeoff between economizing on skilled agents and increasing task completion time. We find that for a wide range of settings, vertical specialization induces an optimal hierarchy of height at most three. This suggests that a multi-agent system designer interested in exploiting vertical specialization needs to use at most three levels of specialization in order to reap most of the benefits.",

In recent years two parallel efforts emerged that have the potential of overcoming this limitation: the first effort is the Semantic Web [1] which provides the tools for the explicit markup of the content of Web pages. The second effort aims to the development of Web services: self contained programs that by becoming the producers and consumers of information facilitate the automation of business transactions. The objective of the Semantic Web is to provide languages to express the content of Web pages and to make accessible to agents and computer programs the information that those pages contain. More precisely, the Semantic Web is based on a set of languages such as RDF and OWL that can be used to markup the content of Web pages. These languages have a well-defined semantics and a proof theory that allows agents to draw inferences over the statements of the language. As an example, an agent may use the semantic markup of the NOAA page reporting the weather conditions in Pittsburgh, and learn that the current condition is Heavy Snow; furthermore, the agent may infer from the semantic markup of the Pittsburgh school board page that in days of heavy snow all the schools are closed. By combining the two pieces of information, the agent would infer that indeed today Pittsburgh schools are closed.",

In this paper we develop a sequential game theory model to capture the interactions among crowdfunders, the solar farm owner, and an electricity company who purchases renewable energy generated by the solar farm. By characterizing a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, and comparing it with a benchmark model without crowdfunding, we find that although the farm owner reduces its investment level under crowdfunding, the overall green energy investment level is increased due to the contribution of crowdfunders.",

An additional analysis of false positives and false negatives of the hybrid matching filters of OWLS-MX led to an even further improved matchmaker version called OWLS-MX2.",

We demonstrate how complex team relationships that are not easily expressed by region-based heuristics can be modeled from data and domain knowledge in a way that is robust to noise and spatial variation. To represent team behaviors in our domain of MOUT (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) planning, we employ two classes of spatial models: 1) team templates that encode static relationships between team members and external landmarks; and 2) spatially-invariant Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to represent evolving \u2026",

Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed to mediate between collision avoidance and goal achievement for multiple robots. However, it has been noted that reactive controllers (such as CBFs) are prone to deadlock, an equilibrium that causes the robots to stall before reaching their goals. In this paper, we formally analyze two and three robot systems and discover circumstances under which CBFs cause deadlocks using duality theory. For the two robot system, we consider mutually heterogeneous robots (such as one more vigorous or closer to its goal than the other) and prove that this heterogeneity does not help in preventing deadlock. We then consider three robots, and conclude from these two scenarios that the geometric symmetry resulting from robots\u2019 initial positions and goals constrains CBFs to generate velocities \u2026",

Location of web services is inherently a semantic problem, because it has to abstract from the superficial differences between representations of the services provided, and the services requested to recognize semantic similarities between the two.

This article focuses on the novel problem of recovering agent-to-team assignments for complex team tasks where team composition, the mapping of agents into teams, changes over time.

            "Abstract": "In order to support the use of cognitive architectures in computer simulation studies involving virtual environments, an integration solution is proposed that enables ACT-R cognitive models to communicate with the Unity game engine. The integration solution is tested using virtual robots that are able to move around a 3D virtual environment and interact with various objects. The robots are equipped with visual, tactile and proprioceptive sensor systems, which yield information about the current sensory state of the robot. This information is communicated to an ACT-R model that subsequently controls the behaviour of the robot by making decisions about motor output. The performance of the model and the integrity of the integration solution are evaluated using a task that requires a virtual robot to retrieve target objects and deposit them in a specified goal location.",

The combination mode shares the risk in the supply chain. The existing research has examined the supply chain modes from various operational aspects. However, the impact of financial constraint is neglected. This paper examines the impact of financial constraint and investigates the supply chain efficiency under each mode.

Providing automated decision support for such environments is a very challenging problem, due to shortening decision cycles, the changing nature of threats, opponent tactics, and environmental unpredictability. Intelligent agents have the promise to provide timely assistance in various areas of decentralized, collaborative decision making, such as information gathering, information dissemination, monitoring of team progress and alerting the team to various unexpected events. In order to fulfil the promise of agent technology in providing effective team assistance, better understanding of robust human-agent teamwork is crucial. The goal of our research project is to develop a theoretically grounded and empirically tested framework to allow for effective agent support for human teams that are engaged in adaptive teamwork in dynamic environments. In order to a establish an experimental baseline of the performance of human-only teams and b understand where agents can provide the best utility in supporting human teamwork, we designed a scenario and experimentally evaluated team work where human teams performed a time-stressed, collaborative search task in a multi-player gaming environment. The collaborative search task recreates some of the challenges faced by human teams during search and rescue operations in the real world.

Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a framework to model the uncertainty arisen from the unknown location of the evader. However, the approach is intractable even with a single pursuer and an evader. Therefore, we propose a Hybrid Hierarchical POMDP structure for improved scalability and efficiency. The structure consists of (i) the base MDPs for the cases where the evader is visible to the pursuers, (ii) the abstract POMDPs for the evader states that are not directly observable, and (iii) the transition states bridging between the base MDPs and abstract POMDPs. This hybrid approach significantly reduces the number of states expanded in the policy tree to solve the problem by abstracting environment structures. Experimental results show \u2026",

We believe that to design and build software agents that can assist human teams, we need develop automated techniques to identify the roles of the human decision-makers.

The testbed we used in our experiments i an abstraction of the meeting scheduling problem, called the Meeting Scheduling Game, which has competitive as well as cooperative features. The agents are selfish, and use a rational decision theoretic approach based on the probabilistic models that the agent is learning. We view agent modeling as an iterative and gradual process, where every new piece of information about a particular agent is analyzed in such a way that the model of the agent is further refined. We present our Bayesian-modeler agent which updates his models about the others using a Bayesian updating mechanism. We propose a framework for measuring the performance of different modelling strategies and establish quantified lower and upper limits for the performance of any modeling strategy. Finally, we contrast the performances of a modeler from an individual and from a collective point of view, comparing the benefits for the modeler itself as well as for the group as a whole.",

            "Abstract": "In the real world, agents often have to operate in situations with incomplete information, limited sensing capabilities, and inherently stochastic environments, making individual observations incomplete and unreliable. Moreover, in many situations it is preferable to delay a decision rather than run the risk of making a bad decision. In such situations it is necessary to aggregate information before taking an action; however, most state of the art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are biased towards taking actions \\textit{at every time step}, even if the agent is not particularly confident in its chosen action. This lack of caution can lead the agent to make critical mistakes, regardless of prior experience and acclimation to the environment. Motivated by theories of dynamic resolution of uncertainty during decision making in biological brains, we propose a simple accumulator module which accumulates evidence in favor of each possible decision, encodes uncertainty as a dynamic competition between actions, and acts on the environment only when it is sufficiently confident in the chosen action. The agent makes no decision by default, and the burden of proof to make a decision falls on the policy to accrue evidence strongly in favor of a single decision. Our results show that this accumulator module achieves near-optimal performance on a simple guessing game, far outperforming deep recurrent networks using traditional, forced action selection policies.",

The environment features a simple maze that the robot is required to navigate. Communication between ACT-R and Unity is established using a network-based inter-operability framework. The ability of the robot to learn about the spatial structure of its environment and navigate to designated goal locations serves as a test of the ability of the framework to support the integrative use of cognitive architectures and virtual environments in a range of research and development contexts.",

In this report we provide an extensive literature review on the research of bilateral negotiations in the fields of Economics and Artificial Intelligence. Three important dimensions are described to identify the negotiation environment and to build a research model. Preliminary considerations and suggestions are given in these dimensions on modelling the system. The review suggests that negotiations with outside options is a new and important research problem, yet it can be addressed, based on the existing work.\"",

The robots have the capability to recognize the site that they are in and receive messages from a central supervisory controller, but they cannot communicate with other robots. There is a cost (e.g., energy, time) for the robots to move from one site to another. These limitations make the swarm hard to control to achieve the desired configurations.

Complex multi-agent tasks typically require dynamic teams where the team membership changes over time. Teams split into subteams to work in parallel, merge with other teams to tackle more demanding tasks, and disband when plans are completed. We introduce a new multi-agent plan representation that explicitly encodes dynamic team membership and demonstrate the suitability of this formalism for plan recognition. From our multi-agent plan representation, we extract local temporal dependencies that dramatically prune the hypothesis set of potentially-valid team plans. The reduced plan library can be efficiently processed using existing tree search techniques to obtain the team state history. Although multi-agent plan recognition is theoretically more computationally expensive than singleagent plan recognition, we show that, in practice, the presence of agent resource dependencies significantly reduces the set of potentially-valid plans.",

However, laser scanned data contains inaccurate data points at spatial discontinuities (object edges). These inaccurate points, known as mixed-pixels, are commonly removed from the data prior to geometric modeling or other downstream processes. The removal of points at the edges of objects introduces error in the geometry of the objects, and object dimensions extracted from the data, such as widths and heights, are usually smaller than the actual values. In many cases, these losses due to removal of points at edges can exceed measurement accuracy tolerances specified in inspection manuals.

Traditional software engineering methods fail to account for new demands of flexibility and adaptability in the construction of software systems. On the other hand, concepts of Virtual Organizations and Electronic Institutions cater for the need of open, heterogenous software environments, where agents may dynamically organize themselves into organizational structures, determined by roles, norms and contracts. Our work aims to facilitate the engineering of heterogenous and distributed systems by providing only a specification of the desired overall system behavior, expressed as a set of norms, and rely on capabilities and properties of individual agents that allow them to dynamically form the desired complete software system. In particular, we present a framework, called Requirement-driven Contracting (RdC), for automatically deriving executable norms from requirements and associated relevant information. RdC facilitates the governance of MAS by ensuring that all requirements, along with runtime changes of requirements are appropriately and automatically reflected in the norms regulating the behavior of MAS.",

In these environments, it may be difficult for agents to form stable trust relationships necessary for confident interactions. Societies may break down when trust between agents is too low to motivate interactions. In such settings, agents should make decisions about who to interact with, given their degree of trust in the available partners. We propose a decision-theoretic model of trust decision making that allows controls to be used, as well as trust, to increase confidence in initial interactions. We consider explicit incentives, monitoring and reputation as examples of such controls. We evaluate our approach within a simulated, highly-dynamic multiagent environment, and show how this model supports the making of delegation decisions when trust is low.",

Although these pre-defined structures succeeded in lessening the undesirable effect due to the existence of multiple agents, they would also suppress the desirable emergence of cooperative behaviors in the multiagent domain. We show that the potential cooperative properties among the agent are emerged by means of profit-sharing (J. Grefenstette, 1988; K. Miyazaki et al., 1994) which is robust in the non-MDPs.",

The input to an ontology clustering system can be natural language texts, structured data, ontology knowledge bases, or their combinations. The output of an ontology clustering system is either a new ontology or an updated ontology with new concepts, new taxonomies, and new relations.This report surveys the ontology clustering methods that are potentially useful for the task of presenting answers to queries that are posted to ontology knowledge bases within the ITA project. The answer presentation can be viewed as a process which takes an ontology knowledge base and queries as input, and present the answers in the right level of concepts so that human users can easily understand the answers with as few cognitive efforts as possible. This might involve choosing the right ontology, creating and evolving existent ontology to present the answers. Ontology clustering methods can be used to identify the appropriate generalization of the concepts so as to reduce the cognitive load of human users to understand the answers.

            "Abstract": "For the most part, studies in the network science literature tend to focus on networks whose functional connectivity is largely invariant with respect to some episode of collective information processing. In the real world, however, networks with highly dynamic functional topologies tend to be the norm. In order to improve our understanding of the effect of dynamic networks on collective cognitive processing, we explored the problem-solving abilities of synthetic agents in dynamic networks, where the links between agents were progressively added throughout the problem-solving process. The results support the conclusion that (at least in some task contexts) dynamic networks contribute to a better profile of problem-solving performance compared to static networks (whose topologies are fixed throughout the course of information processing). Furthermore, the results suggest that constructive networks (like those used in the present study) strike a productive balance between autonomy and social influence. When agents are allowed to operate independently at the beginning of a problem-solving process, and then later allowed to communicate, the result is often a better profile of collective performance than if extensive communication had been permitted from the very outset of the problem-solving process. These results are relevant, we suggest, to a range of phenomena, such as groupthink, the common knowledge effect and production blocking, all of which have been observed in group problem-solving contexts.",

We define team activity recognition as the process of identifying team behaviors from traces of agent positions over time; for many physical domains, military or athletic, coordinated team behaviors create distinctive spatio-temporal patterns that can be used to identify low-level action sequences. This paper focuses on the novel problem of recovering agent-to-team assignments for complex team tasks where team composition, the mapping of agents into teams, changes over time. Without a priori knowledge of current team assignments, the behavior recognition problem is challenging since behaviors are characterized by the aggregate motion of the entire team and cannot generally be determined by observing the movements of a single agent in isolation. To handle this problem, we introduce a new algorithm, Simultaneous Team Assignment and Behavior Recognition (STABR), that generates behavior annotations from spatio-temporal agent traces. The proposed approach is able to perform accurate team behavior recognition without an exhaustive search over the combinatorial space of potential team assignments, as demonstrated on several scenarios of simulated military maneuvers.",

            "Abstract": "Consumers of resources in realistic applications (eg, web, multimedia) typically derive diminishing-return utilities from the amount of resource they receive. A resource provider who is deriving an equal amount of revenue from each satisfied user (eg, by online advertising), can maximize the number of users by identifying a satisfaction threshold for each user, ie, the minimal amount of resource the user requires in order to use the service (rather than drop out). A straightforward approach is to ask users to submit their minimal demands (direct revelation). Unfortunately, self-interested users may try to manipulate the system by submitting untruthful requirements.We propose an incentive-compatible mechanism for maximizing revenue in a resource allocation system where users are ex-ante symmetric (same amount of revenue for any satisfied user) and have diminishing-return utility functions. Users are encouraged by the mechanism to submit their true requirements and the system aims to satisfy as many users as possible. Unlike previous solutions, our mechanism does not require monetary payments from users or downgrading of service.",

They have typically been used to advance our understanding of human cognition in specific task environments; however, they have also been used to support the development of a variety of intelligent systems and agents (e.g., cognitive robots). There are a broad range of reasons to motivate the effort to integrate cognitive architectures with virtual environments. These include the development of intelligent virtual characters for the purposes of training simulations, enhanced gameplay experiences and the modelling of user/gamer behaviour. Virtual environments also support simulations of actual real-world environments (e.g., using physics engines and advanced lighting models) that can be used to perform computational simulations into embedded, extended, and embodied cognition. In the current report, we describe the effort to develop an integration framework that enables the ACT-R cognitive architecture to be used in conjunction with the Unity game engine. The resulting framework, referred to as the ACT-R Unity Integration (ACT-R UI) framework, enables individual ACT-R models to control the behaviour of virtual non-player characters that inhabit 3D virtual environments built on top of Unity. We first provide an overview of the ACT-R architecture and the Unity game engine. We describe the key features of both systems and discuss why they provide such a compelling target for integration. We then go on to describe the nature of the integration solution itself. We outline the extensions to the ACT-R \u2026",

To address these specific requirements, we develop an agent architecture that integrates user intention recognition, normative reasoning over a user's intention, and planning, execution and replanning for assistive actions.

These capabilities are organized around the technologies of agent-based approaches, simulation, and optimization relevant to team selection and performance. The report identifies supporting capabilities necessary for specifying and capturing team performance metrics in an experimental virtual simulation environment. Four applications of the model consistent with PISCES objectives are considered for the simulation prediction of team performance, team selection, individual diagnostic assessment of teamwork, and assessment of teamwork. The report is organized into six sections. Section 1 characterizes current knowledge of teamwork and the factors that would need to be incorporated in a comprehensive simulation of team behavior. Section 2 reviews agent-based models of teamwork describing work involving both teamwork approaches to the design of multiagent systems and agent-based representation of human behavior. Section 3 examines the advantages and disadvantages of agent-based modeling in the context of the complexity and richness of human teams and explores possible methods for overcoming the difficulties.

In spite of this, there are relatively few studies that have attempted to apply ACT-R to situations involving social interaction. This is an important omission since the social aspects of cognition have been a growing area of interest in the cognitive science community, and an understanding of the dynamics of collective cognition is of particular importance in many organizational settings. In order to support the computational modeling and simulation of socially-distributed cognitive processes, a simulation capability based on the ACT-R architecture is described. This capability features a number of extensions to the core ACT-R architecture that are intended to support social interaction and collaborative problem solving. The core features of a number of supporting applications and services are also described. These applications/services support the execution, monitoring and analysis of simulation experiments. Finally, a system designed to record human behavioral data in a collective problem-solving task is described. This system is being used to undertake a range of experiments with teams of human subjects, and it will ultimately support the development of high fidelity ACT-R cognitive models. Such models can be used in conjunction with the ACT-R simulation capability to test hypotheses concerning the interaction between cognitive, social and technological factors in tasks involving socially-distributed information processing.",

While this mechanism is very powerful and in some cases essential to achieving good search performance, the dynamics of the adaptation of such traits are often complex and difficult to predict. This paper presents a case study in which self-adapting mutation rates were found to quickly drop below the threshold of effectiveness, bringing productive search to a premature halt.

This paper introduces the game of Space Fortress as a RL benchmark which specifically targets these characteristics. We show that existing state-of-the-art RL algorithms are unable to learn to play the Space Fortress game, and then confirm that this poor performance is due to the RL algorithms' context insensitivity.

            "Abstract": "A number of studies in the network science literature have attempted to model the effect of network structure on cognitive state fluctuations in social networks. For the most part, these networks use highly simplified models of both cognitive state and social influence. In order to extend these studies and provide the basis for more complex network science simulations, a model of socially-mediated cognitive change is presented. The model attempts to integrate ideas and concepts from a number of disciplines, most notably psychology, evolutionary biology and complexity science. In the model, cognitive states are modelled as networks of binary variables, each of which indicates an agent\u2019s belief in a particular fact. The links between variables represent the \u2018logical\u2019 dependencies between beliefs, and these dependencies are based on an agent\u2019s knowledge of the domain to which the beliefs apply. Drawing on the psychological notion of cognitive dissonance, it is further suggested that agents are under internal pressure to adopt highly consistent belief configurations, and this identifies one source of cognitive dynamism in the model. Another source of dynamism derives from the structure of the social network. Here, the existence of network ties creates a dependency between the belief systems of connected agents. Cognitive change in such \u2018coupled belief systems\u2019 is modelled using Kauffman\u2019s NK(C) model of co-evolutionary development in biological systems. As a final source of cognitive dynamism, the model incorporates the notion of an aggregate belief system (or cultural model), which represents the dominant set of beliefs associated with \u2026",

We are interested in situations where coalitions have to be formed ad-hoc without much co-training. For this, we investigate how agents can support human planners in producing good plans while observing the normative standards that regulate their planning and communication behavior. Based on an implementation of such norm-processing agents, we conducted a set of experiments, where human test subjects were conducting collaborative planning tasks under the guidance of these agents.

            "Abstract": "Robot swarms are homogeneous multi-robot systems that form collective behaviour from decentralized local interactions. Swarms are a favorable choice for solving various problems in robotics as they are robust and fault tolerant in nature, the individual swarm agents themselves being cost effective alternatives to the solution. Developing swarm technology aids in large scale data collection and environmental exploration, package delivery, warehouse management, military reconnaissance, and search and rescue. With the growing interest in developing swarm systems, much researcher and developer time is spent migrating, integrating, and coordinating these various swarm solutions that become deprecated and isolated from the community in frequent cycle. Furthermore, despite the aforementioned swarm architectures provided insights into specific design considerations, there still lacks a generalized architecture that outlines a full swarm pipeline, and is modular enough in design to be readily interchanged with new components as both research and industry advance. We present an architecture for developing full stack swarm systems. Such a system must allow for easy design, deployment, interaction, and evaluation. Using our proposed architecture, we then implemented a framework titled: CMUSWARM, on the ROS platform using Gazebo with irobot create for simulation. We then conduct an evaluation of our architecture by comparing two simple swarm control-laws within the framework.",

Current work focuses on domains, such as foraging, in which robots perform largely independent tasks.

The present study addresses the interaction between automation and organization of human teams in controlling large robot teams performing an urban search-and-rescue (USAR) task. Two possible ways to organize operators were identified: as individual assignments of robots to operators, assigned robots, or as a shared pool in which operators service robots from the population as needed.

In many operational settings, human operators are remotely located and the communication environment is harsh. Hence, there exists some latency in information (or control command) transfer between the human and the swarm. In this paper, we conduct experiments of human-swarm interaction to investigate the effects of communication latency on the performance of a human-swarm system in a swarm foraging task. We develop and investigate the concept of neglect benevolence, where a human operator allows the swarm to evolve on its own and stabilize before giving new commands. Our experimental results indicate that operators exploited neglect benevolence in different ways to develop successful strategies in the foraging task. Furthermore, we show experimentally that the use of a predictive display can help mitigate the adverse effects of communication latency.",

            "Abstract": "Human multi-robot control is a complex process: an operator\u2019s attention constantly shifts among various tasks to maintain the necessary awareness of a given situation, such as exploring environments and locating targets simultaneously. To minimize the laborious monitoring, if a robot can self-reflect its needs for interaction and alert an operator to any abnormalities, the operator\u2019s attention could be appropriately directed to urgent events in a timely manner. This type of human-robot interaction can be viewed as a queuing system, in which an operator acts as a server, and robots\u2019 requests for services are the jobs. This paper presents two experiments that investigated scheduling interventions. In the first experiment, participants performed search and rescue tasks while assisted by an alarmed system: Open-queue, in which all the alarms are displayed at once, or FIFO-queue (first-in-first-out approach), which shows only a single alarm at a time. The second study compared the FIFO and Open conditions from the first study with a shortest-job-first (SJF) queue system. The results show that operator attention can be effectively directed toward interaction with needed robots without degrading performance, which suggest the uses of the queueing disciplines could lead to superior performance while choosing between robot requests becomes more challenging. Additionally, to better understand operators\u2019 intention and resulting behaviors, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was applied to investigate human control processes in interactions with multi-robot teams. The HMM results demonstrated fundamental differences among queuing mechanisms, which \u2026",

Based on prior work, we hypothesize that to improve the performance of human teams, agents must do some combination of the following:(1) reduce the cost of the humans\u2019 information processing;(2) decrease uncertainty in the task;(3) improve coordination between team members;(4) directly assist in task completion. In order to (a) establish an experimental baseline of the performance of human-only teams for some particular task domain, and (b) best understand where agents can provide best utility in supporting human teamwork, we designed scenarios and performed experiments with human teams performing a time-stressed, collaborative search task in a multi-player gaming environment. The collaborative search task recreates some of the challenges faced by human teams during search and rescue operations, such as the one described in the Holistan scenario. In our experiments, we analyze (1) verbal communication between team members and (2) the effects of presenting or omitting task progress information. By ascertaining the information processing and coordination requirements of this team task, we expect to identify \u201cinsertion points\u201d for agent assistance to human teams. Agent assistance will be particularly critical to military teams as their operations become more agile and situation specific.

Embodiment and embedding are deemed to be important, it is argued, because extra-neural resources may shape the profile of brain-based processes, and, at least occasionally, they may feature in the realization of what are referred to as \u2018environmentally extended cognitive systems\u2019. This interest in situated, embodied and extended cognition motivates the development of cognitive computational models that can engage in complex forms of perceptuo-motor processing within highly dynamic and perceptually-rich environments. While the ACT-R cognitive architecture is capable of supporting certain forms of environmental interaction via a set of perceptuo-motor modules, in the majority of cases these modules are used to emulate the interaction seen with relatively simple devices, such as computer keyboards and display screens. In this paper, we show how ACT-R can be integrated with Microsoft\u2019s XNA Framework to support sophisticated forms of interaction with 3D virtual environments. The XNA Framework forms part of Microsoft\u2019s XNA Game Studio, which provides a managed runtime environment that supports the process of video game development. By demonstrating how ACT-R can be integrated with the XNA Framework, we hope to show how ACT-R agents could be embedded in a range of virtual 3D multiplayer game environments.

The problem is that in realistic composition or mediation scenarios in dynamic environments some specific gap can be bridged only by using a combination of several services which are not known and need to be discovered.

            "Abstract": "Neural agents trained in reinforcement learning settings can learn to communicate among themselves via discrete tokens, accomplishing as a team what agents would be unable to do alone. However, the current standard of using one-hot vectors as discrete communication tokens prevents agents from acquiring more desirable aspects of communication such as zero-shot understanding. Inspired by word embedding techniques from natural language processing, we propose neural agent architectures that enables them to communicate via discrete tokens derived from a learned, continuous space. We show in a decision theoretic framework that our technique optimizes communication over a wide range of scenarios, whereas one-hot tokens are only optimal under restrictive assumptions. In self-play experiments, we validate that our trained agents learn to cluster tokens in semantically-meaningful ways, allowing them communicate in noisy environments where other techniques fail. Lastly, we demonstrate both that agents using our method can effectively respond to novel human communication and that humans can understand unlabeled emergent agent communication, outperforming the use of one-hot communication.",

Their emergent behavior allows simple robots to accomplish complex tasks. Since missions may have complex objectives that change dynamically due to environmental and mission changes, human control and influence over the swarm is needed. The field of Human Swarm Interaction (HSI) is young, with few user studies, and even fewer papers focusing on giving non-visual feedback to the operator. The authors will herein present a background of haptics in robotics and swarms and two studies that explore various conditions under which haptic feedback may be useful in HSI. The overall goal of the studies is to explore the effectiveness of haptic feedback in the presence of other visual stimuli about the swarm system. The findings show that giving feedback about nearby obstacles using a haptic device can \u2026",

The design methodology uses the tools of statistical mechanics to create a probability distribution which relates groupings of agents, called Sharing Groups, to pair-wise agent divergences and social temperature. Social temperature is a decision parameter, the same for all agents, that agents use probabilistically to decide when to join a Sharing Group.

However, giving an operator the required control is difficult due to the complexity of the activities such teams engage in and the infeasibility of simply stopping the team whenever human input is required. Our approach to interaction in such a context has three key components which allow us to leverage human expertise by giving them responsibility for key coordination decisions, without risks to the coordination due to slow responses. First, to deal with the dynamic nature of the situation, we use pre-planned sequences of transfer of control actions called transfer-of-control strategies. Second, to allow identification of key coordination issues in a distributed way, individual coordination tasks are explicitly represented as coordination roles, rather than being \u2026",

For the protection of the agents in it's [sic] domain, each society of agents should make available certain services that allow agents to detect and avoid such attempts by malicious third parties. One of these is a rigorous method of identifying agents, so that each agent's actions can be referred to, recorded and evaluated. A robust identification mechanism can allow the construction of higher level-functions such as authentication, non-repudiation and secure communication. Agents can then use these basic functions provided by the MAS infrastructure along with their beliefs, current state of the MAS and the current goals to make decisions about trust. In this paper we present one architecture that allows agents to be named robustly, even in open environments, and build upon this scheme to provide MAS services that can allow agents to authenticate each other, digitally sign communication tokens and encrypt messages and data that is exchanged. We explore possible scenarios of the agent life in an open agent society and give an implementation independent architecture to secure agents and their environment.\"",

Token-based approaches have shown to be a novel and promising way for such coordination. However, previous token-based algorithms were built on heuristics and did not explicitly consider utilities related to token movements or changes in team states. In this paper we put forward an algorithm that uses team rewards to improve token routing decisions. The ideal solution of this token movement model is a centralized Markov Decision Process (MDP) with joint activity. Unfortunately, the assumptions underlying this model are not feasible for large team coordination and we have to make several approximations. First, we decentralize the centralized MDP as a set of standard MDPs with independent individual activities. Then this MDP is approximated by a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) because agents in a large team may not know the exact states of their teammates or that of the environment. A logical team organization is imposed to limit the token passing among one agent and its neighbors. Belief states of the POMDP model are efficiently estimated using Monte Carlo sampling process.",

Two levels of automation reliability, high (90%) and low (50%), were examined in the study. Performance for the queue mechanisms was equivalent confirming that operator attention can be effectively directed to improve performance. Additionally, the higher reliability condition raised an operator's success rate for resolving robot failures and assisted the operator in allocating attention to emergent events in a timely manner. Although the more frequent alerts contributed to better performance operators experienced increased levels of workload.",

Work on Semantic Web services aims to provide richer specifications of services, so as to enable fuller, more flexible automation of service provision and use, support the construction of more powerful tools and methodologies, and promote the use of semantically wellfounded reasoning about services. This chapter provides an overview of OWLS, a Semantic Web services ontology, and discusses its connections with work on agent-based systems.

However, where the rate of agent turnover is high, it can be difficult to obtain sufficient evidence from which to build trust. To address this, recent approaches have proposed a form of stereotypical trust, using visible features of agents to form generalised trust assessments. However, these approaches generally assume that features are explicitly observable, and are not concerned with what form these features take, or how they may be derived. In this paper, we argue that knowledge about social relationships between agents may provide a useful source of feature information. We discuss a number of sources of features, and outline potential strategies for improving the effectiveness of stereotypical trust evaluation mechanisms. Finally, we present trusted group formation as a potential application domain for stereotyping techniques, and discuss key areas for future work in this direction.",

We propose a method to incorporate such spatial semantic awareness in robots by leveraging pre-trained language models and multi-relational knowledge bases as object embeddings. We demonstrate using these object embeddings to search a query object in an unseen indoor environment. We measure the performance of these embeddings in an indoor simulator (AI2Thor). We further evaluate different pre-trained embedding onSuccess Rate(SR) and success weighted by Path Length(SPL).",

However, existing buyer coalition formation schemes do not provide buyers with any means to declare and match their preferences or to calculate the division of the surplus in a stable manner. Concepts and algorithms for coalition formation have been investigated in game theory and multi-agent systems research, but because of the computational complexity, they cannot deal with thousands of buyers which could join a coalition in practice. In this paper, we propose a new buyer coalition formation scheme GroupBuyAuction. At GroupBuyAuction, buyers form a group based on a category of items. A buyer can post an OR-asking for multiple items within a category. An OR-asking is a list of items indicating that the buyer would buy any one of the items in the list with some particular reservation price \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Design of the contract form, together with the negotiation mechanism and strategy, comprise the core decisions in an e-contracting process. In a business-to-business scenario a buyer (eg, a retailer) usually needs to sign a contract with a supplier (eg, a manufacturer) to satisfy a demand that is uncertain at the time of contracting. The buyer would like to have ordering flexibility to respond to the uncertain demand realization. But the supply that can be provided may be constrained by the capacity investment of the supplier, which has to be made in advance. The capacity of a supplier may either be observable and hence contractable, or unobservable and hence not enforcable by a contract. We propose two contract forms, an option contract for the situation with observable capacity, and a wholesale price contract with a franchise fee (WF) for the situation with unobservable capacity. In both contracts the buyer places her final order after the demand is known. In an option contract the buyer first pays a premium fee for reserving a certain capacity from the supplier in advance, and then an exercise fee for each unit that is ordered. In a WF contract the supplier charges a wholesale price for each unit ordered by the buyer, but pays a fixed franchise fee to the buyer. We present optimal auction mechanisms in different protocols for the buyer to negotiate an option contract or a WF contract with competing suppliers. Both contracts generate higher utility for the buyer than the contract in which the buyer procures in advance. Our results show that the optimal auctions for these two contracts have the same outcome. We also discuss the implementation of e \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Collision avoidance for multirobot systems is a well studied problem. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed for synthesizing decentralized controllers that guarantee collision avoidance (safety) and goal stabilization (performance) for multiple robots. However, it has been noted in several works that reactive control synthesis methods (such as CBFs) are prone to deadlock, an equilibrium of system dynamics that causes the robots to come to a standstill before they reach their goals. In this paper, we analyze the incidence of deadlocks in a multirobot system that uses CBFs for goal stabilization and collision avoidance. Our analysis is formal, in that we demonstrate that system deadlock is indeed the result of a force-equilibrium on robots. We show how to interpret deadlock as a subset of the state space and prove that this set is non-empty, bounded, of measure zero and located on the boundary of the safe set. Based on this analysis, we develop a decentralized three-phase algorithm that uses feedback linearization to ensure that the robots provably exit the deadlock set and converge to their goals while avoiding collisions. We show simulation results and experimentally validate the deadlock resolution algorithm on Khepera-IV robots.",

In the portfolio management domain, software agents that evaluate the risks associated with the individual companies in a portfolio should be able to read news articles that indicate the financial outlook of a company. There is a positive correlation between news reports on a companys financial outlook and its attractiveness as an investment. Since it is impossible for financial analysts or investors to track and read each one, it would be very helpful to have a technology for automatically analyzing news reports that reflect positively or negatively on a companys financial outlook. It is also necessary for an agent to learn contextual changes in the news reports autonomously. To accomplish these tasks, we devised a new text classification method and a sampling method. With comprehensive quantitative information gathered by efficient coordinations between agents, and the supplementing of quantitative information by financial news analysis, we showed a successful application of a multi-agent system for portfolio management.Descriptors:",

            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating bounds on parameters representing tasks being performed by individual robots in a multirobot system. In our previous work, we derived necessary conditions based on persistency of excitation analysis for the exact identification of these parameters. We concluded that depending on the robot's task, the dynamics of individual robots may fail to satisfy these conditions, thereby preventing exact inference. As an extension to that work, this paper focuses on estimating bounds on task parameters when such conditions are not satisfied. Each robot in the team uses optimization-based controllers for mediating between task satisfaction and collision avoidance. We use KKT conditions of this optimization and SVD of active collision avoidance constraints to derive explicit relations between Lagrange multipliers, robot dynamics, and task parameters. Using these relations, we are able to derive bounds on each robot's task parameters. Through numerical simulations, we show how our proposed region based identification approach generates feasible regions for parameters when a conventional estimator such as a UKF fails. Additionally, empirical evidence shows that this approach generates contracting sets which converge to the true parameters much faster than the rate at which a UKF based estimate converges.

            "Abstract": "Agents in a multiagent system may need to share information and services. For this, they need to be able to interleave deliberative planning with execution of actions. The deliberative planning is needed to decide which actions to perform to achieve an objective, whereas execution of some of the actions is needed to make a more informed decision on the other actions and to access services provided by other agents. HITaP is a planner that interleaves planning and execution: using HI-TaP an agent can, during planning, gather information by either direct inspection of the domain or by firing queries to other agents and recording their answers. Interleaving planning and execution, as provided by HITaP, plays a crucial role in an agent's ability to construct shared plans with other agents and to manage the negotiation process that leads to agreement with the agent's teammates on these plans. HITaP is implemented and currently used as planning module for agents in the RETSINA multiagent system. These agents cooperate to solve problems in different domains that range from portfolio management to command and control decision support systems. 1",

Two possible ways to organize operators were identified as assignment of robots to particular operators or as a shared pool in which operators service robots from the population as needed.

Consensus requires agents in the system to reach an agreement over a variable of interest only through local interactions. In real systems, limitations in resources available to the individual agents and delays in communication typically result in asynchronous discrete time control models for consensus. In this paper, we model the problem where an adversary (or a friend) can exploit asynchrony in updates in a group of agents that use the same control law. By modifying the update frequency of a subset of the agents, the adversary (or friend) can change the final value that the system agrees on.",

Two models of the experiment are presented: a cognitive model using the ACT-R cognitive architecture and a probabilistic argumentation model using Markov Random Fields (MARF). The cognitive model relies on memory mechanisms such as spreading activation, partial matching and blending to judge when to share information, which facts are relevant to a given question, and how to aggregate probabilistic evidence. MARF carries out real world reasoning after formal theory of human argumentation while at the same time being flexible to accommodate the deviations from the theory. MARF follows knowledge engineering paradigm aiming at reaching correct reasoning as much as possible. Representative results from the experiment are presented and compared to the results of the two models. Implications of the results and avenues for future work are discussed.",

With an impressive array of onboard sensors and autonomous flight capabilities WASMs might play a variety of roles on the modern battle field including reconnaissance, search, battle damage assessment, or communications relay. The first of these high concept munitions, the Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS), is a miniature, autonomous powered munition capable of broad area search, identification, and destruction of a range of mobile ground targets. The LOCAAS uses a small turbojet engine capable of powering the vehicle for up to 30 minutes and LADAR (laser radar) with ATR (automatic target recognition) to identify potential targets. While the LOCAASs were originally designed to operate individually, flying preprogrammed search patterns, the WASM concept envisions artificially intelligent munitions that communicate and coordinate to perform their tasks. Were multiple independent LOCAASs to fly in close proximity, a variety of problems including fratricide, strikes against already dead targets, suboptimal coverage of the search region, and absence of battle damage assessment might arise. These problems could all be resolved by cooperation among the munitions. The next generation of WASMs are posited to have reliable communication with each other and with manned aircraft and ground forces in their area to allow cooperation and control. These communication channels will be required to transmit data, perhaps including video streams, to human controllers, as well as for inter-WASM coordination. We are \u2026",

Participants controlled either 4, 8, or 12 robots. In the fulltask control condition participants both dictated the robots' paths and controlled their cameras to search for victims. In the exploration condition, participants directed the team of robots in order to explore as wide an area as possible. In the perceptual search condition, participants searched for victims by controlling cameras mounted on robots following predetermined paths selected to match characteristics of paths generated under the other two conditions. By decomposing the search and rescue task into exploration and perceptual search subtasks the experiment allows the determination of their scaling characteristics in order to provide a basis for tentative task allocations among humans and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Effective communication among agents in large teams is crucial because the members share a common goal but only have a partial views of the environment. Information sharing is difficult in a large team because, a team member may have a piece of valuable information but not know who needs the information, since it is infeasible to know what each other agent is doing. Although much related work has been done on efficient delivery of information, most work is based on assumptions which are not suited to large scale multiagent teams. In this paper, we made two contributions. Firstly, we present a solution to sharing information that is applicable to large teams based on previous research. A key to the solution is imposing a static network topology on the members of the team where each agent requiring communication to be only along very few links in that network. The key observation underlying this solution is \u2026",

In this context, agreeing on the best course of action to adopt represents a significant challenge. Concurrent actions and causal plan-constraints may lead to conflicts of opinion on what to do. Moreover, individual norms can constrain agent behaviour. We propose an argumentation-based model for deliberative dialogues based on argumentation schemes. This model facilitates agreements about joint plans by enriching the quality of the dialogue through the exchange of relevant information about plan commitments and norms.",

Creating an automated securities dealer is a challenging task with important theoretical and practical implications. Our main interest is a normative automation of the market maker\u2019s activities, as opposed to explanatory modeling of human traders, which was the primary concern of earlier work in this domain. We use a simple class of \u201cnon-predictive\u201d trading strategies to highlight the fundamental issues. These strategies have a theoretical foundation behind them and serve as a showcase for the decisions to be addressed: depth of quote, quote positioning, timing of updates, inventory management, and others. We examine the impact of various parameters on the market maker\u2019s performance. Although we conclude that such elementary strategies do not solve the problem completely, we are able to identify the areas that need to be addressed with more advanced tools. We hope that this paper can serve as a first step in rigorous examination of the dealer\u2019s activities, and will be useful in disciplines outside of Finance, such as Agents, Robotics, and E-Commerce.",

Each robot has knobs and holes along the sides of its body so that the robots can couple by inserting the knobs into the holes. We present the characterization of knob design and the result of gap-crossing behavior with up to nine robots. We show with hardware experiments that the robots are able to couple with each other to cross gaps and decouple to perform individual tasks.

We discuss the e ectiveness of Profit-sharing theoretically and empirically within a Pursuit Game where there exist multiple preys and multiple hunters. In our context of this problem, hunters need to coordinate adaptively one another to capture all the preys, without sharing information, predefined organization and any prior knowledge around their environment. Pursuit Game itself is very simple but can be extended to a real problem. Our approach, Profit-sharing, is contrastive to other reinforcement learning approaches which are based on Dynamic Programming, such as Temporal Di erence method and Q-learning, in that Profit-sharing guarantees convergence to a e ective policy even in domains that do not obey the Markov property, if a task is episodic and a credit is assigned in an appropriate manner. Profit-sharing is also di erent from Q (1) and Sarsa (1) methods in that it does not need eligibility trace to manage the delayed reward. Though our monolithic implementation here seems to be an impractical in a real word, we need to discuss the validity of algorithm as a multiagent reinforcement learning context before introducing some structured frameworks into the monolithic method to extend its application. The contribution of this paper is that we introduce Profit-sharing as the e ective algorithm in the multiagent domain and report its advantages and limitations without hierarchies.",

Instead, this research proposes augmenting traditional LSPIV methods by incorporating autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) as pieces of actuated debris. This addressses the shortcomings of artificial seeding with tracers that may not be recoverable and impractical. Our method uses initial image velocimetry flow estimates to guide an ASV to sparsely seeded or poorly illuminated regions within the survey area.

Such a representation is particularly suitable for large-scale outdoor pursuit-evasion. By allowing height information we not only capture some aspects of 3d visibility but can also consider target heights. In our approach we construct a graph representation of the environment by sampling points and their detection sets which extend the usual notion of visibility. Once a graph is constructed we compute strategies on this graph using a modification of previous work on graphsearching. This strategy is converted into robot paths that are planned on the height map by classifying the terrain appropriately. In experiments we investigate the performance of our approach and provide examples including a map of a small village with surrounding hills and a sample map with multiple loops and elevation plateaus. Experiments are carried out with varying sensing ranges as well as target and sensor heights. To the best of our knowledge the presented approach is the first viable solution to 2.5 d pursuit-evasion with height maps.",

We work in the domain of multi-label classification to perform sentiment classification of tweets and obtain the opinion of the crowd.

Team tasks are crucial in the Range Operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Future systems to support such tasks may include software agents to alleviate heavy workload or time pressure by performing some tasks currently allocated to human operators. MORSE (Multi-agent Operation Range Simulation Environment) is an environment for three team members, encompassing some of the challenges facing Range Operations at KSC. The team must monitor incursions (eg, aircraft or boats) that have entered the exclusion zone, an area bounded by launch impact lines. The human team has at its disposal radars that allow the team members to see incursions in the areas covered by the radars, and interceptor vehicles that can be appointed to intercept incursions. Radars and interceptor vehicles are shared resources that team members must acquire through coordination with each other and utilize for the performance of the team task. The overall team objective is to effect a safe launch where no incursions are left within the impact lines at launch time and resource consumption over the course of the task is minimized. In our initial experiment with this simulation environment we are comparing teams in which team members either have exclusive control over a resource type or control over an operating region.",

We address this question by using the concept of persistency of excitation from system identification. Each robot in the team uses optimization-based controllers for mediating between task satisfaction and collision avoidance. These controllers exhibit an implicit dependence on the task's parameters which poses a hurdle for deriving necessary conditions for parameter identification, since such conditions usually require an explicit relation. We address this bottleneck by using duality theory and SVD of active collision avoidance constraints and derive an explicit relation between each robot's task parameters and its control inputs.

All these studies assume perfect communication between the operator and the swarm. A key challenge in the use of swarm robotic systems in human supervised tasks is to understand human swarm interaction in the presence of limited communication bandwidth, which is a constraint arising in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we present results of human-subject experiments designed to study the effect of bandwidth limitations in human swarm interaction. We consider three levels of bandwidth availability in a swarm foraging task. The lowest bandwidth condition performs poorly, but the medium and high bandwidth condition both perform well. In the medium bandwidth condition, we display useful aggregated swarm information (like swarm centroid and spread) to compress the swarm \u2026",

The crucial question of what makes these tasks so difficult, however remains unanswered. Various hypotheses include inefficiency in sharing information leading to decisions based on incomplete information or cognitive inefficiencies in processing and storing information arriving in a piecemeal fashion. The present study attacks this problem from two directions. Human experiments are used to compare decisions between groups manipulated to receive and share information in raw and aggregated forms and mixed groups comprised of humans and software agents. To shed light on cognitive limitations that may affect performance, an ACT-R cognitive model of group members was constructed and its results compared to human data.",

            "Abstract": "In today\u2019s fast paced military operational environment, vast amounts of information must be sorted out and fused not only to allow commanders to make situation assessments, but also to support the generation of hypotheses about enemy force disposition and enemy intent. Current information fusion technology has the following two limitations. First, current approaches do not consider the battlefield context as a first class entity. In contrast, we consider situational context in terms of terrain analysis and inference. Second, there are no integrated and implemented models of the high-level fusion process. This paper describes the HiLIFE (High-Level Information Fusion Environment) computational framework for seamless integration of high levels of fusion (levels 2, 3 and 4). The crucial components of HiLIFE that we present in this paper are: (1) multi-sensor fusion algorithms and their performance results that operate in \u2026",

Most of the existing literature on non-mediated (ie, totally decentralized) negotiation considers agents with either full information or with probabilistic beliefs about other agents\u2019 preferences on the issues. However, in reality, it is usually not possible for agents to have complete information about other agents\u2019 preferences or accurate probability distributions. We design a reactive negotiation strategy for general multiagent multi-attribute negotiation, where the agents have non-linear utility functions and no information about the utility functions of other agents. We prove that agents generating offers using our negotiation strategy reaches to an agreement acceptable to all the agents. We also prove that rational agents do not have any incentive to deviate from the proposed",

Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs) provide a convenient, but intractable model for specifying planning problems in cooperative teams. Compared to the single-agent case, an additional challenge is posed by the lack of free communication between the teammates. We argue, that acting close to optimally in a team involves a tradeoff between opportunistically taking advantage of agent's local observations and being predictable for the teammates. We present a more opportunistic version of an existing approximate algorithm for DEC-POMDPs and investigate the tradeoff. Preliminary evaluation shows that in certain settings oportunistic modification provides significantly better performance.",

For such organizations, comprised of thousands of agents, improving and shaping the quality of conclusions reached is a challenging problem. The challenge is increased by the fact that acquisition of information could be costly. This leads to the crucial requirement that the organization should strive to reach correct conclusions while minimizing information acquisition cost. In this paper, we have developed a model of complex, interdependent information that is costly to acquire and where complex fusion should be optimized within an organization while minimizing the cost of acquiring the sensor data. Empirical results show a number of interesting effects. First, unselfish agents who spend resources (even when not strictly locally necessary) can lead to substantial improvement in the overall accuracy of the organization's \u2026",

Many algorithms have been developed for data delivery and fusion in static microsensor networks, but most of them are not appropriate for mobile sensor networks due to their heavy traffic and long latency. In this paper we propose an efficient and robust data delivery algorithm for distributed data fusion in mobile ad hoc sensor networks, where each node controls its data flows and learns routing decisions solely based on their local knowledge. We analyze the localized algorithm in a formal model and validate our model using simulations. The experiments indicate that controlled data delivery processes significantly increase the probability of relevant data being fused in the network even with limited local knowledge of each node and relatively small hops of data delivery.",

Automating path planning at a foraging task improved both target detection and localization which is closely tied to SA.

Therefore, if autonomous agents interact with humans, they also need to reason about various legal rules, social and ethical social norms, so they would be trusted and accepted by humans. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can be used for the autonomous agents to learn social norm-compliant behavior via expert demonstrations.

For example, the privacy norm is activated for a domestic robot entering a bathroom where a person may be present, whereas it is not activated for the robot entering the kitchen.

            "Abstract": "Data in real world applications is often subject to some kind of uncertainty, which can be due to incompleteness, unreliability or inconsistency. This poses a great challenge for ontology-based data access (OBDA) applications, which are expected to provide a meaningful answers to queries, even under uncertain domains. Several extensions of classical OBDA systems has been proposed to address this problem, with probabilistic, possibilistic, and fuzzy OBDA being the most relevant ones. However, these extensions present some limitations with respect to their applicability. Probabilistic OBDA deal only with categorical assertions, possibilistic logic is better suited to make a ranking of axioms, and fuzzy OBDA addresses the problem of modelling vagueness, rather than uncertainty. In this paper we propose Subjective DL-Lite (SDL-Lite), an extension of DL-Lite with Subjective Logic. Subjective DL-Lite allows us to model uncertainty in the data through the application of opinions, which encapsulate our degrees of belief, disbelief and uncertainty for each given assertion. We explore the semantics of Subjective DL-Lite, clarify the main differences with respect to its classical DL-Lite counterpart, and construct a canonical model of the ontology by means of a chase that will serve as the foundation for a future construction of an OBDA system supporting opinions.",

Our problem is motivated by applications where multiple robots with heterogeneous capabilities have to work together to accomplish tasks. Thus, for our purposes, a task group is a compound task composed of more than one atomic tasks where one robot is required for each atomic task. Since robots have limited battery life, we assume that the number of (atomic) tasks that a robot can do within a mission has an upper bound. Furthermore, each robot has a constraint on the number of tasks it can do from each group (this models the fact that multiple robots may be needed to simultaneously perform the atomic tasks that make up the compound task). Each robot obtains a payoff (or incurs a cost) for each task and the overall objective for task allocation is to maximize the total payoff (or minimize the total cost) of all the robots. In general, existing (centralized or distributed) algorithms for task allocation either assume that (atomic) tasks are independent, or do not provide performance guarantee for the situation where task constraints exist. We show that our problem can be solved in polynomial time by a centralized algorithm by reducing it to a minimum cost network flow problem. We then present a decentralized algorithm (that extends the auction algorithm of Bertsekas for linear assignment problems [1]) to provide an almost optimal solution. We prove that our \u2026",

In this work the set of random variables denoting the possible template matches for the scenario entities is a realization of a Markov random field. This approach does not separate low level fusion from high level fusion but optimizes both simultaneously. The result of the added high level context is a method that is robust to false positive and false negative, or missed, sensor readings. Furthermore, the high level context helps to direct the search for the best template match. Empirical results illustrate the efficacy of the method both at identifying threats in the face of false negatives, and at negating false positives, as well as illustrating the reduced computational effort resulting from the incorporation of additional high-level context",

ADSC requires associating abnormal parameter values with alarms in such a way that operator attention can be directed toward the involved subsystems or conditions. This is hard to achieve in multirobot control because it is difficult to distinguish abnormal conditions for states of a robot team. For largely independent tasks such as foraging, however, self-reflection can serve as a basis for alerting the operator to abnormalities of individual robots. While the search for targets remains unalarmed the resulting system approximates ADSC. The described experiment compares a control condition in which operators perform a multirobot urban search and rescue (USAR) task without alarms with ADSC (freely annunciated) and with a decision aid that limits operator \u2026",

            "Abstract": "One of the main promises of web services standards is to enable and facilitate seamless interoperability of diverse applications and business processes implemented as components or services. A service can be part of a business workflow that prescribes control and data flows of complex applications. As business needs change, processes may need to get reconfigured or additional process components and services may need to be added. As a result of these changes, the previous components must become interoperable with the new one. This can be accomplished by making manual changes to the existing workflow components and programming the new components in such a way as to have interoperability built-in. This is a rather laborious and inefficient process since it must be repeated every time workflow reconfiguration is needed. Also, since many different elements of a business workflow may be under the control of third parties (eg subcontractors), additional costly coordination will be needed with these third parties to manually find interoperability solutions. Moreover, since the Internet gives the opportunity to dynamically discover service providers, it is often not a priori known which service provider may best fit the application workflow changing needs. In other words, the new service component that must interoperate with old ones, is dynamically discovered. Therefore,(a) a more general solution is desired, namely the ability to achieve process interoperability (eg interoperability of existing processes with new ones) without actually modifying their implementation and interfaces, and (b) the mediation may need to be done dynamically \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cognitive social simulations, enabled by cognitive architectures (such as ACT-R), are particularly well-suited for advancing our understanding of socially-distributed and socially-situated cognition. As a result, multi-agent simulations featuring the use of ACT-R agents may be important in improving our understanding of the factors that influence collective sensemaking. While previous studies demonstrate the feasibility of using ACT-R to model collective cognition, as well as sensemaking processes at the individual level, the development of an ACT-R model of collective sensemaking in a coalition environment presents a range of relatively novel methodological, technological and modeling challenges. Such challenges include the need to equip ACT-R agents with communication capabilities, the need to deal with highly dynamic information environments, the need to support intelligent information retrieval capabilities, and the need to represent inter-agent cognitive differences. These challenges shape the nature of research and development efforts to create a multi-agent simulation capability that can be used to explore the impact of different sociotechnical interventions on collective sensemaking processes. In this paper, we discuss the research efforts being undertaken to address these challenges in the context of the International Technology Alliance (ITA) research program. We also discuss the motivations for using ACT-R to model collective sensemaking processes and outline some opportunities for model application and empirical evaluation.",

But there has not been work studying the situations where both coalition formation and combinatorial auctions exist. In this paper we consider an e-market where each buyer places a bid on a combination of items with a reservation cost, and sellers offer price discounts for each item based on volumes. By artificially dividing the reservation cost of each buyer among the items, we can construct optimal coalitions with respect to each item.

Most of the existing work on tweet classification focuses on topic classification, which classifies tweets into several predefined categories, and sentiment classification, which classifies tweets into positive, negative and neutral. Since tweets are different from conventional text in that they generally are of limited length and contain informal, irregular or new words, so it is difficult to determine user intention to publish a tweet and user attitude towards certain topic. In this paper, we aim to simultaneously classify tweet purpose, ie, the intention for user to publish a tweet, and position, ie, supporting, opposing or being neutral to a given topic. By transforming this problem to a multi-label classification problem, a multi-label classification method with post-processing is proposed. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Planning is an important activity in military coalitions and the support of an automated planning tool could help military planners by reducing the cognitive burden of their work. Current AI planning paradigms use two different types of formalism to represent the planning problem. Each of these formalisms entails different inference algorithms and representation of results.On the one hand plans in non-stochastic domains are represented using declarative logic-based formalisms, an example of which is Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs). In HTNs, domains are represented in terms of task decompositions of increased detail in relation to the actions that must be carried out. In general, declarative formalisms are easier for humans to understand. On the other hand, stochastic planning is often represented in terms of large probability functions that exhaustively specify the likelihood of relevant world changes when actions are executed, as exemplified by Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Stochastic domain specifications can easily become challenging to a human designer as the problem size increases, worse still, solver algorithms degrade quickly with increased domain size. In order to facilitate domain modeling for planning under uncertainty, we propose a method of deriving stochastic domain specifications in the MDP formalism from a description using the HTN formalism. This method can reduce the resulting MDP state-space through an intermediate representation using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The benefits of the approach are twofold:(a) the reduction of the state space, and consequent reduction of computational burden is beneficial \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Sampling based motion planning algorithms are widely used due to their effectiveness on problems with large state spaces by incremental tree growth in conjunction with uniform, random sampling. The major bottleneck in the performance of such algorithms is the amount of collision checks performed, which in turns depends on the sampling distribution itself. In this work, we present a framework to learn an adaptive, non-stationary sampling distribution which explicitly minimizes the search effort, given by the amount of collision checks performed. Our framework models the sequential nature of the problem by leveraging both the instantaneous search tree over the robot configuration space, as well as the workspace environment, by encoding them with a conditional variational auto-encoder, to learn a stochastic sampling policy. We encode the workspace environment with a convolutional network, and the configuration space planning tree with a recurrent neural network. We introduce an approximate oracle which can return multiple label samples for a partially solved planning problem, by forward simulating it. We use an imitation via iterative supervised learning framework to learn a stochastic sampling policy. We call this self-supervised imitation of an oracle generated by forward simulation as self-imitation. We validate our approach on a 4D kinodynamic helicopter planning problem with glideslope and curvature constraints, and a 2D holonomic problem.",

The team task consists of human subjects playing the role of military commanders and cooperatively planning to move their respective units to a common rendezvous point, given time and resource constraints. The objective of the experiment was to compare the effectiveness of agent-based aids for individual and team tasks, as opposed to the baseline condition of manual route planning. There were two experimental conditions: the aided condition, where a route-planning agent (RPA) finds a least-cost plan between the start and rendezvous points for a given composition of force units, and the baseline condition, where the commanders determine initial routes manually and receive basic feedback about the route. We demonstrate that the aided condition \u2026",

However, the sheer amount of such information makes it practically impossible for any human user to be aware of much of it. Therefore, it would be very helpful to have a system that automatically discovers relevant, yet previously unknown information, and reports it to users in human-readable form. As the first attempt to accomplish such a goal, we proposed a new clustering algorithm and compared it with existing clustering algorithms. The proposed method is motivated by constructive and competitive learning from neural network research. In the construction phase, it tries to find the optimal number of clusters by adding a new cluster when the intrinsic difference between the instance presented and the existing clusters is detected. Each cluster then moves toward the optimal cluster center according to the learning rate by adjusting its weight vector. From the experimental results on the three different real world data sets, the proposed method shows an even trend of performance across the different domains, while the performance of our algorithm on text domains was better than that reported in previous research.Descriptors:",

Generating a probability distribution over emitter locations requires integrating multiple signals from different UAVs into a Bayesian filter, hence requiring cooperation between the UAVs. To build a coherent distributed picture given communication limitations, the UAVs share only those sensor readings that induce the largest changes in their local filter. Each UAV translates its probability distribution into a map of information entropy and then plans a path that will maximize the reduction in entropy (or \u2026",

Although probabilistic and fuzzy extensions of DLs exist, which provide an explicit representation of uncertainty, they do not provide an explicit means for reasoning about second order uncertainty. Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DST) overcomes this weakness and provides means to fuse and reason about uncertain information. In this paper, we combine DL-Lite with DST to allow scalable reasoning over uncertain semantic knowledge bases. Furthermore, our formalism allows for the detection of conflicts between the fused information and domain constraints. Finally, we propose methods to resolve such conflicts through trust revision by exploiting evidence regarding the information sources. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is shown through simulations under various settings.",

            "Abstract": "Large heterogeneous teams in a variety of applications must make joint decisions using large volumes of noisy and uncertain data. Often not all team members have access to a sensor, relying instead on information shared by peers to make decisions. These sensors can become permanently corrupted through hardware failure or as a result of the actions of a malicious adversary. Previous work showed that when the trust between agents was tuned to a specific value the resulting dynamics of the system had a property called scale invariance which led to agents reaching highly accurate conclusion with little communication. In this paper we show that these dynamics also leave the system vulnerable to most agents coming to incorrect conclusions as a result of small amounts of anomalous information maliciously injected in the system. We conduct an analysis that shows that the efficiency of scale invariant dynamics is due to the fact that large number of agents can come to correct conclusions when the difference between the percentage of agents holding conflicting opinions is relatively small. Although this allows the system to come to correct conclusions quickly, it also means that it would be easy for an attacker with specific knowledge to tip the balance. We explore different methods for selecting which agents are Byzantine and when attacks are launched informed by the analysis. Our study reveals global system properties that can be used to predict when and where in the network the system is most vulnerable to attack. We use the results of this study to design an algorithm used by agents to effectively attack the network, informed by local \u2026",

We formulated our hypotheses based on the theory of honor-dignity cultures and illustrate how the importance of preserving and maintaining honor influences the Iranian negotiation strategies in business dealings. Our results illustrate that consistent with the culture of honor, Iranian negotiators are more likely to be competitive, express emotions, and employ distributive tactics compared to Canadian negotiators.

It is composed of computationally tractable strategies, three modules and four heuristic estimation methods with different concerns of outside options, in which time preference and opponents leaving are considered. In the second part, we provide simulations to study the impacts of outside options and strategic characteristic, and we analyze the properties and interdependencies between those factors under various environments, in which time preference and opponents leaving are included. The simulation shows that either negotiation strategies or outside options impact much on a negotiation process. The strategies determines the concession pace, while outside options determine the concession extent. From simulation we say the strategies and estimation approaches we present are efficient and computationally tractable in most realistic applications.",

We expand upon prior diversity literature by considering the effect of both surface and deep-level faultlines on the intergroup computer mediated communications in virtual negotiations. Faultlines are hypothetical lines that divide teams into multiple subgroups based on diversity attributes. We confirm that the effect of team diversity on intergroup computer mediated communications can be better captured through faultlines. Our results suggest that faultlines mediate the effect of diversity on teams\u2019 computer mediated intergroup communication and that deep-level faultlines significantly lower the frequency and quality of intergroup communication of virtual negotiations.",

We present a formal model for autonomous agents to negotiate on the Internet. In our model, the negotiation process is driven by the internal beliefs of participating agents. We empirically identify the relative strength of a group of belief updating methods and show how an agent can change its behavior by adjusting some critical parameters. The advantage of our model is that it is flexible and easy to implement. To show different \"personalities\", one only needs to plug in suitable \"subjective beliefs\" to one's agents. Our results provide directive reference on how these beliefs should be chosen and what values of the related parameters should be assigned.",

Using cultural theories involving time perception we generated hypotheses and tested in an in-lab negotiation experiment with varying time deadline. Our sample included East Asian and North American negotiators engaging in an intracultural negotiation. Our results showed significant main effects. East Asian negotiators were more focused on relationship building and longterm plans than North American negotiators, who were focused on the tasks and short-term plans. We discuss interactions of culture and deadline on negotiation process and performance.",

This paper presents modifications to a polynomial-space branch-and-bound based algorithm, called NCBB, for solving DCOP, that make the algorithm any-space. This enables a continuous tradeoff between O (bp) space, O (bpH+ 1) time complexity and O (pw+ bp) space and O (bHpw+ 1) time, where p is variables domain size, H is Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal depth of constraint graph, b is the branching factor of DFS tree, and w is the context width of the tree. This flexibility allows one to apply NCBB to areas, where the limited amount of available memory prevents one from using more efficient exponential space algorithms. Sensor networks is an example of such domain. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that caching does not lead to an increase in complexity even under assumption that all cache lookups fail. We also show experimentally that the use of cahing leads to significant speedups of problem solving.",

Prior to viewing the negotiation, we manipulated observer and negotiator congruency of sacred values via deontological versus instrumental reasoning styles. The results illustrate a \"black sheep effect,\" where observers perceived the cultural in-group negotiator negatively, only when they shared similar sacred values but not when those values were different.

Machine Learning techniques are promising for (semi-) automatic learning of ontologies from the Web and semantic annotation of Web documents.There are three areas of application of machine learning for constructing the Semantic Web: ontology learning, semantic annotation, and ontology integration. The first, ontology learning, refers to using machine learning techniques to (semi-) automatically learn ontologies from a given dataset. The second, semantic annotation, refers to the use of machine learning to automatically semantically annotate large corpora of data according to a given ontology. Ontology integration is required when attempting to integrate different sources of information with differing ontologies or data schemata.",

The ability to learn useful representations from 3D point cloud data is thus of great value to autonomous agents that perceive and interact with the surrounding 3D environment. Recently, neural networks operating on point clouds have shown superior performance on various 3D understanding tasks, thanks to their power to extract task-specific semantic features directly from points. In this thesis, we study how to incorporate geometric and algorithmic structures into the design of neural networks in order to achieve more effective and efficient learning from raw point clouds.In particular, we investigate two problems\u20133D shape completion and canonical pose estimation\u2013that address two essential characteristics of 3D data in the wild: incompleteness and misalignment. We show that the structured neural networks we propose outperform alternative approaches that do not incorporate structural priors on synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate the potential of our networks to operate on challenging real world data such as LiDAR scans collected from an autonomous vehicle.",

In general, existing algorithms for task allocation either assume that tasks are independent or do not provide performance guarantee for the situation, in which task constraints exist.

We prove that the size of the Earley graph created for any given HTN is bounded by the total number of tasks in the HTNs and show that from the Earley graph we can construct a plan for a given task that has the maximum expected utility when it is executed in an MDP environment.",

A complete representation of swarm state is high dimensional and perceptually inaccessible to the human. Thus, a summary representation is often required. In addition, it is often the case that the human-swarm communication channel is extremely bandwidth constrained and may have high latency. This motivates the need for the swarm itself to compute a summary representation of its own state for transmission to the human operator. The summary representation may be generated by selecting a subset of robots, known as the information leaders, whose own states suffice to give a bounded approximation of the entire swarm, even in the presence of uncertainty.

            "Abstract": "In the presence of vast amount of data and their semantic representation, it is a formidable task for a human decision-maker to effectively locate the most relevant facts, identify critical conflicts, and master a big picture of the information for high quality decision making. This paper proposes a presentation framework which applies argumentation-based reasoning to present relevant facts and answers. Knowledge retrieved from a distributed semantic KB are fed into an argumentationbased reasoning engine which re-organizes the knowledge into coherent arguments, estimates the beliefs of the arguments, and analyzes the pattern of conflicts among the arguments to preliminarily determine the acceptability of these arguments for the decision-maker to review. In order to lower the decision-maker\u2019s cognitive load, the argumentation is pruned to present only the arguments and the conflicts that most likely concern the decision-maker. This argumentation pruning algorithm can be adapted to enable a decision-maker to interact with the system and navigate through the information incrementally unfolding the argumentation constructed for the answers.",

            "Abstract": "Shared understanding is commonly seen as essential to the success of coalition operations. Anecdotal reports suggest that shared understanding enables coalition forces to coordinate their efforts in respect of mission goals, and shortfalls in shared understanding are frequently cited as the reason for poor coalition performance. In spite of this consensus regarding the importance of shared understanding, however, there are very few empirical studies that attempt to explore shared understanding in a military coalition context. This paper attempts to support future research efforts into shared understanding by proposing a specific definition for shared understanding and identifying a number of research challenges. Shared understanding is defined as the ability of multiple agents to exploit common bodies of causal knowledge for the purposes of accomplishing common (or shared) goals. This definition implies that agents possessing shared understanding will be capable of coordinating their respective behaviours in order to ensure the efficient realization of cognitive and behavioural objectives. We also identify a number of areas for future research into shared understanding. These include the factors that affect shared understanding, the effect of shared understanding on coalition performance, and the development of techniques to reliably measure and assess understanding in coalition environments.",

These incidents underline the importance of the roles of political and/or religious leaders in the context of ethno-religious conflicts. In this paper, we extend the computational model of ethno-religious conflicts (based on repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma (PD) game in graphs) proposed in , to include the effect of the leaders of the different groups. We present simulation results showing some interesting emergent effects: (a) even when a high fraction of the population of the two groups are willing to compromise with each other, if the leaders are not willing to compromise, there is high potential of conflict between the two groups, and (b) when a majority of the two population groups are unwilling to compromise, even if the leaders are willing to compromise \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Teamwork is a set of interrelated reasoning, actions and behaviors of team members that facilitate common objectives. Teamwork theory and experiments have resulted in a set of states and processes for team effectiveness in both human-human and agent-agent teams. However, human-agent teaming is less well studied because it is so new and involves asymmetry in policy and intent not present in human teams. To optimize team performance in human-agent teaming, it is critical that agents infer human intent and adapt their polices for smooth coordination. Most literature in human-agent teaming builds agents referencing a learned human model. Though these agents are guaranteed to perform well with the learned model, they lay heavy assumptions on human policy such as optimality and consistency, which is unlikely in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive agent architecture in human-model-free setting on a two-player cooperative game, namely Team Space Fortress (TSF). Previous human-human team research have shown complementary policies in TSF game and diversity in human players' skill, which encourages us to relax the assumptions on human policy. Therefore, we discard learning human models from human data, and instead use an adaptation strategy on a pre-trained library of exemplar policies composed of RL algorithms or rule-based methods with minimal assumptions of human behavior. The adaptation strategy relies on a novel similarity metric to infer human policy and then selects the most complementary policy in our library to maximize the team performance.

Since RETSINA implementations are deployed in real-world, distributed, open environments, it is necessary that agents be able to communicate both among themselves and with other entities, to enhance coordination and cooperation and increase system performance. Yet, communication based on client/server architecture is insufficient for the needs of agents, as agents may be both service providers and service consumers, sometime simultaneously. In addition, to support some aspects of interoperability, agents must be able to communicate using standard Agent Communication Languages (ACLs). Thus, there is a need for a more expressive means of communication. As part of our agent architecture, we have developed a communication componentthe RETSINA communicator \u2026",

Because controlling multiple robots places additional demands on the operator we hypothesized that removing the forced pace for reviewing camera video might reduce workload and improve performance. In an initial experiment we evaluated the usefulness of asynchronous operation for a four robot search task. Participants operated four robot teams performing a simulated urban search and rescue (USAR) task using conventional streaming video plus a map interface or an experimental interface without streaming video but with the ability to store panoramic images on the map to be viewed at leisure. Search performance was somewhat better using the conventional interface; however, ancillary measures suggest that the asynchronous \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Q-Ensembles are a model-free approach where input images are fed into different Q-networks and exploration is driven by the assumption that uncertainty is proportional to the variance of the output Q-values obtained. They have been shown to perform relatively well compared to other exploration strategies. Further, model-based approaches, such as encoder-decoder models have been used successfully for next frame prediction given previous frames. This paper proposes to integrate the model-free Q-ensembles and model-based approaches with the hope of compounding the benefits of both and achieving superior exploration as a result. Results show that a model-based trajectory memory approach when combined with Q-ensembles produces superior performance when compared to only using Q-ensembles.",

This paper studies the model of multi-agent learning in complete-information extensive games (CEGs). We provide two provably convergent algorithms for this model. Both algorithms utilize the special structure of CEGs and guarantee both individual and collective convergence. Our work contributes to the multi-agent learning literature in several aspects: 1. We identify a model of multi-agent learning, namely, learning in CEGs, and provide two provably convergent algorithms for this model. 2. We explicitly address the environment-shifting problem and show that how patient agents can collectively learn to play equilibrium strategies. 3. Many game-theoretical work on learning uses a technique called fictitious play, which requires agents to build beliefs about their opponents. For our model \u2026",

Moreover, while intuitively organizations will adapt to take advantage of the new technology, there has been no work looking at how organizations should or will change in response to the new technology. This paper presents a first step toward addressing this oversight. Specifically, a computational model of the working of an organization and how software personal assistants will affect that organization is developed that allows effects of software personal assistants to be modeled.

UDDI is a standard registry for Web Services, but, its search functionality has been limited to a keyword search. Therefore, we propose an enhancement of UDDI, called Matchmaker, that supports semantic service capability discovery. Since September 2003, we have deployed the Matchmaker in one of four official UDDI registries operated by NTT-Communications. In this paper, we first introduce the Matchmaker, and illustrate client tools which lower the threshold of use of semantics. Then, we evaluate this experiment by benchmarks in terms of its performance and functionality. Finally, we discuss user requirements obtained by two ways: questionnaire and observation of search behavior.",

            "Abstract": "Influence maximization in social networks has been widely studied motivated by applications like spread of ideas or innovations in a network and viral marketing of products. Current studies focus almost exclusively on unsigned social networks containing only positive relationships (e.g. friend or trust) between users. Influence maximization in signed social networks containing both positive relationships and negative relationships (e.g. foe or distrust) between users is still a challenging problem that has not been studied. Thus, in this paper, we propose the polarity-related influence maximization (PRIM) problem which aims to find the seed node set with maximum positive influence or maximum negative influence in signed social networks. To address the PRIM problem, we first extend the standard Independent Cascade (IC) model to the signed social networks and propose a Polarity-related Independent Cascade (named IC-P) diffusion model. We prove that the influence function of the PRIM problem under the IC-P model is monotonic and submodular Thus, a greedy algorithm can be used to achieve an approximation ratio of 1-1/e for solving the PRIM problem in signed social networks. Experimental results on two signed social network datasets, Epinions and Slashdot, validate that our approximation algorithm for solving the PRIM problem outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Such a policy has been widely adopted by retailers. We examine the impact of a posterior PM policy on consumers' purchasing behavior, a seller's pricing and inventory decisions, and their expected payoffs, assuming that the seller cannot credibly commit to a price path, but can implement a posterior PM policy. We find that the PM policy eliminates strategic consumers' waiting incentive and thus allows the seller to increase price in the regular selling season. When the fraction of strategic consumers is not too small and their valuation decline over time is neither too low nor too high, the PM policy can substantially improve the seller's profit, as well as the inventory investment. In such situations, the strategic consumers' waiting incentive and the loss if they \u2026",

Further, they assume that an agent\u2019s trustworthiness can be modelled by a single probability distribution. In this paper we explore alternative mechanisms that allow these assumptions to be relaxed. We propose a trust assessment model based on Markov Switching Regimes, where direct and third-party observations about an agent\u2019s behaviour follow interrelated Autoregressive processes. We argue that this offers a richer model of trustworthiness and a means to combine trust assessment with within-task monitoring.",

We show that a simple and easy-to-implement two-payment-level system can motivate operators to explore the appropriateness of their adopted workload and to devote their capacities optimal to the system. The subsequent analytical and numerical investigation provides insights into understanding the way it affects the control strategies in a multi-robot service queue to account for human operators' strategic behaviors.",

The LA-DCOP algorithm can conceptually handle both large-scale problems and multiple tasks per robot, but has key limitations when allocating spatially distributed tasks. In this paper, we extend LA-DCOP with several alternative acceptance rules for robots to determine whether to take on an additional task, given the interaction with the tasks it has already committed to. We show that these acceptance rules dramatically outperform a naive LA-DCOP implementation. In addition, we developed a technique that lets the robots use completely local knowledge to adjust their task acceptance criteria to get the best possible performance at a given communication bandwidth level.",

            "Abstract": "The goal of the award was the procurement of robotic equipment, UAVs and UGVs that collaborate with themselves and a human operator to execute critical missions. Exploration and navigation in unknown environments is a challenging task for ground rovers. While AGVs are often equipped with a variety of sensors that can detect the surrounding environment, the information that these sensors can provide are limited to the immediate surrounding of the AGVs and do not provide sufficient information about the obstacles and eventual destination of different paths. In these cases, an AGV without additional information would have to proceed down each path, prioritized by the best heuristic, in the hopes that no obstacles or dead end block the path. In time-critical environments such as disaster response and relief, this trial-and-error approach would not suffice. Ground operators need to know which paths are safe and absent of hazards to deliver the required aid to trapped survivors as soon as possible. To enhance the exploration and navigation capabilities of autonomous ground vehicles, we propose FalconEye a heterogeneous mapping solution that combines the sensor input from UAVs to detect the open routes and obstacles that AGVs sensors cannot. Using airborne HD cameras and ground LiDAR sensors, FalconEye creates and operates within a 3Dmap whose range far exceeds the map created by ground-only robotic systems. We designed, implemented and demonstrated in field experiments a system of cooperating UAV and UGV under human supervisory control for search and rescue.Descriptors:",

We examine five prominent tools for developing Semantic Web Services and align them to the Semantic Web Service deployment lifecycle presented in Chap. 6. In particular, we describe the development of OWL-S services using tools, such as the OWL-S IDE and the OWL-S Editor; the development of WSMO services, through the WSMO set of tools and IRS-III; and finally, the annotation of services in WSDL-S through the tool MWSAF. Each of these tools cover the steps in the Semantic Web Services deployment and usage lifecycle to varying extents. Some of them, such as MWSAF, focus on only one stage of the lifecycle, whereas other tools, such as the OWL-S IDE and WSMO set of tools, cover all stages.",

            "Abstract": "While multi-agent interactions can be naturally modeled as a graph, the environment has traditionally been considered as a black box. We propose to create a shared agent-entity graph, where agents and environmental entities form vertices, and edges exist between the vertices which can communicate with each other. Agents learn to cooperate by exchanging messages along the edges of this graph. Our proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is invariant to the number of agents or entities present in the system as well as permutation invariance, both of which are desirable properties for any multi-agent system representation. We present state-of-the-art results on coverage, formation and line control tasks for multi-agent teams in a fully decentralized framework and further show that the learned policies quickly transfer to scenarios with different team sizes along with strong zero-shot generalization performance. This is an important step towards developing multi-agent teams which can be realistically deployed in the real world without assuming complete prior knowledge or instantaneous communication at unbounded distances.",

We develop algorithms aimed at flexible and efficient coordination, applying a decentralized social network topology for team organization and the abstract coordination behaviors of Team Oriented Plans (TOPs). From this basis, we present a model to organize a team into dynamically evolving subteams, in order to flexibly coordinate the team.

The efficiency of a distributed constraint satisfaction algorithm depends on its communication cost and computation cost, and both can vary with the numbers of intra- and inter-agents constraints.

Tasks dynamically arrive to a contractor that oversees the process of task allocation. Tasks are auctioned to contractees, who submit prices they require to accept tasks. The agent with the lowest bid wins but is rewarded with the second-lowest price. Each agent, based on his own state, will decide whether to participate in the auction or not, and will decide the bidding price if he chooses to participate. If a busy agent wins a new task, he has to decommit from his current task and pay a decommitment fee.We formulate the problem and derive structural properties of equilibrium strategies. We also provide heuristics that are practical for multiagent system designers. Issues related to system design are discussed in the context of numerical simulations. The contribution is that (a) we provide formal analysis of contractees\u2019 optimal strategies in a given dynamic task allocation system with commitment flexibility;(b) we study the value of commitment flexibility in the presence of different system parameters.",

Trust and reputation are crucial concepts in these environments, as agents must rely on their peers to perform as expected, and learn to avoid untrustworthy partners. However, ad-hoc groups introduce issues which impede the formation of trust relationships. For example, they may be short-lived, precluding agents from gaining the necessary experiences to make an accurate trust evaluation. This paper describes a new approach, inspired by theories of human organisational behaviour, whereby agents generalise their experiences with known partners as stereotypes and apply these when evaluating new and unknown partners. We show how this approach can complement existing state of the art trust models, and enhance the confidence in the evaluations that can be made about trustees when direct and reputational information is lacking or limited.",

The required number of vehicles and the service rate are unique to each job type. Once a job has been completed, the vehicles are able to return to the swarm for use elsewhere. If not enough vehicles are present in the swarm at the time that the job is identified, that job is dropped without being serviced.

All these studies assume perfect communication between the operator and the swarm. A key challenge in the use of swarm robotic systems in human supervised tasks is to understand human swarm interaction in the presence of limited communication bandwidth, which is a constraint arising in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we present results of human-subject experiments designed to study the effect of bandwidth limitations in human swarm interaction. We consider three levels of bandwidth availability in a swarm foraging task. The lowest bandwidth condition performs poorly, but the medium and high bandwidth condition both perform well. In the medium bandwidth condition, we display useful aggregated swarm information (like swarm centroid and spread) to compress the swarm state information. We also observe interesting operator behavior and adaptation of operators\u2019 swarm reaction.",

These types are exemplified by two control methods, selection and beacon control, made available to a human operator to control a foraging swarm of robots. Selection and beacon control differ with respect to their temporal and spatial influence on the swarm and enable an operator to generate different strategies from the basic behaviors of the swarm. Selection control requires an active selection of groups of robots while beacon control exerts an influence on nearby robots within a set range. Both control methods are implemented in a testbed in which operators solve an information foraging problem by utilizing a set of swarm behaviors. The robotic swarm has only local communication and sensing capabilities. The number of robots in the swarm range from 50 to 200. Operator performance for each control method is compared in a series of missions in different environments with no obstacles up to cluttered and structured obstacles. In addition, performance is compared to simple and advanced autonomous swarms. Thirty-two participants were recruited for participation in the study. Autonomous swarm algorithms were tested in repeated simulations. Our results showed that selection control scales better to larger swarms and generally outperforms beacon control. Operators utilized different swarm behaviors with different frequency across control methods, suggesting an adaptation to different strategies induced by choice of control method.

Information sharing is difficult in a large team because, a team member may have a piece of valuable information but not know who needs the information, since it is infeasible to know what each other agent is doing. Although much related work has been done on efficient delivery of information, most work is based on assumptions which are not suited to large scale multiagent teams. In this paper, we made two contributions. Firstly, we present a solution to sharing information that is applicable to large teams based on previous research [12]. A key to the solution is imposing a static network topology on the members of the team where each agent requiring communication to be only along very few links in that network. The key observation underlying this solution \u2026",

Yet, there is a dearth of work examining how culture influences the display and impact of mimicry in negotiations. In this research, we systematically coded behavioral mimicry among Chinese and Canadian dyadic, intracultural, video-taped negotiations. Using cultural theories of high/low context communication, and individualism/collectivism, we predicted and found that low-context, individualistic Canadian negotiators were more direct in their behavioral mimicry by exhibiting higher frequency of postural mimicry, than Chinese negotiators. In contrast, Chinese negotiators were more indirect in their displays of mimicry via longer durations of mirrored postures. Interestingly, gender moderated the effects of culture on the frequency and duration of mimicry. Mimicry led to higher joint gains, only when dyads did not attend to the indirect meanings of the mimicked behaviors. We discuss implications of behavioral mimicry in crosscultural negotiations.",

            "Abstract": "Shared understanding is commonly seen as essential to the success of coalition operations, and current research efforts are attempting to develop techniques and technologies to improve shared understanding in military coalition contexts. In spite of this, our understanding of what the term \u2018shared understanding\u2019 actually means is surprisingly poor. In part, this problem is attributable to the difficulty in comprehending the true nature of understanding itself, although confusions also arise about the precise nature of the differences between shared understanding and ostensibly similar constructs, such as shared mental models and shared situation awareness. In this paper, we attempt to improve our understanding of shared understanding by exploring the nature of understanding, situation awareness and mental models. Following Wittgenstein, we suggest that understanding is best conceived of as something akin to an ability, and shared understanding is, we suggest, best conceived of as the sharing of individual forms of understanding by multiple agents. We further suggest that mental models may provide a mechanistic realization for some of the performances that manifest understanding, and that situation awareness should best be seen as a particular kind of understanding, namely a dynamic form of situational understanding. In addition to discussing the nature of understanding and shared understanding, we also discuss their potential relevance to military coalition operations. We propose that shared understanding is important to coalition operations because it contributes to improvements in coalition performance, the optimal use of limited \u2026",

When decisions must be made quickly, and uncertainty is high, trust between decision makers becomes critical; however, there is little time available to form traditional trust relationships. We suggest that intelligent agents can assist the formation of swift trust in ad-hoc teams by anticipating the information needs of those making decisions about delegation and transfer-of-control, and helping them make informed assumptions when direct trust experiences are unavailable. To facilitate this support, we propose a model of human trust and the evidence on which it is based, for use within intelligent agents, founded on existing theories of trust from both human and agent trust literature. We describe a taxonomy of automated monitoring strategies that can be employed to provide the model with experiential evidence, and discuss practical issues surrounding the implementation of such agents.",

Given a library of swarm behaviors, a supervisory operator commanding the swarm must choose a sequence of behaviors to execute in order to accomplish a particular task during a mission composed of many dynamically arising tasks.

To achieve this, the authors rely on human movement data acquired with a motion capture apparatus to build physically realistic models of human movement.

From user studies, we find that humans tend to make their decisions based on physical characteristics of the swarm rather than its performance since the task performance of swarms is not clearly perceivable by humans. Based on the analysis, we formulate trust as a Markov decision process whose state space includes the factors affecting trust. We develop variations of the trust model for different LOAs.

            "Abstract": "Robots and other complex autonomous systems offer potential benefits through assisting humans in accomplishing their tasks. These beneficial effects, however, may not be realized due to maladaptive forms of interaction. While robots are only now being fielded in appreciable numbers, a substantial body of experience and research already exists characterizing human interactions with more conventional forms of automation in aviation and process industries. In human interaction with automation, it has been observed that the human may fail to use the system when it would be advantageous to do so. This has been called disuse (underutilization or under-reliance) of the automation [97]. People also have been observed to fail to monitor automation properly (eg turning off alarms) when automation is in use, or they accept the automation\u2019s recommendations and actions when inappropriate [71, 97]. This has been called misuse, complacency, or over-reliance. Disuse can decrease automation benefits and lead to accidents if, for instance, safety systems and alarms are not consulted when needed. Another maladaptive attitude is automation bias [33, 55, 77, 88, 112], a user tendency to ascribe greater power and authority to automated decision aids than to other sources of advice (eg humans). When the decision aid\u2019s recommendations are incorrect, automation bias may have dire consequences [2, 78, 87, 89](eg errors of omission, where the",

Very often coalition parties need to operate according to planning constraints and regulations, or policies. Therefore, they find themselves not only in need to consider their own goals, but also to support coalition partners to the extent allowed by such regulations. In time-stressed conditions, this is a challenging and cognition-intensive task. In this paper, we present intelligent agents that support human planners and ease their cognitive burden by detecting and giving advice about the violation of policies and constraints. Through a series of experiments conducted with human subjects, we compare and contrast the agents' performance on a number of metrics in three conditions: agent support, transparent policy enforcement, and neither support nor enforcement.",

This resistance to characterization is due to the fact that the number of possible interactions between the system nodes is exponential in the number of nodes. This combinatorial complexity makes such systems resistant to both formal analysis and empirical exploration. The goal of this work is to analyze a particular complex system, a system of agents that fuse information to develop shared beliefs. Primarily we seek to understand the detrimental emergent effects that might result in convergence to an incorrect belief, due to the large scale interactions of individuals. We achieve this through a two stage approach that combines the formal analysis of an abstracted version of the system with direct simulation of the system itself. The analysis of the abstraction of the system gives us a qualitative \u2026",

Trust and reputation are crucial concepts in these environments, as it may be necessary for agents to rely on their peers to perform as expected, and learn to avoid untrustworthy partners. However, aspects of highly dynamic systems introduce issues which make the formation of trust relationships difficult. For example, they may be short-lived, precluding agents from gaining the necessary experiences to make an accurate trust evaluation. This article describes a new approach, inspired by theories of human organizational behavior, whereby agents generalize their experiences with previously encountered partners as stereotypes, based on the observable features of those partners and their behaviors. Subsequently, these stereotypes are applied when evaluating new and unknown partners. Furthermore, these stereotypical opinions can be \u2026",

As autonomous problem solvers, agents need to develop a model of their environment that allows them to reason on how the actions that they perform affect their environment, and how those changes lead them to achieve their goals. Ontologies provide the conceptual framework that allows agents to construct such models: ontologies describe the type of entities that agents encounter, the properties of those entities, and the relations between them. For example, a stock reporting agent may require ontologies describing not only concepts like ticker symbol, but also the relation between stock and ticker symbol and properties of stocks such as its value \u2026",

The domains of application are diverse and range from low-cost warehouse security to interplanetary exploration. New developments in commodity hardware which serve as low cost replacements for otherwise expensive sensing or motion capabilities promise to further accelerate the trend towards deploying teams of mobile robots.The neglect tolerance model [1] offers a standard approach to describing human control of multiple robots performing independent tasks. The role of the operator in this system of operator and robot teaming is to interact with the robots so as to return their performance to an acceptable level when robot performance degrades. Robot performance can degrade for a variety of reasons including entanglement, conflicting sensor data, loss of localization, etc. According to the neglect tolerance model, a robot requires periodic input from an operator to maintain effectiveness above a threshold.

The distinguishing characteristics from globular tuberculated cacti are the flowers arising from the axil (the cranny at the base of the tubercle), and the absence of a groove along the top surface of the tubercle. Grooved tubercles usually mark a plant as a Coryphanta. Many subgenera of Mammillaria exist with slightly differing flowers. Presence or absence of milky sap is an important identifying characteristic. Our local plant is M. grahamii, the older name for which M. microparpa is a synonym. Most Mammillaria have rings of small flowers in the late winter or early spring, borne just down the shoulder of the plant from the apex. A few produce flowers on and off \u2026",

The responding agent can choose the best offer or reject all of them. In the case of rejection, agents exchange their roles and the negotiation proceeds to the next period. To make counteroffers, an agent first uses the heuristic of choosing, on an indifference curve (or surface), the offer that is closest to the best offer made by the opponent in the previous period, and then taking this offer as the seed, chooses several other offers randomly in a specified neighborhood of this seed offer.

Furthermore, all snakes tested used a narrow subset of all available waveform parameters, measured as the relative curvature equal to 5.0+/-0.3, and number of waves on the body equal to1. 8+/-0.1. We hypothesize that the serpenoid wave of a particular choice of parameters offers distinct benefit for locomotion on granular material. To test this hypothesis, we used a physical model (snake robot) to empirically explore the space of serpenoid motions, which is linearly spanned with two independent continuous serpenoid basis functions. The empirically derived height function map, which is a geometric mechanics tool for analyzing movements of cyclic gaits, showed that \u2026",

In addition, individual meeting constraints and preferences may change both as a result of an agent\u2019s situation or as a result of other agents\u2019 scheduling decisions. Therefore, there is a need for distributed reactive schedule revision in response to changing requirements and constraints.

We are developing a \u201cflat\u201d, distributed organization to provide the robustness and flexibility required by a group where team members will frequently leave. Building on established teamwork theory and infrastructure we are able to build large teams that can achieve complex goals using completely distributed intelligence. However, as the size of the team is increased, new issues arise that require novel algorithms. Specifically, key algorithms that work well for relatively small teams, fail to scale up to very large teams. We have developed novel algorithms meeting the requirements of large teams for the tasks of instantiating plans, sharing information and allocating roles. We have implemented these algorithms in reusable software proxies using the novel design abstraction of a coordination agent that encapsulates a piece of coordination protocol. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach with 200 WASMs coordinating to find and destroy ground based targets in support of a manned aircraft.",

Existing trust models in human-in-the-loop systems are based on task performance of robots. However, we find that humans tend to make their decisions based on physical characteristics of the swarm rather than its performance since task performance of swarms is not clearly perceivable by humans. We formulate trust as a Markov decision process whose state space includes physical parameters of the swarm. We employ an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to learn behaviors of the operator from a single demonstration. The learned behaviors are used to predict the trust level of the operator based on the features of the swarm.",

            "Abstract": "Existing approaches to multirobot coordination separate scheduling and task allocation, but finding the optimal schedule with joint tasks and spatial constraints requires robots to simultaneously solve the scheduling, task allocation, and path planning problems. We present a formal description of the multirobot joint task allocation problem with heterogeneous capabilities and spatial constraints and an instantiation of the problem for the search and rescue domain. We introduce a novel declarative framework for modeling the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem and present a centralized anytime algorithm with error bounds. We demonstrate that our algorithm can outperform standard MILP solving techniques, greedy heuristics, and a market based approach which separates scheduling and task allocation.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of distributed path planning for large teams of hundreds of robots in constrained environments. We introduce two distributed prioritized planning algorithms: an efficient, complete method which is shown to converge to the centralized prioritized planner solution, and a sparse method in which robots discover collisions probabilistically. Planning is divided into a number of iterations, during which every robot simultaneously and independently computes a planning solution based on other robots' path information from the previous iteration. Paths are exchanged in ways that exploit the cooperative nature of the team and a statistical phenomenon known as the \u201cbirthday paradox\u201d. Performance is measured in simulated 2D environments with teams of up to 240 robots. We find that in moderately constrained environments, these methods generate solutions of similar quality to a \u2026",

For those systems to be accepted and trusted, the users should be able to understand the reasoning process of the system, ie the system should be transparent. System transparency enables humans to form coherent explanations of the system's decisions and actions. Transparency is important not only for user trust, but also for software debugging and certification. In recent years, Deep Neural Networks have made great advances in multiple application areas. However, deep neural networks are opaque. In this paper, we report on work in transparency in Deep Reinforcement Learning Networks (DRLN).

            "Abstract": "A team of mobile sensors working together towards a common goal of covering targets in some area, can be modeled by DCOP MST. DCOP MST, is a model based on distributed constraints optimization that enables representation of the dynamic elements in a mobile sensing agents team problem, eg, environment changes, changes in the agents\u2019 tasks and technology failures. Agents in DCOP MST, perform local DCOP algorithms, adjusted to this model, in order to adjust their deployment to the current state of the dynamic environment. In our previous work on DCOP MST we assumed complete and accurate knowledge on the location and importance of targets in the area. This information might not be available in realistic scenarios. In this paper we consider two teams of agents,(a) sensors with advanced mobility and sensing tasked to detect targets, and (b) sensors with limited mobility tasked with target surveillance. We demonstrate how the DCOP MST model can be used by these two teams to fulfill their sub-tasks, and how it can be used for cooperation among the two teams. Our experimental study demonstrates how an increased level of cooperation among the two teams improves the performance of both teams and improves the overall result on fulfilling the mutual coverage goal.",

Currently, multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of autonomous agents representing individuals or organizations and capable of reaching mutually beneficial agreements through negotiation and argumentation are becoming increasingly important and pervasive. Research on both automated negotiation and argumentation in MAS has a vigorous, exciting tradition. However, efforts to integrate both areas have received only selective attention in the academia and the practitioner literature. A symbiotic relationship could significantly strengthen each area\u2019s progress and trigger new R&D challenges and prospects toward the advancement of automated negotiators and argumentation tools. Negotiation and Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems presents the current state-of-the-art on the theory and practice of automated negotiation and argumentation in MAS. The eBook encourages the interaction between these two areas in data modelling and attempts to converge them toward mutual enhancement and synergism. Equally, the monograph brings together researchers and industry practitioners specialized in these areas to share R&D results and discuss existing and emerging theoretical and applied problems. This book is intended as a textbook for graduate courses and a reference book for researchers, advanced-level students in Computers Science, and IT practitioners.",

There are two broad reasons for the additional challenges: things continue to happen in the environment while a decision is pending and the inherent distributedness of the entities involved. Our approach to interaction in such a context has three key components which allow us to leverage human expertise by giving them responsibility for key coordination decisions, without risks to the coordination due to slow responses. First, to deal with the dynamic nature of the situation, we use pre-planned sequences of transfer of control actions called transfer-of-control strategies. Second, to allow identification of key coordination issues in a distributed way, individual coordination tasks are explicitly represented as coordination roles, rather than being implicitly \u2026",

If targets are plentiful, the operator will likely miss targets that enter and leave unattended views while dealing with others that were noticed. The related fusion problem arises because robots\u2019 multiple fields of view may overlap forcing the operator to reconcile different views from different perspectives and form an awareness of the environment by \u201cpiecing them together\u201d.

Each robot has a different payoff (or cost) for the tasks and the objective is to assign the tasks to the robots such that the total payoff (cost) is maximized (minimized) while respecting the task deadline constraints. This problem is an extension of a special generalized assignment problem (where each task consumes the same time resource and must be finished), with additional deadline constraints for the time resource assignment.

Currently deployed MASs encode the interface description and the ontology within the capability description of a service provider, but assume a common ACL between communicating agents. Middle agents support the discovery of service providers based on the advertised capabilities of the service providers. This advertisement defines the provider agent's interface, and may reference the ontology used by the provider agent. However, the requester agent still requires information about the ACL used by the provider to be able to communicate with it. This paper demonstrates how agents can communicate with each other without making assumptions about the ACLs used, by presenting a template based shallow parsing approach to message construction/decomposition, thus greatly simplifying and improving the robustness of inter-agent communication.",

The use of semantic descriptions and ontologies is a valuable extension to current SOA conceptualizations. The described mechanisms are implemented as extensions of the OWL-S virtual machine that we have previously developed. The OWL-S virtual machine is a component that controls the interactions between a client and the Web service it uses. The presented extensions are a result of practical requirements that arose in the course of involvement with two projects that utilize OWL-S based semantic Web services. In particular, we present an event-based model for monitoring and logging interactions. The interaction trace allows a human or software agent to analyze, replay or debug the execution. Additionally, we describe proposed extensions to current specification in OWL-S for reporting and \u2026",

We view agent modeling as an iterative and gradual process, where every new piece of information about a particular agent is analyzed in such a way that the model of the agent is further re ned. We present our bayesian-modeler agent which updates his models about the others using a bayesian updating mechanism. Then, he plays in a rational way using a decision-theoretic approach based on the probabilistic models that he is learning. We experimentally explore a range of strategies from least-to most-informed one in order to evaluate the lower-and upper-limits of the modeler agent performance. We have been running experiments in our test bed, the Meeting Scheduling Game, which resembles some characteristics of the distributed meeting scheduling problem.",

In this paper, we take a systematic look at the value of cooperation. Using a simple cooperative task where agents can act effectively individually but where high levels of cooperation will intuitively lead to better behavior, we investigated when and how cooperation helped overall performance. We systematically varied properties of the environment, e.g., the amount of uncertainty, and how much of what sort of cooperation the agents would perform, e.g., information sharing, resource allocation etc. Our experimental results show that, even if communication were free, and while typically coordination helps the team, under some circumstances, the team may be better off not coordinating at all than coordinating a little bit.

Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed for synthesizing controllers that guarantee collision avoidance and goal stabilization for multiple robots. However, it has been noted that reactive control synthesis methods (such as CBFs) are prone to deadlock, an equilibrium of system dynamics that causes robots to come to a standstill before reaching their goals. In this paper, we formally derive characteristics of deadlock in a multirobot system that uses CBFs. We propose a novel approach to analyze deadlocks resulting from optimization based controllers (CBFs) by borrowing tools from duality theory and graph enumeration. Our key insight is that system deadlock is characterized by a force-equilibrium on robots and we show how complexity of deadlock analysis increases approximately exponentially with the number of \u2026",

Practical missions may require a combination of different swarm behaviors, where these behavioral combinations are not known a priori but could arise dynamically due to changes in mission goals. Therefore, human interaction with the swarm (HIS) is needed. In this paper, we introduce, formally define and characterize a novel concept, Neglect Benevolence, that captures the idea that it may be beneficial for system performance if the human operator, after giving a command, waits for some time before giving a subsequent command to the swarm. This raises the important question of the existence and means of calculation of the optimal time for the operator to give input to the swarm in order to optimize swarm behavior. Human operators are limited in their ability to estimate the best time to give input \u2026",

While these platforms are individually very capable, the development of cheaper hardware allows the consideration of swarm systems composed of many more robots but with each individual being far less powerful. Examples from biology indicate that such systems can be collectively more powerful than any individual robot within the team and also more than many larger, more sophisticated individual robots.

We use standard fault handlers and compensation known for example from WS-BPEL to provide support for long running transactions. In addition to that, we introduce constraint violation handlers (CV-handlers) which allow a designer to define what situations are supposed to trigger an erroneous state and what are the appropriate recovery actions. Further, we introduce explicit recovery actions such as retry and replaceBy to recover from the failure and to restore a normal execution flow. By combining fault handlers, CV-handlers and standard event handlers it is possible to define ways of recovery for standard errors and for violations of constraints resulting for example from Service Level Agreements (SLAs).",

This agent assists in the formation of teams of humans (via other MokSAF agents) and task agents that can autonomously perform team subtasks. It provides a suitable interaction mechanism to instruct the various task agents in the team; and, by monitoring the human's progress, reallocate or modify the sub-tasks if the human fails to achieve that subtask. A military domain has been used to investigate this interface agent. The task consists of three military (human) commanders that each assemble a platoon, and plan routes so that all three platoons arrive at a given rendezvous by a specified time. An experimental study has been conducted to evaluate MokSAF and the assistance provided by one of three different task agents, and the results summarized.",

            "Abstract": "We present video co-summarization, a novel perspective to video summarization that exploits visual co-occurrence across multiple videos. Motivated by the observation that important visual concepts tend to appear repeatedly across videos of the same topic, we propose to summarize a video by finding shots that co-occur most frequently across videos collected using a topic keyword. The main technical challenge is dealing with the sparsity of co-occurring patterns, out of hundreds to possibly thousands of irrelevant shots in videos being considered. To deal with this challenge, we developed a Maximal Biclique Finding (MBF) algorithm that is optimized to find sparsely co-occurring patterns, discarding less co-occurring patterns even if they are dominant in one video. Our algorithm is parallelizable with closed-form updates, thus can easily scale up to handle a large number of videos simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on motion capture and self-compiled YouTube datasets. Our results suggest that summaries generated by visual co-occurrence tend to match more closely with human generated summaries, when compared to several popular unsupervised techniques.",

Unlike most existing works that either assume certain knowledge of the density function beforehand or centrally learn the density function assuming global knowledge of collected data from all the robots, we propose a fully distributed adaptive sampling approach to allow robots to efficiently learn the unknown density function online. In particular, we developed adaptive coverage controllers based on the learned density functions for minimizing the sensing cost. To capture significantly different components of the environmental phenomenon with only locally collected data for each robot when global knowledge is not available, we propose a distributed mixture of Gaussian Processes algorithm that enables robots to collaboratively learn the global density function by exchanging only modelrelated parameters. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm via evaluation on real-world data gathered from agricultural field robot and indoor static sensors.",

Semantic networks can also be used, we suggest, to support the representation and visualization of shared understanding in military coalition contexts. The basic approach is to create a network representing the degree of similarity between individuals with respect to their understanding of some item of interest. In principle, the data for such networks could be obtained in a variety of ways, although, in the current paper, we focus on the use of \u2018cultural models\u2019 (developed at either the individual or group level) to provide a measure of shared understanding. The use of a semantic network based approach to representing and visualizing shared understanding has a number of advantages, each of which are discussed at length in the current paper. These include the use of network techniques to analyse changes in shared understanding across time (particularly in response to organizational and technological changes) and the easy identification of individuals that may play special roles in supporting cross-community understanding. Furthermore, by combining semantic networks with techniques such as cultural network analysis (which can be used to develop individual- or group-level mental models) we can create semantic network models of shared understanding at either the individual or collective level. In the latter case, the technique affords a means of representing and visualizing the degree of shared understanding between specific cultural groups \u2026",

However, there is no guarantee that a source will provide the requested information truthfully and correctly. Even if information is provided only by trustworthy sources, it can contain conflicts that hamper its usability. In this paper, we propose to exploit such conflicts to revise trust in information. This requires a reasoning mechanism that can accommodate domain constraints, uncertainty, and trust. Our formalism\u2014SDL-Lite\u2014is an extension of a tractable subset of Description Logics with Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. SDL-Lite allows reasoning about uncertain information and enables conflict detection. Then, we propose methods for conflict resolution through trust revision and analyse them through simulations. We show that the proposed methods allow reasonably accurate estimations of trust in information in realistic settings.",

In a series of experiments, we show how agents can support human planners, ease their cognitive burden by giving advice on the correct use of policies and catch possible violations. The experiments show that agents can effectively prevent policy violations with no significant extra cost.",

The existence of stable matchings is established by assuming all couples have responsive preferences, which means the unilateral improvement of one partner\u2019s job is considered beneficial for the couple as well. Based on its unique features and special requirements, we design a two-sided matching algorithm for the detailing process with the consideration of market complications including married couples, priority billets that must be filled, and high fill rate for Sailors.

The proposed model builds on the 2-dimensional bounded confidence model proposed by Huet et al (2008). The results show that the average number of extremists has a negative correlation with intolerance threshold and positive correlation with the amount of opinion movement when two agents are to reject each other\u2019s belief. In other words, the more tensions exist between groups, the more individuals getting extremists. We also found that intergroup conflict escalation leads to lower opinion diversity in the population compared with normal situations.",

            "Abstract": "In the application domain of stock portfolio management, software agents that evaluate the risks associated with the individual companies of a portfolio should be able to read electronic news articles that are written to give investors an indication of the financial outlook of a company. There is a positive correlation between news reports on a company financial outlook and the company attractiveness as an investment. However, because of the volume of such reports, it is impossible for financial analysts or investors to track and read each one. Therefore, it would be very helpful to have a system that automatically classifies news reports that reflect positively or negatively on a company financial outlook. To accomplish this task, we treat the analysis of news articles as a text classification problem. We developed a text classification algorithm that classifies financial news article by using a combination of a reduced but highly informative word feature sets and a variant of weighted majority algorithm. By clustering words represented in latent semantic vector space by LSA into groups with similar concepts, we are able to find semantically coherent word groups. A learning method with unlabeled data Self-Confident sampling was proposed to handle the problem of expensive data labeling. Vote entropy is the criterion that information-theoretically assigns a label to an unlabeled document. In comparison with naive Bayes classification boosted by Expectation Maximization EM, the proposed method showed a better performance in terms of accuracy. Two criteria are used to evaluate methods 1 how well they improve their performances with unlabeled data after \u2026",

            "Abstract": "To act effectively under uncertainty, multi-robot teams need to accurately estimate the state of the environment. Although individual robots, with uncertain sensors, may not be able to accurately determine the current situation, the team as a whole should have the capability to perform situation assessment. However, sharing all information with all other team mates is not scalable nor is centralization of all information possible. This paper presents a decentralized approach to cooperative situation assessment that balances use of communication bandwidth with the need for good situation assessment. When a robot believes locally that a particular plan should be executed, it sends a proposal for that plan, to one of its team mates. The robot receiving the plan proposal, can either agree with the plan and forward it on, or it can provide sensor information to suggest that an alternative plan might have higher expected utility. Once sufficient robots agree with the proposal, the plan is initiated. The algorithm successfully balances the value of cooperative sensing against the cost of sharing large volumes of information. Experiments verify the utility of the approach, showing that the algorithm dramatically out-performs individual decisionmaking and obtains performance similar to a centralized approach",

At the present time, however, we have little understanding of how the specific features of coalition communication environments influence the dynamics of collective cognitive processing. In order to address this issue, a computational model of one particular aspect of cognitive processing, namely collective sensemaking, is proposed. The computational model provides the basis for computer simulations that can be used to provide some initial insight into how collective cognition is affected by a variety of psychosocial and technological variables. In addition to a description of the model, some specific proposals for future simulation work are outlined. The results of experiments using this model can be used to guide decisions about what kind of real-world observational and experimental studies to perform. In addition, when combined with empirical studies that seek to validate model outputs in specific situations, the model can be used to support the development of techniques and technologies that maximize the collective cognitive potential of military coalition organizations.",

This chapter extends that work by looking at how the relative performance of random information passing algorithms scales with the size of the team. Additionally, the chapter looks at how random information passing performs when sensor data is noisy, so that individuals need multiple pieces of data to reach a conclusion, and the underlying situation is dynamic, so individuals need new information over time.

An agent-based computational model of negotiation would help in understanding and improving the inter-cultural negotiation process. A major challenge in the development of such autonomous agents lies in developing the reasoning model of the agent. In this paper, we discuss the issues and challenges of developing a POMDP-based agent model for inter-cultural negotiation. POMDPs are promising for the following reasons:(a) POMDPs provide a decentralized way of solving the problem which is an inherent characteristic of the negotiation domain.(b) POMDPs provide a natural way to capture the sequential nature of the bargaining process ie they capture the process rather than just focusing on the outcome.(c) POMDPs can express the various important factors that affect negotiation such as culture.",

In this paper, we propose a partially-centralized organization of consumers, namely, a consumer cooperative for purchasing electricity from the market. We propose a novel multiagent coordination algorithm to shape the energy consumption of the cooperative. In the cooperative, a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole group and consumers make their own consumption decisions based on their private consumption constraints and preferences. To coordinate individual consumers under incomplete information, we propose an iterative algorithm in which a virtual price signal is sent by the coordinator to induce consumers to shift demand. We prove that our algorithm converges to the central optimal solution. Additionally we analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm via simulations on randomly generated instances. The results indicate scalability with respect to the number of agents and consumption slots.",

The outside options influence the negotiation strategies via the impact on the reservation prices. The solution is composed of three modular models single-threaded negotiations, synchronized multithreaded negotiations, and dynamic multi-threaded negotiations. The single-threaded negotiation model provides the negotiation strategy given the reservation price. The other two models calculate the reservation price of a negotiation thread based on the model of the outside options by viewing all outside options as a multi-threaded negotiation process. The model of synchronized multi-threaded negotiations considers the presence of concurrently available outside options and provides an approach to estimate the outcome when the threads are known. The model of dynamic multi-threaded negotiations expands the synchronized model by considering the uncertain outside options that may come dynamically in the future. We propose two effective negotiation strategies, the time-dependent strategy and Bayesian learning strategy, from the AI field. Four heuristic approaches are designed to estimate the expected utility from a synchronized multi-threaded negotiation. A Poisson process is used to model the random sequential arrivals, and formulas are provided to calculate the expected utility from a negotiation process when uncertain outside options may come in the future. We give preliminary experimental analysis to characterize the impact of outside options on the reservation price and so on the negotiation strategy \u2026",

These factors cause the appearance of faulty robots. In a decentralized swarm, sharing incorrect information from faulty robots will lead to undesired swarm behaviors, such as swarm disconnection and incorrect heading directions. We envision a system where a human operator is exerting supervisory control over a remote swarm by indicating changes in trust to the swarm via a\" trust-signal\". By correcting faulty behaviors, trust between the human and the swarm is maintained to facilitate human-swarm cooperation. In this research, a trust-aware behavior reflection method\u2013Trust-R\u2013is designed based on a weighted mean subsequence reduced algorithm (WMSR). By using Trust-R, detected faulty behaviors are automatically corrected by the swarm in a decentralized fashion by referring to the motion status of their trusted neighbors and isolating failed robots from the others. Based on real-world scenarios, three types of robot faults\u2013degraded performance caused by motor wear, abnormal motion caused by system uncertainty and motion deviation caused by an external disturbance such as wind\u2013were simulated to test the effectiveness of Trust-R.

Evolvability itself may be subject to evolution, and this process can greatly enhance or substantially inhibit a system's adaptive potential. In artificial systems, this process can often occur irrespective of the designer's awareness or intention. Sustaining evolvability is of particular importance for extended and possibly open-ended evolution. We recap some of the research done on evolvability and its potential to evolve, and identify a common hazard of this process, the premature stagnation of search via the evolutionary suppression of variability. We describe some approaches to forestalling this problem in the context of static fitness regimes. We then propose that dynamic fitness regimes are a possible key to sustaining variability, and offer some candidates for the form of such regimes.Introduction: Evolvability and Variation",

            "Abstract": "Imitation learning is the problem of recovering an expert policy without access to a reward signal. Behavior cloning and GAIL are two widely used methods for performing imitation learning. Behavior cloning converges in a few iterations but doesn't achieve peak performance due to its inherent iid assumption about the state-action distribution. GAIL addresses the issue by accounting for the temporal dependencies when performing a state distribution matching between the agent and the expert. Although GAIL is sample efficient in the number of expert trajectories required, it is still not very sample efficient in terms of the environment interactions needed for convergence of the policy. Given the complementary benefits of both methods, we present a simple and elegant method to combine both methods to enable stable and sample efficient learning. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and integrates with different policy gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in low dimensional control tasks, gridworlds and in high dimensional image-based tasks.",

However, several questions about high-frequency processes in this region remain open. This thesis addresses the characterisation of the diurnal and other short timescale variability of the meteo-ocean variables measured in the tropical Atlantic Ocean by the PIRATA array, as well as derived air-sea heat fluxes. By combining the complementarity and mitigating the disadvantages of using the high temporal resolution of in situ data in conjunction with the excellent spatial coverage of satellite based data, this work also aims to investigate the characteristics of the Tropical Instability Waves in the tropical Atlantic. The satellite data validation process used in this study assesses each of the buoys individually, to take into account possible regional biases. A complete picture of the mean diurnal cycle and the seasonal variability of the diurnal signal is performed for the first time for the whole tropical Atlantic basin. The SST diurnal signal presents strong characteristics during the respective summer in both hemispheres. However, through the wavelet technique used in this analysis, a significant diurnal signal at the equator could be noticed during the second half of each year, indicating a possible modulation of the diurnal signal by processes with different timescales. It is suggested that Tropical Instability Waves could be one of these processes. The results presented here show that the TIW clearly vary their position and time of activity, depending on the degree of development of the equatorial cold tongue.

The NMTF based clustering framework can combine the relations and content seamlessly and the graph regularization can capture user similarity, message similarity and user interaction explicitly. In order to design regularization components, we further exploit user similarity and message similarity in social networks. A unified optimization problem is proposed by integrating the NMTF framework and the graph regularization. Then we derive an iterative learning algorithm for this optimization problem.

            "Abstract": "We present a model for bilateral negotiations that considers the uncertain and dynamic outside options. Outside options affect the negotiation strategies via their impact on the reservation price. The model is composed of three modules, single-threaded negotiations, synchronized multi-threaded negotiations, and dynamic multi-threaded negotiations. These three models embody increased sophistication and complexity. The single-threaded negotiation model provides negotiation strategies without specifically considering outside options. The model of synchronized multi-threaded negotiations builds on the single-threaded negotiation model and considers the presence of concurrently existing outside options. The model of dynamic multi-threaded negotiations expands the synchronized multi-threaded model by considering the uncertain outside options that may come dynamically in the future. Results show that the utility of a negotiator improves significantly if she considers outside options, and the average utility is higher when she both considers the concurrent outside options and foresees future options.Descriptors:",

            "Abstract": "In a distributed system, the actions of one component may lead to severe failures in the system as a whole. To govern such systems, constraints are placed on the behaviour of components to avoid such undesirable actions. Policies or norms are declarations of soft constraints regulating what is prohibited, permitted or obliged within a distributed system. These constraints provide systems-level means to mitigate against failures. A few machine-processable representations for policies have been proposed, but they tend to be either limited in the types of policies that can be expressed or are limited by the complexity of associated reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we present a language that sufficiently expresses the types of policies essential in practical systems, and which enables both policy-governed decision-making and policy analysis within the bounds of decidability. We then propose an OWL-based \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Coordination of large numbers of agents for performing complex tasks in complex domains is a rapidly progressing area of research. Because of the high complexity of the problem, approximate and heuristic algorithms are typically used for key coordination tasks. Such algorithms usually require tuning of algorithm parameters to get the best performance in particular circumstances. Manually tuning of parameters is sometime difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of dynamic features for a neural network, called dynamic networks, to model the way a coordination algorithm will work under particular circumstances. Genetic algorithms are used to train the networks from an abstract simulation, TeamSim. At the end, the model is used to rapidly determine an appropriate configuration of the algorithm for a particular domain. Users specify required tradeoffs in algorithm performance and use the neural network to find the best configuration for those tradeoffs. Algorithm reconfiguration can even be performed online to improve the performance of an executing team as situation changes. We present preliminary results showing the approach promisingly facilitating users to configure and control a large team executing sophisticated teamwork algorithms.",

Although the cost for misclassifying examples should be differentiated according to their importance, the best-performing error-minimizing classifiers do not have ways of incorporating the cost information into their learning processes. In order to handle the cost effectively, we apply two cost-sensitive learning methods to the problem of the confidential access control and compare their usefulness with those of error-minimizing classifiers. We devise a new metric for assigning cost to any datasets. From the comparison of the cost-sensitive classifiers with error-minimizing classifiers, we find that costing demonstrates the best performance in that it minimizes the cost for misclassifying the examples and the false positive using a relatively small amount of training data.Descriptors:",

One such factor is the physical proximity of operators to the vehicle during deployment. Operators of these UAVs are often within sight of their vehicle, and share many environmental cues such as visual landmarks. However, operating in the field also entails additional environmental stresses, such as less optimal use of computer equipment, variations in weather, and the physical demands of the terrain. In this paper, a pilot study is conducted to determine if any of these factors significantly impact situation awareness, by comparing operator performance in a visual identification task in a live field test with operators performing an identical task in a lab environment. Metric results suggest that performance is similar across the two conditions, but qualitative responses \u2026",

We demonstrate this on two different problems, which are representative of many resource allocation problems addressed in literature. In both these problems, the agents and humans optimize their constraints in a distributed manner.

Using full-body motion capture data acquired from human subjects, our system recognizes the behaviors that a human subject is performing from a set of military maneuvers, based on the subject's motion type and proximity to landmarks. Low-level motion classification is performed using support vector machines (SVMs) and a hidden Markov Model (HMM); output from the classifier is used as an input feature for the behavior recognizer. Given the dynamic and highly reactive nature of the domain, our system must handle behavior sequences that are frequently interrupted and often interleaved. To recognize such behavior sequences, we employ dynamic programming in conjunction with a behavior transition cost function to efficiently select the most parsimonious explanation for the human's actions.

            "Abstract": "The theory and design of effective interfaces for human interaction with multi-robot systems has recently gained significant interest. Robotic swarms are multi-robot systems where local interactions between robots and neighbors within their spatial neighborhood generate emergent collective behaviors. Most prior work has studied interfaces for human interaction with remote swarms, but swarms also have great potential in applications working alongside humans, motivating the need for interfaces for local interaction. Given the collective nature of swarms, human interaction may occur at many levels of abstraction ranging from swarm behavior selection to teleoperation. Wearable gesture control is an intuitive interaction modality that can meet this requirement while keeping operator hands usually unencumbered. In this paper, we present an interaction method using a gesture-based wearable device with a limited number of gestures for robust control of a complex system: a robotic swarm. Experiments conducted with a real robot swarm compare performance in single and two-operator conditions illustrating the effectiveness of the method. Results show human operators using our interaction method are able to successfully complete the task in all trials, illustrating the effectiveness of the method, with better performance in the two-operator condition, indicating separation of function is beneficial for our method. The primary contribution of our work is the development and demonstration of interaction methods that allow robust control of a difficult to understand multi robot system using only the noisy inputs typical of smartphones and other on-body sensor \u2026",

Agents must adaptively respond by changing their locations to continually optimize the coverage of targets. We propose distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOP)_MST, a new model for representing MST problems that is based on DCOP. In DCOP_MST, agents maintain variables for their physical positions, while each target is represented by a constraint that reflects the quality of coverage of that target. In contrast to conventional, static DCOPs, DCOP_MST not only permits dynamism but exploits it by restricting variable domains to nearby locations; consequently, variable domains and constraints change as the agents move through the \u2026",

While most of the existing works focus on connectivity control that ensures robotic team remain connected as one component without faults, we consider the problem of robust connectivity maintenance that seeks to maintain k-connectivity, such that the multi-robot network could stay connected with the removal of fewer than k robots. In this paper, we propose provably minimum k-connectivity maintenance algorithms for multi-robot systems. This ensures the robustness of the multi-robot network connectivity at all time and also in a flexible and optimal way to provide the highest freedom for robots task-related controllers. Particularly, we propose a k-Connected Minimum Constraints Subgraph (k-CMCS) algorithm that activates the minimum k-connectivity constraints to the \u2026",

The technique is based on a (weak) bi-partite control Lyapunov function (clf), and it produces a family of piece-wise continuous stabilizing control laws. This clf-based approach guarantees regulation to the origin even when the system is subject to rectangular or polytopic actuator constraints, such as minimum forward velocity and maximum turn rates. It also offers the designer the flexibility to incorporate performance objectives other than stabilization via a point-wise control value selection. Specifically, we employ the vertex enumeration algorithm to derive a complete parameterization of a constrained stabilizing set of input commands at any particular state.",

This is particularly true for planning the response during an ongoing disaster in a urban area, be that a natural one, or a deliberate attack on the civilian population. As the various activities pertaining to the emergency response need to be coordinated in response to multiple reports from the disaster site, a user finds itself cognitively overloaded. To address this issue, we designed the Anytime Cognition (ANTICO) concept to assist human users working in time-constrained environments by maintaining a manageable level of cognitive workload over time. Based on the ANTICO concept, we develop an agent framework for proactively managing a user\u2019s changing information requirements by integrating information management techniques with probabilistic plan recognition.

When each agent selects an action local space of actions, sequential maximization techniques for submodular function maximization obtain solutions within half of optimal even though such problems are often NP-Hard. However, adapting methods for submodular function maximization to distributed computation on sensor networks is challenging as sequential execution of planning steps is time-consuming and inefficient. Further, prior works have found that planners suffer severely impaired worst-case performance whenever large numbers of agents plan in parallel.

Our approach helps commanders understand operational pictures of the battlefield, eg, enemy force levels and deployment, and make better decisions than adversaries in the battlefield.

In this process, it is fundamental to assess how, when, and where this information has been elaborated. A model of provenance can capture this contextual information. Provenance data inevitably affects the identification of plausible conclusions, thus, it must be introduced in the reasoning process. In this paper, we propose a model of argument schemes that allows software agents to explore provenance for improving the information assessment. Argument schemes present the essential elements of provenance that warrant the credibility of the information. Schemes are also used to establish preferences between pieces of information according to different provenance criteria, such as timeliness and reliability. The introduction of schemes about provenance facilitates the decision-making process by providing a rational method to assess the credibility of a piece of information and to resolve conflicting information.",

However, it is usually not possible for agents to have complete information about the other agent's preference or accurate probability distributions. We prove that using an alternating projection strategy, it is possible to reach an agreement in general automated multi-attribute negotiation, where the agents have nonlinear utility functions and no information about the utility function of the other agent. We also prove that rational agents do not have any incentive to deviate from the proposed strategy.

In this paper, we investigate the dynamics and emergent behaviors of a large team sharing beliefs to reach conclusions about the world. We find empirically that the dynamics of information propagation in such belief sharing systems are characterized by information avalanches of belief changes caused by a single additional sensor reading. The distribution of the size of these avalanches dictates the speed and accuracy with which the team reaches conclusions. A key property of the system is that it exhibits qualitatively different dynamics and system performance over small changes in system parameter ranges. In one particular range, the system exhibits behavior known as scale-invariant dynamics which we empirically find to correspond to dramatically more accurate conclusions being reached by team members. Due to the fact that the ranges are very sensitive to configuration details, the parameter ranges over which specific system dynamics occur are extremely difficult to predict precisely. In this paper we (a) develop techniques to mathematically characterize the dynamics of the team belief propagation (b) obtain through simulations the relation between the dynamics and overall system performance, and (c) develop a novel distributed algorithms that the agents in the team use locally to steer the whole team to areas of optimized performance.",

For each instance of potential aiding there are two questions: 1- can a software agent perform the task? and 2- can the agent's assistance contribute to team performance? Our research addresses these two issues by demonstrating the feasibility of sophisticated agent assistance in scenario-based technology demonstrations and investigating the contribution of agent assistance to human team performance using simplified, controllable laboratory experiments.",

            "Abstract": "Multi-robot systems, such as swarms, with large number of members that are homogeneous and anonymous are robust to deletion and addition of members. However, these same properties that make the system robust, create vulnerabilities under certain circumstances. In this work, we study such a case, namely the insertion by adversarial agents, called moles, that subvert the performance of the system. The adversary monitors the swarm\u2019s movements during surveillance operations for the presence of holes, ie areas that were left uncovered by the swarm. The adversary then adds moles that get positioned in the swarm, in such a way as to deceive the swarms regarding the existence of holes and thus preventing the swarm from discovering and repairing the holes. This problem has significant military applications. Our contributions are as follows: First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies this problem. Second, we provide a formalization of the problem. Third, we provide several algorithms, and characterize them formally and also experimentally. Finally, based on developed theory and algorithms, we present a dynamic scenario and describe adversary control laws to leverage the identified swarm vulnerability.",

The simplicity of the local rules allows for large numbers of low-cost robots in deployment, but the same simplicity creates difficulties when deploying in many applicable environments. These complex missions sometimes require human operators to influence the swarms towards achieving the mission goals. Human swarm interaction (HSI) is a young field with few user studies exploring operator behavior. These studies all assume perfect information between the operator and the swarm, which is unrealistic in many applicable scenarios. Indoor search and rescue or underwater exploration may present environments where radio limitations restrict the bandwidth of the robots. This study explores this bandwidth restriction in a user study. Three levels of bandwidth are explored to determine what amount of information is necessary to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A key prerequisite for higher-level fusion is the use of context to disambiguate and interpret sensed data and guide data collection. For ground operations terrain information supplies an important context. The layout of terrain is a determining factor in arraying of forces, both friendly and enemy, and the structuring of Courses of Action (COAs). For example, key terrain, such as a bridge over an un-fordable river, or terrain that allows observation of the opposing forces line of advance, is likely to give a big military advantage to the force that holds it. Combining information about terrain features with hypotheses about enemy assets can lead to inferences about possible avenues of approach, areas that provide cover and concealment, areas that are vulnerable to enemy observation, or choke points. Key terrain identifies areas where intelligence collection effort should be focused. In addition, if force movements are observed, terrain features give additional information with respect to the intent of enemy forces that have been observed on the move, thus confirming or disconfirming hypotheses about enemy intent. Currently, intelligence officers manually combine terrain-based information, information about the tactical significance of certain terrain features as well as information regarding enemy assets and doctrine to form hypotheses about the disposition of enemy forces and enemy intent. In this paper, we present a set of algorithms and implemented tools for automating terrain based information fusion and inference. The products of automated terrain analysis are currently being validated using analysis of the same terrain produced by human intelligence \u2026",

Developing efficient exploration strategies capable of finding the most useful samples becomes critical in such settings. Existing approaches towards finding efficient exploration strategies add auxiliary objectives to promote exploration by the pre-update policy, however, this makes the adaptation using a few gradient steps difficult as the pre-update (exploration) and post-update (exploitation) policies are often quite different. Instead, we propose to explicitly model a separate exploration policy for the task distribution. Having two different policies gives more flexibility in training the exploration policy and also makes adaptation to any specific task easier. We show that using self-supervised or supervised learning objectives for adaptation allows for more efficient inner-loop updates and also demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to prior works in this domain.",

            "Abstract": "A key challenge in creating a sustainable and energy-efficient society is to make consumer demand adaptive to the supply of energy, especially to the renewable supply. In this article, we propose a partially-centralized organization of consumers (or agents), namely, a consumer cooperative that purchases electricity from the market. In the cooperative, a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole group. The technical challenge is that consumers make their own demand decisions, based on their private demand constraints and preferences, which they do not share with the coordinator or other agents. We propose a novel multiagent coordination algorithm, to shape the energy demand of the cooperative. To coordinate individual consumers under incomplete information, the coordinator determines virtual price signals that it sends to the consumers to induce them to shift their demands when required. We prove that this algorithm converges to the central optimal solution and minimizes the electric energy cost of the cooperative. Additionally, we present results on the time complexity of the iterative algorithm and its implications for agents' incentive compatibility. Furthermore, we perform simulations based on real world consumption data to (a) characterize the convergence properties of our algorithm and (b) understand the effect of differing demand characteristics of participants as well as of different price functions on the cost reduction. The results show that the convergence time scales linearly with the agent population size and length of the optimization horizon. Finally, we observe that as participants' flexibility of shifting their demands \u2026",

To achieve this goal, a stable, widely used, widely accessible and extensible MAS infrastructure is crucial. Various standards bodies (e.g. FIPA) are attempting to define standards for various aspects of MAS infrastructure, such as Agent Communications Languages.

            "Abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of plan recognition for multi-agent teams. Complex multi-agent tasks typically require dynamic teams where the team membership changes over time. Teams split into subteams to work in parallel, merge with other teams to tackle more demanding tasks, and disband when plans are completed. We introduce a new multi-agent plan representation that explicitly encodes dynamic team membership and demonstrate the suitability of this formalism for plan recognition. From our multi-agent plan representation, we extract local temporal dependencies that dramatically prune the hypothesis set of potentially-valid team plans. The reduced plan library can be efficiently processed to obtain the team state history. Naive pruning can be inadvisable when low-level observations are unreliable due to sensor noise and classification errors. In such conditions, we eschew pruning in favor of prioritization and show how our scheme can be extended to rank-order the hypotheses. Experiments show that this robust pre-processing approach ranks the correct plan within the top 10%, even under conditions of severe noise.",

In particular, we proposed a connectivity-aware coverage control approach to simultaneously optimize the coverage performance and ensure robotic network connectivity. Unlike most of existing works on connectivity control that have no guarantee on the primary task, our algorithm could maintain minimum connectivity that introduce minimal revision to the primary coverage controller due to invoked connectivity constraints. This ensures the robotic network stay connected at all time but also in an optimal way to provide highest freedom for achieving primary coverage task. Moreover, we prove the convergence of the proposed controller \u2026",

In contrast to previous approaches that either plan complete paths for each individual robot in the high-dimensional joint configuration space or control the robot group as a whole with explicit constraints on the group's boundary and inter-robot pairwise distance, we propose a novel decentralized online behavior-based algorithm that relies on the topological structure of the multi-robot communication and sensing graphs to solve this problem. We formally describe the communication graph as a simplicial complex that enables robots to iteratively identify the frontier nodes and coordinate forward motion through the sensing graph.

We introduce two novel image perturbations that use \u201ccontextual information\u201d (in the form of stereo image data) to perform more physically-realistic simulation of haze and defocus effects. For both standard and contextual mutations, we show cases where performance drops catastrophically in response to barely-perceptible changes.

Agents can utilize this knowledge to seek and invoke other agents and web services, thus supporting navigation across the Semantic Web. We demonstrate how agents support enhanced navigation within a conference-schedule domain, and present three agent-based services: the RETSINA Calendar Agent, which reasons about schedules marked up on the Semantic Web; the DMA2ICal Translation Agent which provides translation services between schedules grounded in different ontologies, and a Conference \u2026",

This approach allows operators to search through a large amount of data gathered by autonomous robot teams, and fills the gap for comprehensive and scalable displays to obtain a network-centric perspective for UGVs. It is found that the image queue reduces errors and operator\u2019s workload comparing with the traditional synchronous display.

            "Abstract": "Peer discovery via distributed message relaying is an important function of a P2P system in which the resources/services provided by peers and service/resource providers may change frequently. The usual searching protocols create huge burden on communications or cause long response time. Appropriate incentives are required to avoid free-riding and achieve efficient cooperations in message relaying. We present an incentive mechanism that aims at solving both the efficiency and incentive problems of message relaying for peer discovery. In this mechanism rewards are passed from upstream nodes to downstream nodes. A peer is rewarded if a service provider is found via a relaying path composed of this peer. The mechanism allows peers to specifically trade off communication efficiency and reliability, and maintains anonymity and information locality. Some analytical insights are given to the subgame perfect Nash equilibria (SPNE) and best response strategies of this game. An approximation approach is provided to calculate a symmetric SPNE. Experiments show that this incentive mechanism brings a system utility higher than in breadth-first search, and close to the optimal utility in a centralized system. In the incentive mechanism the distribution of relaying efforts over hops is dependent on the convexity of the cost function. With the cost function more convex, peers in earlier hops tend to spend more efforts on relaying.",

Each robot can do at most one task from a group and the total number of tasks a robot can do is bounded by its limited battery life. There is a payoff for assigning each robot to a task and the objective is to maximize the total payoff. A special case, where each group has one task and each robot can do one task is the online maximum weighted bipartite matching problem (MWBMP). For online MWBMP, it is known that, under some assumptions on the payoffs, a greedy algorithm has a competitive ratio of 1 over 3. Our key result is to prove that for the general problem, under the same assumptions on the payoff as in MWBMP and an assumption on the number of tasks arising in each group, a repeated auction algorithm, where each group of tasks is (near \u2026",

This paper investigates the use of a small subset of the swarm as leaders that are dynamically selected during the scenario execution and are directly controlled by the human operator to guide the rest of the swarm, which is operating under a flocking-style algorithm. The goal of the operator in this study is to move the swarm to goal regions that arise dynamically in the environment.We experimentally investigated three different aspects of dynamic leader-based swarm control and their interactions: leader density (in \u2026",

Furthermore, in most real systems it is infeasible for entities to interact with all peers. The presence of a social network can alleviate this problem by providing a neighborhood system within which entities interact with a reduced number of peers. Previous research has shown that the topology of the underlying social network has a dramatic effect on the quality of coalitions formed and consequently on system performance (Gaston & desJardins 2005a). It has also been shown that it is feasible to develop agents which dynamically alter connections to improve an organization\u2019s ability to form coalitions on the network. However those studies have not analysed the network topologies that result from connectivity adaptation strategies. In this paper the resulting network topologies were analysed and it was found that high performance and rapid convergence were attained because scale free networks were being formed. However it was observed that organizational performance is not impacted by limiting the number of links per agent to the total number of skills available within the population, implying that bandwidth was wasted by previous approaches. We used these observations to inform the design of a token based algorithm that attains higher performance using an order of magnitude less messages for both uniform and non-uniform distributions of skills.",

            "Abstract": "Policies are declarations of constraints on the behaviour of components within distributed systems, and are often used to capture norms within agent-based systems. A few machine-processable representations for policies have been proposed, but they tend to be either limited in the types of policies that can be expressed or limited by the complexity of associated reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we argue for a language that sufficiently expresses the types of policies essential in practical systems, and which enables both policy-governed decision-making and policy analysis within the bounds of decidability. We then propose an OWL-based representation of policies that meets these criteria using and a reasoning mechanism that uses a novel combination of ontology consistency checking and query answering. In this way, agent-based systems can be developed that operate flexibly and effectively in \u2026",

Human-swarm teaming has been widely proposed for scenarios, such as human-supervised teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for disaster rescue, UAV and ground vehicle cooperation for building security, and soldier-UAV teaming in combat. Effective cooperation requires an appropriate level of trust, between a human and a swarm. When an UAV swarm is deployed in a real-world environment, its performance is subject to real-world factors, such as system reliability and wind disturbances. Degraded performance of a robot can cause undesired swarm behaviors, decreasing human trust. This loss of trust, in turn, can trigger human intervention in UAVs' task executions, decreasing cooperation effectiveness if inappropriate. Therefore, to promote effective cooperation we \u2026",

This environment assists in the formation of teams of humans via interface agents, which graphically display situation information, and task agents that assist in geospatial planning. The interface agents provide a suitable interaction mechanism by which human team members coordinate the allocation of limited resources, and support various user-interaction behaviors for instructing task agents that provide route-planning assistance. MokSAF has been used to investigate the effects of various user-interactions (and corresponding task agents) for collaborative team planning within a military domain. An experimental study has been conducted to evaluate MokSAF and the assistance provided by each of the three different task agents, and the results summarized.",

In many practical applications, human operators may need to change the current behavior of a swarm from the goal that the swarm was going towards into a new goal due to dynamic changes in mission objectives. There are two related but distinct capabilities needed to supervise a robotic swarm. The first is comprehension of the swarm's state and the second is prediction of the effects of human inputs on the swarm's behavior. Both of them are very challenging. Prior work in the literature has shown that inserting the human input as soon as possible to divert the swarm from its original goal towards the new goal does not always result in optimal performance (measured by some criterion such as the total time required by the swarm to reach the second goal).

Previous research has focused on relaying influence from the operator to the swarm, either by broadcasting commands to the entire swarm or by influencing the swarm through the teleoperation of a leader. While these methods each have their different applications, there has been a lack of research into how the influence should be propagated through the swarm in leader-based methods. This paper focuses on two simple methods of information propagation-flooding and consensus-and compares the ability of operators to maneuver the swarm to goal points using each, both with and without sensing error.

Combining information about terrain features with hypotheses about enemy assets can lead to inferences about possible avenues of approach, areas that provide cover and concealment, areas that are vulnerable to enemy observation, or choke points.

Some researchers employ designated leaders that are known to be leaders by other members of the swarm and hence followed. Others do not impose a leader/follower distinction on the swarm's algorithms and instead choose to influence the swarm indirectly through controlling one or more of its members. Because the robustness of swarm behavior arises from its many distributed interactions, influence through designated leaders might render it susceptible to noise or disrupt its coherence by overriding these mechanisms. Conversely, limiting human influence to indirect control through the local effects of a leader might prove too sluggish to allow effective human control.

Due to intense competition for profit opportunities, trading costs can represent a significant portion of overall return. They must be taken into account both when a specific trade is being executed, and when a general investment strategy is being designed. We empirically demonstrate that by combining market orders (which offer immediate execution regardless of price) and limit orders (which offer uncertain execution at a specified price), we are able to obtain a superior average price than by using market orders only. Our analysis highlights the trade-off between expected price improvement from limit orders and the risk of non-execution. We show how to determine the optimal limit order price in a simplified setting and suggest how this approach can be generalized to a complete solution. All of our experimental results are obtained on \u2026",

We examine the premise that although long interaction time between robots and operators hurts the efficiency of the system, as it generates longer waiting time for robots, it provides robots with longer neglect time and better performance benefiting the system. In the paper we address the problem of how to choose the optimal service level for an operator in a system through a service level differentiation model. Experimental results comparing system performance for different values of system parameters show that a mixed strategy is a general way to get optimal system performance for a large variety of system parameter settings and in all cases is no worse than a pure strategy.",

However, different types of robots are limited by different mobility, battery life, sensor type, etc. Heterogeneous robot systems are able to utilize various types of robots and provide solutions where robots are able to compensate each other with their different capabilities. In this paper, we consider the problem of sampling and modeling environmental characteristics with a heterogeneous team of robots. To utilize heterogeneity of the system while remaining computationally tractable, we propose an environmental partitioning approach that leverages various robot capabilities by forming a uniformly defined heterogeneity cost space.

Such differentiation introduces more service time variability, but it also creates information that enables the implementation of service rate-based scheduling, which mitigates the increased variance and may even reduce the total waiting time. We provide conditions under which our static service differentiation reduces waiting, and further derive closed-form expressions for the optimal differentiation policy, which shows that both optimal service rates and allocation probabilities form geometric sequences. We illustrate our policy in the context of quality-based service domains, in which customers value service time but \u2026",

To that end, we conducted an online survey of Chinese and United States participants in which we asked them to select the preferred normative action a domestic service robot should take in a number of scenarios. The paper makes multiple contributions. Our extensive survey is the first to:(a) collect data on attitudes of people on normative behavior of domestic robots,(b) across cultures and (c) study relative priorities among norms for this domain.

Currently deployed Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) encode the interface description and the ontology within a service provider's capability description (or\\it advertisement) that is registered with a Middle Agent; however, this assumes a common ACL between communicating agents.

This design provides an experimental model of human communities, where information may spread from peer to peer by word of mouth. With this model, we explain the realistic tradeoff between liberal information dumping and targeted information sharing by human peers. Human subjects exchanged naturallanguage messages with relevance to a task, thereby sharing knowledge across a community. Communication took place along the edges of a small-world graph. Cooperation and individual efforts were incentivized. In one condition, participants were asked to request specific information and only supply information that they knew was needed. In another condition, they were asked to supply and forward as much information as possible. We found that a targeted communication policy was successfully implemented by the participants, increased task success, shortened the time it took to get answers to questions, increased efficiency (task success per communication bandwidth), and may have done so selectively for nodes with fewer connections.",

In multi-robot generalized assignment problem (MR-GAP), each robot has its own resource constraint (e.g., energy constraint), and needs to consume a certain amount of resource to obtain a payoff for each task. The objective is to find a maximum payoff assignment of tasks to robots such that each task is assigned to at most one robot while respecting robots' resource constraints. MR-GAP is a NP-hard problem. It is an extension of multi-robot linear assignment problem since different robots can use different amount of resource for doing a task (due to the heterogeneity of robots and tasks).

We posit that requiring artificial agents to adhere to the rules of human language, while also requiring them to maximize information exchange through dialog is an ill-posed problem. We observe that humans do not stray from a common language because they are social creatures who live in communities, and have to communicate with many people everyday, so it is far easier to stick to a common language even at the cost of some efficiency loss. Using this as inspiration, we propose and evaluate a multi-agent community-based dialog framework where each agent interacts with, and learns from, multiple agents, and show that this community-enforced regularization results in more relevant and coherent dialog (as judged by human evaluators) without sacrificing task performance (as judged by quantitative metrics).",

In this paper we present a novel approach to military force aggregation and classification using the mathematical theory of evidence and doctrinal templates. Our approach helps commanders understand operational pictures of the battlefield, e.g., enemy force levels and deployment, and make better decisions than adversaries in the battlefield. A simple application of our approach is illustrated in the simulated testbed OTBSAF and RETSINA system.",

            "Abstract": "With the increasing growth of social media, people have started relying heavily on the information shared therein to form opinions and make decisions. While such a reliance is motivation for a variety of parties to promote information, it also makes people vulnerable to exploitation by slander, misinformation, terroristic and predatorial advances. In this work, we aim to understand and detect such attempts at persuasion. Existing works on detecting persuasion in text make use of lexical features for detecting persuasive tactics, without taking advantage of the possible structures inherent in the tactics used. We formulate the task as a multi-class classification problem and propose an unsupervised, domain-independent machine learning framework for detecting the type of persuasion used in text, which exploits the inherent sentence structure present in the different persuasion tactics. Our work shows promising results as compared to existing work.",

We introduce a specialized GP learner and demonstrate that it produces trading rules that outperform appropriate buy and hold strategy benchmarks in measures of risk adjusted returns. We compare the results to those attained by using other relevant variables, lags of price and volume, and find that the the message board volume produces cleraly superior results. We experiment with alternative representations for the GP trading rule learner. Finally, we find a potential regime shift in the market reaction to the message volume data, and speculate about future trends.",

How autonomous assistance impacts trust in automation as well as how trust affects human calibration and use of automation has been investigated for both dynamic contexts, including the internal variables (e.g., cultural characteristics) and external factors (e.g., system settings). Having standardized measures to capture trust and its antecedents is particularly critical to understanding how factors associated with the human operators and autonomous applications affects the way they are used. This paper reports the development of a trust instrument and several rounds of cross-country validation, including U.S., German, Taiwanese, and Turkish populations. The results confirm that the instrument which was developed reliably measured human trust in automation across cultures.",

In military coalitions, for example, there is a need to understand how factors such as communication network topology, trust, cultural differences and the potential for miscommunication affects the ability of distributed teams to generate high quality plans, to formulate effective decisions and to develop shared situation awareness. The current paper presents a computational model and associated simulation capability for performing in silico experimental analyses of collective sensemaking. This model can be used in combination with the results of human experimental studies in order to improve our understanding of the factors that influence collective sensemaking processes.",

However, HRI has rarely extended beyond single robots or small multi-robot teams. While one of the benefits of robot swarms is their robust capabilities and the ability of their distributed algorithms to deal autonomously with the complex interactions amongst swarm members, there is undoubtedly a need for humans to influence such swarms in some circumstances\u2014especially when these swarms are operating in unknown or hostile environments. In this paper, we approach the problem of human-swarm interaction (HSI) using previous research in levels of automation (LOAs) in HRI. We create a target searching task whereby the swarm can operate at two different levels of autonomy: an autonomous dispersion algorithm, or user-defined goto points. We investigate what \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Several methods currently exist that can perform relatively simple queries driven by relevance feedback on large multimedia databases. However, all these methods work only for vector spaces; that is, they require that objects be represented as vectors within feature spaces. Moreover, their implied query regions are typically convex. This research pa-per explains our solution. We propose a novel method that is designed to handle disjunctive queries within metric spaces. The user provides weights for positive examples; our system\" learns\" the implied concept and returns similar objects. Our method differs from existing relevance-feedback methods that base themselves upon Euclidean or Mahalanobis metrics, as it facilitates learning even disjunctive, concave models within vector spaces, as well as arbitrary metric spaces. In addition, our method is completely example-driven, and imposes no requirements upon the user for other aspects such as feature selection. Our main contributions are two-fold. Not only do we present a novel way to estimate the dissimilarity of an object to a set of desirable objects, but we support it with an algorithm that shows how to exploit metric indexing structures that support range queries to accelerate the search without incurring false dismissals. Our empirical results demonstrate",

In addition, we show that the MAS infrastructure imposes requirements on an individual agent if the agent is to be a member of a MAS and take advantage of various components of the MAS infrastructure. Although agents are expected to enter a MAS and seamlessly and effortlessly interact with the agents in the MAS infrastructure, the current state of the art demands agents to be programmed with the knowledge of what infrastructure they will utilize, and what are various fall-back and recovery \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The utility of semantic knowledge, in the form of ontologies, is widely acknowledged. In particular, semantic knowledge facilitates integration, visualization, and maintenance of information from various sources. However, the majority of previous work in this field has tried to learn ontologies for relatively constrained domains. In other words, to date, there has been relatively little work on trying to construct ontologies for an open domain, where there are enormous needs for such ontologies. Moreover there have been few studies that empirically examine the value of text learning techniques to extract a set of candidate words for concept words in a domain ontology. The goal of this work is to examine the usefulness of existing feature selection methods for the extraction of a set of good candidate words for concept words in an ontology. From the experimental results, we found that the existing word feature selection methods are quite useful for ontology learning, in that there is a good overlap between the word sets identified by feature selection methods and the words in a manually built domain ontology. Finally, from our experience of working on this paper, we enumerate the desiderata for a domain ontology learning system.Descriptors:",

The model is composed of three modules, single-threaded negotiations, synchronized multi-threaded negotiations, and dynamic multi-threaded negotiations. These three models embody increased sophistication and complexity. The single-threaded negotiation model provides the negotiation strategies without specifically considering outside options. The model of synchronized multithreaded negotiations builds on the single-threaded negotiation model and considers the presence of concurrently available outside options. The model of dynamic multithreaded negotiations expands the synchronized multi-threaded model by considering the uncertain outside options that may come dynamically in the future. The modules are described individually, and extensions are discussed for their application in more general situations.",

A structured framework such as this allows agents to peruse and reason about published knowledge without the need for scrapers, information agents, and centralized ontologies. However, in order to process any information, an agent must be familiar with the underlying ontology used to markup that information. However, no single agent can be expected to be familiar with all possible ontologies that may be available on the Semantic Web. Therefore, translation services that transform concepts defined within previously unknown ontologies into known concepts allow agents to understand the available information and hence achieve their goal. This transformation may be achieved by invoking specific markup translation services or by logical reasoning through other shared ontologies. The \u2026",

There are many works in literature that perform semantic segmentation in such scenes, but few relates to the environment that possesses a high degree of clutter in general eg indoor scenes. In this paper, we explore the use of depth information along with RGB and deep convolutional network for indoor scene understanding through semantic labeling. Our work exploits the geocentric encoding of a depth image and uses a multi-scale deep convolutional neural network architecture that captures high and lowlevel features of a scene to generate rich semantic labels. We apply our method on indoor RGBD images from NYUD2 dataset [1] and achieve a competitive performance of 70.45% accuracy in labeling four object classes compared with some prior approaches. The results show our system is capable of generating a pixel-map directly from an input image where each pixel-value corresponds to a particular class of object.",

            "Abstract": "In a search and rescue scenario, rescuers may have different knowledge of the environment and strategies for exploration. Understanding what is inside a rescuer's mind will enable an observer agent to proactively assist them with critical information that can help them perform their task efficiently. To this end, we propose to build models of the rescuers based on their trajectory observations to predict their strategies. In our efforts to model the rescuer's mind, we begin with a simple simulated search and rescue task in Minecraft with human participants. We formulate neural sequence models to predict the triage strategy and the next location of the rescuer. As the neural networks are data-driven, we design a diverse set of artificial \"faux human\" agents for training, to test them with limited human rescuer trajectory data. To evaluate the agents, we compare it to an evidence accumulation method that explicitly incorporates all available background knowledge and provides an intended upper bound for the expected performance. Further, we perform experiments where the observer/predictor is human. We show results in terms of prediction accuracy of our computational approaches as compared with that of human observers.",
