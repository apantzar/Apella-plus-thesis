It provides a combination of social media datasets, giving insights than neither dataset (social network and media service) individually gives. We develop an accurate model to predict future popularity of a video resource given features of the underlying network of its initial sharer. The set of features we propose and analyze are based on the notion of influence score of a user and its fluctuation through time, as well as the distance of content interests among users for both datasets. We discover that the latter feature plays an important role in video popularity prediction, suggesting high dependence of video sharing via Twitter on the video content itself.

Our coordination environment uses the control-driven approach to coordination, namely the model IWIM and the associated language Manifold. In the process we show how Manifold can be used to realize object communication and synchronization of MSSA components and we present a methodology of combining a software architecture such as MSSA with a coordination language such as Manifold.

Its great importance lies in the fact that it makes learning content readily available at any place at any time. Until recently e-learning was usually achieved by providing complete on-line courses. This approach has proven to be inflexible, time consuming and expensive. A solution to these problems is given by the Learning Object (LO) technology. The LOs are small self-contained chunks of learning content that can be stored, searched, retrieved and assembled in order to provide just in time learning. This paper examines and evaluates current work, systems, technologies and trends relating to LOs. The main aim of this paper is to identify the aspects of the LO technology to which further research would be most pertinent and valuable. The paper concludes by identifying the need for a methodology and tools for designing and developing LOs based on the Object-Oriented model for software engineering and finally lays down the route for further work that will lead to the establishment of such a methodology and the implementation of the relevant tools.",

The submerged jet was operated at fixed flow rate conditions, and subjected to a small constant injection of a Rhodamine solution to generate the LIF. Injection of the Rhodamine solution was performed after the water jet had reached hydrodynamic steady state conditions. The jet Reynolds number was varied from the laminar to the moderately turbulent flow regime of a fully developed pipe jet. The influence of rotating the impingement plate was also investigated.

We define the notion of electronic information roads and explore the form which these roads can take. Electronic roads can serve to define a new type of social group based on inherently different relationships centered around intellectual and other interests rather than the proximity of physical contact and direct communication. The implementation of electronic roads will require advancements in digital libraries, advanced networks and distributed systems programming.",

The classification scheme utilizes a dedicated genetic algorithm which evolves a small number of classifiers by dividing the set of available components stored in a database into certain subsets (clusters). Each classifier thus becomes the leader-representative of its cluster. When a user wishes to trace a component he/she identifies the desired characteristics (component profile) which are then compared with the characteristics of the available classifiers. The closest classifier matching the required characteristics over a user-defined threshold will result in the \"winning\" set of components belonging to its cluster, which are presented to the user in descending matching fitness. We have validated our methodology over a synthetic dataset of components and the results obtained \u2026",

This mechanism aims to exploit patterns of social interactions of the users to reduce the load on the origin server, the traffic on the Internet, and ultimately improve the user experience. By addressing the issue of which content will be copied in the surrogate servers of a CDN, it ensures a near-optimal content diffusion placement. At the same time, it moderates the impact on bandwidth that the Big Data transmitted via OSNs has, offering scalable solutions to existing CDNs or OSNs providers.

While context awareness guarantees that the applications are aware of both their context and their own state, dynamic adaptivity enables them to react on their knowledge about it and optimize their offered services. However, because in pervasive computing environments there is also a need for enabling arbitrary synergies, such a behavior also requires appropriate algorithms implementing the adaptation logic required to reason on the sensed context and dynamically decide on the most appropriate adaptations. This paper discusses how utility function-based approaches can use context-awareness for that and, additionally, it shows how the decision-making process is improved with respect to both performance and resource \u2026",

This process is typically performed using context modelling approaches that consider context-awareness and apply static context model validation, at the modelling level, using Object Constraint Language rules. This paper proposes a framework that combines the Model Driven Engineering paradigm with the Petri Nets formalism to support the development of context-aware applications. In contrast to existing context modelling approaches, the focus is on dynamic validation of context-aware applications using Petri Nets. Dynamic validation complements the static validation of context models and ensures the validity of the operational semantics of context-aware applications.

            "Abstract": "This paper forms part of a broader work examining the application of Object Oriented (OO) principles to the design and development of e-Learning material and its use within Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS). The preceding qualitative research has demonstrated the benefits of creating an OO methodology for the analysis, design and development of Learning Objects (LOs). Such benefits mainly include the high reusability, adaptability, standardization and time and cost effectiveness of LO development and use.This paper focuses on defining a model for Object Oriented Learning Object (OOLO) analysis and design, as a first step towards a more extensive OO e-Learning methodology that will extend to OOLO implementation and use. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) notations are used to represent the relevant OO concepts, such as class structure, inheritance, aggregation, polymorphism, etc. The notations may be extended to reflect the specific needs of LOs. The main idea concentrates on developing a predefined hierarchy of OOLOs, which will be something similar to the Application Programming Interface (API) of OO languages such as Java. The existing OOLOs can be used as they are or they can be extended, through inheritance mechanisms, to create new ones. The OOLOs can then be combined using aggregation or other relationships to design, on the fly, larger learning units such as courses.",

The hypersonic flow environment is characterized by high velocity and high temperature, often requiring sensors exposed directly to this environment to be actively cooled. Active cooling is undesirable since it increases the size of the overall sensor system by involving additional hardware and supply of coolant that makes the measurement system overburdening, especially for flight testing. By leveraging high temperature materials, specifically silicon carbide, the current effort set off to develop an un-cooled skin friction gage that can survive at elevated shear stress levels and at temperatures of at least 1000 oC. This is a sensor solution that currently does not exist and is of significant value to the hypersonic test and evaluation community. Shear stress sensors use either direct or indirect \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Software Architectures have evolved considerably over the last decade and, partly also due to the significant progress made in component-based development, have become a major subfield of Software Engineering. The associated field of Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) has also evolved considerably, providing numerous approaches to the formal specification and representation of architectural designs. In this field, one of its most interesting (and rather recent) aspects has been the exploration of different ways to map architectural specifications down to executable representations. In this paper, we present a methodology for mapping the generic features of any typical ADL to executable code. The mapping process involves the use of ACME, a generic language for describing software architectures, and the coordination paradigm. More to the point, we show how the core concepts of ACME can be \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Context modelling and context reasoning are widely used topics in Context-Aware Recommender Systems research. Based on our research, the development of context models in context-aware recommender systems is problematic in that many domain specific and application specific context models are developed with limited or no reuse and sharing capabilities. Furthermore, context-aware recommender systems that follow the representational view of context, design and model the fully observable context that is known at recommendation time but do not consider partially observable context with unknown values at recommendation time, that can nevertheless enhance the recommendation outcome. In this paper we deal with the above two issues by proposing a CARS design system that enables developers: (i) to easily and effectively design context models by defining, sharing and reusing context \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Time-Resolved PIV at 1kHz sampling rate was used to acquire particle image data along a vertical plane within a triple impeller stirred tank, as shown in Fig. 1. The working fluid was glycerin at room temperature (20 oC), stirred steadily at the rotational speeds indicated in Fig. 2 (see R ef [1] for more information on testing conditions). Fluorescent particles and a high-pass color filter in front of the camera lens were used to eliminate contamination of PIV images by background reflections, and thus give way to high contrast imaging especially close to the turbine blades. Acquisition was performed over several cycles, and at each instant in time the 2D velocity field within the measurement plane was determined. Further processing of the radial (r) and vertical (z) components of velocity yielded the circulation strength (Ref 2) of vortical structures within the rz plane. Conversion of time into angular position relative to blade passage yielded the detailed volumetric flow representation shown in Fig. 2 (blade rotation is counter-clockwise looking from the top of the stirred tank). Fig. 2 shows iso-surfaces of the local circulation strength normalized by the blade tip velocity. These iso-surfaces mark the location of toroidal vortices within the stirred tank, and their manifestation as a result of rotational energy addition arising from turbine blade passage.",

With recent technological advancements in AmI and Ubiquitous Computing, the benefits of recommender systems can be enjoyed not only in e-commerce, but in the physical store scenario as well. However, developing effective context-aware recommender systems by non-expert practitioners is not an easy task due to the complexity of building the necessary data models and selecting and configuring recommendation algorithms. In this paper we apply the Model Driven Development paradigm on the physical commerce recommendation domain by defining a UbiCARS Domain Specific Modelling Language, a modelling editor and a system, that aim to reduce complexity, abstract the technical details and expedite the development and application of State-of-the-Art recommender systems in ubiquitous environments (physical retail stores), as well as to enable practitioners to utilize additional data resulting from ubiquitous user-product interaction in the recommendation process to improve recommendation accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "When voltage is applied between two electrodes situated in close proximity to each other (10\u2013100 \u03bcm), a weakly ionized, low temperature plasma discharge can be generated. This in turn creates a plasma sheath, an electrically ionized boundary layer (typically of the order of 10\u2019s to 100\u2019s of microns), where space charge effects dominate. The sheath acts like a virtual capacitor, with the plasma behaving as an inductor. Aerodynamic effects influence the plasma morphology (shape, thickness), thus making the plasma the transduction mechanism. The attraction to the use of plasma discharge as a transduction method for fluid flow property measurement stem from the fact that it lends itself to a probe implementation that is simple in design, can be miniaturized, and at the same time offers unmatched capability for handling ultra-high temperature environments.

The sensor utilizes a focused ultrasound approach to non-intrusively detect the ablative material's surface loss while simultaneously correcting for acoustic velocity dependencies on temperature. The latter correction is done via a closed loop feedback approach. The multi-source focusing approach is atypical of current ultrasound based sensors used for ablation recession rate measurement, which require a-priori knowledge of temperature distribution within the ablative to yield accurate data on recession rate.

Larger scale ejector-based propulsion systems that operate a rocket ejector cycle have been constructed and operated in the past, dating back to the 1960s. Only very recently this same ejector system has been scaled down to the micro-size domain for use in applications other than propulsion, more specifically as a way of entraining and mixing fuel and air for use in micro-combustor applications.

The main aspect examined is the use of smaller subsystems\u2014components in an integrated DSS, with emphasis on two application areas: medical home unit monitoring and real-time prioritisation of the alerts generated by them, and drug interaction checking. The paper suggests the development of an integrated hybrid telecare DSS synthesizing most of the technologies reviewed. Implementation issues are also examined, with an emphasis on the international trend towards the development of platform-independent, component-based, distributed software.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, computers and the Internet have become useful tools, supporting important parts of people\u2019s lives such as work, education and entertainment. However, there are certain risks involved in using ICT technologies, most of which ICT users, whether professionals or not, are not aware of. Regardless the achieved high level of security, computers, networks and mobile devices always involve the human factor which remains an important vulnerability. In this work we present a 3D Virtual World Learning Environment (3DVWLE) that aims to aid towards the development of information security awareness culture to four different target groups: pupils, university students, teachers-professors and enterprise staff. The 3DVWLE simulates a number of real-life information security threat scenarios, enabling users, through their interaction within the virtual world, to experience the risks, be educated about them and combine skills and knowledge to overcome them, without exposing themselves, their data or their organization to real risk. In this paper we provide information on the information security threat scenarios, the design and development of the 3DVWLE as well as the reasoning mechanism that enhances the user experience. Finally, we present early results on user testing and evaluation.",

Transport of both water droplets and aerosol particles was characterized upstream and downstream of these obstacles.

Although a number of architectures and techniques have been proposed and developed for improving the availability and upgradeability of traditional distributed systems, not many of them are directly applicable to Web service-based architectures. Recently, Web services have become the most popular paradigm for business-to-business and enterprise application integration architectures, which makes their availability increasingly important.

Coordination programming enjoys a number of advantages such as the ability to express different software architectures and abstract interaction protocols, support for multi-linguality, reusability and programming-in-the-large, etc. Configuration programming is another promising approach in developing large scale, component-based systems, with the increasing need for supporting the dynamic evolution of components. In this paper we explore and exploit the relationship between the notions of coordination and (dynamic) configuration and we illustrate the potential of control- or event-driven coordination languages to be used as languages for expressing dynamically reconfigurable software architectures.

            "Abstract": "The focus of this effort is to investigate the dispersal of liquid fire suppression agents around solid obstacles, and obtain a better understanding of the physical processes of droplet transport in cluttered spaces. An experimental investigation is presented to examine the flow field dynamics of highly turbulent flow over obstacles, and spray transport in such flow fields. The obstacles of interest were a cylinder and body-centered cube (BCC) arrangement of spheres. Transport of both water droplets and seed particles was characterized upstream and downstream of these obstacles using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Data were recorded for the cylinder at ambient temperature and after being heated to 423 K to estimate the effects of the hot cylinder surface on droplet transport. The results indicate that smaller droplets are entrained into the recirculation region behind the cylinder while the larger droplets impact the cylinder surface, accumulate, and drip off, or disperse radially away from the surface regardless of their interaction with the cylinder. The flow over the heated cylinder indicates the formation of layer of vaporizing liquid on the downstream side of the cylinder in the shear region between the recirculation zone and free stream. In addition, surface cooling that resulted from spray impingement was around 50% of the preset cylinder temperature. For the BCC (with a blockage ratio of about 64%), there is both transport of droplets and seed particles around and through the BCC, as well as significantly more liquid accumulation and dripping than for the cylinder.",

A linear relationship is realized for the laminar regime, while a nonlinear relationship is realized for the turbulent regime. Both relationships incorporate mass-flow profile characteristics to capture the effects of initial conditions (mean flow and turbulence) on the variation of the characteristic variable.

The results show that LDI-integrated pressure is consistent with COMSOL single-point predictions, and that standard deviations range from  up to , so that LDI can be used as a benchmark for the design optimization process of these emitters.

The various scenarios have been designed by secondary school teachers (with the help of the project\u2019s domain experts) baring in mind the corresponding diverse cultural and educational backgrounds of the school environments they would be implemented in. All scenarios were supported by relevant electronic resources, material, or in other words content that was either developed from scratch, or adapted from existing sample resources.There were two consecutive e-learning scenario implementation phases in the project. After both implementation phases, the teachers were asked to complete questionnaires in order to capture facts on the one hand and their personal beliefs on the other. Therefore, this paper constitutes a study of the entire content development process within the course of UNITE, presents a summary of the guidelines that were given to the participating teachers and examines the results of the process separately in the two scenario implementation phases, comparing the two, presenting findings and drawing conclusions. Special emphasis is placed on the factors that might have influenced the teacher\u2019s performance in content development.",

To resolve this issue we propose the use of the COIN platform, which allows exposure, combination and integration of Web Services to support these aspects in different business sectors. Suitable COIN collaboration and interoperability services were selected based on the requirements analysis performed with Donnelly Tanker Management, our industrial partner in Cyprus. These services adhere to requirements of the shipping sector, such as negotiation of voyage terms, trusted information sharing, document management and user management. Using COIN, a web-based enterprise system was created that supported two case studies. Useful results were obtained by marine experts, which revealed \u2026",

Our work investigates how the predictability of video sharing is associated with the underlying social network of the initial sharer of the video and the context of the media platform it was uploaded. In particular we combine user-centric data from Twitter with video-centric data from YouTube to give insights that neither dataset (social network and media service dataset) individually gives. We propose a simple model to predict future popularity of a video resource with a small and easily extracted feature set, based on the notion of influence score of a user and its fluctuation through time, as well as the distance of content interests among users of both datasets. We further demonstrate how the incorporation of our prediction model into a mechanism for content delivery results in considerable \u2026",

These devices are expected to seamlessly monitor context changes and adapt their behavior and functionality to maximize the user benefit. However, designing the self-adaptive logic of such systems is far from trivial. This paper discusses a utility function-based approach for specifying the adaptive behavior of component-based context-aware systems. Although this approach allows for completely autonomous self-adaptive behavior, it also leverages potential user feedback by adjusting and optimizing its behavior. It is argued that this approach provides significant improvement to the adaptive behavior of a system while maintaining the required user attention to a minimum. At the same time, it keeps the \u2026",

A new methodology performing a certain form of requirements identification and collection prior to developing new software components is proposed and demonstrated, the essence of which lays on a three-entity model that describes the relationship between different types of component stakeholders: Developers, reusers and end-users. The model is supported by a set of critical factors analysed in the context of three main directions that orient the production of a new component, that is, the generality of the services offered, the management approach and the characteristics of the targeted market. The investigation of the three directions produces critical success factors that are closely connected and interdependent. Further analysis of the significance of each factor according to the priorities set by component developers can provide a detail picture of potential management implications during the development process and more importantly can support management decisions related to if and how development should proceed.",

This shift towards abstraction aims to reduce the effort and time required by developers to create software services. It is also a strong indicator of reduced development costs and a direct measure of a positive impact on software productivity. Current trends in software engineering attempt to raise further the abstraction level by introducing modelling languages as the key components of the development process. In particular, modelling languages support the design of software services in the form of domain models. These models become the main development artefacts, which are then transformed using code generators to the required implementation. The major predicament with model-driven techniques is the complexity imposed when manually developing the domain \u2026",

Integration of the streamwise component over the cross-sectional area of the pipe gave the instantaneous flow rate through the pipe.

A software circuit for computing the location off of which the ultrasonic waves scattered to focus back at the microphone is also included, so that the recession rate of the heat shield ablative may be monitored in real-time through the scan-focus approach.",

This paper examines the problem of autonomic reasoning for adapting context-aware applications in mobile and pervasive computing environments. In this type of systems, both the context and the adaptation possibilities must be modeled appropriately to enable the adaptation reasoning engine to infer decisions on which adaptations to perform. It is assumed that multiple cross-cutting concerns affect such decisions, and thus we introduce a multi-dimensional, utility-based model which attempts to simulate the user's reasoning mechanisms. The proposed model is applied to component-based mobile and pervasive applications, and is being evaluated through a detailed scenario. It is argued that the proposed model provides a novel and promising approach for designing \u2026",

The platform aims to support experts in providing the best guidance and advice on a nutrition and fitness plan.

To this end, the present experimental investigation examines the flow field dynamics of grid-generated homogeneous turbulent flow over obstacles, and spray transport in such flow fields. Transport of both water droplets and aerosol particles was characterized upstream and downstream of a cylinder using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Data were obtained for the cylinder at ambient temperature and after being heated to 423 K to estimate the effects of the hot cylinder surface on droplet transport. The results indicate that smaller droplets are entrained into the recirculation region behind the cylinder while the larger droplets impact the cylinder surface, accumulate and drip off, or disperse away from the surface.

Coordination programming helps to separate concerns, making complex coordination protocols into standalone entities; permitting separate development, verification, maintenance, and reuse. The IWIM coordination model is described, and a formal automata theoretic version of the model is developed, capturing the essentials of the framework in a fibration based approach. Specifically, families of worker automata have their communication governed by a state of a manager automaton, whose transitions correspond to reconfigurations. To capture the generality of processes in IWIM systems, the construction is generalised so that process automata can display both manager and worker traits.

Much of the flow coefficient data at conditions of interest to inlet designers is based on bleed plates with multiple rows of holes. The flow coefficient for these plates is typically presented as a function of bleed plenum pressure normalized by the freestream total pressure. Numerical simulations of the flowfield at the entrance of the bleed hole show that the flow is complex, especially for supersonic free stream flow, whereby an alternating expansion/compression wave pattern initiates at the porous bleed surface as the flow turns to enter the hole. This implies that a significant portion of the tangential flow total pressure is given up upon entering a 90\u00b0 hole.For large aspect ratio (length-to-diameter ratio) bleed holes the effect \u2026",

No matter how much expertise is put into securing information assets and networks (eg firewalls, encryption) the human factor always remains a vulnerability. Our vision is to aid towards the development of information security awareness culture by using a 3D Virtual World Learning Environment that will simulate real-life security threat scenarios, examples and counterexamples in a way that different groups of users will experience the risks and combine critical skills, knowledge and collaboration to overcome them, without exposing their organization to real risk.

Identical flames have been studied extensively in the past in order to characterize the effects of the vortical structures responsible for the flicker on the flame structure, but the initial velocity perturbation and the velocity fields have not been reported previously. Phase-locked measurements of the instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field at ten phases within a full excitation cycle were made using particle image velocimetry. The velocity measurements were complemented by phase-resolved shadowgraphs recorded in the vicinity of the flame base. Measurements are reported for the two forcing conditions that have most often been studied for this burner. When integrated with the results of previous studies, these measurements provide a clearer picture of the interactions between the buoyancy-induced vortical structures and the flame sheets, as well as, providing an understanding of the initial conditions required for realistic modeling of these flames.",

A CMOS camera recorded the DPIV images at sampling rate of 10 KHz. Advanced image processing techniques were employed to identify the droplets and individually resolve their velocity using a hybrid cross-correlation particle-tracking algorithm. Subsequently, the size distribution of each droplet was quantified using geometric optics theory to convert the droplet image information to the true droplet size.

            "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the effects of two diets differing in n-6:n-3 ratio and prepartal feeding regime on gene expression of PPAR\u03b31a/1b, PPAR\u03b31c/1d, PPAR\u03b32, PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1A (PPARGC1A), GLUT4, TNF\u03b1, adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor (LEPR), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in sows' white adipose tissue on the first day of lactation. The relationship between mRNA expression of these genes and circulating insulin, leptin and thyroid hormones was also considered. Diets contained a low (supplemented with fish oil; f group) or a high (supplemented with sunflower oil; s group) n-6:n-3 ratio and were provided from 8 (f8, s8) or 3 d (f3, s3) before parturition (onset day 8 or 3). A low n-6:n-3 ratio reduced the 1 d postpartum expression of PPAR\u03b32 and PPARGC1A but only when applied from 3 d before parturition. Circulating leptin was negatively correlated with mRNA \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The development and evaluation of a small scale plasma driven shock tube is described in the current paper as a new tool for sensor characterization in a dynamic flow environment. The shock tube is made of quartz glass and for the experiments presented here, operates with air as the medium. The main shock wave is generated at one end of the tube by a coaxial plasma discharge. The wave travels more than 60 tube diameters reaching the test section at a speed of about 426 m/sec. Control over the maximum pressure increase across the shock wave is demonstrated in a closed circuit by simply changing the pressure of the gas within the shock tube from the standard atmospheric conditions to about 0.75 atm, or by physical expansion in a nozzle exhausting in standard air. A maximum pressure increase of about 40 kPa within the first 25 \u03bcsec of the event, and with a repetition rates of up to 0.8 Hz, is demonstrated \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the framework of the FP6 project UNITE a number of e-Learning scenarios have been developed, covering different educational contexts, pedagogical concepts and subjects (environmental education, ICT, language learning, etc.), bridging thus the gap between formal and informal learning settings. All e-Learning scenarios have taken into consideration the diverse cultural and educational backgrounds of the school environments they would be implemented in.The scenarios follow a constructivist approach and promote the inductive and deductive way of learning, as pupils are encouraged to categorize, test structures and apply the knowledge obtained to new situations. These scenarios promote and support problem-based learning, where pupils can be creative, learn how to combine knowledge from different thematic areas, can think critically, analytically, and learn how to solve real problems. Besides pedagogy, scenarios highlight the strengths of UNITE platform itself enabling both inschool and out-of-school activities (also through m-learning).",

Meeting this requirement, however, is often challenged by transducer size constraints, integration at the location of measurement, and packaging, especially when one considers applications in harsh environments where protection of the sensing element may be needed. As part of an effort towards the development of a high frequency pressure measurement device for use in harsh environments (ultra-high temperature), an investigation was performed to evaluate the effect of sensing element packaging and geometry at the point of measurement on the dynamic response of a nominal transducer. Frequency and time domain calculations were performed to assess variations on the magnitude and phase between an input signal and a \u201cmeasured\u201d signal at the \u2026",

We study the hybridization of MOEA/D with a pool of six general-purpose heuristics so as to locally optimize the solutions during the evolution. We initially consider the six individualistic hybrid MOEA/D's, in which at every step of the evolution the same local search heuristic from the generic pool is applied. MOEA/D is then enriched with a learning strategy that, based on the problem's properties and objective functions, adaptively selects at each step of the evolution and for each problem neighbourhood the best performing local search heuristic from the generic pool of heuristics. The proposed method is evaluated on various test instances of a multi-objective \u2026",

The main contribution of this approach is the combination of a development methodology with the middleware architecture, which together bring significant value to developers of context-aware applications. Further contributions include the following: The methodology utilizes separation of concerns, thus decreasing the developmental cost and improving the productivity.

Therefore, the development of computational methods for the enhancement of creativity is undoubtedly a challenge. In this paper we argue that adding context awareness in creativity support tools will enhance the creativity process. This belief is based on the evaluation of a number of the most popular creativity support tools in relation to the features and characteristics they support. In this review, we examine the characteristics related to the interaction between the user and the creativity support tools in two phases: the \u2018preparation\u2019 of creativity process and the \u2018ideation\u2019 phase. Through this analysis we observe that the tools in most cases play a passive role.

Unlike the previous work, this study considers the AOP paradigm for solving real-life problems, which can be faced in any commercial software.

            "Abstract": "Phase-resolved PIV measurements were performed to reveal the detailed flow features within a triple impeller stirredtank. Two tests were performed: low and high rotational speeds, 175 and 575 RPM, respectively. The tests used an optically transparent mixing vessel to measure the 2D flow field characteristics along a vertical plane passing through the tank center. The measurements disclosed interesting in-plane vortical behavior that when measured at two angular positions with respect to the blade passage further indicated the threedimensional flow behavior. For the low RPM case, a laminar flow nature was apparent, whereby vortical toroidal structures spanned around the stirrer vertical axis. Six such structures were dominant. For the high RPM case and for \u03b8= 0o, the case when the blade is parallel to the laser sheet, six dominant vortical structures were apparent. Their rz plane location and size were different from that for the low RPM case. With blade passage four of these vortical structures appeared to merge into two, suggesting that constant toroidal vortical structures spanning around the stirrer axis were absent from the high RPM case. A switch between six distinct and four distinct in-plane vortical structures as the blades pass through the measurement plane further suggested a transitional flow field at 575 RPM.",

In order to make the application of the OOLO feasible and efficient, an OOLO model needs to be developed based on Object-Oriented (OO) concepts. A sample OOLO model of inheritance is used to demonstrate the application of such Learning Objects (LOs) to a learning scenario. The benefits of this model are quantified in terms of savings on the number of new LOs that need to be developed and savings on metadata entry. Additionally, benefits extend to the quality of new LOs due to the automatic application of standards and the increased compatibility among LOs (due to inheritance) and the increased extendibility and functionality of LOs due to the OO characteristic of method \u2026",

Coordination programming helps to separate concerns, making complex coordination protocols into standalone entities; permitting separate development, verification, maintenance, and reuse. The IWIM coordination model is described, and a formal automata theoretic version of the model is developed, capturing the essentials of the framework in a fibration based approach. Specifically, families of worker automata have their communication governed by a state of a manager automaton, whose transitions correspond to reconfigurations. To capture the generality of processes in IWIM systems, the construction is generalised so that process automata can display both manager and worker traits. IWIM systems possess a large number of algebraic properties, a range of which are described. The relationship with other formalisations of the IWIM conception of the coordination principle is explored.",

It is then the duty of a pharmacist to dispense the medication based on this prescription and advise the patient on how it should be taken. In practice this process is much more complex as GP's must not only diagnose and prescribe, but must also consider the patient's profile in terms of possible allergies to certain medications and how the new prescription will interact with other treatments that may already have been prescribed.

This category of applications focuses particularly on the issues of managing distributed units on remote end-systems. Such applications contain remote and administrative units that are connected and exchange data and control messages. In the analysis of our framework, we used UML for the specification, analysis and presentation of system operations. The distributed units of our framework are using XML messages and TCP channels for exchanging data and control messages. We implement a communication \u201cprotocol\u201d that contains the basic messages that can be used in Tele-Control Systems.

Phase-locked measurements of the instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field at ten phases within a full excitation cycle were made using particle image velocimetry. The velocity measurements were complemented by phase-resolved shadowgraphs recorded in the vicinity of the flame base. Measurements are reported for the two forcing conditions that have most often been studied for this burner. When integrated with the results of previous studies, these measurements provide a clearer picture of the interactions between the buoyancy-induced vortical structures and the flame sheets, as well as, providing an understanding of the initial conditions required for realistic modeling of these flames.",

            "Abstract": "Most context-aware recommender systems in the literature that use context modelling have the tendency to develop domain and application specific context models that limit, even eliminate any reuse and sharing capabilities. Developers and researchers in the field struggle to design their own context models without having a good understanding of context and without using any reference models for guidance, often resulting in overspecialized, inefficient or incomplete context models. In this work we build upon prior work to propose an enhanced online context modelling system for Context-Aware Recommender Systems. The system supports CARS developers in the process of building their own context models from scratch, while it supports at the same time sharing and reuse of the models among developers. The system was tested in a real scenario with positive results, as it was able to support context model development with instructions to the developer, model comparison, useful statistics, recommendations of similar models, as well as alternative views of context models to aid the developer in her task.",

We propose a two-level architecture of a hierarchical workflow management system modelled and developed in such a state-of-the-art coordination language. The main advantage of a hierarchical, coordination-based architecture is that individual workflow entities can be easily replaced with others, without disrupting the overall workflow process. Each individual workflow entity exhibits a certain degree of flexibility and autonomy. This makes possible the construction of workflow systems that bring further improvements to process automation and dynamic management, such as dynamic (re-) allocation of activities to actors, reusability of coordination (collaboration) patterns, etc. A case study is presented to demonstrate the \u2026",

The communication and coordination of components lying over a distributed address space has been dealt so far with stream or datagram connections created and controlled by the participating calculation and coordination components. Web services can take advantage of the Reo channel system that separates communication from computation concerns using components that have independent sink and source ports that can be attached to Web Services components, thus overcoming the problem of compatibility in distributed systems.

Software adaptation is not a new term though; it has been extensively researched in several domains and in numerous forms. This has resulted in several interpretations of adaptation. This survey aims to provide a disambiguation of the term, as it is understood in ubiquitous computing, and a critical evaluation of existing software adaptation approaches.

POI recommender systems can be utilized in a variety of mobile and web applications for tourism, touristic websites, travel agency systems, etc., aiming not only to increase customer satisfaction and improve user experience while interacting with these applications but to eventually increase business revenue as well. In this respect, tourism businesses can directly benefit from developing and deploying recommender systems in their platforms. However, developing effective recommender systems by non-recommender system experts, such as Tourism practitioners and web developers, is not an easy task due to the complexity of building data models and selecting and configuring recommendation algorithms. In this paper, the \u201cUbiquitous Recommender Systems for Tourism\u201d(UbiRS4Tourism) Model Driven Framework for the POI for tourism recommendation domain is proposed. The UbiRS4Tourism Framework utilizes a model driven methodology and defines a novel graphical Domain Specific Modelling Language, aiming to reduce the complexity and expedite the development of POI recommender systems for tourism by practitioners/developers with no expertise and background in recommender systems.",

The probe's principle and design makes it suitable for microgravity fluid mechanics and combustion research. The measurement technique is based on the collection and direct heterodyning of coherent light scattered from particles in two adjacent locations allowing the determination of a velocity gradient. The beat frequency of the heterodyned light gives the difference in the Doppler shift and is proportional to the velocity difference of two points. This frequency is analyzed using a conventional laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) signal processor. The angle between the laser beam and the direction of the scattered light determines the measured component of velocity. Therefore, a component of the vorticity vector is measured by using two sets of transmitting and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "According to [4], the term \u2018\u2018coordination\u2019\u2019basically means the management of the interaction among the entities of a system\u2014whether they are agents, processes, molecules, individuals, or whatever. Generally speaking, the notion of coordination is a multi-disciplinary one, and has been given several specific definitions in the many research areas where it is relevant and commonly used, such as Programming Languages, Parallel and Distributed Information Systems,(Distributed) Artificial Intelligence, Internet Technologies and Software Engineering. One of the fundamental characteristics in \u2018\u2018coordination programming\u2019\u2019is the separation of concerns between what is being computed and how the entities that comprise a system of computational units forming an application interact with each other. Thus, a coordination framework comprises three fundamental elements:\u2022 the coordinables, ie, the entities whose mutual interaction is ruled by a coordination model;\u2022 the coordination media, ie, the abstractions enabling the interaction among coordinables (eg, channels, blackboards, etc.);\u2022 the coordination laws, defining the behavior of the coordination media in response to interaction events.This separation of concerns leads to a natural simplification process for the development of large scale complex systems. More to the point, the coordination paradigm enables the development of a coordinable independently from the application within which it will be incorporated, but also from any other coordinables. Coordinables can be developed with the aim of being independent and reusable computational units which will be assembled together with other similar \u2026",

To achieve these concerns while at the same time using a minimal amount or resources, real-time embedded systems use different techniques such as task scheduling, resource management and task synchronization. These techniques involve a number of the modules of the system which makes the use of Aspect-Oriented Software Development imperative. AOSD is a programming technique which uses the notion of join points to capture specific locations in code execution and then use advices to insert new code. This paper examines existing work in the development of schedulers, resource allocation agents and synchronization techniques using Aspect-Oriented Software Development in real-time embedded systems. An analysis of the existing research is used to describe the advantages of using AOSD over conventional OOP methods and to identify areas where further research may be required. 1",

            "Abstract": "Mobile computing is an innovative field gaining increasing attention as many new systems are designed towards that direction. Among these systems, many are desired to be context-aware, with the aim of optimizing and automating their offered services. Such systems provide components whose main feature is to manage the context information, which is communicated between sensors, actuators and applications. In these systems the use of middleware is a solution to the need for detecting and adapting to the changing context. In mobile computing, factors such as scalability, support for distribution, self-adaptivity, support for mobility and modularity/plugability are of particular interest. Many attempts have been documented in the literature concerning systems aiming to address some or all of these requirements and which are used for the implementation of context-aware systems.

Phase-locked measurements of the instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field at ten phases within a full excitation cycle were made using particle image velocimetry. The velocity measurements were complemented by phase-resolved shadowgraphs recorded in the vicinity of the flame base.

Both experimental velocity measurements and two- and three-dimensional simulations for the flow along the centerplane of the rectangular duct are presented for Reynolds numbers in the range of 150 to 600. Comparison of the two-dimensional simulations with the experiments revealed that the simulations failed to capture completely the total expansion effect on the flow, which is influenced by both geometric and hydrodynamic effects. To properly do so requires the definition of an effective expansion ratio, which is the ratio of the downstream and upstream hydraulic diameters and is therefore a function of both the expansion and aspect ratios.

Several tests were performed for rotational speeds ranging from 175 RPM to 1575 RPM. The working fluid was glycerin at ambient conditions. Time averaged results over several blade passage cycles reveal that the vortical toroidal structure and frequency changes significantly over the RPM range investigated.

This paper describes our experience with first designing and implementing a basic context management system, and then with extending it to allow context distribution. In the proposed architecture, the developers define the context dependencies for their software independently of the availability of context information in their corresponding devices.

The current effort considers a typical power electronic module most often used to address DC to AC voltage conversion in larger distributed energy systems. Significant heat generation results from switching and conduction losses inherent in such a circuit, which can then cause a drop in the power processing capabilities or worse, the destruction of the device itself if not properly cooled.

The analysis yields a functional relationship between the characteristic variable of the flow region and the Reynolds number for each of the two independent flow regimes. A linear relationship is realized for the laminar regime, while a nonlinear relationship is realized for the turbulent regime. Both relationships incorporate mass-flow profile characteristics to fully capture the effects of initial conditions on the variation of the characteristic variables. The union of these two independent relationships is formed utilizing the concept of flow intermittency to further expand into a generic scaling relationship that incorporates transitional flow effects to fully encompass solutions spanning the laminar to turbulent flow regimes.

Open Source solutions provide the means whereby educational institutions, students, businesses and foundations can all collaborate to resolve authentic business problems. Not only Open Software provides the necessary shared infrastructure and collaborative practice, the foundations that manage the software are also hubs, which channel the operational challenges of their users through to the people who can solve them. This has great potential for enabling students and supervisors to collaborate in resolving the problems of businesses, but is constrained by the lack of support for managing and promoting collaboration across the two sectors. VALS should 1) provide the methods, practice, documentation and infrastructure to unlock this potential through virtual placements in businesses and other public and private bodies; and 2) pilot and promote these as the \u201cSemester of Code\u201d. To achieve its goals the project develops guidance for educational institutions, and for businesses and foundations, detailing the opportunities and the benefits to be gained from the Semester of Code, and the changes to organisation and practice required. A Virtual Placement System is going to be developed, adapting Apache Melange, and extending it where necessary.

To achieve timeliness and conform to the criticality issues of various processes while at the same time using a minimal amount or resources, real-time embedded systems use different techniques such as task scheduling, resource management and task synchronization. All of these techniques involve a number of the modules of the system which makes the use of Aspect-Oriented Software Development imperative. AOSD is a programming technique which uses the notion of join points to capture specific locations in code execution and then use advices to insert new code.

Air stream velocities inside the mouthpiece were determined from correlated image-pairs of smoke particles, introduced around the modeled inhaler and drawn into the mouthpiece. On the other hand, to investigate the dispersion mechanism, lactose particles (the excipient) were replaced by fluorescent particles that had a similar mean aerodynamic diameter, so that differentiation from the Mie scattering signal of the drug particles could be made by using high-pass and band-pass color \u2026",

Data were recorded for the cylinder at ambient temperature and after being heated to 423 K to estimate the effects of the hot cylinder surface on droplet transport. The results indicate that smaller droplets are entrained into the recirculation region behind the cylinder while the larger droplets impact the cylinder surface, accumulate and drip off, and/or rebound off the surface and disperse radially outward into the free stream. The Weber number was too low to lead to droplet shattering. Significant cooling of the cylinder surface from the initial preset temperature, which resulted from spray \u2026",

Integration of this velocity field is shown to yield the relative change in the refractive index. The technique is applied to an axisymmetric diffusion flame that is acoustically forced. Using appropriate corrections for the circularity of the flame, the shadow image velocity field is integrated to yield the temperature field. The absolute temperature field is compared to previous measurements made in the same flame using thin filament pyrometry.

Context modelling is a basic procedure towards this direction since it models the contextual parameters to be used during the recommendation process. Most literature works however build domain specific contextual models that only represent information of a particular domain, excluding the possibility of model sharing and reuse among other CARS. In this paper we focus on this issue and study whether a more generic modelling approach can be applied for CARS. We discuss a possible solution and show through literature review on relevant systems that the proposed solution has not yet been applied. Next, we present a novel generic contextual modelling framework for CARS, discuss its advantages and evaluate it.",

A Fabry-Perot and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer are used to diagnose dynamically a high temperature turbulent jet flow and, respectively, a Mach 1.6 supersonic flow with shock waves. Imaged interferograms are correlated using PIV methodology to obtain two-dimensional velocity and density maps. The I2V method provides good spatial resolution without the PIV requirements of seeding or the SIV requirement of calibrating, lending itself as a valuable tool for the study of turbulent, steady and unsteady phenomena in gas dynamics.",

Different research works have revealed that the realisation of a smart city and its smart services creates a complex, multi-layered, and multi-dimensional environment with multiple stakeholders. In these surveys, technology requirements have been defined and several platforms were examined, and in most cases reference architectures have been proposed. However, these surveys mostly focus on the technology, while city governance is not effectively addressed via the requirements defined. In this work, we claim that the main goal should be to support digital transformation using technologies for developing smart, creative, innovative, and sustainable cities. Thus, eight open source platforms have been analysed against a set of governance-based and technology-driven requirements \u2026",

One such sensor concept is a shear stress sensor that can operate over a high dynamic range, and at very high temperatures, with an application emphasis on ground and flight testing in supersonic and hypersonic flow. The application of this fundamental sensor element and capacitance sensing design to very high temperature and very high shear environment, however, brings another set of challenges that involve the associated packaging and electrical control scheme.

            "Abstract": "Modern trends in mobile computing have inspired a new paradigm for the development of adaptive applications and services. Because of the variability which characterizes the context of such environments, it is important that the software used is developed so that its extrafunctional behavior is adapted at runtime with the aim of dynamically optimizing the end user\u2019s experience. This chapter proposes a novel approach for the development of adaptive, mobile applications and services using the separation-of-concerns paradigm (Parnas 1972), as it was studied and designed by the Mobility and Adaptation Enabling Middleware (MADAM) project (MADAM Consortium). The proposed approach speci\ufb01es a set of steps for developing adaptive applications which can be automatically managed and dynamically adapted by an underlying middleware layer. Most notably, this approach treats the adaptive behavior of the corresponding application or service as a crosscutting concern in which the speci\ufb01cation can be separated from the implementation of its functional logic.In this approach, the applications are assumed to be composed of components and services which are systematically con\ufb01gured (and recon\ufb01gured) to o\u00a4 er the highest utility possible to the intended users. In this context, the utility refers to a broad term including both quality-of-service (QoS) metrics and nonquanti\ufb01able parameters which generally re\ufb02ect the extent to which the provided service meets the user needs. The components and services are composed into alternative architectures by means of varying port and service bindings which, as a result, provide di\u00a4 erent levels of utility to \u2026",

Such people are intended to use a clean/sterile room for a period of time while they might feel isolated because of their situation. In this period they cannot have any physical contact with other people, family and friends. For each person this period of time is a hard time to spend without the beloved ones. Moreover, before or after a medical intervention or an illness with possible sad outcome the psychical condition of the person is deplorable. These people, these situations need social connections, they need the family and friends, and they need the personal presence of beloved ones.

As an initial first step to engineering an AUV shape that can perform well in the riverine environment, one needs to better understand the fluid dynamics involved, both from a discrete, as well as, from a compounded point of view.

Particle image velocimetry results revealed a strong turbulent flow structure in the mouthpiece at all the flow rates tested, ranging from 15 lpm to 35 lpm. Strong counterclockwise rotating flow, as viewed from downstream, prevailed due to upstream tangential air injection introduced into the mouthpiece by 4 holes equally spaced along the perimeter.

FOCLASA\u201909 was held in Rhodes (Greece) on July 11th, 2009 as a satellite event of the 36th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming, ICALP 2009. The workshop provides a venue where researchers and practitioners could meet, exchange ideas, identify common problems, determine some of the key and fundamental issues related to coordination languages and software architectures, and explore together and disseminate solutions. Indeed, a number of hot research topics are currently sharing the common problem of combining concurrent, distributed, mobile and heterogeneous components, trying to harness the intrinsic complexity of the resulting systems. These include coordination, peer-topeer systems, grid computing, web services, multi-agent systems, and componentbased systems. Coordination languages and software architectures are recognized as fundamental approaches to tackle these issues, improving software productivity, enhancing maintainability, advocating modularity, promoting reusability, and leading to systems more tractable and more amenable to verification and global analysis. This year, we received eighteen submissions involving 46 authors from 4 continents (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and 16 different countries.

            "Abstract": "Modern mobile computing paradigms have set new challenges for the development of distributed mobile applications and services. Because of the variability which characterizes the context of such environments, it is important that mobile applications are developed so that they can dynamically adapt their extra-functional behavior, in order to optimize the experience perceived by their users. This paper proposes an approach for developing adaptive, mobile applications. It is argued that this approach eases the development effort by clearly separating the work required for the development of the application logic from that required for enabling its adaptive behavior. It is argued that in addition to mitigating the development complexity, this approach also enables a new generation of distributed applications. The novelty in the latter is that the applications can dynamically and collaboratively adapt in an ad-hoc manner \u2026",

More importantly, subjects in the most severe spectrum of this condition, namely critical limb ischemia (CLI) have been shown to be in an excessive risk for vascular death with a remarkably high mortality rate of 25% after only 1 year of follow-up (2). notably, only 45% of these subjects will be alive and without amputation after the same time period. It is therefore expected that these patients are usually compromised and present a high operative risk in case of an attempted revascularization procedure (2). on the other hand, endovascular techniques are frequently non-feasible due to various reasons, mainly unfavourable distribution of arterial lesions and/or severe renal impairment rendering \u2026",

However, no attempts have been made to facilitate the user in describing important situations through annotations and further on, to analyze the textual data provided in the annotations, in order to extract useful information and exploit this information for the benefit of others. We argue that these annotations could be proved critical, as long as the system exploits their content and the context.

A Fabry-Perot and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer are used to diagnose dynamically a high temperature turbulent jet flow and, respectively, a Mach 1.6 supersonic flow with shock waves. Imaged interferograms are correlated using PIV methodology to obtain two-dimensional velocity and density maps. The I\u2013V method provides good spatial resolution without the PIV requirements of seeding or the SIV requirement of calibrating, lending itself as a valuable tool for the study of turbulent, steady and unsteady phenomena in gas dynamics.",

Usually, for this task executions in virtual settings, called simulations, are used. The present article presents a simulator for applications developed to be executed on the Apache S4 distributed computing platform for multiple hardware and software scenarios. A version in which mobile devices as well as processing units are used is proposed. The results show that the simulator without mobile devices gets good prediction performance results considering the processing and communication times between the elements of the S4 applications, and the other version with mobile systems shows a decrease in performance in different simulation configurations. However, adding replication in the elements that are communicated with the cellphones has shown substantial improvements in the application's performance.\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

            "Abstract": "Science education is a crucial issue with long-term impacts for Europe as the low enrolment rates in the STEM-fields, including (natural) science, technology, engineering and mathematics, will lead to a workforce problem in research and development. In order to address this challenge, the EU-funded research project SciChallenge (project.scichallenge.eu) aims to find a new way for getting young people more interested in STEM. For this purpose, the project developed and implemented a social-media-based STEM-contest for young people, which aims at increasing the attractiveness of science education and careers among young people. In the first two parts, the paper reflects on the problem, introduces the project and highlights the main steps of the preparation of the contest. The third section of the paper presents the idea, design and implementation of the digital contest platform (www.scichallenge.eu), which serves as the core of the challenge. The fourth part of the paper will provide a status update on the contest pilot. It will provide a summary of the experiences that the consortium made with this novel approach as well as the main obstacles that the consortium was facing. The paper will conclude with a preliminary reflection on the question if such an approach can help to increase the interest of young people in STEM-education and careers.",

In this work we build upon prior work to propose an enhanced online context modelling system for Context-Aware Recommender Systems. The system supports CARS developers in the process of building their own context models from scratch, while it supports at the same time sharing and reuse of the models among developers. The system was tested with a real dataset with positive results, as it was able to support context \u2026",

To this end, the present experimental investigation examines the flow field dynamics of grid-generated homogeneous turbulent flow over obstacles, and spray transport in such flow fields. Transport of both water droplets and aerosol particles was characterized upstream and downstream of a cylinder using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Data were obtained for the cylinder at ambient temperature and after being heated to 423 K to estimate the effects of the hot cylinder surface on droplet transport. The results indicate that smaller droplets are entrained into the recirculation region behind the cylinder while the larger droplets impact the cylinder surface, accumulate and drip off, or are transported around the surface \u2026",

The initiation of a high energy plasma discharge at one end of a quartz tube generates a shock wave that travels the length of the tube. The rate of shock generation is governed by the discharge energy and can easily be several tens of pulses per minute, instead of several pulses per day as with traditional diaphragm-based shock tubes. There is no contamination with solid particles at the test location, and rise times of the order of microseconds can be achieved. The energy release is controllable resulting in robust and repeatable operation. Lastly, the overall footprint of the plasma driven shock tube is small and ideal for frequent laboratory bench top operation.",

This raises the expectations for user-customized and environment-aware services. However, mobile context-aware systems inherently feature characteristics of distribution and heterogeneity which pose great challenges to their developers. In this chapter, we focus on context distribution in mobile and ubiquitous computing environments. After describing the requirements in such environments, we propose a hybrid peer-to-peer based context distribution approach, which is built on top of the JXTA framework, a standard for peer-to-peer systems.

It is expected that the software works as intended, and that the software always and everywhere provides us with the best possible utility. This paper discusses the motivation, technical approach, and innovative results of the MUSIC project. MUSIC provides a comprehensive software development framework for applications that operate in ubiquitous and dynamic computing environments and adapt to context changes. Context is understood as any information about the user needs and operating environment which vary dynamically and have an impact on design choices. MUSIC supports several adaptation mechanisms and offers a model-driven application development approach supported by a sophisticated middleware that facilitates the dynamic and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to vectoring jet thrust using a miniature fluidic actuator that provided spatially distributed mass addition. The fluidic actuators used had no moving parts and produced oscillatory flow with a square wave form at frequencies up to 1\u00b76kHz. A subsonic jet with an exit diameter of 3\u00b781cm was controlled using single and dual fluidic actuators, each with an equivalent circular diameter of 1\u00b706mm. The fluidic nozzle was operated at pressures between 20\u00b768 and 165\u00b747kPa. The objectives of the present work included documentation of the actuation characteristics of fluidic devices, assessment of the effectiveness of fluidic devices for jet thrust vectoring, and evaluation of mass flow requirements for vectoring under various conditions. Measurements were made in the flow field using a pitot probe for the vectored and unvectored cases. Some acoustic measurements were made using \u2026",

Coordination programming helps to separate concerns, making complex coordination protocols into standalone entities; permitting separate development, verification, maintenance, and reuse. The IWIM coordination model is described, and a formal automata theoretic version of the model is developed, capturing the essentials of the framework in a fibration based approach. Specifically, families of worker automata have their communication governed by a state of a manager automaton, whose transitions correspond to reconfigurations. To capture the generality of processes in IWIM systems, the construction is generalised so that process automata can display both manager and worker traits. IWIM systems possess a large number of algebraic properties, a range of which are described. The relationship with other formalisations of the IWIM conception of the coordination principle is explored.",

An improved adaptive hybrid scheme that integrates the dynamically adaptive cross-correlation method with a particle tracking velocimetry algorithm is developed, presented and evaluated in this paper. A detailed description of the methodology, error analysis using Monte-Carlo simulations and elaborate comparisons with established schemes and robust commercial packages are presented. Improvements were guided towards increased accuracy for resolving vortical and poly-dispersed multi-phase flows. We introduce a novel iterative scheme that localizes the cross-correlation. We incorporate state of the art elaborate image processing techniques that allow increased particle densities. A new particle pairing method based on an adaptive cross-correlation masking is introduced. Finally, a refined gaussian estimation scheme that involves only four non-saturated pixels for the particle centroid detection is proposed. Overall, the dynamically adaptive hybrid velocity evaluation scheme presented here allows superior resolution of high velocity gradients, minimizes the loss of the rotational motion of the particles, and eliminates the spatial averaging effects inherent from the cross-correlation.",

This paper presents two context-aware applications, built on top of the MUSIC middleware's context management framework. By describing the development steps, we reveal how development is facilitated via Separation of Concerns and how code reuse is enabled in terms of reusable context plug-ins. It is argued that this approach reduces the required development and maintenance effort and thus lowers the associated cost.",

These reactive media undergo a phase change from solid to semi-solid as they pass through the combustion section of the engine under certain conditions characterized by size and mass. The phase change allows them to adhere to various turbine components including but not limited to stator vanes, rotor blades and shrouds.

In order to achieve higher levels of usability, mobile applications and services need to adapt to changes in context.

We claim that the traditional approach of simply providing contextual information to applications and let them handle the adaptation can be ineffective. We suggest a holistic approach where context management is an integral part of a more comprehensive adaptation enabling middleware.

This is one of the main reasons for the selection of a 3D VW platform for the development of an innovative and motivating tool under an umbrella of a V-ALERT project. The project aims to support the establishment of Information Security culture through providing awareness and facilitating learning process using the developed 3D Virtual World Learning Environment (VWLE). The provision of recommendations to users within 3D VWLE is a novel research field and to the best of our knowledge there are no publications in the field. This paper aims to provide an insight into the design and development of a context-aware recommendation in the V-ALERT 3D VWLE that considers available relevant information such as the context, user (learner) individual characteristics and user history to provide personalized content to assist the user during the learning activities. The paper also offers results of pilot usability evaluations which will be taken under consideration in the final, redesigned version of the 3D VWLE.",
