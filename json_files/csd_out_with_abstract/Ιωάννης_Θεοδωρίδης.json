            "Abstract": "Virtual Agents are autonomous embodied entities in virtual environments that look and behave like living organisms. They are usually equipped with sensors that read the state of the environment and effectors that apply actions on other entities. Believable agent behavior requires nonomniscience: each agent should contain its own representation of the environment based on its sensing abilities and its interaction history. However, the storage and maintenance of a multitude of different knowledge bases in a dynamic environment with a large number of agents raises memory and performance issues, as data is duplicated and a lot of calculations are repeated. This paper presents an architecture for multiagent virtual environments that is based on a spatiotemporal database, which maintains an abstract representation of the environment and the moving entities, and delivers all the sensory information required by the agents. The use of the spatiotemporal database enhances the agents\u2019 reasoning about the position and motion of other entities by providing a number of queries for spatiotemporal reasoning.",

In the near future, it is unavoidable that this explosion will contribute in what is called the Big Data era, raising high challenges for the data management research community. Instead of trying to manage bigger and bigger volumes of raw data, future Moving Object Database (MOD) systems need to extract and manage (the minimum necessary) semantics of movement. Such semantics can foster next-generation location-based services (LBS) and locationbased social networking (LBSN) applications, building more efficient and effective applications, while in parallel opening new research directions in the field of transportation, urban planning etc. In this article, we first present a \u2026",

The ease of producing a random sample depends on the available mechanism for accessing the elements of the dataset. Existing DBS algorithms perform sampling over flat files. In this paper, we develop a new method that exploits spatial indexes and the local density information they preserve, to provide good quality of sampling result and fast access to elements of the dataset. With the proposed method accurate density estimations can be produced with respect to factors like skew, noise or dimensionality. Moreover, significant improvement in sampling time is attained. The performance of the proposed method is examined analytically and experimentally. The comparative results illustrate its superiority over existing methods.",

It provides an ontological model for structuring and abstracting movement data in a multilevel hierarchy of progressively detailed movement segments that generalize concepts such as trajectories, stops, and moves. Baquara2 also includes a general customizable process to annotate movement data with concepts and objects described in ontologies and Linked Open Data (LOD) collections.

            "Abstract": "DEFINITION Linear Hashing is a dynamically updateable disk-based index structure which implements a hashing scheme and which grows or shrinks one bucket at a time. The index is used to support exact match queries, ie find the record with a given key. Compared with the B+-tree index which also supports exact match queries (in logarithmic number of I/Os), Linear Hashing has better expected query cost O (1) I/O. Compared with Extendible Hashing, Linear Hashing does not use a bucket directory, and when an overflow occurs it is not always the overflown bucket that is split. The name Linear Hashing is used because the number of buckets grows or shrinks in a linear fashion. Overflows are handled by creating a chain of pages under the overflown bucket. The hashing function changes dynamically and at any given instant there can be at most two hashing functions used by the scheme.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND A hash table is an in-memory data structure that associates keys with values. The primary operation it supports efficiently is a lookup: given a key, find the corresponding value. It works by transforming the key using a hash function into a hash, a number that is used as an index in an array to locate the desired location where the values should be. Multiple keys may be hashed to the same bucket, and all keys in a bucket should be searched upon a query. Hash tables are often used to implement associative arrays, sets and caches. Like arrays, hash tables have O (1) lookup cost on average.",

Further, we introduce two access methods this kind of data, namely the Spatio-Temporal R-tree (STR-tree) and the Trajectory-Bundle tree (TB-tree). The former is an R-tree based access method that considers the trajectory identity in the index as well, while the latter is a hybrid structure, which preserves trajectories as well as allows for R-tree typical range search in the data. We present performance studies that compare the two indices with the R-tree (appropriately modified, for a fair comparison) under a varying set of spatiotemporal queries, and we provide guidelines for a successful choice among them.",

Subsequently, we study several preprocessing techniques that aim to clean, transform, compress and partition long GPS traces into meaningful portions of movement. Finally, we overview some representative maritime knowledge discovery techniques, such as trajectory clustering, group behaviour identification, hot-spot analysis, frequent route or network discovery and data-driven predictive analytics methods.",

The results of data mining are known as patterns. Patterns can also be found in other scientific areas, such as biology, astronomy, mathematics etc. Today requirements impose the need for a system that efficiently manipulates complex and diverse patterns. In this work, we study the problem of the efficient representation and storage of patterns in a so-called pattern-base Management System. Towards this aim we examine three well known models from the database domain, the relational, the object-relational and the semi-structured (XML) model. The three alternative models are presented and compared based on criteria like generality, extensibility and querying effectiveness. The comparison shows that the semi-structure representation is more appropriate for a \u2026",

Based on the map, specific transport situations surrounding the congested areas are examined and ways of reducing congestion are suggested. The method is evaluated in the aggregated metropolitan area of Athens and Piraeus in Greece, and the potential and the effectiveness of this technique in analysing traffic are demonstrated. With more and more urban vehicles being equipped with GPS devices, the method can be easily transferable to other regions, paving the way for the adoption of the approach for an up-to-date, spatial-temporal \u2026",

Given the vital importance of maritime safety to the environment, the economy, and in national security, our system leverages the real-time acquisition of vessel activity with geographical and other static information. Thus, it can offer timely notification in emergency situations, such as intrusion into marine preservation areas, loitering, and unsafe sailing. Thanks to a mobility tracking module, evolving trajectories generated by massive positional updates can be compressed online into concise, but reliable synopses per ship, retaining only salient motion features within a sliding window. These features are exploited by a complex event recognition module that detects suspicious situations of interest to maritime authorities. We conducted a comprehensive empirical validation against a real dataset of traces collected from thousands of vessels. Our results confirm the scalability and approximation accuracy of the proposed system, and thus demonstrate its potential for effective, real-time maritime monitoring.",

A multi-stage hybrid approach is employed for a new variation of the core TP task, the so-called Future Semantic Trajectory Prediction, including clustering the enriched trajectory data using a semantic-aware similarity function as distance metric. Subsequently, a separate predictive model is trained for each cluster, using a nonuniform graph-based grid that is formed by the waypoints of each flight plan. In practice, flight plans constitute a constrained-based training of each \u2026",

The literature on NN query processing algorithms so far deals with either stationary or moving query points over static datasets or future (predicted) locations over a set of continuously moving points. With the increasing number of Mobile Location Services (MLS), the need for effective k-NN query processing over historical trajectory data has become the vehicle for data analysis, thus improving existing or even proposing new services. In this paper, we investigate mechanisms to perform NN search on R-tree-like structures storing historical information about moving object trajectories. The proposed (depth-first and best-first) algorithms vary with respect to the type of the query object (stationary or moving point) as well as the type of the query result (historical continuous or not), thus \u2026",

For query optimization purposes, analytical models are needed to estimate the processing cost of a specific query in order to evaluate alternative execution plans. In this paper, we combine techniques that have been used for the analysis of nearest neighbor and spatial join queries, and derive the performance cost (in terms of disk accesses) of K-CPQs using R-trees.

Current approaches group trajectories together by accounting only the degree of their similarity, ignoring at the same time the degree in which they are unrelated and more importantly the hesitancy introduced by the uncertainty. In this paper we study the effect of uncertainty on clustering TD, as well as the representation of the clusters and introduce a three-step approach to deal with this challenge. Firstly, we propose an intuitionistic point vector representation of trajectories that encompasses the underlying uncertainty and we introduce an effective distance metric to cope with uncertainty. At the second step, we devise CenTra, a novel algorithm which tackles the problem of discovering the Centroid Trajectory of a group of movements taking into advantage the local similarity between portions of trajectories. At the final step, we devise CenTR-I-FCM a variant of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm, appropriately modified in the context of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) theory, which embodies CenTra as its update procedure when producing the cluster centroids at each iteration. The experimental evaluation with real world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.",

For the many applications where cluster change is relevant, among them customer relationship management, fraud detection and marketing, it is also necessary to provide insights about the nature of change: Is a cluster corresponding to a group of customers simply disappearing or are its members migrating to other clusters? Is a new emerging cluster reflecting a new target group of customers or does it rather consist of existing customers whose preferences shift? To answer such questions, we propose the MONIC framework for modelling and tracking of cluster transitions. Our cluster transition model encompasses changes that involve more than one cluster, thus allowing for insights on cluster change in the whole clustering. Our transition tracking mechanism is not based on the topological properties of clusters, which are only available for some types of clustering, but on the contents of the underlying data stream. We present our first results on monitoring cluster transitions over the ACM digital library.",

An interesting and challenging query type over existentially uncertain data is the search of the Nearest Neighbor (NN), since the probability of a potential dataset object to be the NN of the query object depends on the locations and probabilities of other points in the same dataset. In this paper, following a statistical approach, we estimate the average number of the NNs required to answer probabilistic thresholding NN (PTNN) queries as function of the threshold t, allowing us to utilize existing approaches and propose a cost model for such queries. Based on the same statistical approach, we propose an efficient algorithm for PTNN queries over arbitrarily structured existentially uncertain spatial data. Our experimental study demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed techniques.",

A common approach to deal with huge data volumes is to reduce the available information to knowledge artifacts (i.e., clusters, rules, etc.), hereafter called patterns, through data processing methods (pattern recognition, data mining, knowledge extraction). Patterns reduce the number and size of the original information to manageable size while preserving as much as possible its hidden / interesting content. In order to efficiently and effectively deal with patterns, academic groups and industrial consortiums have recently devoted efforts towards modeling, storage, retrieval, analysis and manipulation of patterns with \u2026",

            "Abstract": "During the last decade, the domain of mobility data mining has emerged providing many effective methods for the discovery of intuitive patterns representing collective behavior of trajectories of moving objects. Although a few real-world trajectory datasets have been made available recently, these are not sufficient for experimentally evaluating the various proposals, therefore, researchers look to synthetic trajectory generators. This case is problematic because, on the one hand, real datasets are usually small, which compromises scalability experiments, and, on the other hand, synthetic dataset generators have not been designed to produce mobility pattern driven trajectories. Motivated by this observation, we present Hermoupolis, an effective generator of synthetic trajectories of moving objects that has the main objective that the resulting datasets support various types of mobility patterns (clusters, flocks \u2026",

The database of the tool is automatically updated from remote sources while existing possibilities allow the querying on different earthquakes parameters, the analysis of the data for extraction of useful information and the graphical representation of the results via maps, charts etc. In the present work, we extend SEISMO-SURFER to include macroseismic data collected by the Geodynamic Institute and filled in a relative database. More specifically, the seismic parameters of the strong earthquakes, stored into the SEISMO-SURFER database, are linked to the macroseismic intensities observed at different sites. Administrative information for each site, local surface geology, tectonic lines, damage photographs and detailed descriptions from newspapers are also included. University of Piraeus and Geodynamic Institute are working together to continuously update and develop SEISMO-SURFER, concerning the data included, the variety of parameters stored and the mining algorithms supported for exploiting knowledge.",

Then, we propose a method to deal with the model\u2019s calculation, by incorporating it in the execution of the compression algorithm. Our experimental study shows that this proposal introduces a small overhead in the execution of trajectory compression algorithms, and also verifies the results of the analysis, confirming that our model can be used to provide a good estimation of the effect of trajectory compression in spatiotemporal querying.",

This \u201cflood\u201d of patterns imposes new challenges regarding their management. Pattern comparison, which aims at evaluating how close to each other two patterns are, is one of these challenges resulting in a variety of applications. In this chapter we investigate issues regarding the pattern comparison problem and present an overview of the work performed so far in this domain. Due to heterogeneity of data mining patterns, we focus on the most popular pattern types, namely frequent itemsets and association rules, clusters and clusterings, and decision trees.Nowadays a large quantity of raw data is collected from different application domains (business, science, telecommunication, health care systems, etc.). According to Lyman and Varian (2003),\u201cThe world produces between 1 and 2 exabytes of unique information per year, which is roughly 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth\u201d. Due to their quantity and complexity, it is impossible for humans to thoroughly investigate these data collections directly. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) provide a solution to this problem by generating compact and rich semantics representations of raw data, called patterns (Rizzi et al, 2003). With roots in machine learning, statistics, and pattern recognition, KKD aims at extracting valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable",

As it usually happens in data management world, the challenge after storing the data is the implementation of appropriate analytics that could extract useful knowledge. However, traditional data warehousing systems and techniques were not designed for analyzing trajectory data. Thus, in this work, we investigate how the traditional data cube model is adapted to trajectory warehouses in order to transform raw location data into valuable information. In particular, we focus our research on three issues that are critical to trajectory data warehousing:(a) the trajectory reconstruction procedure that takes place in order to transform sampled location data originated eg from GPS recordings into trajectories and load them to a moving object database,(b) the ETL procedure that feeds a trajectory data warehouse, and (c) the aggregation of cube measures for OLAP purposes. We provide design solutions for all these issues and we test their applicability and efficiency in real world settings.",

The goal of this paper is to fill this gap by first presenting the next generation of location-based services and then, demonstrating their implementation which takes advantage of both modern commercial software and state-of-the-art spatial network and spatio-temporal databases techniques. Novel techniques are also proposed in fields non-thoroughly addressed by the research community, such as the prediction of future position of objects moving on a road network.",

To reduce its expansion, most governments decided to mitigate a great percentage of daily movements of their citizens. For instance, they enforced strict controls (in space, time, etc.) on urban movement whereas they selectively prohibited international air and ground connections. In this short study, we briefly discuss some lessons learned out of this process based on recorded mobility figures, and we raise challenges that are emerging in the post-pandemic era, in the intersection of the sustainable urban mobility and movement data science fields.",

Due to their importance, many techniques have been proposed in literature for indexing intervals. Here we concentrate on the 1-dimensional dynamic interval management problem and in particular the so-called stabbing query. We first present classical main-memory solutions to the stabbing query, namely: the Interval Tree, the Segment Tree and the Priority Search Tree. These structures have been extended in various ways to support intervals in external memory (i.e., on the disk). Among other structures in this chapter we discuss: the Segment R-tree, the External Segment Tree, the External Priority Search Tree, the Metablock \u2026",

On the other hand, an alternative strategy considers that data stays in-house to the hosting organization and privacy-preserving mobility data management systems are in charge of privacy-aware sharing of the mobility data.

In this paper, we study the problem of hot spot analysis for massive trajectory data of moving objects, which has many real-life applications in different domains, especially in the analysis of vast repositories of historical traces of spatio-temporal data (cars, vessels, aircrafts). In order to identify hot spots, we propose an approach that relies on the Getis-Ord statistic, which has been used successfully in the past for point data. Since trajectory data is more than just a collection of individual points, we formulate the problem of trajectory hot spot analysis, using the Getis-Ord statistic. We propose a parallel and scalable algorithm for this problem, called THS, which provides an exact solution and can operate on vast-sized data sets.

Despite an increase in traffic and national monitoring, ships formulate routes according to their best judgment risking an accident. In this study we take a dataset spanning in 3 years from the AIS (Automatic Identification System) network, which is transmitting in public a ship's identity and location with an interval of seconds, and we load it in a trajectory database supported by the Hermes Moving Objects Database (MOD) system. Presented analysis begins by extracting statistics for the dataset, both general (number of ships and position reports) as well as safety related ones. Simple queries on the dataset illustrate the capabilities of Hermes and allow to gain insight on how the ships move in the Greek Seas. Analysis of movement based on an Origin-Destination matrix between interesting areas in the Greek territory is presented. One of the newest challenges that emerged during this process is that the amount of the positioning data is becoming more and more massive. As a conclusion, a preliminary review of possible solutions to this challenge along with others such as dealing with the noise in AIS data is mentioned and we also briefly discuss the need for interdisciplinary cooperation.",

Particular focus is put on the underlying techniques; indexing, partitioning, query processing are essential for enabling efficient and scalable data management. In this way, this report serves as a useful guide of state-of-the-art methods and modern techniques for scalable mobility data management and analytics.",

In particular, we address two variants of the problem: (a) spatiotemporal sub-trajectory clustering and (b) index-based time-aware clustering at querying environment. Our approach for (a) relies on a two-phase process: a voting-and-segmentation phase followed by a sampling-and-clustering phase. Regarding (b), we organize data into partitions that correspond to groups of sub-trajectories, which are incrementally maintained in a hierarchical structure. Both approaches have been implemented in Hermes@PostgreSQL, a real Moving Object Database engine built on top of PostgreSQL, enabling users to perform progressive cluster analysis via simple SQL. The framework is also extended with a Visual Analytics (VA) tool to facilitate real world analysis.",

Especially nowadays, the need for performing advanced analytic operations over massively produced data, such as mobility traces, in efficient and scalable ways is imperative. However, discovering clusters of complete trajectories can overlook significant patterns that exist only for a small portion of their lifespan. In this paper, we address the problem of Distributed Subtrajectory Clustering in an efficient and highly scalable way. The problem is challenging because the subtrajectories to be clustered are not known in advance, but they need to be discovered dynamically based on adjacent subtrajectories in space and time. Towards this objective, we split the original problem to three sub-problems, namely Subtrajectory Join, Trajectory Segmentation and Clustering and Outlier Detection, and deal with each one in a distributed \u2026",

The proposed scheme involves block-based low-level feature extraction from images followed by the clustering of the feature space to form higher-level, semantically meaningful patterns. The clustering of the feature space is realized by an expectation-maximization algorithm that uses an iterative approach to automatically determine the number of clusters. Then, the 2-component property of PANDA is exploited: the similarity between two clusters is estimated as a function of the similarity of both their structures and the measure components.

            "Abstract": "The increasing opportunity of quickly collecting and cheaply storing large volumes of data, and the need for extracting concise information to be efficiently manipulated and intuitively analyzed, are posing new requirements for data management systems in both industrial and scientific applications. A usual approach to deal with such huge volume of data is to reduce the available data to knowledge artifacts (ie, clusters, rules, etc.), also called patterns, through data processing methods (pattern recognition, data mining, knowledge extraction) that reduce their number and size to make them manageable from humans while preserving as much as possible their hidden/interesting information. In order to efficiently and effectively deal with patterns, academic groups and industrial consortiums have devoted efforts towards the modeling, storage, retrieval, analysis and manipulation of patterns with results mainly in the area of standards, inductive databases and pattern-base management systems. Notably, two main lines of research have been pursued, by different research groups. The first line of research, focused around the notion of the Pattern-Base Management System (PBMS), has been pursued by the members of the European PANDA project [1]. In the PANDA approach, patterns are concise and rich in semantics representations of data. Patterns are differentiated from data: the former lie in the PBMS, where customized operations (eg, similarity checks) are to be applied, whereas the latter reside in traditional data stores. PANDA has come up with a generic model and languages for patterns [2, 3] as well as results for internal data representation in \u2026",

To efficiently support strict path queries, we present a novel NET work-constrained TRAjectory index (NETTRA).

Spatio-temporal Database Management Systems (STDBMS) are able to process, manage and analyze spatio-temporal data.

Such a collection of data types and their corresponding operations are defined, developed and provided as a data cartridge using the extensibility interface of Oracle10g. This paper presents HERMES Moving Data Cartridge (HERMES-MDC), the core component of STAU system architecture. HERMES-MDC integrates two other data cartridges, namely the TAU temporal data cartridge and Oracle\u2019s spatial data cartridge. It introduces time-varying geometries that change their position and/or extent in space and time dimension, either discretely or continuously. HERMES-MDC extends PL/SQL, the data definition and manipulation language of Oracle10g, with spatio-temporal semantics.

The second one is the non-incremental alternative, which returns the K elements of the result all together at the end of the algorithm. In this paper, based on distance functions between two MBRs in the multidimensional Euclidean space, we propose a pruning heuristic and two updating strategies for minimizing the pruning distance, and use them in the design of three non-incremental branch-and-bound algorithms for K-CPQ between spatial objects stored in two R-trees.

The objective of this paper is to review current research challenges and trends tied to the integration, management, analysis, and visualization of objects moving at sea as well as a few suggestions for a successful development of maritime forecasting and decision-support systems.",

For designing and testing novel data types and access methods that will support these applications, large spatiotemporal datasets are needed. As in many cases it is not possible to obtain real datasets, either they do not exist or they are not accessible, synthetic datasets are governed by artificial parameters rather than by the (sometimes invisible) rules governing real-world behavior. In this work, we show how, at least for some cases, one can generate spatiotemporal datasets that simulate real-world behavior. We illustrate example cases and translate them into appropriate calls of GSTD2 a spatiotemporal data generator. The generated data is illustrated using two-dimensional snapshot pictures as well as three-dimensional (two spatial plus one temporal dimension) trajectory images.",

In this chapter, we briefly present the basic characteristics of a spatial database and then describe in detail the major efforts on efficiently manipulating spatial data using specialized indexing structures and access methods.",

In the era of Big Data, the production of mobility data has become massive and, consequently, performing such an operation in a centralized way is not feasible. In this article, we address the problem of Distributed Subtrajectory Join processing by utilizing the MapReduce programming model. Compared to traditional trajectory join queries, this problem is even more challenging since the goal is to retrieve all the \u201cmaximal\u201d portions of trajectories that are \u201csimilar.\u201d We propose three solutions: (i) a well-designed basic solution, coined DTJb; (ii) a solution that uses a preprocessing step that repartitions the data, labeled DTJr; and (iii) a solution that, additionally, employs an indexing scheme, named DTJi.

In this work, we revisit this assumption and examine whether dissimilarity between sets of frequent itemsets could serve as a measure of dissimilarity between raw datasets. In particular, we investigate how the dissimilarity between two sets of frequent itemsets is affected by the minSupport threshold used for their generation and the adopted compactness level of the itemsets lattice, namely frequent itemsets, closed frequent itemsets or maximal frequent itemsets. Our analysis shows that utilizing frequent itemsets comparison for dataset comparison is not as straightforward as related work has argued, a result which is verified through an experimental study and opens issues for further research in the KDD field.",

In this paper, we study the temporal-constrained sub-trajectory cluster analysis problem, where the aim is to discover clusters of sub-trajectories given an ad-hoc, user-specified temporal constraint within the dataset\u2019s lifetime. The problem is challenging because: (a) the time window is not known in advance, instead it is specified at query time, and (b) the MOD is continuously updated with new trajectories. Existing solutions first filter the trajectory database according to the temporal constraint, and then apply a clustering algorithm from scratch on the filtered data. However, this approach is extremely inefficient, when considering explorative data analysis where multiple clustering tasks need to be performed over different temporal subsets of the database \u2026",
