            "Abstract": "Today we can register a growing interest in the Internet and especially in the World Wide Web. The Internet network links not only start to blur our conception of distance, they also create a new learning environment by bringing together a multinational community of learners and by providing for new social exchanges, so precious for children and teachers living in islands. With the Internet infrastructure computer supported learning sites can be set up connecting different learning communities. This is important. However, just connecting different knowledge generating communities doesn't guarantee learning or better a kind of knowledge negotiation resulting in understanding and new insights. The goal of this paper is to:\u2022 Categorise the current educational activities supported by Internet and analyse them. The term'Internet'only refers to the underlying technology. Actually, a large variety of tools are available for teaching or learning via Internet. Any reflection on the practices and on the effectiveness of learning experiences needs to discriminate which software tools are being used, and which pedagogical functions are fulfilled by these tools.",

            "Abstract": "The modern educational technological environments do not focus on the transmission of knowledge, but on the triggering of metacognitive functions. Reflection acts as a booster for metacognition. In this work, we present initially a review of the research on reflection in technological environments. Through the review and in combination with the benefits of analogical reasoning, we propose an alternative kind of reflection, the analogical reflection, instead of self-reflection and comparative reflection. Self-reflection is considered as someone\u2019s reflection on his/her own actions. As comparative reflection, we consider the reflection on others\u2019 actions. By the analogical reflection, we mean the reflection on analogies. Based on the analogical reflection, we outline our pilot research, which is a case study on three groups consisted of two students each. The students work collaboratively in the ModellingSpace technological environment. Our basic hypothesis is the following: In self-reflection, it is very possible that someone cannot recognise his/her own mistakes. In comparative reflection, this possibility is potentially reduced, because perhaps the others do not make the same mistakes. We estimate that this possibility is minimised when the analogical reflection is activated, because it is easier to recognise a strange behaviour in a familiar cognitive domain, where the normal behaviour is well known. Finally, we present briefly an instructional framework, in which students are asked to reason analogically and reflect on modelling activities, in order to exploit and improve their metacognitive skills.",

Its main purpose has been to understand and identify the characteristics of electronic communication, collaboration and coordination. In recent years, however, its scope has expanded to include the support of students and teachers during online learning activities. This chapter documents the findings from three European projects that focused on this novel, supportive role for interaction analysis. Following the definition of interaction analysis indicators and their computation, the use of unified data formats and interfaces is considered as means for utilising tools and data beyond their original scope and settings. Finally, the issue of visualisation of analysis results is discussed.",

            "Abstract": "The ModellingSpace (MS) project is concerned with developing and implementing a computer-based modelling learning environment in actual school contexts and preparing an education programme for the teachers involved in it. The paper describes the conceptual framework of setting up human networks and developing them into communities of practitioners as part of carrying out this empirical research. To foster a harmonious integration of the environment and to promote an efficient use of it, the MS project sees the development of pedagogical tools as a process of innovation that involves teachers, as the main actors, from the first stages of the design. Teachers also participate in the building of new knowledge about the development of high level competencies such as modelling, exploratory learning and collaborative problem solving. In order to describe the complex mechanisms set to work during the implementation phase, a conceptual model is used. This concerns the systematisation of actions so as to focus on the goals of implementation and to control better the variables that could negatively bias any expected effects. The systemic nature of this model is expected to further facilitate the communication of the created expertise. It will thus allow to improve the efficiency of future actions in relation to the use of ICT-rich environments in education while also promoting a more formal \u201cdriving\u201d of the associated changes.",

It is based on the research background which the implementation of DIAS relied upon; a system aiming at supporting asynchronous discussions\u2019 participants on an awareness and metacognition level via visualized interaction analysis indicators. Open questions from the CSCW field are used as a guideline for selecting the appropriate data to collect. The Information Visualization field provides ideas for successfully presenting information obtained by applying Interaction Analysis methods on these data. Through simple examples, we try to demonstrate how such attempts may lead to powerful analysis tools, with cognitive and metacognitive extensions.",

The market validation of the different services has been performed in different environments, private and state schools, from different geographical areas; Greece, Spain and North Ireland in the UK, in order to confirm the business model developed and the services acceptance. Outcomes show that e-COMODE services benefit schools by providing mechanisms to solve the lack of sufficient and appropriate teacher's support to incorporate new technologies in their teaching practices, to implement collaborative learning in the educational systems and the learning via computer based modelling. Although end-users (teachers, students) have already adopted the e-COMODE facilities, the barriers for the exploitation of the services are at the level of the public administration. Therefore, the business model proposed is being revised in function of the experience gathered during the market validation.",

When designing learning activities under this scope, in a social context, the need for building supporting tools for the participants of such activities has been highlighted. We have implemented such tools, by applying Interaction Analysis (IA) techniques, in order to support the participants of asynchronous discussion learning activities. In this paper we study the effects of IA indicators on students' selfregulation. We present research findings from several implemented case studies, in order to confirm our hypothesis, that such supporting tools indeed facilitate students' selfregulation, as it was shown both quantitatively and qualitatively, thus enhancing the overall activity, as well as the collaborative process itself.",

During the implementation of the program, a case study was produced which focused on the analysis of the learning community that was created. In this paper analysis results are presented indicating how the learning community was created and how it evolved. In order to thoroughly analyze the learning community, appropriate tools and methods of analysis were used and are presented. These tools were also used for self\u2010regulation.

            "Abstract": "Databases use and design has utilitarian and pedagogical educational interest. The utilitarian interest for databases education is determined by their economic impact. The increasing demand for database development in combination with the availability of user friendly data base management systems (dbms\u201f s) results to database design by untrained people raising quality and cost questions [2, 3]. In addition we consider that pedagogical interest of databases rises from their view as models [8] and the possibility to use them for the design of general knowledge learning activities. In this consideration database design is a modeling activity and dbms\u201f s are general purpose modeling environments using data models as representation systems. Database design can be used for the development of group based, learning activities, concerning authentic problem solving that conserve students motivation. The above utilitarian and learning advantages of databases rationalize the database design instruction in secondary education but the way that this could be better approached is still an open educational research question. Research reports about human factors in database design are rather limited [2, 3, 9] and concern higher education students and professionals. The differences in the background between the two target groups do not permit simple transfer of research results from higher to secondary education. Our research interests concern databases didactics and educational exploitation in general, for secondary education students.In this paper we present an action research about difficulties secondary education students in database design \u2026",

Is there any possibility to apply these activities when all participants are collocated? Does this collocated collaboration setting seems meaningful and for what reasons?

More specifically, it explores synchronous computer mediated collaborative activities with collocated students in realistic secondary school context. The proposed approach determines some significant application conditions:(a) The selection of critical instances of this setting application related to every day courses (eg conceptual understanding, strategies for inquiry or modelling),(b) The application of appropriate structured script that involves: individual work, synchronous computer mediated activity, face to face activity, and social activity with the whole class,(c) The existence of appropriate interactions\u2019 analysis tools, that support students in a metacognitive level,(d) The existence of interactions\u2019 analysis tools appropriate to support teachers in a diagnosis level as well as in a teaching strategies self-regulation level. Research results are based on analysis of students\u2019 actions & computer mediated dialogues, as well as on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 points of view, in order to justify the meaningfulness of the activity. The quality of learning process and collaboration are analyzed mainly via a mixed analysis approach of students\u2019 computer-mediated dialogues.",

The study was implemented with thirty (30) students. Quantitative results demonstrated that the intervention enhanced the inquiry ability of all students. Qualitative results demonstrated that it is essential for students to practise modeling activities. It is also essential that the realisation of experiments in computer follow the realisation of real experiments, in order to activate the students reasoning in greater depth and support them pass to formal thought. The study adds to the existing literature on designing learning environments.",

Database technology has significant economic impact and the demand for database design cannot be covered by the existent educated experts. Furthermore, the database management systems available at schools could be used for the design and implementation of high quality learning activities. Databases are general purpose modeling environments that enable problem solving using conceptual frameworks closer to the solver and the problem than the machine architecture. Databases design introduction in the curricula of secondary education programs raises educational research questions. Research questions concern the didactics of the subject as well as the value of database design based learning activities.

The design of learning activities related to map use and construction for young students is mainly based on \u2018an idea\u2019derived from epistemological analysis and analysis of cognitive difficulties of individuals using maps. This analysis led to re-attribute to the map its communicative status, through meaningful activities. The design rationale of the proposed learning activities apply on the assumption that the cognitive operation of an individual for instance to read a map (2D symbolic representation) and use it to \u2018move\u2019in the real space (3D representation), could be distributed over two group of individuals communicating each other while working in one of the two representational modes. For this purpose a technology based learning environment was designed, permitting children 6 years old to be implicated in collaborative settings as distributed cognitive activities related to maps. The activities are based on settings of two teams communicating via walky-talky: one team wanders around a real specific space carrying a GPS device, while the other team observes the exact path-trail traveled by the rover team, in front of their workstation running cartography tools. This paper is focused on the design of these learning activities, as well as on the collaborative settings specifications.",

The research community in order to support learning as well as collaboration, has designed systems differentiating themselves from common web-based tools (simply enabling collaborative activities), and constitute new cognitive and metacognitive tools. The paper, firstly, presents some distinctions of collaborative learning systems from other networked systems, based on assumptions on collaborative learning processes and possibilities of implementation in current educational settings. Secondly, by presenting some cross section systems proceeds to an analysis and categorization of main tools and functionalities that characterizing them. Thirdly, it analyses and discusses extensively the current trade-offs of collaborative systems design. Finally, it attempts a synthesis of necessary tools by a proposed framework and concludes by presenting the main axes of the research agenda concerning design of systems and underlying tools addressed to young students of primary and secondary education.",

Several communication and/or collaboration web modules are used in order to support the organizational structure and facilitate the operational purpose of such communities. Following the same approach, scientific networks (SN) are widely used as a common method of expanding research and sharing academic resources. The need for appropriate tools in order to support the members of a CoP or a SN and further facilitate their collaborative tasks, or even resulted learning is often highlighted by the literature. In this paper we propose the use of Interaction Analysis indicators for that matter.

Technology-based modelling environments have enhanced the pedagogical possibilities for learning activities. However, most of the available modelling systems usually support very specific types of modelling, and the vast majority are not appropriate for young children. MODELLINGSPACE is a project funded by the IST program of the European Commission that explores the pedagogical possibilities of modelling activities in actual schools. This paper presents some MODELLINGSPACE tools and functions, typical use-scenarios of modelling and collaborative modelling within the classroom; addressed to students 11-16 years old, as well as an outline of the main current research results.",

            "Abstract": "Usually analysis of collaborative problem solving situations is done through discourse analysis or interaction analysis, where in the centre of attention are the actors involved (students, tutors etc.). An alternative framework, called \u201cObjectoriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF) is briefly presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the centre of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are \u2018owned\u2019by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development. OCAF is based on both actions and dialogues of actors and allow deriving further qualitative as well as quantitative indicators of both solution quality and collaboration. Web-based tools supporting the OCAF approach are discussed. These tools are designed to be open in possible adaptations and able to be linked to various collaborative systems supporting diagrammatic problem solving.",

There are also IA tools that provide interface alternatives in CMC tools (eg alternative reading views in forums). Moreover, there are IA tools that are directly linked to a specific learning environment (eg a specific forum) or others that are independent of them; recently some methods are designed so as to be open to every kind of interaction data.

More sophisticated environments are needed when we vision e-learning as taken place in a rich and flexible Learning Community context, for young students or even for adults and professionals. Our proposal consists of an Electronic Learning Community (eLC) that can be nested in a Web-based system using MS SharepointTM Portal Server advanced features. Such a solution could provide several means in order to overcome problems and difficulties that inevitably occur in a system as complex and sophisticated as that.",

Meanwhile, technologies could also create barriers to the latter. Particularly, when the use of technologies causes security and privacy concerns, E-learning becomes less fruitful as the participants are too afraid to be exposed by what has been provided to help them learn in the first place. This paper presents a study on user's perception in using E-learning technologies and the relevant issues. The major contribution of this paper is the awareness-raising of security and privacy issues, which are often overlooked in the research efforts that implicate user tracking and personal data usage for instructional purposes.",

The IA graphs used are of two categories, the first category summarizes quantitatively the activity of the users for each blog permitting the comparison of students\u2019 activity level in a group while the second category permits the comparison among different groups. The statistical analysis of the students\u2019 interactions shows significant impact of the graphs presence to the number of posts and comments produced by the groups. Furthermore the graphs of the first category (intra-group IA) have stronger consequences than the graphs of the second (intergroup IA). The results support the general claim that interaction analysis is an important component for self regulation in computer supported collaborative learning environments.",

Numerous experiments for use in physics instruction are provided using different pedagogical tools. The paradigm described here adopts a socio-constructivist approach, where the student takes an active role in the construction of his knowledge, and it exploits three different media: a video in order to motivate students\u2019 interest; objects from everyday life for the experiments; the technology-based learning environment \u201cModellingSpace\u201d, which emphasize qualitative understanding, semi-quantitative understanding, requiring written explanations and cooperative learning. Results shows that the use of three media is essential in order to advance the reasoning of students in greater depth and pass to formal thought. The realisation of experiments in computer is not contrary to reality, but can supplement it.",

In what specific ways support students reasoning applying rich visualizations and multiple representations? How to assure flexible main collaborative actions and communications and how to support related learning community needs?
