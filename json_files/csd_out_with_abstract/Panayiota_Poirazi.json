Theoretical work in the 1960s predicted important dendritic effects on neuronal processing, establishing computational modelling as a powerful technique for their investigation. Since then, modelling of dendrites has been instrumental in driving neuroscience research in a targeted manner, providing experimentally testable predictions that range from the subcellular level to the systems level, and their relevance extends to fields beyond neuroscience, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Validation of modelling predictions often requires\u2014and drives\u2014new technological advances, thus closing the loop with theory-driven experimentation that moves the field forward.

Although parts of biological systems become more and more characterized, a more global understanding of the structure, dynamics and functionalities of complex intracellular networks is currently lacking. Systems Biology approaches aim at providing such a global picture by combining analytical and experimental techniques across several multi-disciplinary fields. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the analytical approaches and computational tools that have been applied to biological systems in order to describe them at different levels of abstraction.

Breast cancer is both genetically and histopathologically heterogeneous, and the underling development mechanisms remain largely unknown. Global expression analysis using microarrays offers unprecedented opportunities to obtain molecular signatures of the state of activity of diseased cells and patient samples. The predictive power of this approach is much greater than that of currently used approaches, but remains to be validated in prospective clinical studies. The PrognoChip project is based on the synergy between Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics, following the lines of the new raising discipline of Biomedical Informatics. In this context we are moving towards the specification and creation of an Integrated Clinico-Genomics Information Technology Environment (ICG-ITE) where, the smooth integration between the clinical and the genomics worlds as well as the intelligent processing of the underlying data, enables the identification of reliable and clinically valid (ie, in terms of prognosis) molecular (gene) markers.",

            "Abstract": "It was recently shown that multiple excitatory inputs to CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites must be activated nearly simultaneously to generate local dendritic spikes and superlinear responses at the soma; even slight input desynchronization prevented local spike initiation (Gasparini, 2006;Losonczy, 2006). This led to the conjecture that CA1 pyramidal neurons may only express their nonlinear integrative capabilities during the highly synchronized sharp waves and ripples that occur during slow wave sleep and resting/consummatory behavior, whereas during active exploration and REM sleep (theta rhythm), inadequate synchronization of excitation would lead CA1 pyramidal cells to function as essentially linear devices. Using a detailed single neuron model, we replicated the experimentally observed synchronization effect for brief inputs mimicking single synaptic release events. When synapses were driven instead by double pulses, more representative of the bursty inputs that occur in vivo, we found that the tolerance for input desynchronization was increased by more than an order of magnitude. The effect depended mainly on paired pulse facilitation of NMDA receptor-mediated responses at Schaffer collateral synapses. Our results suggest that CA1 pyramidal cells could function as nonlinear integrative units in all major hippocampal states.",

            "Abstract": "Proper functioning of working memory involves the expression of stimulus-selective persistent activity in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which refers to neural activity that persists for seconds beyond the end of the stimulus. The mechanisms which PFC pyramidal neurons use to discriminate between preferred vs. neutral inputs at the cellular level are largely unknown. Moreover, the presence of pyramidal cell subtypes with different firing patterns, such as regular spiking and intrinsic bursting, raises the question as to what their distinct role might be in persistent firing in the PFC. Here, we use a compartmental modeling approach to search for discriminatory features in the properties of incoming stimuli to a PFC pyramidal neuron and/or its response that signal which of these stimuli will result in persistent activity emergence. Furthermore, we use our modeling approach to study cell-type specific differences in persistent activity properties, via implementing a regular spiking (RS) and an intrinsic bursting (IB) model neuron. We identify synaptic location within the basal dendrites as a feature of stimulus selectivity. Specifically, persistent activity-inducing stimuli consist of activated synapses that are located more distally from the soma compared to non-inducing stimuli, in both model cells. In addition, the action potential (AP) latency and the first few inter-spike-intervals of the neuronal response can be used to reliably detect inducing vs. non-inducing inputs, suggesting a potential mechanism by which downstream neurons can rapidly decode the upcoming emergence of persistent activity.

            "Abstract": "We address the problem of predicting the position of a miRNA duplex on a microRNA hairpin via the development and application of a novel SVM-based methodology. Our method combines a unique problem representation and an unbiased optimization protocol to learn from mirBase19.0 an accurate predictive model, termed MiRduplexSVM. This is the first model that provides precise information about all four ends of the miRNA duplex. We show that (a) our method outperforms four state-of-the-art tools, namely MaturePred, MiRPara, MatureBayes, MiRdup as well as a Simple Geometric Locator when applied on the same training datasets employed for each tool and evaluated on a common blind test set. (b) In all comparisons, MiRduplexSVM shows superior performance, achieving up to a 60% increase in prediction accuracy for mammalian hairpins and can generalize very well on plant hairpins, without any special optimization. (c) The tool has a number of important applications such as the ability to accurately predict the miRNA or the miRNA*, given the opposite strand of a duplex. Its performance on this task is superior to the 2nts overhang rule commonly used in computational studies and similar to that of a comparative genomic approach, without the need for prior knowledge or the complexity of performing multiple alignments. Finally, it is able to evaluate novel, potential miRNAs found either computationally or experimentally. In relation with recent confidence evaluation methods used in miRBase, MiRduplexSVM was successful in identifying high confidence potential miRNAs.",

We introduce a computational method that uses a Naive Bayes classifier to identify mature miRNA candidates based on sequence and secondary structure information of the miRNA precursor. Specifically, for each mature miRNA, we generate a set of negative examples of equal length on the respective precursor(s). The true and negative sets are then used to estimate probability distributions for sequence composition and secondary structure on each position along the RNA.

We identify two modules of stress-associated genes that are regulated by transcription factor dimers and show that ANN modeling can be used to accurately predict the expression of all genes in these modules.

The practical advantage of having levels is that they divide a game into manageable sections.

A computer game analogy can be applied quite easily to the task of understanding the mammalian brain.

Recent publications reported that an increase in A\u03b2 concentration perturbs pre-synaptic release in hippocampal neurons. In particular, it was shown in vitro that A\u03b2 is an endogenous regulator of synaptic transmission at the CA3-CA1 synapse, enhancing its release probability. How this synaptic modulator influences neuronal output during physiological stimulation patterns, such as those elicited in vivo, is still unknown. Using a realistic model of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we first implemented this A\u03b2-induced enhancement of release probability and validated the model by reproducing the experimental findings. We then demonstrated that this synaptic modification can significantly alter synaptic integration properties in a wide range of physiologically relevant input frequencies (from 5 to 200 Hz). Finally, we used natural input patterns, obtained from CA3 pyramidal neurons in vivo during free exploration of rats in an open field, to investigate the effects of enhanced A\u03b2 on synaptic release under physiological conditions. The model shows that the CA1 neuronal response to these natural patterns is altered in the increased-A\u03b2 condition, especially for frequencies in the theta and gamma ranges. These results suggest that the perturbation of release probability induced by increased A\u03b2 can significantly alter the spike probability of CA1 pyramidal neurons and thus contribute to abnormal hippocampal function during Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

Imbalance of the excitation/inhibition ratio has been identified in several neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism and epilepsy, which also present with other cognitive deficits and symptoms associated with prefrontal cortical (PFC) dysfunction. We undertook a computational approach to study how changes in the excitation/inhibition balance in a PFC microcircuit model affect the properties of persistent activity, considered the cellular correlate of working memory function in PFC. To this end, we constructed a PFC microcircuit, consisting of pyramidal neuron models and all three different interneuron types: fast-spiking (FS), regular-spiking (RS) and irregular-spiking (IS) interneurons. Persistent activity was induced in the microcircuit model with a stimulus to the proximal apical dendrites of the pyramidal neuron models, and its properties were analyzed, such as the induction profile, the interspike intervals (ISIs) and neuronal synchronicity. Our simulations showed that a) the induction but not the firing frequency or neuronal synchronicity is modulated by changes in the NMDA-to-AMPA ratio on FS interneuron model, b) removing or decreasing the FS model input to the pyramidal neuron models greatly limited the biophysical modulation of persistent activity induction, decreased the ISIs and neuronal synchronicity during persistent activity, c) the induction and firing properties could not be altered by the addition of other inhibitory inputs to the soma (from RS or IR models) and d \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Individual memories are often linked so that the recall of one triggers the recall of another. For example, contextual memories acquired close in time can be linked, and this is known to depend on temporary increase in excitability that drive the overlap between dorsal CA1 (dCA1) hippocampal ensembles encoding the linked memories. Here, we show that the Locus Coeruleus (LC) cells projecting to dCA1 have a key permissive role in contextual memory linking, without affecting contextual memory formation, and that this effect is mediated by dopamine and not by noradrenaline. Additionally, we found that LC to dCA1 projecting neurons modulate the excitability of dCA1 neurons, and the extent of overlap between dCA1 memory ensembles, as well as the stability of coactivity patterns within these ensembles. This discovery of a neuromodulatory system that specifically affects memory linking without affecting memory formation, reveals a fundamental separation between the brain mechanisms that modulate these two distinct processes.",

It has been proposed that feed-forward inputs to basal dendrites drive a neuron\u2019s stimulus preference, while feedback inputs to apical dendrites sharpen selectivity. However, how a neuron\u2019s dendritic domains relate to its functional selectivity has not been demonstrated experimentally. We performed 2-photon dendritic micro-dissection on layer-2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex. We found that removing the apical dendritic tuft did not alter orientation-tuning. Furthermore, orientation-tuning curves were remarkably robust to the removal of basal dendrites: ablation of 2 basal dendrites was needed to cause a small shift in orientation preference, without significantly altering tuning width. Computational modeling corroborated our results and put limits on how orientation preferences \u2026",

We implemented 57 basal tree morphologies of layer 5 prefrontal pyramidal neurons of the rat and identified morphological types that were characterized by different response features, forming distinct functional types.

Yet little is known about how dendrites themselves represent the environment, the degree to which they are coupled to their soma, and how that coupling is sculpted with experience. In order to answer these questions, we developed a novel preparation in which we image soma and connected dendrites in a single plane across days using in vivo two-photon microscopy. Using this preparation, we monitored spatially tuned activity in area CA3 of the hippocampus in head-fixed mice running on a linear track. We identified \u201cplace dendrites\u201d, which can stably and precisely represent both familiar and novel spatial environments. Dendrites could display place tuning independent of their connected soma and even their sister dendritic branches, the first evidence for branch-specific tuning in the hippocampus. In a familiar environment, spatially tuned somata were more decoupled from their dendrites as compared to non-tuned somata. This relationship was absent in a novel environment, suggesting an experience dependent selective gating of dendritic spatial inputs. We then built a data-driven multicompartment computational model that could capture the experimentally observed correlations. Our model predicts that place cells exhibiting branch-specific tuning have more flexible place fields, while neurons with homogenous or co-tuned dendritic branches have higher place field stability. These findings demonstrate that spatial representation is organized in a branch-specific manner within dendrites of \u2026",

Memory representations are seen as activated neuronal populations of granule cells, the main encoding cells in DG, which are estimated to engage 2\u20134% of the total population. This sparsity is assumed to enhance the ability of DG to perform pattern separation, one of the most valuable contributions of DG during memory formation. In this work, we investigate how features of the DG such as its excitatory and inhibitory connectivity diagram can be used to develop theoretical algorithms performing Sparse Approximation, a widely used strategy in the Signal Processing field. Sparse approximation stands for the algorithmic identification of few components from a dictionary that approximate a certain signal. The ability of DG to achieve pattern separation by sparsifing its representations is exploited here to improve the performance of the state of the art sparse approximation algorithm \u201cIterative Soft Thresholding\u201d (IST) by adding new algorithmic features inspired by the DG circuitry. Lateral inhibition of granule cells, either direct or indirect, via mossy cells, is shown to enhance the performance of the IST. Apart from revealing the potential of DG-inspired theoretical algorithms, this work presents new insights regarding the function of particular cell types in the pattern separation task of the DG.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been under investigation due to their involvement in carcinogenesis, often taking up roles of tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Due to the slow nature of experimental identification of miRNA genes, computational procedures have been applied as a valuable complement to cloning. Numerous computational tools, implemented to recognize the features of miRNA biogenesis, have resulted in the prediction of novel miRNA genes.

Due to the advancement of high throughput technologies, there is currently a large amount of data such as gene expression, gene deletion and protein-protein interactions for S. Cerevisiae under various environmental conditions. Mining these datasets requires efficient computational methods capable of integrating different types of data, identifying inter-relations between different components and inferring functional groups or \u2018modules\u2019 that shape intracellular processes. This study uses computational methods to delineate some of the mechanisms used by yeast cells to respond to environmental changes. The GRAM algorithm is first used to integrate gene expression data and ChIP-chip data in order to find modules of coexpressed and co-regulated genes as well as the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate these modules. Since transcription factors are themselves transcriptionally regulated, a three-layer regulatory cascade consisting of the TF-regulators, the TFs and the regulated modules is subsequently considered. This three-layer cascade is then modeled quantitatively using artificial neural networks (ANNs) where the input layer corresponds to the expression of the up-stream transcription factors (TF-regulators) and the output layer corresponds to the expression of genes within each module. This work shows that (a) the expression of at least 33 genes over time and for different stress conditions is well predicted by the expression of the top layer transcription \u2026",

Over the last few years, new experimental techniques have allowed the visualization and probing of dendritic anatomy, plasticity and integrative schemes with unprecedented detail. This vast amount of information has caused a paradigm shift in the study of memory, one of the most important pursuits in Neuroscience, and calls for the development of novel theories and models that will unify the available data according to some basic principles.

            "Abstract": "Current deep learning architectures show remarkable performance when trained in large-scale, controlled datasets. However, the predictive ability of these architectures significantly decreases when learning new classes incrementally. This is due to their inclination to forget the knowledge acquired from previously seen data, a phenomenon termed catastrophic-forgetting. On the other hand, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can model the input space utilizing constrained k-means and thus maintain past knowledge. Here, we propose a novel algorithm inspired by biological neurons, termed Dendritic-Self-Organizing Map (DendSOM). DendSOM consists of a single layer of SOMs, which extract patterns from specific regions of the input space accompanied by a set of hit matrices, one per SOM, which estimate the association between units and labels. The best-matching unit of an input pattern is selected using the maximum cosine similarity rule, while the point-wise mutual information is employed for class inference. DendSOM performs unsupervised feature extraction as it does not use labels for targeted updating of the weights. It outperforms classical SOMs and several state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms on benchmark datasets, such as the Split-MNIST and Split-CIFAR-10. We propose that the incorporation of neuronal properties in SOMs may help remedy catastrophic forgetting.",

Dendritic atrophy has been reported in diseases associated with pattern separation deficits, suggesting a possible role for dendrites in this phenomenon. To investigate whether and how the dendrites of GCs contribute to pattern separation, we build a simplified, biologically relevant, computational model of the DG.

            "Abstract": "Over the last decade, numerous computational methods have been developed in order to infer and model biological networks. Transcriptional networks in particular have attracted significant attention due to their critical role in cell survival. The majority of network inference methods use genome-wide experimental data to search for modules of genes with coherent expression profiles and common regulators, often ignoring the multi-layer structure of transcriptional cascades. Modelling methodologies on the other hand assume a given network structure and vary significantly in their algorithmic approach, ranging from over-simplified representations (e.g. Boolean networks) to detailed -but computationally expensive-network simulations (e.g. with differential equations). In this work we use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to model transcriptional regulatory cascades that emerge during the stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and extend in two layers. We confine the structure of the ANNs to match the structure of the biological networks as determined by gene expression, DNA-protein interaction and experimental evidence provided in publicly available databases. Trained ANNs are able to predict the expression profile of 11 target genes across multiple experimental conditions with a Correlation Coefficient > 0.7. When time-dependent interactions between upstream transcription factors and their indirect targets are also included in the ANNs, accurate predictions are achieved for 30/34 target genes. Moreover, heterodimer formation is taken into account. We show that ANNs can be used to (a) accurately predict the expression of downstream \u2026",

While several computational methods are currently available for identifying miRNA genes, accurate prediction of the mature miRNA remains a challenge. Existing approaches fall short in predicting the location of mature miRNAs but also in finding the functional strand(s) of miRNA precursors.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we present a computational tool that incorporates a Naive Bayes classifier to identify mature miRNA candidates based on sequence and secondary structure information of their miRNA precursors. We take into account both positive (true mature miRNAs) and negative (same-size non-mature miRNA sequences) examples to optimize sensitivity as well as specificity. Our method can accurately predict the start position of experimentally verified mature miRNAs for both human and mouse, achieving a significantly larger (often double) performance accuracy compared with two existing methods. Moreover, the method exhibits a very high generalization performance on miRNAs from two other organisms. More importantly, our method provides direct evidence about the features of miRNA precursors which may determine the location of the mature miRNA. We find that the triplet of positions 7, 8 and 9 from the mature miRNA end towards the closest hairpin have the largest discriminatory power, are relatively conserved in terms of sequence composition (mostly contain a Uracil) and are located within or in very close proximity to the hairpin loop, suggesting the \u2026",

In general, feature selection methods aim at identifying a common set of genes whose combined expression profiles can accurately predict the category of all samples. Here, we argue that this simplified approach is often unable to capture the complexity of a disease phenotype and we propose an alternative method that takes into account the individuality of each patient-sample. Instead of using the same features for the classification of all samples, the proposed technique starts by creating a pool of informative gene-features. For each sample, the method selects a subset of these features whose expression profiles are most likely to accurately predict the sample's category. Different subsets are utilized for different samples and the outcomes are combined in a hierarchical framework for the classification of all samples. Moreover, this approach can innately identify subgroups of samples within a given class which share common feature sets thus highlighting the effect of individuality on gene expression. In addition to high classification accuracy, the proposed method offers a more individualized approach for the identification of biological markers, which may help in better understanding the molecular background of a disease and emphasize the need for more flexible medical interventions.",

The neural correlate of this type of short-term memory is persistent spiking activity (PA) of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, mainly in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC). Neurons embedded in PFC microcircuits integrate widespread information from various brain regions. PFC microcircuits of~ ten neurons are characterized by highly reciprocal connections and non-linear integration in their dendrites. Understanding how dendrites integrate information from multiple sources is crucial to explain their functional role. Spatial and temporal integration of signals occurs at dendrites before propagating to the soma, and plays a role in coding of information [1, 2]. The main question is whether and how pyramidal neurons in such circuits can detect temporally structured information in order to timely adjust behavior. Dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons have been shown to exhibit temporal sensitivity [1]. To address this question, we constructed a detailed PFC microcircuit, implemented in the NEURON simulation environment. We used reconstructed morphologies of layer 5 PFC pyramidal neurons, validated against experimental findings. The microcircuit consisted of nine pyramidal neurons and two interneurons, all interconnected [3]. To investigate temporal coding, we delivered temporally structured input to four out of the nine pyramidal neurons and assessed, given persistent activity emergence, a) the time-to-first-spike (ttfs) of each pyramidal cell and b) the Inter-Spike Intervals (ISIs) during PA.

            "Abstract": "Functional annotation of the genome in various species is important to understand their phenotypic complexity. The road towards functional annotation involves several challenges ranging from experiments on individual molecules to large-scale analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. HTS data is typically a result of the protocol designed to address specific research questions. The sequencing results in reads, which when mapped to a reference genome often leads to the formation of distinct patterns (read profiles). Interpretation of these read profiles are essential for the analysis in relation to the research question addressed. Several strategies have been employed at varying levels of abstraction ranging from a somewhat ad hoc to a more systematic analysis of read profiles. These include methods which can compare read profiles, e.g. from direct (non-sequence based) alignments to classification of patterns into functional groups. In this review, we highlight the emerging applications of read profiles for the annotation of non-coding RNA and cis-regulatory regions such as enhancers and promoters. We also discuss the biological rationale behind their formation.",

            "Abstract": "Previous biophysical modeling work showed that nonlinear interactions among nearby synapses located on active dendritic trees can provide a large boost in the memory capacity of a cell (Mel, 1992a, 1992b). The aim of our present work is to quantify this boost by estimating the capacity of (1) a neuron model with passive dendritic integration where inputs are combined linearly across the entire cell followed by a single global threshold, and (2) an active dendrite model in which a threshold is applied separately to the output of each branch, and the branch subtotals are combined linearly. We focus here on the limiting case of binary-valued synaptic weights, and derive expressions which measure model capacity by estimating the number of distinct input-output functions available to both neuron types. We show that (1) the application of a fixed nonlinearity to each dendritic compartment substantially increases the model's flexibility,(2) for a neuron of realistic size, the capacity of the nonlinear cell can exceed that of the same-sized linear cell by more than an order of magnitude, and (3) the largest capacity boost occurs for cells with a relatively large number of dendritic subunits of relatively small size. We validated the analysis by empirically measuring memory capacity with randomized two-class classifica-tion problems, where a stochastic delta rule was used to train both linear and nonlinear models. We found that large capacity boosts predicted for the nonlinear dendritic model were readily achieved in practice.* http://Inc. usc. edu",

It has also led to the development of photoactivatable calcium-dependent indicators that mark active synapses, neurons and circuits. Furthermore, calcium-dependent photoactivation can be used to trigger gene expression in active neurons. Here we describe two sets of protocols, one using CaMPARI and a second one using Cal-Light. CaMPARI, a calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator, enables rapid network-wide, tunable, all-optical functional circuit mapping. Cal-Light, a photoactivatable calcium sensor, while slower to respond than CaMPARI, has the capacity to trigger the expression of genes, including effectors, activators, indicators or other constructs. Here we describe the rationale and provide procedures for using these two calcium-dependent constructs (1) in vitro in dissociated primary neuronal cell cultures (CaMPARI & Cal-Light); (2) in vitro in acute brain slices for circuit mapping (CaMPARI); (3) in vivo for triggering photoconversion or gene expression (CaMPARI & Cal-Light); and finally, (4) for recovering photoconverted neurons post-fixation with immunocytochemistry (CaMPARI). The approaches and protocols we describe are examples of the potential uses of both CaMPARI and Cal-Light. The ability to mark and manipulate neurons that are active during specific epochs of behavior has a vast unexplored experimental potential.",

The temporoammonic pathway (TA), converging at stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), appears to be inhibitory. The relative temporal occurrence of the stimuli conveyed by the two pathways seems to modulate the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Specifically, the excitatory effect of SC inputs is greatly attenuated when preceded by TA stimulation within a specific time window. This phenomenon is referred to as the spike-blocking effect. Dvorak-Carbone and Schuman found that spike-blocking efficacy temporally coincide with the GABAb signalling pathway, while spike blocking was almost abolished in the presence of GABAb antagonist.

            "Abstract": "The in vivo activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons alternates between regular spiking and bursting, but how these changes affect information processing remains unclear. Using a detailed CA1 pyramidal neuron model, we investigate how timing and spatial arrangement variations in synaptic inputs to the distal and proximal dendritic layers influence the information content of model responses. We find that the temporal delay between activation of the two layers acts as a switch between excitability modes: short delays induce bursting while long delays decrease firing. For long delays, the average firing frequency of the model response discriminates spatially clustered from diffused inputs to the distal dendritic tree. For short delays, the onset latency and inter-spike-interval succession of model responses can accurately classify input signals as temporally close or distant and spatially clustered or diffused across different stimulation protocols. These findings suggest that a CA1 pyramidal neuron may be capable of encoding and transmitting presynaptic spatiotemporal information about the activity of the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal network to higher brain regions via the selective use of either a temporal or a rate code.",

            "Abstract": "Technological advances have unraveled the existence of small clusters of co-active neurons in the neocortex. The functional implications of these microcircuits are in large part unexplored. Using a heavily constrained biophysical model of a L5 PFC microcircuit, we recently showed that these structures act as tunable modules of persistent activity, the cellular correlate of working memory. Here, we investigate the mechanisms that underlie persistent activity emergence (ON) and termination (OFF) and search for the minimum network size required for expressing these states within physiological regimes. We show that (a) NMDA-mediated dendritic spikes gate the induction of persistent firing in the microcircuit. (b) The minimum network size required for persistent activity induction is inversely proportional to the synaptic drive of each excitatory neuron. (c) Relaxation of connectivity and synaptic delay constraints eliminates the gating effect of NMDA spikes, albeit at a cost of much larger networks. (d) Persistent activity termination by increased inhibition depends on the strength of the synaptic input and is negatively modulated by dADP. (e) Slow synaptic mechanisms and network activity contain predictive information regarding the ability of a given stimulus to turn ON and/or OFF persistent firing in the microcircuit model. Overall, this study zooms out from dendrites to cell assemblies and suggests a tight interaction between dendritic non-linearities and network properties (size/connectivity) that may facilitate the short-memory function of the PFC.",

            "Abstract": "Metabolic interactions involve the exchange of metabolic products among microbial species. Most microbes live in communities and usually rely on metabolic interactions to increase their supply for nutrients and better exploit a given environment. Constraint-based models have successfully analyzed cellular metabolism and described genotype-phenotype relations. However, there are only a few studies of genome-scale multi-species interactions. Based on genome-scale approaches, we present a graph-theoretic approach together with a metabolic model in order to explore the metabolic variability among bacterial strains and identify and describe metabolically interacting strain communities in a batch culture consisting of two or more strains. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the bacterium E. coli across different single-carbon-source conditions. A different diversity graph is constructed for each growth condition. The graph-theoretic properties of the constructed graphs reflect the inherent high metabolic redundancy of the cell to single-gene knockouts, reveal mutant-hubs of unique metabolic capabilities regarding by-production, demonstrate consistent metabolic behaviors across conditions and show an evolutionary difficulty towards the establishment of polymorphism, while suggesting that communities consisting of strains specifically adapted to a given condition are more likely to evolve. We reveal several strain communities of improved growth relative to corresponding monocultures, even though strain communities are not modeled to operate towards a collective goal, such as the community growth and we identify the range \u2026",

To clarify issues, we developed a CA1 pyramidal cell model calibrated with a broad spectrum of in vitro data. Using simultaneous dendritic and somatic recordings and combining results for two different response measures (peak versus mean EPSP), two different stimulus formats (single shock versus 50 Hz trains), and two different spatial integration conditions (within versus between-branch summation), we found that the cell's subthreshold responses to paired inputs are best described as a sum of nonlinear subunit responses, where the subunits correspond to different dendritic branches.

Plasticity-related phenomena which affect synaptic properties, such as synaptic tagging and capture, synaptic clustering, branch strength potentiation and spinogenesis provide the foundation for a model of memory storage that relies heavily on processes operating at the dendrite level. The emerging picture suggests that clusters of functionally related synapses may serve as key computational and memory storage units in the brain.

During a working memory task, neurons of the PFC rapidly modify their response properties in a context-dependent manner. Could this flexible tuning be mediated by temporary connectivity states, supported by single-cell mechanisms? Are these states bound by the underlying network connectivity? Indeed, pyramidal neurons of the PFC are characterized by prominent non-linear dendritic responses and participate in hyper-reciprocal networks. This work probes these questions using a detailed, PFC model network equipped with nonlinear synaptic mechanisms. The model reproduces a wide range of experimental findings with respect to the response properties of individual cells and the dynamic population responses. We propose that PFC neurons dynamically form functional assemblies by transiently recruiting non-linear dendritic phenomena, shaping a robust yet flexible population response.",

Moreover, in response to a somatic step current, these cells display a range of firing behaviors, the most common being (1) repetitive action potentials (Regular Spiking - RS), and (2) an initial cluster of 2-5 action potentials with short ISIs followed by single spikes (Intrinsic Bursting - IB). A correlation between firing behavior and dendritic morphology has recently been reported. In this work we use computational modeling to investigate quantitatively the effects of the basal dendritic tree morphology on the firing behavior of 112 three-dimensional reconstructions of layer V PFC rat pyramidal cells. Particularly, we focus on how different morphological (diameter, total length, volume and branch number) and passive (Mean Electrotonic Path length) features of basal dendritic trees shape somatic firing when the spatial distribution of ionic mechanisms in the basal dendritic trees is uniform or non-uniform. Our results suggest that total length, volume and branch number are the best morphological parameters to discriminate the cells as RS or IB, regardless of the distribution of ionic mechanisms in basal trees. The discriminatory power of total length, volume and branch number remains high in the presence of different apical dendrites. These results suggest that morphological variations in the basal dendritic trees of layer V pyramidal neurons in the PFC influence their firing patterns in a predictive manner and may in turn influence the information processing capabilities of these neurons.",

Recent studies suggest that memories acquired close in time are encoded by overlapping neuronal ensembles, and that this overlap is necessary for memory linking. Transient increases in neuronal excitability drive this ensemble overlap, but whether dendritic plasticity plays a role in linking memories is unknown. Here, we show that contextual memory linking is not only dependent on ensemble overlap in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), but also on RSC branch-specific dendritic allocation mechanisms. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of RSC dendrites, we show that the same dendritic segments are preferentially activated by two linked (but not independent) contextual memories, and that spine clusters added after each of two linked (but not independent) contextual memories are allocated to the same dendritic segments. Importantly, with a novel optogenetic tool, selectively targeted to activated dendritic segments following learning, we show that reactivation of dendrites tagged during the first context exploration is sufficient to link two contextual memories. These results demonstrate a causal role for dendritic mechanisms in memory linking and reveal a novel set of rules that govern how linked, and independent memories are allocated to dendritic compartments.",

A high percentage of miRNA genes have been located in cancer-associated genomic regions (CAGRs) and fragile sites (FRA)(3), thus implicating miRNAs in tumourigenic events. An example of such a case is the report of two known miRNAs (miR-15a and miR-16a) located in chromosome 13q14, a region deleted in more than half of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (4)(B-CLLs). About 30% of miRNAs are found in the introns of other genes. It is generally thought that in most cases where the miRNA lies in the same orientation; the miRNA is cotranscribed with the host gene (5). This can have obvious implications when investigating genes that are highly expressed in certain cancers, whereby the careful investigation of their intronic sequences can lead to the identification of putative, intron-residing miRNAs, with a fundamental role in cancer development.In this study we aim to implement efficient miRNA precursor and target prediction, computational tools, using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) trained to recognise existing biological features of miRNA biogenesis, and conservation. Previous prediction approaches adopt a pipeline architecture, whereby sequences are eliminated as the pipeline proceeds (6, 7). The drawback of these approaches is that they loose numerous true miRNAs along the line due to stringent cut-offs that often do not apply to all miRNAs. Other approaches use homology to detect novel miRNAs with similarity to previously identified miRNAs (8-10). This method obviously fails when scanning distantly related \u2026",

Synaptic activation of varying sets of these dendrites leads to somatic firing variability that cannot be fully explained by the point neuron reduction.

The highly branched dendritic structure that originates from the cell body, explores the surrounding 3D space in a fractal-like manner, until it reaches a certain amount of complexity. Its shape undergoes significant alterations under various physiological or neuropathological conditions. Yet, despite the profound effect that these alterations can have on neuronal function, the causal relationship between the two remains largely elusive. The lack of a systematic approach for remodeling neural cells and their dendritic trees is a key limitation that contributes to this problem. Such causal relationships can be inferred via the use of large-scale neuronal models whereby the anatomical plasticity of neurons is accounted for, in order to enhance their biological relevance and hence their predictive performance. To facilitate this effort, we developed a computational tool named REMOD that allows the structural remodeling of any type of virtual neuron. REMOD is written in Python and can be accessed through a dedicated web interface that guides the user through various options to manipulate selected neuronal morphologies. REMOD can also be used to extract meaningful morphology statistics for one or multiple reconstructions, including features such as sholl analysis, total dendritic length and area, path length to the soma, centrifugal branch order, diameter tapering and more. As such, the tool can be used both for the analysis and/or the remodeling of neuronal morphologies of any type.",

The ways in which these distinct representations can be generated have been explored in a number of theoretical and computational modeling studies. Here, we review two categories of pattern separation models: those that address the phenomenon in an abstract mathematical fashion and those that delve into the underlying biological mechanisms by taking into account the anatomy and/or physiology of hippocampal circuits. We summarize the strategies, findings and limitations of these modeling \u2026",

In this study, we concentrate on stress-induced effects in CA1 neurons which include an enhancement of the slow afterhypolarization (sAHP), an increase in Ca2+ currents, specifically a presumed upregulation of the Cav1.2 subunit that mediates one type of the L-type Ca2+ currents (the Ls type), and a suppression of Ca2+ extrusion mechanism, manifested as a decrease in plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase-1. The aim of our study lies in identifying a causal relationship between either or both of the changes in the Ca2+ dynamics system and the increase in the sAHP.

Investigations regarding the functional implications of such neuronal clustering have proposed that this modularity may underlie the spiking irregularities seen in cortical activity in vivo [3] or code for the execution of a voluntary movement [4].

The model incorporates N- and L-type calcium channels which are respectively coupled to fast and slow afterhyperpolarization potassium channels. Model parameters are calibrated using physiological data. Computer simulations reproduce the decreased excitability of aged CA1 cells, which results from increased internal calcium accumulation, subsequently larger postburst slow afterhyperpolarization, and enhanced spike frequency adaptation.

Potential metabolic interactions (edges) are allowed only between strains of different metabolic capabilities. Bacterial communities are determined by finding cliques in this network. Growth of the emerged hypothetical bacterial communities is simulated by extending the metabolic flux balance analysis model of Varma et al [2] to embody heterogeneous cell population growth in a mutual environment.Results from aerobic growth on 10 different carbon sources are presented. The upper bounds of the diversity that can emerge from single-cloned populations of E. coli such as the number of strains that appears to metabolically differ from most strains (highly connected nodes), the maximum clique size as well as the number of all the possible communities are determined. Certain single gene deletions are identified to consistently participate in our hypothetical bacterial communities under most environmental conditions implying a pattern of growth-condition-invariant strains with similar metabolic effects.

Consistent with the idea that these measures are causally related, a genetic manipulation that enhances spine turnover also enhances both L&M and spine clustering.

We compare capacity for two different modes of dendritic integration: (1) linear, where synaptic inputs are summed across the entire dendritic arbor, and (2) nonlinear, where each dendritic compartment functions as a separately thresholded neuron-like summing unit. We calculate much larger storage capacities for cells with nonlinear subunits and show that this capacity is accessible to a structural learning rule that combines random synapse formation with activity-dependent stabilization/elimination. In a departure from the common view that memories are encoded in the overall connection strengths between neurons, our results suggest that long-term information storage in neural tissue could reside primarily in the selective addressing of synaptic contacts onto dendritic subunits.",

Here, we review evidence of the hypothesis that information flow and processing in the hippocampus complies with the principles of Compressed Sensing (CS). The CS theory comprises a mathematical framework that describes how and under which conditions, restricted sampling of information (data set) can lead to condensed, yet concise, forms of the initial, subsampled information entity (i.e. of the original data set). In this work, hippocampus related regions and their respective circuitry are presented as a CS-based system whose different components collaborate to realize efficient memory encoding and decoding processes. This proposition introduces a unifying mathematical framework for hippocampal function and opens new avenues for exploring coding and decoding strategies in the brain.",

            "Abstract": "In the study of memory engrams, synaptic memory allocation is a newly emerged theme that focuses on how specific synapses come to store a given memory. Cumulating evidence from imaging and molecular experiments indicates that the recruitment of synapses that participate in the encoding and expression of a memory is neither random nor uniform. A hallmark observation is the emergence of groups of synapses which share similar response properties and/or similar input properties and are located within a stretch of a dendritic branch. This grouping of synapses has been termed \u201csynapse clustering\u201d and has been shown to emerge in many different memory related paradigms, as well as in in vitro studies. The clustering of synapses may emerge from synapses receiving similar input, or via many processes which allow for cross-talk between nearby synapses within a dendritic branch, leading to cooperative plasticity. Clustered synapses can act in concert to maximally exploit the nonlinear integration potential of the dendritic branches in which they reside. Their main contribution is to facilitate the induction of dendritic spikes and dendritic plateau potentials, which provide advanced computational and memory-related capabilities to dendrites and single neurons. In this review we present recent evidence which investigates the role of synapse clustering in dendritic integration, sensory perception, learning and memory as well as brain dysfunction. We also discuss recent theoretical work which explores the computational advantages provided by synapse clustering, leading to novel and revised theories of memory. As an eminent phenomenon \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Working memory refers to the temporary storage of information and is strongly associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Persistent activity of cortical neurons, namely the activity that persists beyond the stimulus presentation, is considered the cellular correlate of working memory. Although past studies suggested that this type of activity is characteristic of large scale networks, recent experimental evidence imply that small, tightly interconnected clusters of neurons in the cortex may support similar functionalities. However, very little is known about the biophysical mechanisms giving rise to persistent activity in small-sized microcircuits in the prefrontal cortex. Here, we present a detailed biophysically \u2013yet morphologically simplified- microcircuit model of layer V PFC neurons that incorporates connectivity constraints and is validated against a multitude of experimental data. We show that (a) a small-sized network can exhibit persistent activity under realistic stimulus conditions. (b) Its emergence depends strongly on the interplay of dADP, NMDA and GABAB currents. (c) Although increases in stimulus duration increase the probability of persistent activity induction, variability in the stimulus firing frequency does not consistently influence it. (d) Modulation of ionic conductances (Ih, ID, IsAHP, IcaL, IcaN, IcaR) differentially controls persistent activity properties in a location dependent manner. These findings suggest that modulation of the microcircuit\u2019s firing characteristics is achieved primarily through changes in its intrinsic mechanism makeup, supporting the hypothesis of multiple bi-stable units in the PFC.
