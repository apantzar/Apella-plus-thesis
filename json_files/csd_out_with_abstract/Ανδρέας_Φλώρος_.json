            "Abstract": "Under this research we developed a system destined as a teaching aid for students with communication difficulties. Our methodology examines the underlying mathematical concepts from a highly analytical perspective and derives appropriate courseware material of equivalent quality. The case-studies described in this paper deliver basic courseware on number theory and generalised mathematical concepts by presenting the geometrical meaning of the underlying concepts and providing alternative representations that enable understanding of the underlying theory. This process has resulted in the development of a visual set of case-studies that teach basic mathematical and geometrical concepts which may subsequently be extended to algorithms such as division, Greatest Common Divider, multiplication, least common multiplier, attributes and requirements for division. Interactive multimedia technologies are used extensively in the development of the teaching environment. A game-like interface aided by realistic binaural audio and animation has proved to attract user-attention for longer periods than using traditional teaching methods, aiding the educational process by providing an immersive multimedia interactivelearning alternative, for students with communication problems.",

It is not only targeted to the creation of automatic music composers and raters, but also reinforces the research for a deeper understanding of human noesis. The aim of this work is twofold: first, it proposes an Interactive Evolution system that uses Genetic Programming to evolve simple 8\u2013bit melodies. The results obtained by subjective tests indicate that evolution is driven towards more user\u2013preferable sounds. In turn, by monitoring features of the melodies in different evolution stages, indications are provided that some sound features may subsume information about aesthetic criteria. The results are promising and signify that further study of aesthetic preference through Interactive Evolution may accelerate the progress towards defining \u2026",

The most challenging aspect of such integration relates the synchronized and robust real-time streaming of multiple audio channels to multipoint receivers, for example, wireless active speakers. Here, it is shown that current WLAN solutions are susceptible to transmission errors. A detailed study of the IEEE802.11e protocol (currently under ratification) is also presented and all relevant distortions are assessed via an analytical and experimental methodology. A novel synchronization scheme is also introduced, allowing optimized playback for multiple receivers. The perceptual audio performance is assessed for both stereo and 5-channel applications based on either PCM or compressed audio signals.",

Several applications for music education and commercial use can utilize such algorithms and allow for an easy-to-use way to interpret drum signals in real--time. The paper at hand proposes a system that performs real--time drums transcription. The proposed system consists of two subsystems, the real--time separation and the training module. The real--time separation module is based on the use of characteristic filters, combining simple bandpass filtering and amplification, a fact that diminishes computational cost and potentially renders it suitable for implementation on hardware. The training module employs Differential Evolution to create generations of characteristic filter combinations that optimally separate a set of given drum sources. Initial experimental results indicate that the proposed system is relatively accurate rendering it \u2026",

The main reason is the tonal enhancement of the original/unmastered audio material. The aforementioned process is mostly based on the musical information and the mode of the audio material. This information can be retrieved from a listening procedure of the original stimuli, or the corespondent musical key notes. The current work presents an adaptive and automated equalization system that performs the aforementioned mastering procedure, based on a novel method of fundamental frequency tracking. In addition to this, the overall system is being evaluated with objective PEAQ analysis and subjective listening tests in real mastering audio conditions.",

Key wireless mesh networking issues are discussed and value for the potential service providers and users of the network is specified. The network development builds on advanced features of wireless mesh networks, like multi-channel and multi-radio operation, connectivity to a fixed network infrastructure through multiple links and general purpose applications support, which overcome many of the limitations that are currently imposed by wireless ad-hoc networks. The proposed network is designed to provide apart from broadband Internet access a number of sophisticated services to the citizens, tourists and business visitors of the island. To assure viability and expansion for the CorfuNet initiative, the present study discusses scenarios on two alternative business models, namely the collaborative and the single provider models, differentiated on the basis of the network\u2019s owner.",

This can pose a serious limitation, especially for blind children, since in recent years electronic games have become one of the most common and wide spread means of entertainment and socialization. For our implementation we use binaural technology which allows the player to hear and navigate the game space by adding localization information to the game sounds. With our implementation and user studies we provide insight on what constitutes an accessible game for blind people as well as a functional game engine for such games. The game engine developed allows the quick development of games for the visually impaired.

            "Abstract": "Sound equalization is a common approach for objectively or subjectively defining the reproduction level at specific frequency bands. It is also well-known that the human auditory system demonstrates an inner process of sound-weighting. Due to this, the perceived loudness changes with the frequency and the user-defined sound reproduction gain, resulting into a deviation of the intended and the perceived equalization scheme as the sound level changes. In this work we introduce a novel equalization approach that takes into account the above perceptual loudness effect in order to achieve subjectively constant equalization. A series of listening tests shows that the proposed equalization technique is an efficient and listener-preferred alternative for both professional and home audio reproduction applications.",

The technique uses a time-frequency domain metric for retrieving the panning coefficients applied during the initial stereo mixing. Panning information is also used for separating the original single channel audio streams and finally for synthesizing the expanded sound field using binaural processing. The technique is mainly intended for playback applications over short-distant loudspeaker setups or headphones and, in the context of this work, it is subjectively evaluated in terms of the perceived sound field expansion and the sound-source spatial distribution accuracy.",

State-of-the-art binaural technology algorithms are used for producing the final two-channel binaural signal. These algorithms are optimized for realtime operation, able to manipulate high-quality audio (typically 24bit/96kHz) for an arbitrary number of fixed-position or moving sound sources in closed acoustic enclosures. Simple gestural rules are employed, which aim to provide the complete functionality required for the mixing process, using low cost equipment. It is shown that the proposed platform can be efficiently used for general audio mixing/mastering purposes, providing an attractive alternative to legacy hardware control designs and software-based mixing user interfaces.",

The main goal of the presented system is to generate accompanying music based on the local human musician's tonal, rhythmic and intensity playing style, incorporating no prior knowledge about the improvisers intentions. Compared to existing systems previously proposed, this work introduces a constraint-free improvisation environment where the most important musical characteristics are automatically adapted to the human performer's playing style, without any prior information.

Currently there are many systems on the market that distribute audio over Ethernet but the majority of sound engineers are not using them yet. There are mainly two reasons that audio networks are not as popular as expected. First, many of the systems are based on a proprietary implementation that does not allow interoperability between different vendors. Second, wired networks, like the conventional analog audio networks, also need a cable installation. It is therefore understood that the development of a wireless digital audio \u2026",

Although many novel ideas have been proposed for illustrating basic mathematical (ie geometrical) concepts, currently there is a lack of effective methods to dynamically reproduce an alternative representation of the underlying concepts. The proposed approach introduces valuable explanatory tools for efficiently supporting the learning objectives, enabling students to reach the core of each notion. In this work, a digital multimedia methodology is presented which implements the above dynamic representation approach. Recent, state-of-the-art trends in multimedia technology related to modern two or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) object modelling are utilised in order to efficiently reproduce a virtual mathematical environment in which selected mathematical concepts. Apart from the time-dependent dynamic representation, advanced user interaction features are also supported for determining various representation parameters (such as the view and lighting position, as well as the time resolution/speed). Additionally, accurate 3D sound projection techniques are employed in cases that the spatial sound information enhances the illustrated perceptual effect. For convenient access of the multimedia content, the proposed methodology includes a web interface and a multimedia database, offering advanced searching capabilities.

This instrument was selected on the grounds that it is quite interesting in terms of its playing technique and there has never been a similar attempt to do so to date. Moreover, music in Cretan tradition has been in the spotlight and intrigued a lot of people, not only those originating from Crete. The cretanlyra.app constitutes a recreational and educational application that features a presentation of the Cretan lyre and offers the user the capability of simulated playing, using the same gestures as an actual musician would. The user is instructed by the application so that they will familiarise themselves with playing some well-known melodies of the Cretan tradition. In addition, they can combine the lute sound with playing the lyre.",

In this paper we suggest that engagement in Citizen Science projects applied on Smart Cities infrastructure can be enhanced through contextual and structural game elements realized through augmented audio interactive mechanisms. Our inter-disciplinary framework is described through the paradigm of a collaborative bird call recognition game, in which users collect and submit audio data, which are then classified and used for augmenting physical space with virtual soundscape maps. We discuss the Playful Learning, Internet of Audio Things, and Bird Monitoring principles that shaped the design of our paradigm, and analyze its potential technical implementation.",

In this work we introduce the implementation of a system, capable to react to common spoken words, taking into account the estimated vocal stress level, thus allowing the realization of a prioritized, affective aural interaction path. Upon the successful word recognition and the corresponding stress level estimation, the system triggers particular affective-prioritized actions, defined within the application scope of an intelligent home environment. Application results show that the established affective interaction path significantly improves the ambient intelligence provided by an affective vocal sensor that can be easily integrated with any sensor-based home monitoring system.",

By combining entertaining elements with interactive technologies to deliver the respective curricula they can enhance the development of various skills, as well as serve as platforms for the application of modern educational theories. Audio Games (AG) are a particular genre of electronic games, in which all information is conveyed mainly or exclusively through sound. Thus, players need to employ their sense of hearing to understand and accomplish the necessary tasks, a process that promotes their concentration, memory, fantasy, emotion, perception, data management and cooperation. Even though research findings have shown that both game and audio interaction have positive effects on the user, there has been no systematic approach in designing educational AG and implementing them in the learning process. In this paper the authors attempt to establish the theoretical frame for the design of educational AG by arguing that their features comply with the goals of music education, as these are formulated in the official Program of Music Studies by the Greek Ministry of Education, and in the Primary Years Program on learning Arts by the International Baccalaureate Institution, on local and global level respectively. In that context, three different audio gamification approaches developed by the authors are discussed as suggestions for incorporation into formal education.

Although many existing works focus on emotion recognition from music, there seems to be a relative scarcity of research on emotion recognition from general sounds.

Existing studies that aim to investigate the relation of the latter source placement and the elicited emotions are limited to distance, front and back spatial localization and/or specific emotional categories. In this paper we analytically investigate the effect of the source angular position on the listener's emotional state, modeled in the well-established valence/arousal affective space.

Music has self-referentiality, i.e., does not necessarily relate to extramusical concepts, and is organized on multiple interrelated levels of abstraction, a fact that makes it a peculiar test-bed for AI methods. This chapter focuses on how different AI methods model abstractions from musical surfaces, how they model knowledge, and knowledge acquisition mechanisms. The main categories presented herein are (i) nonadaptive methods that rely on user modeling for generating interesting and meaningful music, (ii) probabilistic approaches that learn, either implicitly or explicitly, from data, and (iii) evolutionary methods that allow intuitive user interaction. Based on the review of such methods, this chapter attempts to highlight some recent algorithmic developments that might lead \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Key changes are common in Western classical music. The precise segmentation of a music piece at instances where key changes occur allows for further analysis, like self-similarity analysis, chord recognition, and several other techniques that mainly pertain to the characterization of music content. This article examines the automatic segmentation of audio data into parts composed in different keys, using clustering on chroma-related spaces. To this end, the  k -means algorithm is used and a methodology is proposed so that useful information about key changes can be derived, regardless of the number of clusters or key changes. The proposed methodology is evaluated by experimenting on the segmentation of recordings of existing compositions from the Classic-Romantic repertoire. Additional analysis is performed using artificial data sets. Specifically, the construction of artificial pieces is proposed as a means to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Algorithmic music synthesis with intelligent methodologies is a subject of research under both unsupervised and supervised forms, with the production of rhythm being an important aspect of the compositional process. Unsupervised algorithms tend to produce rhythms that are described either as simplistic and repetitive, or very complex and unstable. This work examines a modification of the legacy L-systems that are hereby termed as Finite L-systems (FL-systems). With this modification, the produced symbolic sequences are more controllable, offering a rhythm production alternative that is more flexible than the L-systems. In particular, when used for unsupervised rhythm production, FL-systems construct rhythmic sequences with great variability in terms of complexity and repetitiveness. This trend indicates that their combination with learning algorithms may provide a flexible supervised rhythm production system.",

All binaural calculations and audio signal processing/mixing are performed in real-time, due to the employment of an optimized binaural 3D Audio Engine developed by the authors. Moreover, all user operations are performed through a user-friendly graphical interface allowing the efficient control of a large number of binaural mixing parameters.

The methodology followed towards this aim incorporates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms and allows the evoDrummer to provide several alternative rhythms with specific, controlled divergence from the selected base rhythm. To this end, the notion of rhythm divergence is also introduced, based on a set of 40 drum\u2013specific features.

Complete elimination of these distortions usually requires excessive oversampling of the source PCM audio signal, which results to impractical realizations of digital PWM systems. In this paper, a description of digital PWM distortion generation mechanism is given and a novel principle for their minimization is proposed, based on a process having some similarity to the dithering principle employed in multibit signal quantization. This conditioning signal is termed\" jither\" and it can be applied either in the PCM amplitude or the PWM time domain. It is shown that the proposed method achieves \u2026",

For example, in the case of classical music orchestras, their conductors perform sound mixing by specifying the reproduction gain of specific groups of musical instruments or of the entire orchestra. Moreover, modern sound artists and performers also employ sound mixing when they compose music or improvise in real-time. In this work a system is presented that incorporates a gestural interface for real-time multitrack sound mixing. The proposed gestural sound mixing control scheme is implemented on an open hardware micro-controller board, using common sensor modules. The gestures employed are as close as possible to the ones particularly used by the orchestra conductors. The system overall performance is also evaluated in terms of the achieved user experience through subjective tests.",

Existing ARAG implementations have focused on exploring the surroundings and navigating to virtual sound sources as the main mode of interaction. This paper suggests that gestural activity with a handheld device can realize complex modes of sonic interaction in the augmented environment, resulting in an enhanced immersive game experience. The ARAG \u201cAudio Legends\u201d was designed and tested to evaluate the usability and immersion of a system featuring an exploration phase based on auditory navigation, as well as an action phase, in which players aim at virtual sonic targets and wave the device to hit them or hold the device to block them. The results of the experiment provide evidence that players are easily accustomed to auditory navigation and that gestural sonic interaction is perceived as difficult, yet this does not affect negatively the system\u2019s usability and players\u2019 immersion. Findings also include indications that elements, such as sound design, the synchronization of sound and gesture, the fidelity of audio augmentation, and environmental conditions, also affect significantly the game experience, whereas background factors, such as age, sex, and game or music experience, do not have any critical impact.

            "Abstract": "While modern sound researchers generally focus on speech and music, mammalian hearing arose from the need to sense those events in the environment that produced sound waves. Such unorganized sound stimuli, referred to as Sound Events (SEs), can also produce an affective and emotional response. In this research, the investigators explore valence recognition of SEs utilizing rhythm-related acoustics cues. A well-known data set with emotionally annotated SEs was employed; various rhythm-related attributes were then extracted and several machine-learning experiments were conducted. The results portray that the rhythm of a SE can affect the listener\u2019s valence up to an extent and, combined with previous works on SEs, could lead to a comprehensive recognition of the rhythm\u2019s effect on the emotional state of the listener.",

In this work, a novel dither generator is presented, based on a novel stochastic approach that derives a statistically equivalent signal to the original input. Using a sequence of tests as well as objective and psychoacoustic measurements, it is shown that the addition of the proposed dither generator output to the initial input signal and the application of a low-order noise shaper significantly suppresses the quantization error perception.",

Due to the significant character that historical buildings have within the history and identity of local and consequently national communities, the monitoring approach above is nowadays considered a fundamental component of cultural preservation. Modern trends on sensor networks nowadays allow the installation of wireless monitoring equipment, able to collect a large volume and variety of data that can be further processed in order to support prevention modelling techniques and strategies. Despite the valuable post-processing outcome of the above modelling techniques, in several real-time monitoring cases, an aspect that may significant impact the data analysis accuracy from the monitoring engineer is to create an audiovisual \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Sound events are known to have an influence on the listener\u2019s emotions, but the reason for this influence is less clear. Take for example the sound produced by a gun firing. Does the emotional impact arise from the fact that the listener recognizes that a gun produced the sound (semantic content) or does it arise from the attributes of the sound created by the firing gun? This research explores the relation between the semantic similarity of the sound events and the elicited emotions. Results indicate that the semantic content seems to have a limited role in the conformation of the listener\u2019s affective states. However, when the semantic content is matched to specific areas in the Arousal-Valence space or when the source\u2019s spatial position is considered, the effect of the semantic content is higher, especially for the cases of medium to low valence and medium to high arousal or when the sound source is at the lateral positions of the listener\u2019s head.",

            "Abstract": "Close miking represents a widely employed practice of placing a microphone very near to the sound source in order to capture more direct sound and minimize any pickup of ambient sound, including other, concurrently active sources. It is used by the audio engineering community for decades for audio recording, based on a number of empirical rules that were evolved during the recording practice itself. But can this empirical knowledge and close miking practice be systematically verified? In this work we aim to address this question based on an analytic methodology that employs techniques and metrics originating from the sound source separation evaluation field. In particular, we apply a quantitative analysis of the source separation capabilities of the close miking technique. The analysis is applied on a recording dataset obtained at multiple positions of a typical musical hall, multiple distances between the microphone and the sound source multiple microphone types and multiple level differences between the sound source and the ambient acoustic component. For all the above cases we compute the Source to Interference Ratio (SIR) metric. The results obtained clearly demonstrate an optimum close-miking performance that matches the current empirical knowledge of professional audio recording.",

The main motivation of the paper at hand is the analysis of the tonal composition potentialities of several discrete dynamical systems, in comparison to genuine human compositions. Therefore, a set of human musical compositions is utilized to provide \"compositional guidelines\" to several dynamical systems, the parameters of which are properly adjusted through evolutionary computation. This procedure exposes the extent to which a system is capable of composing tonal sequences that resemble human composition.

Routing of the signals is inflexible. Digital audio is frequently wired in a similar way to analog. Although several channels can share a single physical circuit (eg, up to 64 with AES10), thus reducing the number of cores needed in a cable. Routing of signals is still inflexible and any change to the equipment in a location is liable to require new cabling. Networks allow much more flexibility. Any piece of equipment plugged into the network is able to communicate with any other.

Electronic games and augmented reality environments are two such media that can shape powerful modes of interactive and immersive experiences. Audio games in particular, ie electronic games that utilise data sonification and audio interaction techniques to express all narrative and gameplay content, have been proven to enhance players\u2019 skills, such as concentration, memory, fantasy, emotional response, perception, data management and cooperation. However, despite the promising research findings reported in literature, there has been no systematic approach in integrating systems based on audio interaction into formal education. This article suggests that audio games can be designed and implemented for the delivery of targeted curricula through an engaging learning experience, whereas fusing audio game mechanics into new interactive technologies, such as augmented reality environments, will further enhance the students\u2019 immersiveness in the learning process. Towards establishing the theoretical framework for the design of educational audio games, as well as educational augmented reality audio games, the authors review existing approaches and argue that the inherent features of both audio interaction and augmented reality systems agree with the official educational goals formulated by the Greek Ministry of Education and the International Baccalaureate Institution.

We use bioinspired intelligence for developing a world-the Lakewhere multiple tribes of artificial, autonomous agents live within, having survival as their ultimate goal. The tribes exhibit primitive social swarm-based behavior and intelligence, which is used for taking actions that will potentially allow to dominate the game world. Tribes\u2019 populations also demonstrate a number of physical properties that restrict their ability to act illimitably. Multiuser intervention is employed in parallel, affecting the automated decisions and the physical parameters of the tribes, thus infusing the gaming orientation of the application context. Finally, sound synthesis is achieved through a complex mapping scheme established between the events occurring in the Lake and the rhythmic, harmonic and dynamic-range parameters of an advanced, collaborative sound composition engine. This complex mapping scheme allows the production of interesting and complicated sonic patterns that follow the performance evolution in both objective and conceptual levels. The overall synthesis process is controlled by the conductor, a virtual entity that determines the synthesis evolution in a way that is very similar to directing an ensemble performance in real world.",
