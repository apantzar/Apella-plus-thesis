These tools have the potential to substantially improve transparency e.g. by enabling understanding complex legislation and debating. In this paper we present the results of the evaluation of an AV platform by experts and policy makers. The results suggest the potential of such tools is large particularly for understanding complex legislation and debates. The results indicate an AV tool can be also potentially used for massive deliberations when however usability is further improved. They further suggest an AV tool seems particularly relevant to the analysis and policy formation stages of policy making, where identification, elaboration and presentation of complex topics are needed.

Citizens require accessible, user-friendly, personalized, and integrated public services (IPS) that match their needs and circumstances. At the same time, trust in the public sector deteriorates. In Europe, for many years, the EU is devising relevant policies and practical advice, such as the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).

The aim of this paper is to propose an approach towards inclusive IPS co-creation and provision and new technologies exploitation.

GEA has deliberately remained technology independent and following the Model Driven Architecture approach, GEA constitutes a computationally independent model for the domain. GEA has been derived from multi-disciplinary influences and insights and identifies two broad modeling areas, called governance mega-processes: Public Policy Formulation and Service Provision. These two, together with the object versus process perspective, form a four-cell matrix that defines four modeling areas for the GEA models. To populate these cells with \u2026",

In this context, a number of studies have recently explored Social Media\u2019s capability to predict the outcome of real-world phenomena. The results of these studies are controversial with elections being the most disputable phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to present a case of predicting the results of the UK 2010 through Twitter. In particular, we study to what extend it is possible to use Twitter data to accurately predict the percentage of votes of the three most prominent political parties namely the Conservative Party, Liberal Democrats, and the Labour Party. The approach we follow capitalises on (a) a theoretical Social Media data analysis framework for predictions and (b) Linked Open Data to enrich Twitter data. We extensively discuss each step of the framework to emphasise on the details that could affect the prediction \u2026",

Since 2005, many efforts have been made to semantically describe Web services and several models have been proposed towards this direction, e.g. OWL-S, WSMO, SAWSDL. The Web follows a decentralized architecture, thus all the services are available at some location; but finding this location remains an open issue. Many efforts have been proposed to solve the service search problem. In this work, an innovative approach for semantic service search is proposed. Our effort addresses mainly two shortcomings. First, it does not require from the service providers to publish their services or their descriptions in a centralized service registry. Second it exploits the semantic information that exists in semantic service descriptions in order to improve \u2026",

In the context of this paper the term \u201conline sophistication\u201d is closely associated with the support of eGovernance. More specifically, we suggest that online sophistication is measured using four main criteria: web site general characteristics, content provision, eGovernment services and eParticipation. Each of these criterion is measured using a number of metrics, such as accessibility and navigation (for web site general characteristics), information about the region and its services (for content provision), level of online maturity of eGovernment services, and facilitation of online discussions and consultations (for eParticipation). These criteria were used for assessing the Web sites of all 13 Greek regions during winter 2006-2007. The results are promising with room for improvement with the exception of eParticipation that is virtually non-existent in the Web sites of Greek regions.",

The aim of this paper is to understand t-Gov and investigate the level of t-Gov sophistication in Europe by assessing the e-government policies of 18 European Union member states. We first review the relevant literature, to conclude t-Gov embraces nine defining elements namely user-centric services, joined-up government, one-stop government, multichannel service delivery, flexibility, efficiency, increased human skills, organisational change and change of attitude of public servants, and value innovation.

Providing high-level models and definitions for the overall governance system is perceived to be the first step towards standardization and the creation of commonly accepted domain vocabularies and ontologies.

These led to several successful e-Government applications (e.g., see www.epractice.eu). One of the most popular tools that was used by governments in order to modernize their services and make them accessible is e-Government portals, e.g., (Drigas et al. 2005), (Fang 2002). The main goals of such portals are: To make available complete, easy to understand, and structured information about public services and public administration\u2019s modus operandi, which will assist citizens during the service provision process.

The case study, stemming from the EU-funded Once-Only Principle project (TOOP) highlights the challenges faced by the architecture team when developing the Reference Architecture that tackles the Once-Only Principle across different countries and policy domains. The architecture is not built from scratch, but re-uses and enhances already available building blocks in order to seamlessly preserve interoperability and to comply with regulations and existing technical standards, leaving at the same time enough \u2026",

The field of e-participation is highly fragmented, mainly due to the large number of different participation areas, stakeholders, levels of engagement, and stages in policy-making involved. A key challenge for overcoming the complexity and current fragmentation of the field is to achieve interoperability between different e-participation systems, ie assembling e-participation toolsets dynamically according to respective participation processes and needs, and making use of content from different applications and tools. Unfortunately, e-participation toolboxes that ensure interoperability and make use of standards in order to exchange data with other systems are rare.

However, practical knowledge cannot be as easily managed and transferred as information, because it needs social context and interaction.

In this paper we suggest the need for incorporating predictive models into the Linked Data Web. Towards this end, we propose an RDF Schema vocabulary that will enable the creation of predictive models descriptions adhering to the Linked Data principles. The incorporation of these descriptions into the Linked Data Web could create new potentials beyond cross-platform model reuse. In particular, it will enable (a) easy discovery and reuse of appropriate models at a Web Scale and (b) creation of more accurate models exploiting connections of models to other models, datasets and other resources on the Web.",

By reviewing the relevant literature, we suggest that t-Gov embraces nine defining elements, namely user-centric services, joined-up government, one-stop government, multi-channel service delivery, flexibility, efficiency, increased human skills, organizational change and change of attitude of public servants, and finally, value innovation. Based on this understanding, we examine 18 national eGovernment policy documents to determine the degree of t-Gov sophistication.

When the cost of the filling operation increases with the number of scan line segments, as is the case in numerically controlled machining, layered fabrication and computer graphics applications, then it is desirable to select a direction that minimizes this number.

The real value, however, of these open data cubes will unveil from combining and exploiting them in analytics across the Web. Linked data paradigm promises to facilitate the realization of this vision. The RDF data cube (QB) vocabulary, which enables modeling multidimensional data as RDF graphs, is a major step towards this direction. Based on the QB vocabulary a number of data cubes are provided as linked data either by the owners of the data or by third parties. However, existing linked open data cubes do not facilitate the development of generically applicable tools that could use data from different sources. The aim of this paper is to present challenges related to the development of software tools that combine and exploit linked open data cubes in analytics and visualizations. These challenges have been emerged during the development of the OpenCube suite of tools that support the whole linked data cube lifecycle.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the challenges faced by a ministry that is traditionally organized when exploiting LOSD. The preliminary results suggest that major challenges include the absence of a favorable culture and skills mainly related to data governance and software development. Therefore, essential ingredients seem to be missing to create a fertile ground for the use and exploitation of LOSD technology.",

In this paper we examine the possibility to use GORE methodologies and techniques for the analysis of value co-creation in service systems. We regard value co-creation as an abstract, high-end goal of the customer that is accomplished through the integration of service from providers and the complementary application of proprietary resources from the customer and examine the possibility to analyze it with AND/OR goal diagrams. In addition, we examine six GORE methodologies and assess their relevance to the requirements analysis of value co-creation. The results show that GORE can provide a promising methodological foundation for the analysis of value co-creation. In particular, softgoals and\" satisficing\" objectives are extremely useful in analyzing value co-creation and the \u2026",

PSIF studies, models and tries to resolve semantic interoperability conflicts raised during the deployment or the migration of an application by defining the following dimensions: Fundamental PaaS Entities, Types of Semantics, and Levels of Semantic Conflicts. In the context of this paper, the development of common PaaS models and standardized management interfaces are raised as primary requirements in this context. PaaS architectures can then be augmented with a semantic layer that would host the common models and would be the link between heterogeneous PaaS offerings.",

Many efforts have been proposed to solve the service discovery problem but none of them took up. In this work, a lightweight approach for service discovery is proposed. Our approach comprises of three main phases. Firstly, during the crawling phase the semantic service descriptions are retrieved and stored locally. Afterwards, in the homogenization phase the semantics of every description are mapped to a service meta-model and the resulting triples are stored in a \u2026",

Combining and analyzing Open Data from multiple datasets and sources enable the performance of advanced data analytics scenarios that could result in valuable services and data products. However, it is still difficult to discover and combine Open Statistical Data that reside in different data portals. Although Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD) provide standards and approaches to facilitate combining statistics on the Web, various interoperability challenges still exist. In this paper, we propose an Interoperability Framework for LOSD, comprising definitions of LOSD interoperability conflicts as well as modelling practices currently used by six official open government data portals. Towards this end, we combine a top-down approach that studies interoperability conflicts in the literature with a bottom-up approach that studies the modelling practices of data portals. We define two types of LOSD schema-level conflicts, namely naming conflicts and structural conflicts. Naming conflicts result from using different URIs. Structural conflicts result from different practices of modelling the structure of data cubes. Only two out of the 19 conflicts are currently resolved and 11 can be resolved according to literature.

There is therefore a clear need for formulating research strategies to support eParticipation research. In this paper, we first present the European objectives and Programmes relating to eParticipation. We thereafter present DEMO-net, a Network of Excellence in the field of eParticipation funded by the European Commission. DEMO-net aims to strengthen scientific, technological and social research excellence in eParticipation by integrating the research capacities of individuals and organisations spread across Europe. We finally present a strategy proposed by DEMO-net in order to facilitate eParticipation research, to support collaborative excellence in research as well as to face the problem of the existing fragmentation in the field. A key element of the strategy is the division of the project in three phases: building, executing and realising. The strategy involves the establishment of a corpus of research and policy documents, the investigation of the barriers to eParticipation and the establishment of criteria for future eParticipation initiatives.",

However, currently relevant policies, research and practice is fragmented. As a result, current research practices (such as on IPS co-creation) and technologies (eg mobile) have not yet fed relevant policy, such as the European Interoperability Framework. In this poster, inGov project is outlined, which is a research and innovation project funded by the EU under Horizon2020 to overcome this problem. The vision of inGov project is to provide innovative ICT-supported governance models as well as mobile apps including chatbots, which will enable stakeholders\u2019 collaboration in co-producing inclusive and accessible IPS. The project results will be piloted in Malta, Austria, Greece and Croatia. We aim to feed the results back to EU policies \u2026",

Linked Data is a promising paradigm for opening data because it facilitates data integration on the Web. Recently, a growing number of organizations adopted linked data paradigm and provided Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD). These data can be exploited to create added value services and applications that require integrated data from multiple sources. In this paper, we suggest that in order to unleash the full potential of LOSD we need to facilitate the interaction with LOSD and hide most of the complexity. Moreover, we describe the requirements and design criteria of a JSON-QB API  hat (i) facilitates the development of LOSD tools through a style of interaction familiar to web developers and (ii) offers a uniform way to access LOSD.

Specifically, getting the information about all the benefits that someone is entitled to is a very complex task in many countries. To address this problem, a domain ontology is created. The ontology is used as the knowledge base for a semantic application that uses a reasoner. This latter component queries the knowledge base through a web interface by receiving the user's profile as input, and providing as output the benefits that match the specified profile. The application is highly reconfigurable in order to easily accommodate legislation changes. Moreover, the application is transferable to a large number of similar service provision cases in the public administration domain. In light of these, the advantages of semantic web technology and its application to the e-government domain are presented.",

Customer participation in these networks, even though necessary, is usually neglected or submissive to the needs of the business enterprises. Based on the metaphor of 'business ecosystems', this paper argues for the need to introduce customers as active members of business networks and proposes a conceptual and a business model of customer-centric business ecosystems. The business model is based on a technological platform, which enables the development, the dynamic configuration and the coordination of the customer-centric business ecosystem. The operations of the platform follow the paradigm of service oriented architectures and they can be implemented with the use of Web services. The paper \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Electronic Government (eGovernment) is currently facing significant challenges particularly due to the economic crisis which suggests governments should provide more with fewer resources. During the last few years, cloud computing emerged as a new computing paradigm with significant potential. The use of cloud computing in eGovernment has inevitably attracted significant attention from the research community. However, views of researchers and practitioners about the ways and the extent to which cloud computing can be adopted at the national level in order to facilitate eGovernment vary notably. The aim of this paper is to map cloud computing adoption by governments. For this purpose, a stage model was developed by employing the thematic analysis method based on both academic and grey literature. The proposed model is applicable at the national level and consists of four stages: ad-hoc eGov cloud solutions, cloud-based public services, eGov cloud (s) and diffusion of cloud computing in eGov. It should be noted that at this phase the authors\u2019 research is of an exploratory nature thus the model has not been validated with empirical data. Its purpose is to facilitate further research on the topic and help governments determine their progress in adopting cloud computing.",

However, we observe that few games have been designed with use in the flipped classroom in mind, and there is therefore potential to improve the flipped classroom experience by approaching the development and integration of games with a more holistic and adaptive experience in mind. For that purpose, a focus group of educators was assembled for a pilot project and their educational practices, objectives and gaming experience analyzed. Following this investigation, co-constructed game design choices were made to try and develop a game that could support a variety of subjects and learning experience in the FC. Although the focus group answers showed that a fully adaptive gaming experience needed, for reasons of flexibility, to lean towards a gamified platform, the final design solution can have the potential to support fully the flipped classroom experience for any subject or class desired.",

            "Abstract": "Value creation in e-commerce is dominated by business-oriented approaches. For example, the two basic types of e-commerce, B2B and B2C, aim at business cooperation or exchanges and increased sales, respectively. The tacit assumptions here are that business firms know (better) customers\u2019 needs and value comes for the business firm and the customer alike through the improvement of the business processes. A shift in the conceptualization of value creation from business-oriented to consumeroriented approaches is taking place gradually in the recent literature. The consumer is recognized as a \u201cco-creator of value\u201d and the business firm as a \u201cservice provider\u201d, which operates to provide benefit (ie \u201cservice\u201d) to the consumer. The value for the consumer derives from the combination of service elements that usually come from different providers, because of the complex nature and the diversity of people\u2019s needs. The role of the business firm is to support the consumer in creating value by enabling his participation in value creation and by producing products and services as the pre-conditions for value creation.This chapter contributes in the development of consumer-oriented e-commerce, that is ecommerce models that focus on the needs of the consumer (the end-customer, the individual), by providing a conceptual framework and an extended SOA model. The purpose of consumer-oriented e-commerce is to empower the consumer in the creation of value according to his personal preferences and needs by composing service from different business firms.

Facilitating learning through the use of ICT, also known as eLearning, is a vital part of modern educational systems. Established pedagogical strategies, such as Problem Based Learning (PBL), are being adapted for online use in conjunction with modern Web 2.0 technologies and tools. However, even though Web 2.0 and progressive social-networking technologies are automatically associated with ideals such as collaboration, sharing, and active learning, it is also possible to use them in a very conservative, teacher-centred way limiting thus their impact. In this paper, we present PBL 2.0 framework, ie, a framework combining PBL practices with Web 2.0 technologies. More specifically, we (a) explain the \u2026",

The objective of this paper is to accumulate this body of knowledge and provide a preliminary analysis of the research results in the area so far. Towards this end, we systematically reviewed the scientific literature to identify relevant studies. These studies were analysed and synthesised in the form of a proposed conceptual framework, which was thereafter applied   to further analyse this literature, hence gaining new insights into the field. The framework comprises three dimensions, namely category of contribution, step of data analysis, and application area. The application of the framework resulted in interesting findings. For example, the majority of the contributions that focus on publishing linked data cubes are cases while the majority of the exploitation contributions are software tools. Moreover, integration of data cubes remains largely unexamined in the literature. This paper, however, does not present the final results of the analysis of the literature as this is still an ongoing activity.",

            "Abstract": "The life-event concept is a meaningful metaphor aiming to reduce the gap between citizens\u2019 needs and provided public services. It enables public services to be composed in more sophisticated services that are able to satisfy more advanced citizens\u2019 expectations. Despite many recent efforts, however, implementing life events remains a challenge. Most of existing technologies that can be used to implement life events are either too static to effectively incorporate possible variations in citizens\u2019 needs and circumstances or too dynamic to be efficiently used by public administrations. In this paper we present an approach for implementing life events that is based on generic workflows technologies. This approach benefits from organising life events as processes (workflow management) and making them more flexible by including dynamic rules (rule management). To show suitability of the approach, we first determine the main requirements for implementing life events and then present how they are satisfied when adopting generic workflows technologies. The described functionality is illustrated with real life-event examples which are currently analysed in OneStopGov, a European Commission co-funded project.",

Big agricultural data can be used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes. However, the exploitation and integration of big agricultural data is not straightforward because: i) raw data (eg sensor data, satelite images) need to be further processed in order to extract valuable indicators (eg Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) or to be aggregated to the proper granularity level and ii) meta-data are needed to facilitate the exploration and integration of data (eg integrate data that have the same spatial and temporal coverage). In this paper, we study the characteristics of big agricultural data and propose a semantic model approach that facilitates their exploitation and integration. Towards this direction we study the semantic challenges that come up (eg granularity of data, data integration) and their potential solutions.",

To fulfil this objective we reviewed the relevant literature and examined 18 case studies of European eGovernment applications where interoperability has a significant role. The results enabled us to identify a number of critical factors categorized as technical, semantic, organizational, political, legal, managerial and economic. We believe that the results of this research can be used by practitioners and researchers alike. Practitioners may use the results as guidance when developing their own applications. Researchers can further extend these results, for example, by attempting to better understand current trends, by identifying additional critical factors and by investigating the relationships between factors.",

Using the portal, PA clients will be guided through an online structured discussion (ie a set of questions and answers) with public administration. As a result of this discussion the portal provides PA clients with all necessary information on the appropriate service (s) that cover their needs. Furthermore, the appropriate service (s) instance (s) which can be invoked though the portal are electronically available.",

Linked Data has been employed by some of these as a paradigm that allows for the provision of structured, semantically enabled and linkable data on the Web. The objective of this article is to discuss how Linked Data has been used in government data provision so far and to describe an architecture that will enable the provision of integrated government data around real-world things in a decentralized manner. Moreover, an implementation of the specific architecture is described in detail employing a hypothetical use case scenario that involves real world public agencies and schools. This implementation includes among others the publishing of Linked Data on top of a relational database and inline the HTML code of a web page as well \u2026",

However, despite its widespread adoption, there is currently no systematic work towards understanding and defining life events. The aim of this paper is to create a common understanding of the life-event concept. First, it investigates the life-event concept and proposes a suitable definition. Second, it proposes a preliminary framework for modelling life events based on a simple, systemic model for public services. This framework is validated by means of an example. Finally, available options for implementing a life-event portal are outlined while ideas for the further direction of this work are suggested.",

The open, generic Reference Architecture for Semantically Interoperable Clouds introduces a scalable, reusable and transferable approach for facilitating the design, deployment and execution of resource intensive SOA services on top of semantically interlinked Clouds. In order to support the development of semantically interoperable Cloud systems based on RASIC, the model of a common Cloud API is also specified.",

In this context, students are required to engage with pre- and/or post-class activities in order to prepare themselves for class work. The FC instruction method has already been used in conjunction with other learning strategies. This theoretical paper presents the first developmental steps of a research project, which aims at building the FC through a fully bespoke and personalized experience, by using data-driven adaptable games and problem-based learning elements to improve the learning experience. The project will develop a gaming platform that will support the whole FC in a cyclical perspective, and aims to use the resources of gamification in a more significant manner that could go beyond score tracking and badges. Moreover, the problem-based learning approach will be used to better frame the learning activities included in FCs, while learning analytics features will provide adaptable learning pathways. The potential of this approach is to build a better FC experience for all the stakeholders. Students will be given more agency to calibrate their learning experience, while educators can monitor the students\u2019 progress more effectively and adjust their learning activities accordingly. Finally, researchers will get better insight into the FC learning process, and the mechanics, which contribute to optimize the learning experience.",

This results in identifying a unified requirements set, i.e. 186 requirements, and stakeholders set, i.e. 19 stakeholders, for eGov PSP systems. Based on these findings, we determine 16 overview use cases demonstrating the basic functionality of such systems. Our findings are modeled using ArchiMate 2.0 notation.

However, policies in the field continue to identify limitations and issues that are required to be addressed and solved (European Commission, 2010). Moreover, the current ever-changing world causes economies, trends, technologies and professional domains to constantly shift and transform. To this end, all sectors require competent employees with lifelong learning abilities and skills to quickly adapt and contribute to economic growth and boost societal benefits (EU, 2010).This paper presents the PBL3. 0 project that aims at enhancing Problem Based Learning (PBL) with Learning Analytics (LA) and Learning Semantics (LS) in order to produce a new educational paradigm and pilot it to produce relevant policy recommendations. To this end, the project constructed a new educational approach that combines a well-established learning strategy like PBL with novel technologies in learning, aiming also at respecting legal and ethical considerations (PBL_LA). Moreover, a semantic model for PBL_LA was designed that enables the annotation of learning resources in order to easily integrate them to the PBL approach and enable their discoverability when setting personalized learning pathways. During the project, a set of open source software tools, analytics tools, and an intuitive semantic annotation tool were employed in order to support the PBL_LA and the semantic model on existing Learning \u2026",

            "Abstract": "According to the European Commission (2008a), many people today are losing interest and confidence in the way their countries are being governed. Issues of trust, openness and transparency are being frequently and intensely discussed (Millard et al, 2008) as the public manifests lack of confidence in public servants and governmental institutions. At the same time, public apathy and dissatisfaction is also evident through decreasing turnout rates at elections, which further lead to representatives elected by a minority of the electorate and to a feeling of loss of ownership of the democratic process. In this context, citizens increasingly demand greater transparency and accountability from the government, and favour public participation in the shaping of policies that affect them (OECD, 2001).Public participation is about citizen power. It provides the means for deliberately including all citizens in policy and decision making by incorporating their concerns, needs and values into these processes (Arnstein, 1969 and Creighton, 2005). This is achieved by setting in place the appropriate procedures for informing, consulting and involving citizens affected by a decision to have an input into that decision (Smith and Nell, 1997). Current Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have made it possible to enhance traditional participation procedures by electronic means, introducing in this way the concept of electronic Participation (eParticipation).",

According to the OECD, globalization, democracy issues, security risks, ageing societies and modern cultures are the global mega-trends affecting the way education deploys its functions. Enterprise Architecture (EA), as a key enabler of strategy formulation and business-IT alignment, could play a central role in helping ministries and educational organizations develop their full IT strategy and gain a competitive advantage. In this perspective, a systematic EA mapping study was conducted on major research databases, academic journals and conference proceedings, in order to identify the major approaches and challenges of EA in the education domain. A total amount of 60 articles from the past 10 years were found and analyzed (e.g. the EA lifecycle phase of each initiative). Our analysis reveals that most research \u2026",

Public Administration (PA) is a huge organization with several different activities, with stakeholders that may have conflicting interests or different priorities etc. The application of the organizational engineering approaches in the PA domain can help towards its modernization. One initial step to this direction is to create the appropriate domain models as generic and reusable representations so as to use them as blueprints for modeling the organizations of interest. In this work, we have included the state-of-the-art in eGovernment domain models. We have grouped these initiatives to the following three categories depending on their modeling perspective: object, process and holistic and assess their pros and cons.",

The area of eparticipation is currently a rapidly evolving one. Although, a few eparticipation-related frameworks have been developed they actually aimed to address specific purposes. As a result, there is no work aiming to model the whole eparticipation domain. In this paper, a first attempt to model the domain of eparticipation is presented. For this purpose, we identify and describe the most significant aspects that characterize the eparticipation domain according to the relevant literature. In addition, we define a domain model in order to formally describe these aspects and the relationships between them.

Some of these issues can be addressed by making available aggregated instead of raw record-level data. In many cases however, there is still a need for controlling access even to the resulting aggregated data, e.g., due to data provider\u2019s policies.

            "Abstract": "Billions of people everyday use Social Media (SM), such as Facebook and Twitter, to express their opinions and experiences with brands. Companies are highly interested in understanding such SM brand-related content. Consequently, many studies have been conducted and many applications have been developed to analyse this content. For analysis purposes, the main SM metrics used include volume and sentiment. Interestingly, however, brand equity theory proposes different metrics for assessing brand reputation. These include brand image, brand satisfaction and purchase intention (henceforth referred to as marketing metrics). The objective of this paper is to explore the feasibility of applying marketing metrics in Twitter brand-related content. For this purpose, we collect, study and analyse tweets that mention two brands, namely IKEA and Gatorade. The manual analysis suggests that a significant amount of brand tweets is related to brand image, brand satisfaction and purchase intention. We thereafter design an algorithm that classifies tweets into relevant categories to enable automatic marketing metrics computation. We implement the algorithm using statistical learning approaches and prove that its classification accuracy is good. We anticipate that this article will motivate other studies as well as applications\u2019 designers in adopting marketing theories when evaluating brand reputation through SM content.",

This model is part of a family of models that have been developed for the domain of governance and includes models of both data and process. This family of models comprises the so-called Governance Enterprise Architecture-GEA. The model presented in this paper analyses the sequence of phases through which any public administration service goes through when delivered to its customers. We intend to validate this model and then apply it as part of an e-government ERP kernel that could be easily parameterised and configured for a variety of different services offered by public administration at its different levels and in different countries.",

To shed light on this major breach, an analysis is performed regarding the types of information that have been produced and used by the state through time, as well as the methods employed for information processing and dissemination of information in three stages, tribal, massive and configurational. The paper reviews the effects of information technology on general organization by structuring these effects in four stages: islands of automation, automated process chains, business reengineering through IT and total reinvention. It then analyses the fourth stage as it applies to government and public administration in particular. The major changes brought upon government and public administration through IT in this fourth phase appear to have profound effects forcing even a reconsideration of what public administrations should produce and why. For this new era, an organizational, information systems and political paradigm for public administration is proposed.",

However, we observe that few games have been designed with use in the flipped classroom in mind, and there is therefore potential to improve the flipped classroom experience by approaching the development and integration of games with a more holistic and adaptive experience in mind. For that purpose, a focus group of educators was assembled for a pilot project and their educational practices, objectives and gaming experience analyzed. Following this investigation, co-constructed game design choices were made to try and develop a game that could support a variety of subjects and learning experience in the FC.

Open Statistical Data (OSD), which are highly structured and generally of high quality, can be used in advanced decision making scenarios that involve machine learning analysis. Linked data technologies facilitate the discovery, retrieval, and combination of data on the Web. They enable this way the wide exploitation of OSD in machine learning. A challenge in such analyses is to specify the criteria for selecting the proper datasets to combine and construct a predictive model. This paper presents a case study that aims at creating a model to predict house sales prices in fine grained geographical areas in Scotland using a large variety of Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD) from the Scottish official statistics portal. To this end, we present the machine learning analysis steps that can be enhanced using LOSD and we define a set of compatibility criteria. A software tool is also presented as a proof of concept for facilitating the exploitation of LOSD in machine learning. The case study proves the importance of discovering and combining compatible datasets when implementing machine learning scenarios for decision-making.",

The declaration process is extremely complex and hence imposes significant administrative burdens on citizens and businesses. The objective of this paper is to develop an e-government solution for reducing the administrative burdens related to the informative stage of the specific public service. By informative stage we refer to all these actions that one needs to undertake to obtain all essential information in order to be capable of executing a specific service. The analysis of this service suggest that its complexity is mainly related to the different supporting documents that need to be submitted along with the declaration form, which depend on a number of factors. Consequently, an online dialogue was suggested that enables automatic identification of the input documents to be submitted. The dialogue was modelled using BPMN and developed in an open source environment. This approach is expected to significantly reduce administrative burdens in this service. Most importantly, the followed approach can be also applied in other complex public services.",

Recently, National Statistical Institutes and public authorities adopted the Linked Data paradigm to publish their statistical data on the Web. Many vocabularies have been created to enable modeling data cubes as RDF graphs, and thus creating Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD). However, the creation of LOSD remains a demanding task mainly because of modeling challenges related either to the conceptual definition of the cube, or to the way of modeling cubes as linked data.

The input to the application consists of the user profile, while the output returned consists of the public services that match the specified profile.",

Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is such a strategy, since it enables active participation by shifting the focus from the delivery of knowledge to its creation by the students, in their endeavour to implement problem-based projects. PBL is more commonly used in project-oriented courses, where students have to not only build but also apply new knowledge in real world contexts and therefore familiarize themselves with work conditions. Online technologies, such as cognitive tools, are able to harmonize this shift by visualizing some of the more demanding steps of PBL as well as facilitating collaboration and knowledge building.

Therefore, a logical step for governments is to move the provision of public services online. However, public services have a complex structure and may span across multiple, disparate public agencies. Moreover, the legislation that governs a public service is usually difficult for a layman to understand. Despite this, governments have created online portals to enable citizens to find out about and utilise specific public services. While this is positive, most portals fail to engage citizens because they do not manage to hide the complexity of public services from users. Many also fail to address the specific needs \u2026",

Existing approaches are hampered by the complexity of underlying semantic service models and by the fact that they try to impose a technical vocabulary to users. This leads to what we call the service discovery gap. In this paper we envision an approach that allows users to query or browse services using free text tags, thus providing an interface in terms of the users' vocabulary instead of the service\u2019s vocabulary. Unlike simple keyword search, we envision tag clouds associated with services themselves as semantic descriptions carrying collaborative knowledge about the service that can be clustered hierarchically, forming lightweight \u201contologies\u201d. Besides tag-based discovery only describing the service on a global view, we envision refined tags and refined search/discovery in terms of the concepts that are common to all current semantic service description models, ie input, output, and operation. We argue that Service matching can be achieved, by applying tag-cloud-based service similarity on the one hand and by clustering services using case based indexing and retrieval techniques on the other hand.",

            "Abstract": "The need for a citizen or business oriented approach in public administration resulted in the introduction of the life-events and business episodes concepts. A life-event can be considered as a metaphor for identifying the public services related to the specific situation that citizens face eg getting married. Similarly, business episodes have been introduced for businesses, eg opening a new business. Life-events and business episodes can be considered as workflows of public services and actions. For example the lifeevent \u201cgetting married in Greece\u201d can be considered as a workflow that consists of the following public services and actions executed in sequence: issuing a marriage permit, issuing a marriage ceremony licence, the ceremony and finally the declaration of marriage. Therefore, life-events and business episodes can be better modelled and thereafter implemented if we could identify common workflow patterns that are used in each case. According to the literature there are a number of workflow patterns such as sequence, parallel split, synchronisation etc. In this paper, we model some important life-events and business episodes in various European countries. The modelled life-events include getting married while modelled business episodes include opening a new business example. We thereafter use these models in order to identify and analyse the workflow patterns that are used in each case. An interesting finding of the analysis is that life-events and business episodes follow a small only number of possible workflow patterns. These early findings are promising as they are anticipated to assist in modelling life-events and business \u2026",

We finally present an architecture and prototype implementation for the most advanced OGD class in our scheme, which enables linking decentralised data.",

            "Abstract": "As SOA matures the number of services made available on the Web increases steadily. At the same time, Web 2.0 allows people to easily combine content from different sources and to create mashups, which are becoming a new service species, mainly generated by users. In this paper, we extend and enhance service descriptions by involving users and including information related to their views and behavior. We borrow ideas and extend the models and practices for the annotation of Web content and information resources that has recently become popular in widelyused social platforms. This means that users are encouraged to describe in their own terms the services they use. As this metadata emerges directly or indirectly from the users, we call them social metadata or social semantics. In this context collective intelligence emerges dynamically and in a bottom-up fashion from the social metadata of the services. Our approach aims at strengthening the user participation in the Web and more generally in the service industry by providing service metadata, which are later used as a form of lightweight user-side semantic annotation of services. This annotation is provided directly and explicitly by the users and/or implicitly by identifying patterns in the users' behavior. This type of service annotation acts supplementary to the description of services initially provided by the service providers and is linked to the actual use of the services in the real world. We can harvest the extracted knowledge and use it for improving the search for services on the Web or for facilitating the clustering of services. The final goal remains to improve service quality through \u2026",

The adoption of the Linked Data principles and technologies has promised to enhance the analysis of statistical data at a Web scale. Statistical data, however, is typically organized in data cubes where a numeric fact is categorized by dimensions. Both data cubes and Linked Data introduce complexity that raises the barrier for opening up and reusing statistical data. In this paper we describe the first release of the OpenCube toolkit that aims at supporting the whole lifecycle of linked data cubes. In particular, the OpenCube toolkit supports transforming raw data into RDF data cubes, attaching metadata, and providing query access to them. In addition, the toolkit enables linked data cube browsing and exploration as well as performing data analytics in an easy manner.",

As the amount of data available increases, so too should the exploitation of this data. However, this potential currently seems to be unexploited. Since exploiting open government data has the potential to create new public value, the absence of this exploitation is something that should be explored. It is therefore timely to investigate how the potential of existing datasets could be unleashed to provide services that create public value. For this purpose, we conducted a literature study and an empirical survey of the relevant drivers, barriers and gaps. Based on the results, we propose a framework that addresses some of the key challenges and puts forward an agile co-production process to support effective data-driven service creation.

Specifically, getting the information about all the benefits that someone is entitled of is a very complex task in many countries. To address this problem, a domain ontology is first created in OWL (Web Ontology Language). The ontology is used as the knowledge base for a semantic application that uses a reasoner. This latter queries the knowledge base through a web interface by receiving the user\u2019s profile as input, and providing the benefits that match to the specified profile as output. A list of the required documents and the procedure for receiving the various benefits from the appropriate service provider is also returned. In this way, a complex procedure is simplified and a serious overload on the client\u2019s side (being business or citizen). is relaxed The application is highly reconfigurable in order to eg easily accommodate legislation changes. It accommodates law changes by ontology modifications. Moreover, the application is transferable to a large number of similar service provision cases in the public administration domain. In light of these, the advantages of semantic web technology and their application to the e-government domain are discussed.",
