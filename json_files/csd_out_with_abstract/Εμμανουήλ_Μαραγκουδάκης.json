The particular service is addressed mainly to scientists who lack of data mining domain expertise but want to investigate hidden relationships among their experimental or observational data. A novelty of the proposed service relies on the fact that it proposes a common data presentation format which is scalable, robust and extensible, thus allowing scientists from different applications areas to adapt their raw data and use the proposed service. This particular service introduces the most proper data mining technique by investigating several complementary principles like Bayesian networks, neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines and other core algorithms from the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The service has been effectively used in a case study which is briefly described.",

Thus, it is crucial for the administration of the institutions to set new strategies and plans for a better management of the current processes. Furthermore, the managerial decision is becoming more difficult as the complexity of educational entities increase. The purpose of this study is to suggest a way to support the administration of a HEI by providing new knowledge related to the educational processes using data mining techniques. This knowledge can be extracted among other from educational data that derive from the evaluation processes that each department of a HEI conducts. These data can be found in educational databases, in students\u2019 questionnaires or in faculty members\u2019 records.

            "Abstract": "For the present work, we deal with the significant problem of high imbalance in data in binary or multi-class classification problems. We study two different linguistic applications. The former determines whether a syntactic construction (environment) co-occurs with a verb in a natural text corpus consists a subcategorization frame of the verb or not. The latter is called Name Entity Recognition (NER) and it concerns determining whether a noun belongs to a specific Name Entity class. Regarding the subcategorization domain, each environment is encoded as a vector of heterogeneous attributes, where a very high imbalance between positive and negative examples is observed (an imbalance ratio of approximately 1: 80). In the NER application, the imbalance between a name entity class and the negative class is even greater (1: 120). In order to confront the plethora of negative instances, we suggest a search tactic during training phase that employs Tomek links for reducing unnecessary negative examples from the training set. Regarding the classification mechanism, we argue that Bayesian networks are well suited and we propose a novel network structure which efficiently handles heterogeneous attributes without discretization and is more classification-oriented. Comparing the experimental results with those of other known machine learning algorithms, our methodology performs significantly better in detecting examples of the rare class.",

The performance of the prediction model reaches a level of 97% in terms of precision and recall, improving the existing state-of-the-art levels achieved by Neural Networks by a factor of 1.5%-2%.

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing (CC) can offer significant benefits to enterprises. However, it can pose some risks as well, and this has led to lower adoption than the initial expectations. For this reason, it would be very useful to develop \u2018predictive analytics\u2019 in this area, enabling us to predict which enterprises will exhibit a propensity for CC adoption. In this direction, we investigate the use of six well-established classifiers (fast large margin Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Linear Regression) for the prediction of enterprise level propensity for CC adoption. Having as our theoretical foundation the Technology\u2013Organization\u2013Environment (TOE) framework, we are using for this prediction of set of technological (concerning existing enterprise information systems), organizational and environmental characteristics. Our first results, using a dataset collected from 676 manufacturing firms of the glass, ceramic and cement sectors from six European countries (Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Spain, and UK) through the e-Business W@ tch Survey of the European Commission, are encouraging. It is concluded that among the examined characteristics the technological ones, concerning the existing enterprise systems, seem to be the most important predictors.",

            "Abstract": "Climate change and its impact on everyday life still remains one of the greatest challenge of our era. The complex nature of climate data addresses the use of data science techniques to provide predictive analytics to the task at hand. While most existing approaches exploit correlation between observations and features to improve forecasting, the present work deals with causality, a principle that enhances robustness and provides better insight to domain experts. More specifically, a novel framework for causality discovery is proposed, based on statistical (ie Granger causality tests) as well as on nonlinear state space reconstruction algorithms (ie Convergent Cross Mapping, a very effective algorithm in dynamic systems, such as the task at hand) in order to find the causal relations between meteorological time series. Furthermore, the framework also supports methods for graph analysis, thus providing informative visualizations on the influential levels of causality. Experiment results on a dataset of real observations from different cities of Greece, obtained through crawling of Internet sites of Davis weather stations demonstrate the ability to model and visualize the relations of the meteorological parameters amongst the cities. Moreover, by utilizing such causal inference knowledge, the forecasting performance for each city is significantly improved, since only relevant and informative features were taken into consideration.",

            "Abstract": "This paper describes Eksairesis, a system for learning economic domain knowledge automatically from Modern Greek text. The knowledge is in the form of economic terms and the semantic relations that govern them. The entire process in based on the use of minimal language-dependent tools, no external linguistic resources, and merely free, unstructured text. The methodology is thereby easily portable to other domains and other languages. The text is pre-processed with basic morphological annotation, and semantic (named and other) entities are identified using supervised learning techniques. Statistical filtering, ie corpora comparison is used to extract domain terms and supervised learning is again employed to detect the semantic relations between pairs of terms. Advanced classification schemata, ensemble learning, and one-sided sampling, are experimented with in order to deal with the noise in the data, which is unavoidable due to the low pre-processing level and the lack of sophisticated resources. An average f-score of 68, 5% over all the classes is achieved when learning semantic relations. Bearing in mind the use of minimal resources and the highly automated nature of the process, classification performance is very promising, compared to results reported in previous work.",

By taking advantage of the plethora in unlabeled data found in image databases in addition to some available labeled examples, we overcome the expensive task of annotating the whole set of training data and the performance of the character segmentation learner is increased. Apart from this approach, which has not previously used for this task, we have experimented with two well-known machine learning methods (Learning Vector Quantization and a simplified version of the Transformation-Based Learning theory). We argue that a classifier generated from BBN and SVM is well suited for learning to identify the correct segment boundaries. Empirical results will support this claim. Performance has been methodically evaluated using both English and Modern Greek corpora in order to determine the unbiased behaviour of the trained models. Limited training data are proved to endow with satisfactory results. We have been able to achieve precision exceeding 86%.",

The proposed methodology takes as input the data received from weather sensors and in following the winter precipitation model aims at forecasting the weather type given three precipitation classes, namely rain, freezing rain, and snow, as registered in the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS). To enable the proposed classification, six supervised machine learning models were selected: Naive Bayes, Decision Stump, Hoeffding Tree, HoeffdingOption Tree, HoeffdingAdaptive Tree, and OzaBag. Results depicted that all the models performed well in terms of accuracy and computation time, while some achieved even better outcomes. Specifically, among all six models, OzaBag presented the best classification results, followed by HoeffdingOption Tree.",

Similar to text generation based on parts of text we are able to generate a molecule architecture based on an existing target. By adopting this approach, we propose a novel way of searching for existing compounds that are suitable candidates. Similar to question and answer Natural Language solutions we are able to find drugs with highest relevance to a target. We are able to identify substructures of the molecular structure that are the most suitable for binding. In addition, we are proposing a novel way of generating the molecule in 3D space in such a way that the binding is optimized. We show that we are able to generate compound structures and protein structures that are optimised for binding to a target.",

Weights can be essential for social network analysis, but they pose new challenges to privacy preserving network analysis. In this paper, we mainly consider prevention of identity disclosure, but we also touch on edge and edge weight disclosure in weighted graphs. We propose a method that provides k-anonymity of nodes against attacks where the adversary has information about the structure of the network, including its edge weights. The method is efficient, and it has been evaluated in terms of privacy and utility on real word datasets.",

To overcome the drop in accuracy when predicting instances of the rare class due to this disproportion, we balance the learning data by applying one-sided sampling to the training corpus and thus by reducing the number of non-complement instances.

The paper uses time series analysis techniques such as Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to study the existence of a relation between price data and textual information, either from news or social media. Pattern matching techniques from time series data are also incorporated, in order to experimentally validate potential correlations of price and textual information within given time periods. The ultimate goal is to create a forecasting model that exploits the previously discovered patterns in order to augment the forecasting accuracy. Results obtained from the experimental phase are promising. The performance of the classifier shows clear signs of improvement and robustness within the time periods where patterns between stock price and the textual information have been identified, compared to the periods where patterns did not exist.

We have made use of minimal linguistic resources, such as basic morphological tagging and phrase chunking, to demonstrate that verb subcategorization, which is of great significance for developing robust natural language human computer interaction systems, could be achieved using large corpora, without having any general-purpose syntactic parser at all. Moreover, by taking advantage of the plethora in unlabeled data found in text corpora in addition to some available labeled examples, we overcome the expensive task of annotating the whole set of training data and the performance of the subcategorization frames learner is increased. We argue that a classifier generated from BBN and SVM is well suited for learning to identify verb subcategorization frames. Empirical results will support this claim. Performance has been methodically evaluated using two different corpora, one balanced and one domain-specific in order to determine the unbiased behavior of the trained models. Limited training data are proved to endow with satisfactory results.

            "Abstract": "For the present work, we endeavor with the important aspect of information retrieval of Web content using natural language queries. Currently, markup languages and formalisms do not fully provide mechanisms for effective and accurate analysis of Web content but rather provide means for describing the content in a more human-centric approach. As a result, natural language queries cannot be handled by the Internet search engines. Other approaches use grammar markup labels that attempt to fully match an unforeseen query. For the purposes of this paper, we introduce the theoretical and implementation issues of a novel, statistical framework that can cope with Web content analysis and information retrieval using natural language. The framework is based on Bayesian networks, a tool for knowledge representation and reasoning under conditions of uncertainty. The Web page designer provides the lexical items that contain useful information and labels the corresponding semantic interpretation, from a pre-defined set of domain categories. This knowledge is used for learning the structure and the parameters of a Bayesian network. At the time a user\u2019s query is encountered, the network is used in order to return pages that contain the most related semantic content to the user\u2019s query.",

Thus far, there have been a number of research papers that emphasize solely in past data from stock bond prices and other technical indicators.

            "Abstract": "For the present work, we introduce and evaluate a novel Bayesian syntactic shallow parser that is able to perform robust detection of pairs of subject-object and subject-direct object-indirect object for a given verb, in a natural language sentence. The shallow parser infers on the correct subject-object pairs based on knowledge provided by Bayesian network learning from annotated text corpora. The DELOS corpus, a collection of economic domain texts that has been automatically annotated using various morphological and syntactic tools was used as training material. Our shallow parser makes use of limited linguistic input. More specifically, we consider only part of speech tagging, the voice and the mood of the verb as well as the head word of a noun phrase. For the task of detecting the head word of a phrase we used a sentence boundary detector. Identifying the head word of a noun phrase, ie the word that holds the morphological information (case, number) of the whole phrase, also proves to be very helpful for our task as its morphological tag is all the information that is needed regarding the phrase. The evaluation of the proposed method was performed against three other machine learning techniques, namely na\u00efve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines, methods that have been previously applied to natural language processing tasks with satisfactory results. The experimental outcomes portray a satisfactory performance of our proposed shallow parser, which reaches almost 92 per cent in terms of precision.",

            "Abstract": "One of the most common tasks nowadays in big data environments is the need to classify large amounts of data. There are numerous classification models designed to perform best in different environments and datasets, each with its advantages and disadvantages. However, when dealing with big data, their performance is significantly degraded because they are not designed\u2014or even capable\u2014of handling very large datasets. The current approach is based on a novel proposal of exploiting the dynamics of skyline queries to efficiently identify the decision boundary and classify big data. A comparison against the popular k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM) and na\u00efve Bayes classification algorithms shows that the proposed method is faster than the k-NN and the SVM. The novelty of this method is based on the fact that only a small number of computations are needed in order to make a prediction, while its full potential is revealed in very large datasets.

In order to cope with the plethora of negative examples, we propose a search tactic during training that employs Tomek links for eliminating unnecessary negative examples from the training set.

            "Abstract": "The large scale application of ICT-based assistive environment technologies for the home care of elderly and disabled people is going to generate huge numbers of signals transmitted from homes to local health centers or hospitals in order to be monitored by medical personnel. This task is going to be of critical importance and at the same time-if manually performed-quite demanding for specialized human resources and costly. In order to perform it in a cost-efficient manner it is necessary to develop mechanisms and methods for automated screening of these signals in order to identify abnormal ones that require some action to be taken. This paper proposes a method for automatic screening of heart sound signals, which are the most widely acquired signals from the human body for diagnostic purposes in both the'traditional'medicine and the emerging ICT-based assistive environments.

            "Abstract": "One of the most common classification tasks that applies on textual information is sentiment analysis, i.e. the prediction of the sentiment of a given document. With the vast use of social media and internet applications such as e-commerce, e-tourism and e-government, numerous comments and opinions are broadcasted per day, thus an automatic way of analyzing them is of great importance. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis for Greek texts, obtained from Web 2.0 platforms. Greek is a language that lacks an in-depth availability of natural language processing tools in the sense that most of them are not publicly available. The novelty of the article is that instead of utilizing preprocessing tools such as Part-of-Speech taggers, text stemmers and polar-word lexica, it incorporates the translation of the Greek token as provided by the Google Translator\u00ae API.

In addition,-from the tutors\u2019 perspectivethe problem solving strategies of the students are often particularly difficult to identify. In this paper, we argue that such problems could be tackled using machine learning techniques such as Bayesian Networks.

The recent event of Hong Kong protests triggered an outburst of fake news posts that were identified on Twitter, which were then promptly removed and compiled into datasets to promote research. These datasets focusing on linguistic content were used in previous work to classify between tweets spreading fake and real news using traditional machine learning algorithms (Zervopoulos et al., in: IFIP international conference on artificial intelligence applications and innovations, Springer, Berlin, 2020).

By considering two different conditional independence assumptions, the na\u00efve Bayes and Bayesian networks approaches were regarded and evaluated against the CART algorithm, which has been previously used with success. A finite length window of minimal morphological and syntactic resources was incorporated, ie the POS label and the kind of phrase boundary, a novel syntactic feature that has not been applied to intonational phrase break detection before. This feature can be used in languages where syntactic parsers are not available and proves to be important, not only for the proposed Bayesian methodologies but for other algorithms, like CART. Trained on a 5500 word database, Bayesian networks proved to be the most effective in terms of precision (82, 3%) and recall (77, 2%) for predicting phrase breaks.",

            "Abstract": "Sentiment analysis has played a primary role in text classification. It is an undoubted fact that some years ago, textual information was spreading in manageable rates; however, nowadays, such information has overcome even the most ambiguous expectations and constantly grows within seconds. It is therefore quite complex to cope with the vast amount of textual data particularly if we also take the incremental production speed into account. Social media, e-commerce, news articles, comments and opinions are broadcasted on a daily basis. A rational solution, in order to handle the abundance of data, would be to build automated information processing systems, for analyzing and extracting meaningful patterns from text. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis applied in Greek texts. Thus far, there is no wide availability of natural language processing tools for Modern Greek. Hence, a thorough analysis of Greek, from the lexical to the syntactical level, is difficult to perform. This paper attempts a different approach, based on the proven capabilities of gradient boosting, a well-known technique for dealing with high-dimensional data. The main rationale is that since English has dominated the area of preprocessing tools and there are also quite reliable translation services, we could exploit them to transform Greek tokens into English, thus assuring the precision of the translation, since the translation of large texts is not always reliable and meaningful. The new feature set of English tokens is augmented with the original set of Greek, consequently producing a high dimensional dataset that poses certain difficulties for any traditional classifier \u2026",

This gives rise to the gradual development of policy analytics. Another important trend in the area of digital government is the increasing exploitation of artificial intelligence techniques by government agencies, mainly for the automation, support and enhancement of operational tasks and lower-level decision making, but only to a very limited extent for the support of higher-level functions, and especially policy making. Our paper contributes towards the advancement and the combination of these two important trends: it proposes a policy analytics \u2026",

On the contrary, we approach this significant problem from the scope of an extended coding of training data. More specifically, our method attempts to generate more features in order to reveal the hidden aspects of the domain, modeled by the available training examples. We propose a novel feature construction algorithm, based on the ability of Bayesian networks to represent the conditional independence assumptions of a set of features, thus projecting relational attributes which are not always obvious to a classifier when presented in their original format. The augmented set of features results in a significant increase in terms of classification performance, a fact that is depicted to a plethora of machine \u2026",

The ambiguity in the human way of Greeklish writing, since Greeklish users do not follow a standardized way of transliteration makes the process of transcribing Greeklish back to Greek alphabet challenging. Even though a plethora of deterministic approaches for the task at hand exists, this paper presents a non-deterministic, vocabulary-free approach, which produces comparable and even better results, supports argot and other linguistic peculiarities, based on an ensemble classification methodology of Data Mining, namely Random Forests.

The basic objective is to gather knowledge from images with some known methods such as image retrieval, image processing and artificial intelligence. Towards this direction, this paper proposes a classification system for identifying pools from satellite area images. For the feature extraction of every photograph, and therefore the creation of the data set, the method of trainable segmentation is applied. In the current approach, genetic algorithms are utilised in an attempt to reduce the feature set to only the informative ones and class imbalance issues were also dealt with by incorporating a hybrid boosting and genetic sub-sampling approach. Results show that the best precision and recall rates are achieved by using a combination of AdaBoost and neural \u2026",

In this paper we argue in favor of using some well-known cryptographic primitives, borrowed from the literature on large-scale Internet elections, in order to preserve accuracy in privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) systems. Our approach is based on the classical homomorphic model for online elections, and more particularly on some extensions of the model for supporting multi-candidate elections. We also describe some weaknesses and present an attack on a recent scheme [1] which was the first to use a variation of the homomorphic model in the PPDM setting. In addition, we show how PPDM can be used as a building block to obtain a Random Forests classification algorithm over a set of \u2026",

Previous research has shown the most accurate approach to acquire knowledge from data while simultaneously preserving privacy is the exploitation of cryptography. In this paper we introduce an extension of a privacy preserving data mining algorithm designed and developed for both horizontally and vertically partitioned databases. The proposed algorithm exploits the multi-candidate election schema and its capabilities to build a privacy preserving Tree Augmented Naive Bayesian classifier. Security analysis and experimental results ensure the preservation of private data throughout mining processes.",

In addition to this approach, which has not yet been used for this task, we have experimented with two well-known machine learning methods (learning vector quantization and a simplified version of the transformation-based learning theory).

To achieve this, we leverage important advancements in deep learning. Our approach generalizes to systems beyond the source system and achieves the generation of complete structures that optimize the binding to a target unseen during training.

Despite the commercial benefits to the region, there are certain issues related to the preservation of the local ecosystem and safety. This danger is further deteriorated by the absence of regulations on allowed waterways. Marine accidents could cause a major ecological disaster in the area and pose big socio-economic impacts in Greece.
