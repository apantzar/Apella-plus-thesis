This is particularly valid for floating-point (FP) units, which are becoming more common in embedded systems and are usually protected from operational faults through costly hardware redundant approaches. In this paper, we present scalable instruction-based self-test program development for both single and double precision FP units considering different instruction sets (MIPS, PowerPC, and Alpha), different microprocessor architectures (32/64-bit architectures) and different memory configurations. Moreover, we introduce bit-level manipulation instruction sequences that are essential for the development of FP unit's self-test programs.

            "Abstract": "Software-based self-test (SBST) has recently emerged as an effective methodology for the manufacturing test of processors and other components in systems-on-chip (SoCs). By moving test related functions from external resources to the SoC's interior, in the form of test programs that the on-chip processor executes, SBST eliminates the need for high-cost testers, and enables high-quality at-speed testing. Thus far, SBST approaches have focused almost exclusively on the functional (directly programmer visible) components of the processor. In this paper, we analyze the challenges involved in testing an important component of modern processors, namely, the pipelining logic, and propose a systematic SBST methodology to address them. We first demonstrate that SBST programs that only target the functional components of the processor are insufficient to test the pipeline logic, resulting in a significant toss of fault \u2026",

Sequential fault testing for Booth array multipliers has never been proposed in the past. In this paper, we present two BIST architectures for modified Booth array multipliers with respect to the Realistic Sequential Cell Fault model (RS-CFM). The first BIST architecture aims to resolve the test invalidation problem to the larger possible extent, while the second one aims to test cost reduction. Both BIST architectures achieve very high sequential fault coverage and impose moderate hardware and delay overhead. Simplified variations of the two BIST architectures are also presented for the non-recoded signed array multipliers. Thus, the proposed BIST architectures offer a universal BIST solution that covers the totality of signed array multipliers: non-recoded and recoded.",

            "Abstract": "Built-In Self-Test (BIST) techniques constitute an effective and practical approach for VLSI circuits testing. BIST schemes are typically classified into two categories: off-line and on-line. Input vector monitoring concurrent BIST schemes are a class of on-line techniques that circumvent the problems appearing separately in on-line and in off-line BIST. The utilization of input vector monitoring concurrent BIST techniques provides the capability to perform testing at different stages, manufacturing, periodic off-line and concurrent online. The input vector monitoring concurrent BIST schemes proposed so far have targeted either exhaustive or pseudorandom testing separately. In this paper a novel input vector monitoring concurrent BIST scheme based on a pre-computed test set is presented. The proposed scheme can perform both concurrent on-line and off-line testing; therefore it can be equally well utilized for manufacturing and concurrent on-line testing in the field. The applicability of the scheme is validated with respect to the hardware overhead and the time required for completion of the test in benchmark circuits. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first to be presented in the open literature based on a pre-computed test set that can perform both concurrent on line and off-line testing.",

While concurrent fault detection is mainly achieved by hardware or software redundancy, like duplication, non-concurrent fault detection, particularly useful for periodic testing, is usually achieved through hardware BIST. Software-based self-test has been recently proposed as an effective alternative to hardware-based self-test allowing at-speed testing while eliminating area, performance and power consumption overheads. In this paper we focus on the applicability of software-based self-test to non-concurrent on-line testing of embedded processor cores. Low-cost in-field testing requirements, particularly small test execution time and low power consumption guide the development of self-test routines. We show how self \u2026",

On-board payload data processing based on an adaptable SRAM FPGA based hardware platform offers unique advantages over both one-time programmable anti-fuse FPGAs and ASICs, enabling an adaptable instrument with significant savings in mass, power, cost, resources and flexibility. In this paper, for the first time, we integrate the instrument system supervisor processor along with dedicated, adaptable and high-performance on-board data processing functions in a single-chip, dependable and adaptable payload Data Processing Unit (DPU), based on the space-grade Xilinx Virtex-5QV FPGA.

We focus on the impact of the memory system architecture and the cache coherency mechanisms on the execution of self-test programs on the processor cores. We propose a generic self-test routines scheduling algorithm aiming at the reduction of the total test application time for the SMP by reducing both bus contention and data cache coherency invalidation.

These FPGAs are very suitable for implementation of digital signal processing algorithms, providing the possibility for orders of magnitude increases in performance over processor-based implementations and thus are well suitable to establish dependable reconfigurable space systems. Alternatively, reconfigurable Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs) can be used as low-cost, low-power solutions for non-critical space applications.

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, on-line testing is essential for modern microprocessors to detect latent defects that either escape manufacturing testing or appear during system operation. Small memories, such as L1 caches and translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) are not usually equipped with memory built-in self-test (MBIST) hardware. Software-based self-test (SBST) is a flexible and low-cost solution for on-line March test application and error detection in such small memories. Although, L1 caches and TLBs are small components, their reliable operation is crucial for the system performance due to the large penalties caused when L1 cache or TLB misses occur. In this paper, an SBST program development methodology is proposed for on-line testing of small cache memories in microprocessors. To overcome testability challenges that are due to the \u201chidden\u201d or implicit operation of such memories, the proposed SBST methodology \u2026",

Functional self-testing is performed by test programs that the processor executes at-speed from on-chip memory. Multiprocessors and multithreaded architectures are constantly becoming the typical general-purpose computing paradigm, and thus the various existing uniprocessor functional self-testing schemes must be adopted and adjusted to meet the testing requirements of complex multiprocessors. A major challenge in porting a functional self-testing approach from the uniprocessor to the multiprocessor case is to take advantage of the inherent execution parallelism offered by the multiple cores and the multiple threads in order to reduce test execution time.

Structured Design-for-Testability (DfT) and hardware-based self-testing techniques, which usually have a non-trivial impact on a circuit\u2019s performance, size and power, can not be applied without serious consideration and careful incorporation into the processor design. Embedded Processor-Based Self-Test shows how the powerful embedded functionality that processors offer can be utilized as a self-testing resource. Through a discussion of different strategies the book emphasizes on the emerging area of Software-Based Self-Testing (SBST). SBST is based on the idea of execution of embedded software programs to perform self-testing of the processor itself and its surrounding blocks in the SoC. SBST is a low-cost strategy in terms of overhead (area, speed, power), development effort and test application cost, as it is applied using low-cost, low-speed test equipment.

            "Abstract": "Manufacturing testing is carried-out once in order to ensure the correct operation of the circuit under test right after fabrication, while either periodic off-line testing or concurrent on-line testing is carried-out in order to ensure that the circuit under test continues to operate correctly in field. The utilization of input vector monitoring concurrent BIST techniques provides the capability to perform all types of testing, namely manufacturing, periodic off-line and concurrent on-line. The input vector monitoring concurrent BIST schemes proposed so far have targeted either exhaustive or pseudorandom testing. In this paper a novel input-vector monitoring concurrent BIST scheme based on a pre-computed test set is introduced. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first to be presented in the open literature based on a pre-computed test set that can perform both on line and off-line testing",

            "Abstract": "The modified Booth array multiplier is the most ubiquitous multiplier architecture in the datapaths of either general purpose microprocessors or specialized Digital Signal Processors. Sequential fault testing for Booth array multipliers has never been proposed in the past. In this paper, we present two BIST architectures for modified Booth array multipliers with respect 10 the Realistic Sequential Cell Fault model (RS-CFM). The first BIST architecture aims 10 resolve the test invalidation problem to the larger possible extent, while the second one aims 10 test cost reduction. Both BIST architectures achieve very high sequential fault coverage and impose moderate hardware and delay overhead. Simplified variations of the two BIST architectures are also presented for the non-recoded signed array multipliers. Thus, the proposed BIST architectures offer a universal BIST solution that covers the totality of signed array multipliers: non-recoded and recoded.",
