Oxygen and nutrients transport to cancerous tissues is mediated by the blood vessels that provide a route for metastasizing cancer cells to distant organs and deliver drugs to tumors. Nanoparticles can serve as nanoagents in imaging of tumors and improve the specificity and sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging. This chapter discusses more about the function of nanoparticles in early detection of diseases and as therapeutics agents, carriers of chemotherapeutical drugs to assist the accurate delivery of drugs, targeting tumors and photothermal therapy of tumors.

The BICs were of approximately 100 ms duration and approximated positive-and negative-going half-sinusoids. Some positively and negatively peaking BICs constituting the P300 coincided with known peaks in the averaged P300. However, there were trial-to-trial differences in their occurrences, particularly where a positive or a negative BIC could occur with the same latency in different trials, a fact which would be obscured by averaging them.

Coastal areas play a significant role for the economy of the entire region. In this paper we propose a new methodology for automatic extraction of the coastline using aerial images. A combination of a four step algorithm is used to extract the coastline in a robust and generalizable way. First, noise distortion is reduced in order to ameliorate the input data for the next processing steps. Then, the image is segmented into two regions, land and sea, through the application of a local threshold to create the binary image. The result is further processed by morphological operators with the aim that small objects are being eliminated and only the objects of interest are preserved. Finally, we perform edge detection and active contours fitting in order to extract and model the coastline. These algorithmic steps are illustrated through examples, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.",

Using public EEG data, a wide range of features is extracted from each segment and then applied to the classifiers. The analysis covers a patient-specific approach, so as to optimize the decision to each patient individually and a patient-independent approach in order to explore a global prediction approach that can discriminate randomly selected preictal and interictal segments from all patients.

Given a DNA Microarray dataset, traditional feature selection methods produce lists of candidate genes which vary significantly under variations of the training data. That instability hinders the validity of research findings and raises doubts about the reliability of such methods. In this study, we propose a framework for the extraction of stable genomic signatures. The proposed methodology enforces stability at the validation step, independent of the feature selection and classification methods used. The statistical significance of the selected gene set is also assessed. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of stability issues in genomic signatures, beyond their prediction capabilities.",

Rivers are often monitored by flashy hydrographs that exhibit characteristic response times ranging from minutes to hours.

This paper presents a new approach in statistical estimation of fluid flow that calculates a local flow probability distribution function in the frequency domain. Our work improves upon the inefficiencies of spatial estimation of the auto-regressive STAR model and converts motion estimation into a restoration problem, where the local field can be computed fast in the frequency domain, while various natural constraints can be taken into account within the inversion strategy of the motion estimation process.",

This study differs from other published works in that it shows that this technique can be used as a biomarker to distinguish the epileptic subjects specifically when the EEG recordings of these subjects are clinically diagnosed as normal. Using the spectral features and a linear discriminant classifier a global classification score of up to 85% was achieved on our clinical data.

We introduce a clustering method for this purpose, which is based on the expression patterns but is also influenced by temporal changes. We compare the results of our platform with methods based on expression or the rank of temporal changes. The proposed platform is illustrated with a temporal gene expression dataset comprised of primary human chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We derived three clusters in each cell type and compared the content of these classes in terms of temporal changes, which can support biological performance. For statistical evaluation we introduce a validity measure that takes under consideration these temporal changes and we also perform an enrichment analysis of three central genes in each cluster.

Four imputation techniques were applied: regression imputation, expectation-maximization, data augmentation, and hotdeck. Models using the imputed data sets were compared with models without CA-125 to investigate the important clinical issue concerning the necessity of CA-125 information for diagnostic models and with models using only complete cases to investigate differences between imputation and complete case strategies for missing values.

In this work, we investigated changes in mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) patients using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state recordings and a DFC approach. The activity of several well-known brain rhythms was first beamformed using linearly constrained minimum norm variance of the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical brain regions of interest. A DFC graph was formulated using the imaginary part of phase lag value which were obtained from 30 mTBI patients and 50 normal controls. Filtering each quasi-static graph statistically and topologically, we estimated a normalized Laplacian transformation of every single quasistatic graph based on the degree of each node. Then, the related eigenvalues of the synchronization of each node were computed by incorporating the complete topology. Using the neural-gas algorithm, we modelled the evolution of the eigenvalues for each group, resulting in distinct FC microstates (FC\u03bcstates). Using the so-called chronnectomics (transition rate, occupancy time of FC\u03bcstate, and Dwell time) and complexity index over the evolution of the FC\u03bcstates, we evaluated the level of discrimination and derived statistical differences between the two groups. In both groups, we detected equal number of FC\u03bcstates with statistically significant transitions in the \u03b4, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3low frequency bands. The discrimination rate between the two groups was very high in the \u03b8 and \u03b3low bands, followed by a statistically significant difference between the two groups in all \u2026",

Fish escapes due to problems in the infrastructure or increased death rates as a result of the existing environmental conditions are just a few of the most common reasons.

Small sized, low-cost autonomous devices can offer a lower cost alternative solution, providing also more frequent inspection and efficient timely alarming capabilities. In this paper, the design and operational characteristics of a small-sized Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) architecture are presented, yielding to a powerful tool for regular periodic fish-cage net inspection in terms of net holes and fouling.

Such faults are usually the result of the influence of electrodynamics forces generated during the flow of large short circuit currents, as well as of the forces occurring when the transformers or generators are transported. The early detection and classification of winding failures is of particular importance, as these kinds of defects can lead to winding damage due to overheating, imbalance, etc. Application results on investigations of windmill generator winding faults are presented. The ANN approach is proven effective in classifying faults based on features extracted by the WT.",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 150 subjects in resting-state from the Human Connectome Project database [15, 16] and further separated into two categorical groups based on their IQ scores, resulting to 76 low-IQ and 74 high-IQ subjects. Cerebellum was parcellated into 28 lobules/ROIs (per subject) using a standard cerebellum anatomical atlas [2, 3](lobules I-IV, V, VI, Crus I, Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX, X) as shown in Fig. 1 (cerebellum\u2019s flat surface representation [3] is also provided where color coding has been applied based on each lobule\u2019s volumetric size). These lobules serve different functions eg cognition [4, 5, 10, 11], emotion [4, 10, 12]. Lobule Vermis Crus I was found to contain less than 0.005% of the total cerebellar volume and thus was removed from further analysis. Thereafter, correlation matrices were constructed by computing the zero-lag temporal Pearson correlation coefficients between the average BOLD time-series for each pair of ROIs. By computing conventional graph metrics, small-world network properties [6, 7, 8, 18] were discovered using the weighted clustering coefficient (averaged over all nodes to define its global version) and characteristic path length (Supplementary Table 1) for estimating the tradeoff between segregation and integration. In addition, the connectivity metric was computed for extracting the average cost per network (Supplementary Table 1). In this study, the concept of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) was \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The emergence of surface mount technology devices has resulted in several important advantages including increased component density and size reduction on the printed circuit board, on the expense of quality inspection. Classical visual inspection techniques require time-consuming image processing to improve the accuracy of the inspected results. In this paper we reduce the computational complexity of classical machine vision approaches by proposing two neural network based techniques. In the first we maintain image information only in the form of edges, whereas the second we preserve the entire content of info but compressed in a single dimension through image projections. Both algorithms are tested on real industrial data. The quality of inspection is preserved while reducing the computational time.",

The image contrast among different structures varies with the material properties, material composition, and geometrical parameters, and it is difficult to be determined only from its physical, electrical, or optical parameters. The novelty of this study consists in fusing statistical analysis with polarimetric principles. As a result, quantification of image contrast in terms of Stokes parameters together with the modeling of intensity distribution for the corresponding target areas can be proved a powerful tool for analyzing the different properties of operational modalities and/or materials depicted in digital images.

In this paper we propose a new approach of studying brain synchronization dynamics by extending the use of WC to include certain statistically significant (in terms of signal coherence) time segments, to study and characterize any disturbances present in the functional connectivity network of schizophrenia patients.

For such a purpose, a representative dataset for medical analysis was chosen which regards Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a kind of oral cancer associated with smoking and alcohol drinking habits; however the individual risk could be modified by genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the metabolism of tobacco carcinogens and in the DNA repair mechanisms. To study this relationship, the data set comprised demographic and life-style (age, gender, smoke and alcohol), and genetic data (the individual genotype of 11 polymorphic genes), with the information on 124 HNSCC patients and 231 healthy controls. Strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithms when applied to medical datasets, such as the one considered, will be analyzed, with particular attention to the issue of missing values.",

Low oxygen levels, due to excessive fooling's, leads to decrease growth performance, and feed efficiency. Therefore, frequent periodic inspection of fish-cage nets is required, but this task can become quite expensive with the traditional means of employing professional divers that perform visual inspections at regular time intervals. The modern trend in aquaculture is to take advantage of IT technologies with the use of a small-sized, low-cost autonomous underwater vehicle, permanently residing within a fish cage and performing regular video inspection of the infrastructure for the entire net surface.

All these measures are based on some mean of an appropriate signal attribute over trials in the time/ frequency domain and do not characterize the variability across trials. In order to quantify trial-to-trial variability we consider a measure based on entropy, characterizing the distribution of power across trials.

Many years later, the grid technology has gone through various development stages yielding common solution mechanisms for similar categories of problems across interdisciplinary fields. Several new concepts like the Virtual Organization and Semantic Grid have been perfected bringing closer the day when the scientific communities will collaborate as if all their members were at the same location, working with the same laboratory equipment and running the same algorithms. Many production-scale standard-based middlewares have been developed to an excellent degree and have already started to produce significant scalability gains, which in the past, were considered unthinkable.",

EEG provides excellent temporal resolution for the study of brain activity while, on the other hand, fMRI provides good spatial localization of different cognitive functions. Although the combination of the two modalities looks very promising, there are still problems and challenges that need to be addressed in order to take advantage of their supplementary nature. In this chapter, we review the various methods and techniques used for the joint analysis of EEG and fMRI.",

            "Abstract": "This study investigates the potential of fluorescence imaging in conjunction with an original, fused segmentation framework for enhanced detection and delineation of brain tumor margins. By means of a test bed optical microscopy system, autofluorescence is utilized to capture gray level images of brain tumor specimens through slices, obtained at various depths from the surface, each of 10 \u00b5m thickness. The samples used in this study originate from tumor cell lines characterized as Gli36 \u03d1 EGRF cells expressing a green fluorescent protein. An innovative three-step biomedical image analysis framework is presented aimed at enhancing the contrast and dissimilarity between the malignant and the remaining tissue regions to allow for enhanced visualization and accurate extraction of tumor boundaries. The fluorescence image acquisition system implemented with an appropriate unsupervised pipeline of image processing and fusion algorithms indicates clear differentiation of tumor margins and increased image contrast. Establishing protocols for the safe administration of fluorescent protein molecules, these would be introduced into glioma tissues or cells either at a pre-surgery stage or applied to the malignant tissue intraoperatively; typical applications encompass areas of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) and confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE). As a result, this image acquisition scheme could significantly improve decision-making during brain tumor resection procedures and significantly facilitate brain surgery neuropathology during operation.

To this end we present a biologically inspired probabilistic model and a modified Expectation-Maximization algorithm for the estimation of its parameters.

            "Abstract": "The multiple description coding framework is well-suited for the transmission of images in the presence of transmission errors. However, it has been mainly explored for idealized channels, where packets are either received correctly or not at all. In more realistic scenarios, bitstreams are affected by bit-level noise and error correcting codes must be employed. In the proposed scheme, the input image is decomposed into wavelet coefficients that are encoded using lattice vector quantization for the generation of multiple descriptions. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are used for the protection of each stream, while joint decoding exploits the correlation between the multiple descriptions. The proposed joint source-channel decoding scheme can provide robust transmission of images by introducing a controlled amount of redundancy that can be used for error recovery.

A promising tool for exploring potential biomarkers for mTBI is magnetoencephalography which has the advantage of high spatial and temporal resolution. By adopting proper analytic tools from the field of symbolic dynamics like Lempel-Ziv complexity, we can objectively characterize neural network alterations compared to healthy control by enumerating the different patterns of a symbolic sequence. This procedure oversimplifies the rich information of brain activity captured via MEG. For that reason, we adopted neural-gas algorithm which can transform a time series into more than two symbols by learning brain dynamics with a small reconstructed error. The proposed analysis was applied to recordings of 30 mTBI patients and 50 normal controls in \u03b4 frequency band. Our results demonstrated \u2026",

The proposed methodology uses the color characteristics of river flow images and provides a high correlation factor with the suspended sediment measurements. In our opinion, the importance of the current work derives from the fact that it provides an alternative and effective way of estimating SS distribution rather as opposed to the conventional method that requires human presence, especially if we consider the difficulty of taking measurements of the river pollution during flush flood events when the sediment distribution is increased and is directly related to water quality.",

            "Abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common brain disorders and may result in brain dysfunction and cognitive disturbances. Epileptic seizures usually begin in childhood without being accommodated by brain damage and many drugs produce no brain dysfunction. In this study cognitive function in mild epilepsy cases is evaluated where children with seizures are compared to controls i.e., children with epileptic seizures, without brain damage and under drug control. Two different cognitive tasks were designed and performed by both the epileptic and healthy children: i) a relatively difficult math task and ii) Fractal observation. Under this context, we propose two frameworks: the first is based on time-frequency analysis using the continuous wavelet transform (WT) and the Compressed Spectral Array (CSA), and the second is based on Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) modeling to evaluate the EEG signals at rest and during cognitive tasks in both groups. Initially, the analytical capabilities of the proposed feature extraction techniques were assessed in a simulated environment, and finally classification of the actual data was performed. The results suggest that time-frequency analysis methods were able to capture non-stationary activity, whereas ARMA modeling performs better on stationary signals. Classification of the actual data was successful and both approaches reached the same level of accuracy (73.4%). Higher frequency bands (beta and gamma) were apparent on frontal-parietal lobes on both math and fractal tests, while alpha band was diffused across a wider frontal network, only during the math task.",

Five of the identified significant metabolites, namely glucose, pyruvate, lactate, alanine and lipids, are involved in the energy production process, necessary for the survival of the cell.

This is intended for the researchers new in the field to get insight in the state-of-the-art techniques used to find approximate solutions of the brain sources giving rise to a scalp potential recording. Furthermore, a review of the performance results of the different techniques is provided to compare these different inverse solutions. The authors also include the results of a Monte-Carlo analysis which they performed to compare four non parametric algorithms and hence contribute to what is presently recorded in the literature. An extensive list of references to the work of other researchers is also provided. This paper starts off with a mathematical description of the inverse problem and proceeds to discuss the two main categories of methods which were developed to solve the EEG inverse problem, mainly the non parametric and parametric methods. The main difference between the two is to whether a fixed number of dipoles is assumed a priori or not. Various techniques falling within these categories are described including minimum norm estimates and their generalizations, LORETA, sLORETA, VARETA, S-MAP, ST-MAP, Backus-Gilbert, LAURA, Shrinking LORETA FOCUSS (SLF), SSLOFO and ALF for non parametric methods and beamforming techniques, BESA, subspace techniques such as MUSIC and methods derived from it, FINES, simulated annealing and computational intelligence algorithms for parametric methods.

            "Abstract": "Gliomas are the most common types of brain cancer, well known for their aggressive proliferation and the invasive behavior leading to a high mortality rate. Several mathematical models have been developed for identifying the interactions between glioma cells and tissue microenvironment, which play an important role in the mechanism of the tumor formation and progression. Building and expanding on existing approaches, this paper develops a continuous three-dimensional model of avascular glioma spatio-temporal evolution. The proposed spherical model incorporates the interactions between the populations of four different glioma cell phenotypes (proliferative, hypoxic, hypoglychemic and necrotic) and their tissue microenvironment, in order to investigate how they affect tumor growth and invasion in an isotropic and homogeneous medium. The model includes two key variables involved in the proliferation and invasion processes of cancer cells; i.e. the extracellular matrix and the matrix-degradative enzymes concentrations inside the tumor and its surroundings. Additionally, the proposed model focuses on innovative features, such as the separate and independent impact of two vital nutrients, namely oxygen and glucose, in tumor growth, leading to the formation of cell populations with different metabolic profiles. The model implementation takes under consideration the variations of particular factors, such as the local cell proliferation rate, the variable conversion rates of cells from one category to another and the nutrient-dependent thresholds of conversion.

Towards this direction a feature selection and classification method, embedding the Relief-F filter criterion under a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier, has been introduced focusing on the identification of significant genetic alterations related to glycolysis. In particular a genomic (Microarray Expression) dataset, consisting of 14 glioma patients has been used for the statistical analysis. The results have demonstrated that a specific group of gene markers (HK, PGI, PFK, ALDO, GAPDH, PGK, PGM, ENO, PK, LDH, PDH and MDH) directly related to cell glycolysis, have a great impact on the discrimination of different grades of gliomas malignancy (AUROC of 0.98), thus leading to the conclusion that these markers could establish the foundations for new therapeutic approaches.",

The proposed method aims at deriving efficient approximations of the river velocity using natural formations on the river surface. In order to overcome peculiarities of the flow, we propose to uniformly exploit all such structures that appear locally with short temporal duration. Towards this direction we explore the expanded capabilities of a stereoscopic camera layout with the dual observation fields and the potential of reverting projective deformations. By mapping to world coordinates, all spatial locations in the video reflect velocity as a uniform field, except for local flow variations. The velocity estimation is performed by computing the optical flow using a series of video frames, combining the information of the views of both cameras. The novelty of the proposed river flow estimation scheme lies on the fact that the accuracy of motion \u2026",

This approach uses subsequent gray-scale video frames along with a statistical estimation method to extract the optical flow. An average velocity estimate is computed using the velocity vectors of the main motion trend, which is extracted using classification methods. The corresponding real-world surface velocity is computed using velocity-area transformations. The use of only two subsequent video frames and the lack of tracers in the flow are the key features of this technique in order to extract an accurate estimate of the real surface velocity.

We present an approach that enables the relation of stereoscopic images with tacheometry data. The proposed multimodal fusing scheme results in an accurate 3D realistic fa\u00e7ade reconstruction and provides a fast and low cost solution. In the first stage of the proposed approach a 2D skeleton of the building is extracted from the viewed scene using Active Contour and Hough line extraction. The next stage of our method utilizes depth information, extracted from a stereoscopic layout, to infer the structural details of inner fa\u00e7ade structures, such as windows or doors. In the final stage, the structural information extracted from the image data is integrated with georeferenced point datasets.

The main cause of death is not the primary tumor but its metastases at distant sites, such as lymph nodes and other organs (preferentially lung, liver, and bones). The study of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood resulting from tumor cell invasion and intravascular filtration highlights their crucial role concerning tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. Genomic research regarding CTCs monitoring for breast cancer is limited due to the lack of indicative genes for their detection and isolation. Instead of direct CTC detection, in our study, we focus on the identification of factors in peripheral blood that can indirectly reveal the presence of such cells. Using selected publicly available breast cancer and peripheral blood microarray datasets, we follow a two-step elimination procedure for the identification of several \u2026",

P300 data was obtained from healthy participants and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), while Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) data came from a healthy subject. The ICs found corresponded to the spatiotemporal profiles reported in the literature, which is based mainly upon averaged waveforms. Some positively and negatively peaking components of the P300 ICs were found to coincide with known peaks in the averaged P300. However, there were trial-to-trial differences where a particular IC might occur or not, and where a positive or a negative component could occur with the same latency. These variations would be obscured by the standard averaging practice in EP analysis. The mean latencies of the ICs differed between healthy participants and AD patients, particularly in the IC associated with the P3b peak (p<0.01). In the case of the CNV, our approach correctly identified both the orienting and the expectancy components, even though a short 1s interstimulus interval was used.",

A set of physical measurements and simulated signals are selected for the time series analysis. The empirical mode decomposition is applied and the adaptive basis of each raw signal is extracted. The decomposed narrow-band amplitude and frequency modulated signals are modelled by using dynamic artificial neural networks (ANNs).

While the broad class of information fusion methods is constantly enriched, their proper consideration on the basis of data or information distribution lacks a common framework and develops around ad-hoc methods that cannot justify the overall effectiveness of fusion methods. In this context, the present work aims at uncovering analogies between decision fusion methods and established primary classifiers. Such correspondence of specific fusion methods to base classifiers allows us to utilize knowledge from the field of data mining as to summarize and model the statistical performance of combiners and possibly provide best practices and optimality criteria for their use. As case studies, we focus on two main categories of classifiers, namely distance and discriminantfunction based, when applied to the problem of classifier fusion. The Decision-Templates fusion method is examined as a representative distance based technique and compared with the Support-Vector-Machine scheme as representative of discriminant-function hyper classifiers. Based on statistical performance measures, we advocate the use of SVMs for decision fusion as an efficient and extensible framework that can be adapted to specific application domains.",

For EMEG source reconstruction, an average across the annotated epileptic spikes is often used to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). In this contribution, we propose a two-phase clustering of interictal spikes with unsupervised learning methods, namely Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and K-means. In addition, we investigate the accuracy of combined EMEG source analysis on the sorted activity, using an individualized (with regard to both geometry and conductivity) six-compartment finite element head model with calibrated \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The independent components analysis (ICA) of the auditory P300 evoked responses in the EEG of normal subjects is described. The purpose was to identify any features which might provide the basis for biomarkers for diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Single trial P300s were analysed by ICA, the activations were back-projected to scalp electrodes, many artefactual components were removed automatically, and the back-projected independent components (BICs) were first clustered according to their amplitudes and latencies. Then these primary clusters were secondarily clustered according to the columns of their mixing matrices, which clusters together those BICs with the same scalp topographies and, therefore, source locations. The BICs comprising the P300s had simple shapes, approximating half-sinusoids. Trial- to-trial variations in the BICs were found, which explain why different averages have been reported. Both positive- and also negative-going BICs were identified, some associated with known peaks in the P300 waveform. Artefact-free, single trial P300 waveforms could be constructed from the BICs, but these are probably of less interest than the BICs themselves. The findings demonstrate that neither averaged P300s, nor single trial P300s, are reliable as biomarkers, but rather it will be necessary to investigate the BICs present in a number of single trial realizations.",

A key business continuity activity is to set proactively and non-arbitrarily recovery priorities while computing the recovery time effort (RTE) for these functions. The specific activity requires the consideration of technical and environmental factors of individual business functions in order to compute mathematically their recovery time. A recently published formula stems from the business continuity points method. Its limitation has been the absence of real data during its conception. The purpose of the chapter is firstly, to use business continuity data from a public college in order to validate the initial formula and, secondly, to infer a new more accurate and robust RTE equation based on regression analysis techniques.

The most advanced diffusive models take into consideration the heterogeneous velocity of glioma in gray and white matter, by using two different discrete diffusion coefficients in these areas. Moreover, by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), they simulate the anisotropic migration of glioma cells, which is facilitated along white fibers, assuming diffusion tensors with different diffusion coefficients along each candidate direction of growth.

We performed a quantitative proteomic analysis in osteoarthritic and normal chondrocytes followed by functional analyses to investigate proteome changes and molecular pathways involved in OA pathogenesis. Chondrocytes were isolated from articular cartilage of ten patients with primary OA undergoing knee replacement surgery and six normal donors undergoing fracture repair surgery without history of joint disease and no OA clinical manifestations. We analyzed the proteome of chondrocytes using high resolution mass spectrometry and quantified it by label-free quantification and western blot analysis. We also used WebGestalt, a web-based enrichment tool for the functional annotation and pathway analysis of the differentially synthesized proteins, using the Wikipathways database. ClueGO, a Cytoscape plug-in, is also used to compare groups of proteins and to visualize the functionally organized Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways in the form of dynamical network structures.

The thriving environment for the implementation of different agriculture systems is justified by a series of technologies that offer the prospect of improving agricultural productivity through the intensive use of data. The concept of big data in agriculture is not exclusively related to big volume, but also on the variety and velocity of the collected \u2026",

In this paper, we present a new test bed, the BIOPATTERN Grid, which aims to fulfil this role in the long term. The main objectives in this paper are 1) to report the development of the BIOPATTERN Grid, for biopattern analysis and bioprofiling in support of individualization of healthcare. The BIOPATTERN Grid is designed to facilitate secure and seamless sharing of geographically distributed bioprofile databases and to support the analysis of bioprofiles to combat major diseases such as brain diseases and cancer within a major EU project, BIOPATTERN (www. biopattern. org); 2) to illustrate how the BIOPATTERN Grid could be used for biopattern analysis and bioprofiling for early detection of dementia and for brain injury assessment on an individual basis. We highlight important issues that would arise from the mobility of citizens in the EU, such as those associated with access to medical data, ethical and security; and 3) to describe two grid services which aim to integrate BIOPATTERN Grid with existing grid projects on crawling service and remote data acquisition which is necessary to underpin the use of the test bed for biopattern analysis and bioprofiling.",

With a correct modeling of the surgical robot (in our case is the robotic arm AESOP1000) and appropriate image processing algorithms we can give the doctor the ability to have better perception of the space the laparoscope `sees' through its camera(s). One of our objectives deals with robotic arm kinematics and dynamics. AESOP1000 is modeled and simulated through VRML language. We can model an exact virtual space of the patient's abdomen and the trainee can use the robotic arm for a virtual `tour' in it. Using the model, he can observe how the camera is moving in abdomen space but also he can place the camera at every point he wants.",

In this study, we analyzed CFC profiles from resting state Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings obtained from 30 mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients and 50 controls. We used mutual information (MI) to quantify the phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) of activity among the recording sensors in six nonoverlapping frequency bands. After forming the CFC-based functional connectivity graphs, we employed a tensor representation and tensor subspace analysis to identify the optimal set of features for subject classification as mTBI or control. Our results showed that controls formed a dense network of stronger local and global connections indicating higher functional integration compared to mTBI patients.

            "Abstract": "The late epoch of the 20th century has viewed an enormous increase in electronic sensitive equipment due to the huge growth in communication, computer and automation industries. These new generations of electronic equipment are becoming progressively sensitive to power quality disturbances. Any variation in the supply voltage magnitude or frequency may have detrimental effects on the equipment. Electric utilities must assess the present value of the power before taking any quality improvement actions. Therefore, monitoring and detection of power quality disturbances has become a significant issue.The increased concern for power quality has resulted in significant advances in monitoring algorithms, techniques and equipment that can be used to characterize disturbances and power quality variations. Analysis tools can present the power quality information as individual events (disturbance waveforms), trends, or statistical summaries. By comparing events with libraries of typical power quality variation characteristics and correlating with system events (eg, capacitor switching), causes of the variations can be determined. In the same manner, the measured data should be correlated with impacts to help characterize the sensitivity of end use equipment to power quality variations. This will help identify equipment that requires power conditioning and provide specifications for the protection that can be developed based on the power quality variation characteristics. The main purpose of this thesis is to find, present, test and evaluate three relatively new algorithms that are being used for power quality monitoring and classification. These are \u2026",

The current study investigates further the importance of these couplings using recordings of resting-state magnetoencephalographic activity obtained from 30 mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) subjects and 50 healthy controls. Intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling modes are incorporated in a single graph to detect group differences within individual rich-club subnetworks (type I networks) and networks connecting RC nodes with the rest of the nodes (type II networks).

Spectral features extracted by using nonparametric, signal representation techniques (Fourier and wavelet transform) and a parametric, signal modeling technique (ARMA) are compared and their effect on the classification of the two groups is analyzed. The subjects performed two different tasks: a control (rest) task and a relatively difficult math task. The results show that spectral features extracted by modeling the EEG signals recorded from individual channels by an ARMA model give a higher discrimination between the two subject groups for the control task, where classification scores of up to 100% were obtained with a linear discriminant classifier.",

            "Abstract": "Whereas single class classification has been a highly active topic in optical remote sensing, much less effort has been given to the multi-label classification framework, where pixels are associated with more than one labels, an approach closer to the reality than single-label classification. Given the complexity of this problem, identifying representative features extracted from raw images is of paramount importance. In this work, we investigate feature learning as a feature extraction process in order to identify the underlying explanatory patterns hidden in low-level satellite data for the purpose of multi-label classification. Sparse auto-encoders composed of a single hidden layer, as well as stacked in a greedy layer-wise fashion formulate the core concept of our approach. The results suggest that learning such sparse and abstract representations of the features can aid in both remote sensing and multi-label problems \u2026",

Essentially, establishing the optimal resection strategy requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to avoid inflicting neurological deficits on the patients. An important aspect prior to the operative treatment exploits the combined use of Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG), EMEG in source analysis. In order to estimate the spike onset within the irritative zone using the aforementioned method, an average across the annotated epileptic spikes is often used to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). However, detecting the spike onset zone suffers from poor localization accuracy due to either unrealistic head modelling or because of \u2026",

Current study followed an \u201cattack strategy\u201d to compare the rich-club and small-world network organization models using Magnetoencephalo\u00acgraphic (MEG) recordings from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients and neurologically intact controls to identify the topology that describes the underlying intrinsic brain network organization. We hypothesized that the reduction in global efficiency caused by an attack targeting a model\u2019s hubs would reveal the \u201ctrue\u201d underlying topological organization. Connectivity networks were estimated using mutual information as the basis for cross-frequency coupling. Our results revealed a prominent rich-club network organization for both groups. In particular, mTBI patients demonstrated hyper-synchronization among rich-club hubs compared to controls in the \u03b4 band and the \u03b4-\u03b31, \u03b8-\u03b31, and \u03b2-\u03b32 frequency pairs.

These advances are more evident in case of cancerous tumors due to the complexity of the disease, along with the use of additional factors for defining tumor evolution,(like drugs effect nutrition, etc), and diffusion policies on adjacent tissues. In this paper, we focus on the predictive analysis of malignant brain tumors like gliomas. The analysis combines two different strategies. The first relies on texture segmentation on exploiting Gabor filters banks and applying semi-supervised learning methods. The unsupervised component of the learning process finds common textural patterns and labels them together, while the supervised component performs a consistent labeling of the regions into semantically meaningful areas with respect to medical description. Then, a computational model based on systems of differential equations is applied to predict future evolutions of the tumor within the 3D dimension space. The new model is driven by the texture segmentation results. Experiments on real-world MRI images of brain tumors have been conducted to reveal the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of improving prognosis index.",

            "Abstract": "Pathway analysis methodologies couple traditional gene expression analysis with knowledge encoded in established molecular pathway networks, offering a promising approach towards the biological interpretation of phenotype differentiating genes. Early pathway analysis methodologies, named as gene set analysis (GSA), view pathways just as plain lists of genes without taking into account either the underlying pathway network topology or the involved gene regulatory relations. These approaches, even if they achieve computational efficiency and simplicity, consider pathways that involve the same genes as equivalent in terms of their gene enrichment characteristics. Most recent pathway analysis approaches take into account the underlying gene regulatory relations by examining their consistency with gene expression profiles and computing a score for each profile. Even with this approach, assessing and scoring single-relations limits the ability to reveal key gene regulation mechanisms hidden in longer pathway sub-paths. We introduce MinePath, a pathway analysis methodology that addresses and overcomes the aforementioned problems. MinePath facilitates the decomposition of pathways into their constituent sub-paths. Decomposition leads to the transformation of single-relations to complex regulation sub-paths. Regulation sub-paths are then matched with gene expression sample profiles in order to evaluate their functional status and to assess phenotype differential power. Assessment of differential power supports the identification of the most discriminant profiles. In addition, MinePath assess the significance of the pathways as a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Background: Here, we propose a threshold-free selection method for the identification of differentially expressed features based on robust, non-parametric statistics, ensuring independence from the statistical distribution properties and broad applicability. Such methods could adapt to different initial data distributions, contrary to statistical techniques, based on fixed thresholds. This work aims to propose a methodology, which automates and standardizes the statistical selection, through the utilization of established measures like that of entropy, already used in information retrieval from large biomedical datasets, thus departing from classical fixed-threshold based methods, relying in arbitrary p-value and fold change values as selection criteria, whose efficacy also depends on degree of conformity to parametric distributions,. Methods: Our work extends the rank product (RP) methodology with a neutral selection method of high information-extraction capacity. We introduce the calculation of the RP entropy of the distribution, to isolate the features of interest by their contribution to its information content. Goal is a methodology of threshold-free identification of the differentially expressed features, which are highly informative about the phenomenon under study. Conclusions: Applying the proposed method on microarray (transcriptomic and DNA methylation) and RNAseq count data of varying sizes and noise presence, we observe robust convergence for the different parameterizations to stable cutoff points. Functional analysis through BioInfoMiner and EnrichR was used to evaluate the information potency of the resulting feature lists. Overall, the derived \u2026",

The calibration procedure uses the P20/N20 topographies and subject-specific realistic head models from MRI. We investigate the inter-subject variability of skull conductivity and relate it to skull thickness, age and gender of the subjects, to the individual scalp P20/N20 surface distance between the P20 potential peak and the N20 potential trough as well as to the individual source depth of the P20/N20 \u2026",

In order to eliminate these biases, both experimental optimization of the amplification methodology and computational approaches are required. The latter comprehends normalization and scaling procedures aiming to correct the introduced biases and extract true biological traits.

However, there is a limited research investigating cerebellum\u2019s relationship with cognitive processes. In this study, the network of cerebellum was analyzed in order to investigate its overall organization in individuals with low and high crystallized Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were selected from 136 subjects in resting-state from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database and were further separated into two IQ groups composed of 69 low-IQ and 67 high-IQ subjects. Cerebellum was parcellated into 28 lobules/ROIs (per subject) using a standard cerebellum anatomical atlas. Thereafter, correlation matrices were constructed by computing Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the average BOLD time-series for each pair of ROIs inside the cerebellum. By computing conventional graph metrics, small-world network properties were verified using the weighted clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length for estimating the trade-off between segregation and integration. In addition, a connectivity metric was computed for extracting the average cost per network. The concept of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) was adopted and implemented in order to avoid methodological biases in graph comparisons and retain only the strongest connections per network. Subsequently, six global and three local metrics were calculated in order to retrieve useful features concerning the characteristics of each MST. Moreover \u2026",

Epileptic seizures usually begin in childhood without being accommodated by brain damage and many drugs produce no brain dysfunction. In this study cognitive function in mild epilepsy cases is evaluated where children with seizures are compared to controls ie, children with epileptic seizures, without brain damage and under drug control. Two different cognitive tasks were designed and performed by both the epileptic and healthy children: i) a relatively difficult math task and ii) Fractal observation. Under this prism, we investigate seven measures of quantifying synchronous oscillatory activity based on different underlying assumptions. Namely, the most widely used coherence, a coding-based measure known as MDL (Minimum Description Length) and the Geweke alternative, a robust phase coupling measure known as PLV (Phase Locking Value), a cortical synchrony measure defined from the embedding dimension in state-space called S-estimator, a reliable way of assessing generalized synchronization also in state-space and an unbiased alternative called Synchronization likelihood. Assessment was performed in three stages; initially the methods were validated on coupled nonlinear oscillators, secondly surrogate data testing was performed to assess the possible nonlinear nature of the acquired EEGs and finally synchronization on the actual data was measured. The results on the actual data suggest higher frequency band gamma2 was mostly apparent in occipitalparietal lobes during fractal tests.",

The purpose of this study is threefold. First, to show that the diagnostic value of the information extracted from two different MRS scanners of 1.5T and 3T is significantly influenced in terms of brain gliomas discrimination. Second, to statistically evaluate the discriminative potential of publicly known metabolic ratio markers, obtained from these two types of scanners in classifying low-, intermediate-, and high-grade gliomas. Finally, to examine the diagnostic value of new metabolic ratios in the discrimination of complex glioma cases where the diagnosis is both challenging and critical.

In this study, we investigated abnormal alterations due to mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) using DFC of the source reconstructed magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state recordings. Brain activity in several well-known frequency bands was first reconstructed using beamforming of the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical brain regions of interest. A DFC graph was formulated using the imaginary part of phase-locking values, which were obtained from 30 mTBI patients and 50 healthy controls (HC). Subsequently, we estimated normalized Laplacian transformations of individual, statistically and topologically filtered quasi-static graphs. The corresponding eigenvalues of each node synchronization were then computed and through the neural-gas algorithm, we quantized the evolution of the eigenvalues resulting in distinct network microstates (NMstates). The discrimination level between the two groups was assessed using an iterative cross-validation classification scheme with features either the NMstates in each frequency band, or the combination of the so-called chronnectomics (flexibility index, occupancy time of NMstate, and Dwell time) with the complexity index over the evolution of the NMstates across all frequency bands. Classification performance based on chronnectomics showed 80% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, and 49% specificity. However, performance was much higher (accuracy: 91 - 97 %, sensitivity: 100%, and specificity: 77 \u2013 93 %) when focusing on the microstates. Exploring the mean \u2026",

Several mathematical models have been developed during the last two decades, towards simulating the mechanisms that govern the development of glioma. The most common models use the diffusion-reaction equation (DRE) for simulating the spatiotemporal variation of tumor cell concentration. The proposed diffusive models have mainly used finite differences (FDs) or finite elements (FEs) for the approximation of the solution of the partial differential DRE. This paper presents experimental results on the comparison of the FEs and FDs, especially focused on the glioma model case.

            "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are important for metastatic dissemination of cancer. They can provide useful information, regarding biological features and tumor heterogeneity; however, their detection and characterization are difficult due to their limited number in the bloodstream and their mesenchymal characteristics. Therefore, new biomarkers are needed to address these questions. Bioinformatics functional enrichment analysis revealed a subgroup of 24 genes, potentially overexpressed in CTCs. Among these genes, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 plays a central role. After prioritization according to the CXCR4 corresponding pathways, five molecules (JUNB, YWHAB, TYROBP, NFYA, and PRDX1) were selected for further analysis in biological samples. The SKBR3, MDA-MB231, and MCF7 cell lines, as well as PBMCs from normal (n\u2009=\u200910) blood donors, were used as controls to define the expression pattern of all the examined molecules. Consequently, 100 previously untreated metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients (n\u2009=\u2009100) were analyzed using the following combinations of antibodies: CK (cytokeratin)/CXCR4/JUNB, CK/NFYA/\u03a5WH\u0391\u0392 (14-3-3), and CK/TYROBP/PRDX1. A threshold value for every molecule was considered the mean expression in normal PBMCs. Quantification of CXCR4 revealed overexpression of the receptor in SKBR3 and in CTCs, following the subsequent scale (SKBR3>CTCs>Hela>MCF7>MDA-MB231). JUNB was also overexpressed in CTCs (SKBR3>CTCs>MCF7>MDA-MB231>Hela). According to the defined threshold for each molecule, CXCR4-positive CTCs were identified in 90% of the patients with \u2026",

In particular, the LG graph descriptor defines similarity and distance measures that can be successfully used for the difficult comparison of the extracted LG graphs in the presence of noise. In addition, hidden states represent periods of stationary distribution of topographies that constitute the equivalent of the microstates in the model.

We used different measures quantifying both phase and energy aspects of the ERP, in order to distinguish evoked from induced oscillations.

Thus, there is an urgent need to address the statistical framework of microarray analysis and identify its drawbacks and limitations, which will enable us to thoroughly compare methodologies under the same experimental set-up and associate results with confidence intervals meaningful to clinicians. In this study we consider gene-selection algorithms with the aim to reveal inefficiencies in performance evaluation and address aspects that can reduce uncertainty in algorithmic validation. A computational study is performed related to the performance of several gene selection methodologies on publicly available microarray data. Three basic types of experimental scenarios are evaluated, i.e. the independent test-set and the 10-fold cross-validation (CV) using maximum and average performance measures. Feature selection methods behave differently under different validation strategies. The performance results from CV do not mach well those from the independent test-set, except for the support vector machines (SVM) and the least squares SVM methods. However, these wrapper methods achieve variable (often low) performance, whereas the hybrid methods attain consistently higher accuracies. The use of an independent test-set within CV is important for the evaluation of the predictive power of algorithms. The optimal size of the selected gene-set \u2026",

Single trials are of interest, because conventional averaging conceals trial-to-trial variability and hence information. Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is a technique for Blind Source Separation (BSS) to recover N temporally independent source signals s = {s1(t), ... sN(t)} from N linear mixtures (the observations), x = {x1(t), ... xN(t)} obtained by multiplying the matrix of unknown sources s by an unknown mixing matrix A, (x = A.s). ICA seeks a square unmixing matrix W such that s = W.x. Difficulties arise for short duration, relatively low amplitude EPs, which have sparse ICs. The effectiveness of different algorithms was compared. Problems associated with more sources than measurement electrodes and with the generation by the algorithms of artefactual components were investigated. Ways of extracting the true EP components were considered. Component grouping was applied to obtain reliable groups, which could be explored for any clinical interpretations. Here we describe the recommended approach as developed by our virtual research group.",

The recognition of personality profiles is crucial in making human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) applications realistic, more focused, and user friendly. The ability to recognize personality using neuroscientific data underpins the neurobiological basis of personality. This paper aims to automatically recognize personality, combining scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and machine learning techniques. As the resting state EEG has not so far been proven efficient for predicting personality, we used EEG recordings elicited during emotion processing. This study was based on data from the AMIGOS dataset reflecting the response of 37 healthy participants. Brain networks and graph theoretical parameters were extracted from cleaned EEG signals, while each trait score was dichotomized into low-and high-level using the k-means algorithm. A feature selection algorithm was used afterwards to reduce the feature-set size to the best 10 features to describe each trait separately. Support vector machines (SVM) were finally employed to classify each instance. Our method achieved a classification accuracy of 83.8% for extraversion, 86.5% for agreeableness, 83.8% for conscientiousness, 83.8% for neuroticism, and 73% for openness. View Full-Text",

Typical symptoms of the later are the so called drusen, which appear as abnormal white-yellow deposits on the retina. Conventional image processing techniques are inappropriate for the segmentation of these features, since they are sensitive to non-uniform illumination and non-homogeneous background. This paper presents a novel segmentation technique for the automatic detection of drusen in retina images acquired with the aid of a digital fundus camera. Homomorphic filtering and adaptive histogram equalization are used for non-uniform illumination compensation and enhancement. For the detection of drusen in retina images, we develop a novel segmentation technique, the Histogram-based Adaptive Local Thresholding (HALT), which extracts the useful information from an image without being affected by the presence of other structures. We provide experimental results from the application of our technique to real images, where certain abnormalities (drusen) have slightly different characteristics from the background and are hard to be segmented by other conventional techniques.",

            "Abstract": "The time-varying microstructure of sleep EEG spindles may have clinical significance in dementia studies and can be quantified with a number of techniques. In this paper, real and simulated sleep spindles were regarded as AM/FM signals modeled by six parameters that define the instantaneous envelope (IE) and instantaneous frequency (IF) waveforms for a sleep spindle. These parameters were estimated using four different methods, namely the Hilbert transform (HT), complex demodulation (CD), matching pursuit(MP) and wavelet transform (WT). The average error in estimating these parameters was lowest for HT,higher but still less than 10% for CD and MP, and highest (greater than 10%) for WT. The signal distortion induced by the use of a given method was greatest in the case of HT and MP. These two techniques would necessitate the removal of about 0.4 s from the spindle data, which is an important limitation for the case of spindles with duration less than 1 s. Although theCDmethodmaylead to a higher error thanHTand MP,it requires a removal of only about 0.23 s of data. An application of this sleep spindle parameterization via the CD method is proposed, in search of efficient EEG-based biomarkers in dementia. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed parameterization may be promising, since it can quantify specific differences in IE and IF characteristics between sleep spindles from dementia subjects and those from aged controls.",

The goal of this study is to derive the functional network of the cerebellum during the resting-state and then compare the ensuing group networks between males and females. Toward this direction, a spatially constrained version of the classic spectral clustering algorithm is proposed and then compared against conventional spectral graph theory approaches, such as spectral clustering, and N-cut, on synthetic data as well as on resting-state fMRI data obtained from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The extracted atlas was combined with the anatomical atlas of the cerebellum resulting in a functional atlas with 46 regions of interest.

Coastline mapping and change detection are essential for safe navigation, resource management, environmental protection, and sustainable coastal development and planning. In this paper, we proposed a new methodology for the automatic extraction of coastline, using aerial images. This method is based on edge detection and active contours (snake method). Initially the noise of the image is reduced which is followed by an image segmentation. The output images are further processed to remove all small spatial objects and to concentrate on the spatial objects of interests. Then, the morphological operators are applied. We used aerial images taken from an aircraft and high-resolution satellite images from a coastal area in Crete, Greece, and we compared the results with geodetic measurements, to validate the methodology.

Among its shortcomings we identify the lack of statistical foundation in many ad-hoc fusion methods and the lack of strong non-linear combiners with the capacity to partition complex decision spaces. In this work, we draw parallels between the well known decision templates (DT) fusion method and the nearest mean distance classifier in order to extract a useful formulation for the overall expected classification error. Additionally we evaluate DTs against a support vector machine (SVM) discriminant hyper-classifier, using two benchmark biomedical datasets. Beyond measuring performance statistics, we advocate the theoretical advantages of support vectors as multiple attractor points in a hyper-classifier's feature space.",

            "Abstract": "In the continuing effort to shrink the electronics components and assemblies, the need for streamlined production processes and quality assurance is emerging stronger than ever. Surface Mounted Devices (SMD) is one of the breakthrough techniques that drove printedcircuit board production to a new level, increasing substantially the component density and reducing the size of produced circuits. Quality inspection of SMD is recognized as a critical and complex task in the production process (Bartlet et al., 1988). Speed is also important as to reduce the overall production costs (Lecklider, 2004). Specific SMD defects have been reported in the literature (Loh & Lu, 1999) including component misplacement and absence, component with wrong polarity, solder joint defects and component shifting. Much of the current research efforts are concentrated on detecting solder joint defects. The types of solder joint defects include surplus solder, insufficient solder and lacking solder. Component shifting has also been reported as a special solder joint defect. Among the methods employed by industrial automatic solder-joint quality inspection systems are laser infrared signatures, digital radiography, laser Doppler vibrometry or laser acoustic microscopy. However, the high cost, low throughput and sampling loss of the above approaches call for research on non-destructive machine vision systems. Several optical inspection systems for solder joints have been reported (Bartlet et al., 1988; Capson & Eng, 1988; TH. Kim et al., 1999; Ryu & Cho, 1997), using different illumination techniques and defect classification schemes. There have also been efforts to \u2026",
