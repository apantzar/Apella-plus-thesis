Colored PNs are an extension of classical PNs that are suitable for modeling and analyzing complex interconnected CIs. Timed PNs are another extension of PNs that support timing constraints and events.

            "Abstract": "Reversible computation is an unconventional form of computing that uses reversible operations, that is, operations that can be easily and exactly reversed, or undone. Its study originates in the 1960\u2019s when it was observed that maintaining physical reversibility avoids the dissipation of heat [19]. Thus, the design of reversible logic gates and circuits can help to reduce the overall energy dissipation of computation and lead to low-power computing. Subsequently, motivation for studying reversibility has stemmed from a wide variety of applications, which naturally embed reversible behaviour. These include biological processes where computation may be carried out in forward or backward direction [31, 18], and the field of system reliability where reversibility can be used as a means of recovering from failures [14, 20]. One line of work in the study of reversible computation has been the investigation of its theoretical foundations [1]. During the last few years a number of formal models have been developed aiming to provide understanding of the basic principles of reversibility along with its costs and limitations, and to explore how it can be used to support the solution of complex problems. In the context of concurrent and distributed computation this study has led to the definition of different forms of reversibility: While in the sequential setting reversibility is generally understood as the ability to execute past actions in the exact inverse order in which they have occurred, a process commonly referred to as backtracking, in a concurrent scenario it can be argued that reversal of actions can take place in a more liberal fashion.

Thus, it is possible to model alternative power-consumption behaviors and analyze tradeoffs in their timing and other characteristics.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we extend PALPS, a process calculus proposed for the spatially-explicit individual-based modeling of ecological systems, with the notion of a policy. A policy is an entity for specifying orderings between the different activities within a system. It is defined externally to a PALPS model as a partial order which prescribes the precedence order between the activities of the individu- als of which the model is comprised. The motivation for introducing policies is twofold: one the one hand, policies can help to reduce the state-space of a model, on the other hand, they are useful for exploring the behavior of an ecosystem under different assumptions on the ordering of events within the system. To take account of policies, we refine the semantics of PALPS via a transition relation which prunes away executions that do not respect the defined policy. Furthermore, we propose a translation of PALPS into the probabilistic model checker PRISM . We illustrate our framework by applying PRISM on PALPS models with policies for conducting simulation and reachability analysis.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we propose a formal framework for studying privacy in information systems. The proposal follows a two-axes schema where the first axis considers privacy as a taxonomy of rights and the second axis involves the ways an information system stores and manipulates information. We develop a correspondence between the above schema and an associated model of computation. In particular, we propose the \\Pcalc, a calculus based on the -calculus with groups extended with constructs for reasoning about private data. The privacy requirements of an information system are captured via a privacy policy language. The correspondence between the privacy model and the \\Pcalc semantics is established using a type system for the calculus and a satisfiability definition between types and privacy policies. We deploy a type preservation theorem to show that a system respects a policy and it is safe if the typing of the system satisfies the policy. We illustrate our methodology via analysis of two use cases: a privacy-aware scheme for electronic traffic pricing and a privacy-preserving technique for speed-limit enforcement.",

This uncertainty is modelled via a set of probability distributions over all the possibilities, one for each user. The resulting model is an amalgamation of the KP-model of (E. Koutsoupias and C. H.

Each attacker wishes to maximize the probability of escaping its cleaning by the system protector; towards a conflicting objective, the system protector aims at maximizing the expected number of cleaned attackers.We model this network scenario as a non-cooperative strategic game on graphs.

However, due to the network\u2019s size, economic and performance reasons, it is capable to provide safety, i.e. clean nodes from the possible presence of attackers, only to a limited part of it. The objective of the defender is to place itself in such a way as to maximize the number of attackers caught, while each attacker aims not to be caught. In [7], a basic case of this problem was modeled as a non-cooperative game, called the Edge model. There, the defender could protect a single link of the network.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we propose a formal framework for studying privacy in information systems. The proposal follows a two-axes schema where the first axis considers privacy as a taxonomy of rights and the second axis involves the ways an information system stores and manipulates information. We develop a correspondence between the above schema and an associated model of computation. In particular, we propose the \\Pcalc, a calculus based on the -calculus with groups extended with constructs for reasoning about private data. The privacy requirements of an information system are captured via a privacy policy language. The correspondence between the privacy model and the \\Pcalc semantics is established using a type system for the calculus and a satisfiability definition between types and privacy policies. We deploy a type preservation theorem to show that a system respects a policy and it is safe if the typing of the system satisfies the policy. We illustrate our methodology via analysis of two use cases: a privacy-aware scheme for electronic traffic pricing and a privacy-preserving technique for speed-limit enforcement.",

It is defined externally to a palps model as a partial order which prescribes the precedence order between the activities of the individuals of which the model is comprised. The motivation for introducing policies is twofold: one the one hand, policies can help to reduce the state-space of a model; on the other hand, they are useful for exploring the behavior of an ecosystem under different assumptions on the ordering of events within the system. To take account of policies, we refine the semantics of palps via a transition relation which prunes away executions that do not respect the defined policy.

So, the defender captures system rationality. In a Nash equilibrium, no single player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from its randomized strategy. The Price of Defense is the worst-case ratio, over all Nash equilibria, of the optimal gain of the defender (which is \u03bd) over the gain of the defender at a Nash equilibrium.

In this paper we propose a reversible approach to Petri nets by introducing machinery and associated operational semantics to tackle the challenges of the three main forms of reversibility, namely, backtracking, causal reversing and out-of-causal-order reversing. Our proposal concerns a variation of Petri nets where tokens are persistent and are distinguished from each other by an identity. Our design decisions are influenced by applications in biochemistry but the methodology can be applied to a wide range of problems that feature reversibility. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with an example of a biochemical system and an example of a transaction-processing system both featuring reversible behaviour.",

In this paper, we present our work on the usage of a \u03c0-calculus-based language for modeling and reasoning about the GDPR provisions of 1) lawfulness of processing by providing consent, 2) consent withdrawal, and 3) right to erasure. A static analysis method based on type checking is proposed to validate that a model conforms to associated privacy requirements. This is the first step towards a rigorous Privacy-By-Design methodology for analyzing and validating a software system model against the GDPR. A use case is presented to discuss and illustrate the framework.",

            "Abstract": "Reversible computation is an unconventional form of computing where any sequence of performed operations can be executed in reverse order at any point during computation. It has recently been attracting increasing attention as on the one hand it promises low-power computation and on the other hand it is inherent or of interest in a variety of applications. In this paper we propose a structural way of translating reversing Petri nets (RPNs), a formalism that embeds the three main forms of reversibility (backtracking, causal reversing and out-of-causalorder reversing), to Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs), an extension of traditional Petri Nets, where tokens carry data values. The translation into the CPN model uses additional places and transitions in order to capture the machinery employed in the RPN framework and demonstrates that the abstract model of RPNs, and thus the principles of reversible computation, can be emulated in CPNs. The transformation can be automated and utilized for the analysis of reversible systems using CPN Tools.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we report on work-in-progress towards defining a formal framework for studying privacy. Our framework is based on the -calculus with groups [1] accompanied by a type system for capturing privacy-related notions. The typing system we propose combines a number of concepts from the literature: it includes the use of groups to enable reasoning about information collection, it builds on read/write capabilities to control information processing, and it employs type linearity to restrict information dissemination. We illustrate the use of our typing system via simple examples.",

In the 1960s, Floyd [5] and Hoare [7] provided the emerging field of computer science with a fundamental understanding of (partial and total) program correctness. Given a precondition P of a program \u03d5, establishing a correctness argument amounts to deriving the strongest description Q of\u03d5 subject to P. A correctness proof in Floyd\u2013Hoare logic is then represented as a tuple:",
