More specifically, assuming that the marginal distribution of detail coefficients is non-Gaussian, we model it with the Student's t probability density function. Furthermore, we assume that the embedding power of the hidden information is unknown, suggesting in this way a new test statistic based on the Rao hypothesis test. The proposed detector exhibits better performance in terms of detection sensitivity and robust properties compared with other known methods in the framework of non-Gaussian environment. Additionally, we investigate a fixed-parameterization approach towards a lightweight detection with regard of time complexity.",

Super-resolution (SR) is a post-processing approach aiming to reconstruct a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart. Recent advances in medical image SR include the application of deep neural networks, which can improve image quality at a low computational cost. When dealing with medical data, accuracy is important for discovery and diagnosis, therefore, interpretable neural network models are of significant interest as they enable a theoretical study and increase trustworthiness needed in clinical practice. While several interpretable deep learning designs have been proposed to treat unimodal images, to the best of our knowledge, there is no multimodal SR approach applied for medical images.

The performance of the same codec is also analyzed for different source coding rates. The performance Wyner-Ziv video coding is compared with pure H. 263 Intraframe coding which has similar complexity at the encoder and the superiority of the Wyner-Ziv codec over pure H. 263 intra coding is shown. Current video compression standards perform interframe predictive coding to exploit the similarities among successive frames. Since predictive coding makes use of motion estimation, the video encoder is typically five to ten times more complex than the decoder. This asymmetry in complexity is desirable for broadcasting or for streaming video-on-demand systems where video is compressed once and decoded many times. However, some future systems may require the dual scenario. Wyner-Ziv video coding is a step towards achieving this. We present our simulation results that show that Wyner-Ziv video coding performs much better than pure H. 263 intracoding under noisy conditions. The dependency of the decoder on the quantization of key (H. 263 Intra coded) frames is analyzed. The error resilience of the decoder to missing blocks in the key frames is also shown.",

Our drift control mechanism maintains two frame buffers in the encoder and decoder; one for the base layer and the other for the enhancement layer. Drift control is achieved by switching between these two buffers for motion compensation and prediction. In the encoder, the residues are coded using the embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) algorithm. Our prediction is based on the enhancement layer, which inherently introduces drift in the system, if part of the enhancement layer is not available at the receiver. A measure of drift is computed based on channel information, and a threshold is set. When the measure exceeds the threshold, i.e. when drift becomes significant, we switch the prediction to be based on the base layer, which is \u2026",

Furthermore, the capturing process introduces additive noise and the point spread function of the lens and the effects of the finite size of the photo-detectors further degrade the acquired video frames. The goal of resolution enhancement is to estimate a high-resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution images while also compensating for the degradations. We propose a technique for image resolution enhancement with adaptively weighted low-resolution images (channels) and simultaneous estimation of the regularization parameter. The weight coefficients work as the cross-channel fidelity to each low-resolution image, while the regularization parameter acts as the within-channel balance between data and prior model for each channel.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, an optimal framework is proposed for the joint encoding of the shape and texture information in object based video. The solution is optimal in the operational rate distortion sense, i.e, given the coding setup, the solution guarantees the smallest possible distortion for a given rate. The shape is approximated using polygons or higher order curves. We also consider biasing the cost function to favor horizontal and vertical edges, for the case of polygon approximation (biased polygon approximation). The texture is encoded using shape adaptive discrete cosine transform (SA-DCT) or shape adaptive discrete wavelet transform (SA-DWT) of the MPEG-4 video codec. A comparison is drawn between the two techniques. Both a fixed-width and a variable-width tolerance band for shape coding are considered. The variable width of the tolerance band is a function of the texture profile, i.e, the width is inversely \u2026",

In the second method, a cumulative measure of the overall distortion is computed by summing the inter-frame propagation impact to all frames affected by a slice loss. Furthermore, the authors develop a No-Reference (NR) sparse regression framework for predicting the CDSSIM metric to circumvent the real-time computational complexity in streaming video applications.

In this paper, we set out to develop a 3D medical image compression method that extends the 3D wavelet difference reduction algorithm by computing the similarity of the pixels in adjacent slices and progressively compress only the similar slices.

Traditionally this problem is treated separately from the texture encoding problem. In this paper, we present a vertex-based shape coding method which is optimal in the operational rate-distortion sense and takes into account the texture information of the video frames. This is accomplished by utilizing a variable-width tolerance band whose width is a function of the texture profile. As an example, this width is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the image gradient. Thus, in areas where the confidence in the estimation of the boundary is low and/or coding errors in the boundary will not affect the application (e.g., object-oriented coding and MPEG-4) significantly, a larger boundary approximation error is allowed. We present experimental results which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

The popular 3-D Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees (3-D SPIHT) is used to produce a completely embedded video bit stream. A new channel coding technique employing low-density parity check (LDPC) codes and rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes/cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is proposed for error-detection and correction. A flat-fading Rayleigh channel with additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) is modeled for transmission. The embedded bit stream is given unequal error protection (UEP) and the rate-distortion optimization algorithm is developed and carried out for the selection of source coding rate and the channel coding rate. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this system under different wireless channel conditions for video transmission and are seen to be better than the classical technique of using RCPC/CRC.",

At first, the low resolution images are registered by establishing correspondences between robust SIFT features. In the second step, the estimation of the registration parameters is fine-tuned along with the estimation of the high resolution image, in an iterative procedure, using the maximization of the mutual information criterion.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a resolution enhancement algorithm based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework. The objective of resolution enhancement (super-resolution) is to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a sequence of lowresolution (LR) images, under the assumption that there exists subpixel motion between the low-resolution frames. EM based image restoration has been studied in previous work, while its results can not be directly applied to the resolution enhancement scenario because of the subsampling (decimation) process in the acquisition model. This leads to a non-square degradation matrix which is not circulant as in the restoration case and hence cannot be diagonalized and operated on by the EM algorithm in the frequency domain. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to reorganize and interlace the low-resolution frames to construct an interlaced image using the registration parameters. This interlaced image is equivalent to a uniform blur process of the PSF blurred image. Now the resolution enhancement problem reduces to a restoration problem with two low-pass filters to deblur: one is the blur due to the point spread function (PSF) of the optical lens, and the other the uniform blur due to the decimation matrix. EM based restoration algorithm is thus computed efficiently in the frequency domain, considering the inaccurate estimate of the PSF and unknown power spectrum of both the high-resolution image and noise. Simulations using synthetic images are implemented to verify the proposed algorithm and conclusions are drawn.",

The optimization is quality-driven, i.e. the received quality of the video that is transmitted by the nodes is optimized. The scheme takes into account the fact that the sensor nodes may be imaging scenes with varying levels of motion. Nodes that image low-motion scenes will require a lower source coding rate, so they will be able to allocate a greater portion of the total available bit rate to channel coding. Stronger channel coding will mean that such nodes will be able to transmit at lower power. This will both increase battery life and reduce interference to other nodes. Two optimization criteria are considered. One that minimizes the average video distortion of the nodes and one that \u2026",

Particularly, we study the LASSO regression through two different architectures; the Global LASSO (G.LASSO) and Local LASSO (L.LASSO).

The scheme takes into account the fact that different nodes image videos with varying amounts of motion and determines the source coding rate, channel coding rate, and power level for each node under constraints on the available bit rate and power. The objective is to maximize the quality of the video received by the centralized control unit (CCU) from each node. However, since increasing the power level of one node will lead to increased interference with the rest of the nodes, simultaneous maximization of the video qualities of all nodes is not possible.

The reconstruction relies on the choice of Huber function parameter, or threshold T. There is no explicit selection of T in the previous studies. In this paper, we propose a method for choosing the threshold of the HMRF image prior in MAP based resolution enhancement. The method is based on the fact that the threshold T of the Huber function in the HMRF image priors is physically the trade-off between high-frequency components and low-frequency components for imagery data. High-pass filtering using the discrete Laplacian kernel along with the Huber function is used as the smoothness measure. When the high-passed value is less than T, the measure \u2026",

In this paper, the degradation of the atmospheric turbulence to the low-resolution images is modeled as per-pixel motion in the high-resolution plane and is assumed to be spatially local and temporally quasi-periodic. The registration is a two-stage process: first, the global motion between frames is estimated using the phase-correlation method to remove \"jitter\" and stabilize the sequence; then, an optical flow method with quasi-periodic constraint is used to estimate the per-pixel motion.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose an approach to manage network resources for a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) visual sensor network where nodes monitor scenes with varying levels of motion. It uses cross-layer optimization across the physical layer, the link layer, and the application layer. Our technique simultaneously assigns a source coding rate, a channel coding rate, and a power level to all nodes in the network based on one of two criteria that maximize the quality of video of the entire network as a whole, subject to a constraint on the total chip rate. One criterion results in the minimal average end-to-end distortion amongst all nodes, while the other criterion minimizes the maximum distortion of the network. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the cross-layer optimization.",

            "Abstract": "Scalability is an important desirable property of video codecs. Wavelet-based motion-compensated temporal filtering provides the most powerful scheme for scalable video coding and provides high-compression efficiency that competes with the current state of art codecs. However, the delay introduced by the temporal filtering schemes is sometimes very high, which makes them unsuitable for many real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a new temporal filter set to minimize delay in 3D wavelet-based video coding. The new filter set gives a performance at par with existing longer filters. The length of the filter can vary from two to any number of frames depending on delay requirements. If the frames are processed as separate groups of frames (GOFs), the proposed filter set will not have any boundary effects at the GOF. Experimental results are presented and conclusions are drawn.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, we demonstrate the interference mitigation capabilities of the auxiliary vector (AV) receiver for scalable video transmission over direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems using a hardware testbed. The proposed receiver design is also compared to the conventional RAKE matched-filter (RAKE-MF) and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) receivers. The DS-CDMA video data stream is transmitted over an RF channel under ''real world'' Rayleigh-faded multipath channel conditions, emulating open and/or urban battlefield environments. The state-of-the-art Agilent E4438C vector signal generator and baseband studio fader is used to provide a configurable \"real time\" RF channel. In this work, the \"foreman\" video sequence is source encoded using an MPEG-4 compatible video codec and channel-coded using rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the context of this project, we worked on the development of a cross-layer resource management system over single hop and multihop Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access DS-CDMA Visual Sensor Networks VSNs. The target was the optimal determination and allocation of the source and channel coding rates and the power levels among the nodes of the considered network. For the efficient allocation of the nodes transmission parameters, we applied various distortion-related criteria, drawing inspiration from game theory as well, and investigated fairness and efficiency under different perspectives for each of them. Computational intelligence optimization algorithms and reinforcement learning techniques were applied in order to solve the resulting optimization problems. All the solutions provided by the examined schemes were Pareto-optimal and thus, the choice about the most fair and efficient scheme is problem-dependent. Some of the approaches that were taken into account for further improving the end-to-end video distortion of a wireless multiple-access VSN included the time scheduling of transmitting nodes for interference mitigation, the optimal Instantaneous Decoding Refresh IDR frame placement during encoding, the content-based node prioritization, and the weighted bi-objective optimization for measuring the trade-off between video quality and consumed transmission power. The evaluation of all proposed approaches showed that enhanced end-to-end video quality can be achieved, by keeping power consumption at reasonable levels, when compared to the case of assigning equal values to the transmission \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We propose a game-theory-based cross-layer optimization scheme for wireless Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) visual sensor networks. The scheme uses the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), which assumes that the nodes negotiate, with the help of a centralized control unit, on how to allocate resources. The NBS takes into account the video quality each node could achieve without making an agreement. The cross-layer optimization scheme determines the source coding rate, channel coding rate, and transmission power for each node. We compare the proposed game-theory-based scheme with competing schemes that minimize the average or maximum distortion among the nodes.
