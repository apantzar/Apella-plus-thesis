            "Abstract": "The problem of estimating the node density in ad hoc networks is a significant one for protocol design. In molecular nanonetworks, the node density estimation problem poses additional challenges due to the limited processing and communication capabilities of the network nodes which necessitate the design of simple to implement distributed solutions, and the diffusion based communication channel which is different from traditional electromagnetic networks. In this work, inspired by the quorum sensing process, we propose and analyze a new node density estimation scheme based on synchronous transmission of all network nodes and measurement of the received molecular concentration. We show that when the synchronous transmission is performed in infinite space, a linear parametric model of the node density can be derived which can be used for estimation purposes. When, however, the transmission is \u2026",

Tunable metasurfaces are ultra-thin, artificial electromagnetic (EM) components that provide engineered and adjustable functionalities up to the terahertz (THz) band and beyond. The controller network lies at the heart of an software-defined metamaterial (SDM) and poses significant implementation and cointegration challenges. SDMs are planar, rectangular structures that can transform impinging EM waves in a controlled manner. Early SDM designs considered a grid topology of cells with rectangular wired connectivity. The communication network within an SDM needs to be designed while accounting for a series of physical limitations. When scaling the SDM paradigm toward THz operation, however, conventional network-on-chip may encounter issues in the form of complex \u2026",

Two communication methods are investigated, namely free diffusion and diffusion with drift. Since the nodes are randomly distributed, the distance between them can be represented as a random variable, which results in a stochastic process representation of the received signal strength. We derive the probability density function of this process for both molecular communication methods. Specifically for the case of free diffusion we also derive the cumulative distribution function, which can be used to derive transmission success probabilities. The presented work constitutes a first step towards the characterization of the signal to noise ratio in the considered setting for a number of molecular communication methods.",

Personalization is such an example. The moving user differs from the desktop user in that his handheld device is truly personal. It roams with the user and allows him access to info and services at any given time from anywhere. As the moving user is not limited to a fix place and to a given time period, factors such as time and current experience becomes increasingly important for him. His context is now a function of time and experience and the goal of personalization is to match the local services to this context. In this paper we exploit the importance of time and experience in personalization for the moving user and present a system that anticipates and compensates the time-dependant shifting of user interests.",

            "Abstract": "Hypersurface, a software defined metasurface (SDM) paradigm constitutes a revolutionary technology aiming at offering programmatic control over all aspects of a propagating wave, altering its direction, power, polarization and phase. In the absence of line of sight (LOS) between a transmitter and a receiver, HSF can provide seamless connectivity via programmatic reflection. However, such an application requires fine tuning of the metasurface reconfiguration parameters, which may not be effective when done in an open loop fashion due to model uncertainties. In this work, we consider a feedback-based formulation of the problem, which involves maximization of the received power and propose the use of Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) for the controller implementation due to fact that it is model-free and adheres to the maximization problem. Extensive simulations indicate that the proposed scheme is successful \u2026",

M-Commerce services and applications can be adopted through different wireless and mobile networks, with the aid of several mobile devices. However, constraints of both mobile networks and devices influence their operational performance; therefore, there is a strong need for taking into consideration those constraints in the design and development phases of m-Commerce services and applications. Another important factor in designing m-Commerce services and applications is the identification of mobile users requirements. Furthermore, m-Commerce services and applications need to be classified based on the functionality they provide to the mobile users. This kind of classification results in two major classes: the directory and the transaction-oriented services and applications. This paper suggests a new approach for designing and developing m-Commerce services and applications. This approach relies on mobile users needs and requirements, the classification of the m-Commerce services and applications, as well as the current technologies for mobile and wireless computing and their constraints.",

            "Abstract": "This paper, proposes a generic active queue management (AQM) control methodology in TCP/IP networks, based on Fuzzy logic control principles. A simple, effective and efficient non-linear control law is built, using a linguistic model of the system, rather than a traditional mathematical model, which is easily adapted in different network environments (e.g. Best-Effort and Differentiated-Services architectures). We demonstrate, via extensive simulative evaluation, that the proposed Fuzzy control methodology offers inherent robustness with effective control of the system under widely differing operating conditions, without the need to (re)tune any parameters. As demonstrated, this is in contrast with its well-known conventional counterparts A-RED, REM, PI, AVQ for Best-Effort, and two-level PI, RIO for Differentiated-Services based networks, where the proposed approach outperforms all of them both in Best-Effort and \u2026",

Such an approach facilitates adaptability in nowadays ubiquitous user interaction contexts within the Internet of Things (IoT), in which end-users authenticate multiple times per day through a variety of interaction device types. We present an initial evaluation of the new authentication method based on an in-lab experiment with 32 participants. Analysis of results reveal that the FlexPass paradigm is memorable and that users like the adaptable perspective of the new approach. Findings are expected to scaffold the design of more user-centric knowledge-based authentication mechanisms within nowadays ubiquitous computation realms.",

In previous work we proposed an information hovering scheme which increases the achieved reachability, by employing probabilistic flooding outside the hovering area. Informed vehicles outside the hovering area offer alternative paths towards the uninformed vehicles thus increasing reachability. In this work we investigate the robustness of the proposed protocol with respect to changing hovering area, transmission range of the vehicles and the message loss probability.

Supported objectives include any combination of Quality of Service and power transfer optimization, eavesdropping and Doppler effect mitigation, in multi-cast or uni-cast settings. Additionally, a graph-based model of programmable environments is proposed, which incorporates core physical observations and efficiently separates physical and networking concerns.

The presented networking approach assumes that each node is equipped with 10 bits of reclaimable storage to accommodate four integer counters, and a trivial set of integer operations on them.

In this paper we present Fuzzy-RED, a novel approach to Diff-Serv congestion control, and compare it with a classical RIO implementation. We believe that with the support of fuzzy logic, we are able to achieve better differentiation for packet discarding behaviors for individual flows, and so provide better quality of service to different kinds of traffic, such as TCP/FTP traffic and TCP/Weblike traffic, whilst maintaining high utilization (goodput).",

For the work described in this paper, we assume that packets go through a threshold policy which provides preferential treatment to high priority packets. The objective of this work is to dynamically control the parameters of the threshold policy so that certain QoS requirements are met. Towards this end, we investigate various measurement-based techniques from the Perturbation Analysis (PA) framework.

            "Abstract": "Large-distance communications beyond a few meters is challenging for Terahertz (THz) signals because of high spreading loss and absorption in the media. The smart antenna concept used for RF antennas to improve the signal-to-interference/noise level can be extended to these THz antennas. Out of the two types of implementations of this concept, viz.(i) adaptive array and (ii) switched-beam antenna, this paper presents the switched-beam nanoantenna for the THz wave region. Based on the Yagi-Uda antenna concept, switched-beam graphene nanoantennas over silicon dioxide (SiO 2) substrate is proposed in this paper. In one case (Antenna-I), the antenna is able to switch the beam in\u00b190\u00ba directions, whereas in the other case (Antenna-II), the switching directions are 0\u00ba,\u00b190\u00ba, 180\u00ba. This pattern reconfigurability can also be observed over a frequency range leading to simultaneous pattern and frequency \u2026",

Distress nodes, use this network to disseminate help-requests as a far outcry mechanism. In turn, and upon their arrival, emergency response units opt to gain access to the withstanding ad-hoc network in order to retrieve those disseminated help requests; invaluable information that would allow timely response to those distress nodes. This work is concerned with Bilateral Routing, an algorithm that best meets the requirements and constraints for help-request dissemination and retrieval in emergency scenarios. A novel explore-and-exploit dissemination strategy is detailed that clearly outperforms traditional dissemination mechanisms. The strategy takes into account both centrality and battery power of each node, to increase survivability and allow for \u2026",

By using a system level simulator, results concerning QoS measures as packet delay, blocking and handover failure probabilities have been obtained. If the cell radius decreases and the number of BSs increases the blocking probability decreases with a linear trend. One concludes that the supported traffic and the corresponding throughput significantly increase when the cell radius decreases. However, increasing system capacity by decreasing the cell radius causes an increase in the intensity of handovers and a decrease in the throughput per BS. Hence, optimum values for the coverage distance will correspond to higher cell radius. Delay and delay variation are not a limitation.",

SRSS adds noise to a signal in order to enhance its Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and can be useful in sensing and detecting weak signals, e.g. weak Primary User or even Secondary User activity in TVWS. We demonstrate that SR is a useful Spectrum Sensing technique and can improve SNRs by ~8-10 dB using MATLAB simulations. Typically, SRSS uses only Additive SR Noise and we include and also investigate Multiplicative SR Noise effects, showing that in certain instances the latter can also improve SNRs by ~2 dB. We compare the Additive versus the combined Additive and Multiplicative cases using Uniform and Normal/Gaussian distributions and present our results. Our ultimate goal is to include SRSS in an IEEE/DySPAN \u2026",

It includes a set of tools for effective scheduling and coordination of team members, with features including automatic notification and alerting. It makes use of supportive tools relevant to home care that improve efficiency and minimises errors of home care monitoring.

The resulting feedback system can be realized as an autonomous switched system. The special structure of the system and the fundamental properties resulting from this structure are outlined. Global asymptotic stability is then established for two 2-dimensional network examples. The extension of this stability result to higher dimension networks is currently under investigation.",

The unique manufacturing challenges and cost considerations of these networks make for minimal complexity solutions at all network layers. From a networking aspect, packet retransmissions should be kept minimal, while ensuring communication between any two nanonodes. In addition, assigning unique addresses to nanonodes is not straightforward, since it can entail a prohibitively high number of packet exchanges. Thus, efficient data routing is considered an open issue in nanonetworking. The present paper proposes a routing system which can be dynamically deployed within a nanonetwork. Static, dense topologies with numerous, identical nodes are examined. These attributes are especially important in the context of recently proposed applications of nanonetworks.

This limitation raises issues of increased client waiting times, especially as the total size of the data to be disseminated increases. This problem could be partially or fully resolved by offloading part of the data to local mobile ad hoc subsystems. To this end, a novel merging of wireless data broadcasting and information hovering is proposed. The information hovering subsystem handles the least popular data items, allowing the most popular ones to be efficiently disseminated through the central wireless broadcasting.

Decoupling of network access has favoured the idea of convergence, ie the co-existance and integration of the various access technologies in order to act as a unified platform combining their resources to best serve the increasing user requirements. Any communication network, such as a converged network [62, 65] considered in this report, is a multi-level system, ie decisions must be taken at different levels and by different system entities. Its main task comprises of providing the means to efficiently provide a requested service to the appropriate user, where the decision-making entities are:(i) the user and (ii) the network operator acting as a service provider (the actual service provider may be a different entity, however, the network operator is the decision-making entity in terms of information transport).",

The control objective is to regulate the queue size at each link so that it tracks a reference queue size chosen by the designer. To achieve the latter, the protocol implements at each link a certainty equivalent proportional controller which utilizes estimates of the effective number of users utilizing the link. These estimates are generated online using a novel estimation algorithm which is based on online parameter identification techniques. The protocol utilizes an explicit multi-bit feedback scheme and does not require maintenance of per flow states within the network. Extensive simulations indicate that the protocol is able to guide the network to a stable equilibrium which is characterized by max-min fairness, high utilization, queue sizes close to the reference value and no \u2026",

The Hypersurface design is concerned with the development of a network of switch controllers that are responsible for configuring the metamaterial. The design of the Hypersurface, however, has demanding requirements that need to be delivered within a context of limited resources. This paper shares the experience of a rigorous design procedure for the Hypersurface network, that involves iterations between designing a network and its protocols and the formal evaluation of each design. Formal evaluation has provided results that, so far, drive the development team in a more robust design and overall aid in reducing the cost of the Hypersurface manufacturing.",

In contrast to previous schemes that rely on a predetermined network topology or frequent information exchange for finding a routing path, thus incurring additional implementation cost, we utilize capabilities of bacteria, such as directional sensing and molecule prioritization, to design a simple to implement routing scheme which can facilitate information transfer towards a sink node.

            "Abstract": "Electromagnetic waves undergo multiple uncontrollable alterations as they propagate within a wireless environment. Free space path loss, signal absorption, as well as reflections, refractions, and diffractions caused by physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for and are treated as probabilistic factors. This article proposes a radically different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the behavior of wireless environments. The key enabler is the so-called HyperSurface tile, a novel class of planar meta-materials that can interact with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The HyperSurface tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering toward any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation, and more. Multiple tiles are employed \u2026",

However, in order to achieve optimum results, it is important, among others, to select wisely the Transmission Mode of the D2D Device. Towards this end, our previous work proposed an intelligent Transmission mode selection approach in a framework that is utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) BDIx agents to collectively satisfy the D2D challenges in a Distributed Artificial Intelligent (DAI) manner and act autonomously and independently.

Meanwhile, advancements in computer technology and especially the technique of computer simulation offer a new effective way for testing plausible solutions prior to their implementation. Based on a microscopic traffic simulation model this paper presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative traffic solution interventions on a main arterial in Nicosia, Cyprus. In particular, computer experiments are carried out to test various plausible scenario solutions. The scenarios under evaluation, involve the use of dedicated bus lanes, high occupancy vehicle lanes and road enhancement interventions. The simulation results show that an attractive scenario such as the use of dedicated bus lanes, if not designed properly, could bring disastrous results not only to the private car transport mode but also to the bus transport mode as coupling effects cause buses to get stuck with the rest of the traffic. By going through a computer experimentation process and scenario analysis a viable solution is derived, where restricted lanes for buses and high occupancy vehicles are introduced in combination with road geometry redesign and traffic re-direction at key points.",

We provide some control approaches that we believe can ensure stability in the network under such circumstances. It is important that future broadband wireless networks must be able to offer network services and QoS assurance without causing network instability. This paper, therefore, reveals possible approaches to be considered in the design of future broadband wireless systems.

Seamless roaming requires that users and applications do not experience loss of connectivity or any noticeable interruption in traffic. This is not only important for highly delay-sensitive traffic, but also for TCP-based traffic, as its performance is highly sensitive to packet loss and reordering. It is therefore imperative that handovers are initiated in such a way that the handover latency and packet loss is minimized. However, little is known about the performance of the proposed Mobile IPv6 approach in an actual network. In particular, it is not understood how different enhancement schemes for Mobile IPv6 influence essential performance metrics.

The motivation for this game is to provide a framework where coordination between the game players is desired even though in the real world environment the APs lack any management regarding the efficient utilization of the communication channels and furthermore, it is quite common for a terminal served by one of the APs to be within the signal range of multiple alternative APs. This may not be desirable since APs can be in competition for the same communication resource (radio channel), and since the current standards dictate that at any given time every terminal must be rigidly associated with one particular AP, this situation results in increased interference and consequently a low utilization efficiency of the radio resource, when same or overlapping channels are selected by neighbouring APs.The graphical game aims to motivates cooperation of the players, ie the APs, to overcome the resulting interference because of the unmanaged dense deployment of the APs. In fact, it would be much better for individual APs that are in physical proximity to each other to form groups, where one member of the group would serve the terminals of all group members in addition to its own terminals, so that the other access points of the group can be silent or even turned off, thereby reducing interference and increasing overall Quality of Experience (QoE).

A significant issue in VANETs is the design of an effective broadcast scheme which can facilitate the fast and reliable dissemination of critical safety messages to neighbouring vehicles in case of an unexpected event, such as a traffic accident. We pose the objecive of finding a broadcast scheme which does not rely on the existence of a positioning system, as this may not always be available and mitigates the effect of the broadcast storm problem, typical when utilizing blind flooding. Towards this goal, we investigate the use of probabilistic flooding as a candidate solution 1. We conduct our study using a powerful integrated platform combining the OPNET Modeler and VISSIM simulators. Our results indicate that that there exists a tradeof between reachability and latency which leads to optimal values for the rebroadcast probability. These optimal choices can lead to almost all vehicles receiving the broadcast message while at the same time minimizing the delivery time. As the optimal values depend on the traffic density our findings highlight the need for an adaptive, traffic aware, probabilistic broadcast scheme.",

            "Abstract": "In disasters and emergencies severity of trauma and loss of life can be reduced by more effective communication between emergency workers, volunteers, and survivors. Typically, almost all of these parties will hold mobile phones (in addition to special purpose wireless communication devices, in the case of emergency workers), which are likely to be used intensively to seek and to provide aid to those in need. However, the utility of mobile phones may be limited by battery life. The usefulness of these mobile phones can therefore be enhanced by extending battery life. One way to extend battery life is to introduce a duty cycle, i.e. a pattern of use where the phone is alternately sleeping and active. It is shown below that under some broad assumptions about the type of emergency, it is best to introduce such a duty cycle straight away, and to start with quite short sleep cycles, which increase exponentially, but with a \u2026",

The rapid growth of the Internet and increased demand to use the Internet for time-sensitive voice and video applications necessitate the design and utilization of effective congestion control algorithms, especially for new architectures, such as Diffserv. As a result, a number of researchers are now looking at alternatively schemes to TCP congestion control.

However, to achieve optimum results it is important to select wisely the Transmission mode of the D2D Device to form clusters in the most fruitful positions in terms of Sum Rate and Power Consumption. Towards this end, this paper investigates the use of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) and innovative to D2D, Machine Learning (ML) approaches to achieve satisfactory results in terms of Spectral Efficiency (SE), Power Consumption (PC) and execution time, with the creation of clusters and backhauling D2D network under existing Base Station/Small Cell. Additionally, one of the major factors that affect the creation of high-quality clusters under a D2D network is the number of the Devices. Therefore, this paper focuses on a small (<=200) number of Devices, with the purpose to identify the limits of each approach in terms of number of devices. Specifically, to identify where it is beneficial to form a cluster, investigate the critical point that gains increases rapidly and at the end examine the applicability of 5G requirements. Additionally, prior work presented a Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) Solution/Framework in D2D and a DAIS Transmission Mode Selection (TMS) plan was proposed. In this paper DAIS is further examined, improved in terms of thresholds evaluation, evaluated, and compared with other approaches (AI/ML). The results obtained demonstrate the exceptional performance of DAIS, compared to all other related approaches in terms of SE, PC, execution time and cluster formation efficiency. Also \u2026",

Instead of adding capacity to our roads there should be an effort to find ways in order to enhance the level of service of the public transport mode especially with the use of technology, such as applying computer and information technology to transportation systems. Advanced technologies such as intelligent transportation systems require though rigorous testing and evaluation that is not possible with the current analytical methods and techniques. As a result of advancements in computer technology simulation modeling becomes a viable alternative. This paper presents an overview on traffic simulation and the microscopic simulation model development process of a major highly congested traffic network of Nicosia, Cyprus. The validated simulation model gives transportation planners and traffic managers the capability to test various Bus Rapid Transit scenario solutions involving the use of intelligent transportation systems prior to their implementation.",

Therefore, regarding the multicast service, the key functionality of the enhanced session management is to create network subgroups based on network information as well as general user and environment context information to the extent that these are considered necessary for forming network-efficient groups, and in turn communicating the characteristics of these subgroups in the form of content stream descriptions to the media delivery function for obtaining the appropriate content for each subgroup.",

With respect to the realtime nature of video streaming, unpredictable bandwidth, end-to-end delay and packet loss, are all problems that can affect video streaming over the Internet.

We present a novel feedback mechanism and a fuzzy oriented decision algorithm which collectively provide video adaptation to network parameters.

For each patient a flexible (dynamic) virtual medical team is provided, made up from visiting home-care nurses, doctors, and other health care professionals, responsible for each case.

DITIS uses a number of state of the art technologies which are seamlessly put together, such as collaboration and personalization via mobile agents, access to medical data from anywhere and any time via a variety of mobile devices and a variety of protocols (ie, WAP, HTML) and continuous connectivity via new communication technologies such as ADSL and GPRS, and soon UMTS.

For this purpose, a new active queue management scheme, implemented within the Diff-Serv framework, has recently been proposed to provide congestion control in TCP/IP networks using a fuzzy logic control approach. The proposed fuzzy logic approach for congestion control allows the use of linguistic knowledge to capture the dynamics of nonlinear probability marking functions, uses multiple inputs to capture the dynamic state of the network more accurately, and can offer effective implementation. We present the controlled approach followed by the fuzzy logic based controller, and we show simulation results where the fuzzy logic based controller outperforms the Random Early Detection (RED) implementation for Diff-Serv in terms of link utilization, packet losses, and queue fluctuations and delays. Also, the proposed scheme can offer better differentiation among high-and low-priority traffic, thus it can provide better QoS to different types of data streams, such as TCP/FTP traffic or TCP/Web-like traffic, whilst maintaining high utilization.",

            "Abstract": "The high popularity of Wi-Fi technology for wireless access has led to a common problem of densely deployed access points (APs) in residential or commercial buildings, competing to use the same or overlapping frequency channels and causing a degradation to the user experience due to excessive interference. This degradation is partly caused by the restriction where each client device is allowed to be served only by one of a very limited set of APs (e.g. belonging to the same residential unit), even if it is within range of (or even has a better signal quality to) many other APs. In this paper, we propose a cooperative strategy to mitigate the interference and enhance the quality of service in dense wireless deployments, by having neighboring APs agree to take turns (e.g. in round-robin fashion) to serve each other's clients. We present and analyze a cooperative game-theoretic model of the incentives involved in such \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Energy conservation is a global issue with great implications. High energy demands and environmental concerns force the transformation of electricity grids into smart grids, towards more rational utilization of energy. Embedded computing and smart metering transform houses into energy-aware environments, allowing residents to make informed choices about electricity. Web technologies are successfully used for managing heterogeneous home devices, facilitating the remote management of the house through Web APIs. Hence, the Web, as an ubiquitous and scalable platform, is suitable for interconnecting energy-aware smart homes and the smart grid. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities created when energy-aware smart homes communicate in near real-time with the smart grid and we propose an architecture for their flexible integration to the grid, through the Web. A proof of concept deployment is performed and general security aspects are discussed. The potential of this Web-based architecture is demonstrated by developing two applications that exploit these new capabilities of smart homes, towards an intelligent grid. Demand response is harnessed to schedule electricity-related tasks for future execution and load shedding is employed to reduce the total load for avoiding outages. Finally, issues such as peak leveling, fault tolerance, billing and a market for energy are briefly discussed.",

            "Abstract": "Intensive livestock production might have a negative environmental impact, by producing large amounts of animal excrements, which, if not properly managed, can contaminate nearby water bodies with nutrient excess. However, if animal manure is exported to distant crop fields, to be used as organic fertilizer, pollution can be mitigated. It is a single-objective optimization problem, in regards to finding the best solution for the logistics process of satisfying nutrient crops needs by means of livestock manure. This paper proposes a dynamic approach to solve the problem, based on a decentralized nature-inspired cooperative technique, inspired by the foraging behavior of ants (AIA). Results provide important insights for policy-makers over the potential of using animal manure as fertilizer for crop fields, while AIA solves the problem effectively, in a fair way to the farmers and well balanced in terms of average transportation distances that need to be covered by each livestock farmer. Our work constitutes the first application of a decentralized AIA to this interesting real-world problem, in a domain where swarm intelligence methods are still under-exploited.",

WSN-driven applications greatly depend on the sensors' observations to support decision-making and respond accordingly to reported critical events. In case of compromisation, it is vital to recover compromised WSN services and continue to operate as expected. To achieve an effective restoration of compromised WSN services, sensors should be equipped with the logic to take recovery decisions and self-heal. Self-healing is challenging as sensors should be aware of a variety of aspects in order to take effective decisions and maximize the recovery benefits. So far situation awareness has not been actively investigated in an intrusion recovery context. This research work formulates situation aware intrusion recovery policy \u2026",

In this paper, the framework of a methodology is introduced to characterize the workload of programmable metasurfaces which is then used to analyze the beam steering HSFs.

However, delivering video over wireless networks poses a lot of challenges. Network congestion and wireless channel errors yield tremendous packet loss leading to degraded video quality. One of the most critical issues for video applications is to ensure that the quality of service (QoS) requirement will be maintained at an acceptable level, providing responsiveness to the time-variant network conditions as well as scalability and fairness among concurrent users. In this paper, we study the performance of a novel fuzzybased adaptive mechanism which takes into account a combination of Network Adaptation Techniques with Content Adaptation Techniques in order to achieve graceful performance degradation when network load increases and network conditions deteriorate. Our performance evaluations indicate that our approach finely adapts the video stream bit rate to the available bandwidth, maintains responsiveness to dynamic changes and achieves scalability and fairness as well as high and stable objective quality of service.",

Furthermore, topology modifications driven by mobile nodes or failures may lead to unpredictable network behavior, and even to congestion.

A system level simulator is used to obtain the blocking probability, and other QoS measures, e.g., handover failure probability and delay. Using these results, one obtains the system capacity, i.e., the supported fraction of active users and throughput for a given grade of service. The profit (in percentage) was obtained, and the optimum (most profitable) cell radius was found. A higher number of pico-cells (with a cell radius around 34 m) will be a profitable solution for the optimisation of network planning. This will also allow for increasing system capacity and reducing prices.",

            "Abstract": "Many congestion control protocols have been recently proposed in order to alleviate the problems encountered by TCP in high-speed networks and wireless links. Protocols utilizing an architecture that is in the same spirit as the ABR service in ATM networks require estimates of the effective number of users utilizing each link in the network to maintain stability in the presence of delays. In this paper, we propose a novel estimation algorithm that is based on online parameter identification techniques and is shown through analysis and simulations to converge to the effective number of users utilizing each link. The algorithm does not require maintenance of per-flow states within the network or additional fields in the packet header, and it is shown to outperform previous proposals that were based on pointwise division in time. The estimation scheme is designed independently from the control functions of the protocols \u2026",

This problem arises in many diverse scenarios within ad-hoc networks and especially networks formed during and in the aftermath of a disaster in which infrastructure-based communication systems have been damaged or completely destroyed.

Notably, the dissemination of alert messages has to be done in a way that achieves sufficient dissemination while ensuring network longevity.

Thus the mobile users that are on the move may have to deal with dynamic changes of network resources when crossing the cell edge, introducing new types of handovers (MBMS Handovers). Executing an MBMS Handover using the current Handover Algorithm will result in inefficiencies. Therefore, for efficient execution of these new types of handover a different approach has to be followed. This paper proposes a new Handover Algorithm which efficiently maximizes the overall system capacity when mobile MBMS users have to deal with these new types of handovers.",

            "Abstract": "Information hovering is an information dissemination concept over a mobile set of peers which has not been investigated to the extent that other information dissemination paradigms have. It naturally appears in many vehicular network applications where information must be made available to vehicles within a confined geographical area for during some time period. One elementary strategy is to flood the area with data. Even in this case, some vehicles may never receive the content due to potential partitions created by low traffic density. In order to address this issue, in this work we propose a strategy based on epidemic routing in the hovering area, and probabilistic flooding outside it. Vehicles outside the hovering area serve as bridges towards partitions, leading to high reachability. We highlight the adaptive feature of the protocol, where the rebroadcast probability in partitions is adaptively regulated based on estimates of the density of vehicles in the hovering area. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in VISSIM, using as the reference model in all simulation experiments a section of the road network in cities of Washington. The proposed protocol is shown to achieve the set design goals. View Full-Text",

Its flexibility of communication and access to the patient's history and daily record at all times, home, outpatients or in the event of an emergency admission has offered the team an overall assessment and history of each symptom. DITIS has thus offered improved quality of life to the patient, for example by offering the nurse's immediate authorisation to change prescription via mobile devices and the oncologist the possibility of assessment and symptom control without having to see the patient. It has offered the home care service the opportunity to plan future services and lobby for funding by offering audit, statistics, and performance evaluation and with these in place, the possibility for research. DITIS the programme will be presented and demonstrated including the mobile device and a discussion around the evaluation of its use. The difficulties will also be examined with trust being the key to implementation of the system.

We propose enhancements to the well-known Profile-Energy (Pro-Energy) model, the so-called Improved Profile-Energy (IPro-Energy), and compare its performance with Accurate Solar Irradiance Prediction Model (ASIM), Pro-Energy, and Weather Conditioned Moving Average (WCMA). The performance metrics considered are the prediction accuracy and the execution time which measure the implementation complexity. In addition, the effectiveness of the considered models, when integrated in an energy management scheme, is also investigated in terms of the achieved throughput and the energy consumption. Both solar irradiance and wind power datasets are used for the evaluation study. Our results indicate that the proposed IPro-Energy scheme outperforms the other candidate models in terms of the prediction accuracy achieved by up to 78% for short term predictions and 50% for medium term prediction horizons. For long term predictions, its prediction accuracy is comparable to the Pro-Energy model but outperforms the other models by up to 64%. In addition, the IPro scheme is able to achieve the highest throughput when integrated in the developed energy management scheme. Finally, the ASIM scheme reports the smallest implementation complexity.",

Packet losses and retransmissions resulting from congestion cost precious energy and shorten the lifetime of sensor nodes. This problem motivates the need for congestion control mechanisms in WSN. In this thesis, we identify several network aspects, some of which are unique to sensor networks, that affect congestion, as for example: sensor reporting rate; number of MAC retransmissions; RTS/CTS mechanism; buffer size; average path length; ad-hoc routing protocols; and Minimum Contention Window. We also study congestion symptoms, such as delay and packet loss, for different Wireless Sensor Network Congestion Types. Moreover, since congestion affects on energy consumption and fairness, these are also examined. A brief analysis of the existing congestion control schemes shows that most of them are effective on mitigating congestion mainly through rate control and packet drop mechanisms, but do so at the cost of significantly reducing application fidelity measured at the sinks. Also very few techniques appear to adopt the approach of resource provisioning (e.g waking up nodes and \u2018careful\u2019 routing). Although these may just use extra resources and reroute traffic or use multiple paths they may result in high energy consumption. Based on the above research a hybrid theoretical framework of a congestion control scheme is proposed which is composed of two parts: (i) Throttle the traffic when applications\u2019 fidelity requirements are met and / or energy consumed is more than the available budget, and (ii) Increase the network resources that \u2026",

However, as the amount of data increases, the waiting time of the clients becomes unacceptably high. The present paper proposes the combination of optimal wireless broadcasting and information hovering, as an effective means of performance improvement in vehicular networks with locality of demand. While state-of-the-art works exploit user collaboration only as a means of wireless coverage extension, the proposed scheme proposes parallel dissemination through broadcasting and user networking over the whole studied area. Optimal, periodic broadcast scheduling is adopted at the highest tier for data dissemination. At the lowest tier, users can exploit information hovering around selected anchoring points, in order to retrieve data faster than their next scheduled broadcast. The issue of sharing the dissemination load optimally between the broadcasting and the hovering subsystems is mapped to the classic pull-push balancing problem. Through analysis, the long-standing \u201coptimal cut-off point\u201d balancing method is shown to be suboptimal, and a new method is proposed which achieves lower client serving time in any of the cases. Simulation results in realistic VANETs show that the proposed dissemination scheme surpasses state-of-the-art works in terms of efficiency and client satisfaction.",

            "Abstract": "Network congestion control is a complex problem that requires robust, possibly intelligent, control methodologies to obtain satisfactory performance. Designing effective congestion control strategies for computer networks is known to be hard because of the difficulty of obtaining realistic, cost effective, tractable analytical models. This renders the application of classical control system design methods, which rely on availability of these models, very hard, and possibly not cost effective. Computational Intelligence employing Fuzzy Logic Control methodology is reported to offer effective solutions for certain classes of control problems. It is particularly appealing in non-linear complex systems where satisfactory analytic models are costly or impractical to obtain, but where their behaviour is well understood and can be captured by linguistic models. Consequently, a number of researchers have looked at fuzzy logic in order to devise effective, robust congestion control techniques. In this paper, we discuss several control approaches currently in use, before we motivate the utility of Fuzzy Logic based control. Then, through a number of examples, we illustrate the power of the methodology by the successful application of fuzzy based congestion control in the two diverse networking technologies of ATM and TCP/IP.",

By solving the location of roadside units in order to meet the Gamma Deployment, the network designer assures a given share of vehicles to keep frequent contacts with roadside units. Since Gamma Deployment reflects the connectivity experienced by drivers, it can be used for comparing vehicular networks deployed over distinct conditions.",

DITIS evolved to be much more than that and even though it has been introduced five years ago it is considered as a novel application.

This phenomenon had a negative effect on the bus transport mode which over the years its use has been considerably reduced. As traffic congestion increased considerably during the same period the need for a high quality public transportation system became clear. This need is also supported by the demand for public transportation by the aging and disadvantaged population. The best way to attract people back to public transportation is to have a reliable bus system with a high quality of service which can compensate for the lack of freedom and exibility a private vehicle can provide. However such a system should not have a negative effect on the traffic network in terms of congestion and travel times but should coexist serving both the needs of people who do not drive and those who use the public transport \u2026",

At operation phase, the routing employs the appropriate subset of anchors, selected by the sender of a packet. CORONA requires minimal setup overhead and simple integer-based calculations only, imposing limited requirements for trustworthy operation. Once deployed, it operates efficiently, yielding a very low packet retransmission and packet loss rate, promoting energy-efficiency and medium multiplexity.",

A typical security attack that can be launched by an adversary, in order to affect the network's communication, is the selective forwarding attack. If compromisation occurs, it is essential to recover the network to a stable state. In the context of mission-critical WSNs the challenge is not just to recover from compromisation but it is vital to restore an enhanced network operation in order to support a reliable decision-making. Sensor nodes usually address the selective forwarding attack by deploying blacklisting and rerouting. These countermeasures have been proposed in the context of omni-directional networks.

Extensive simulations indicate that the protocol is able to guide the network to a stable equilibrium which is characterized by max\u2013min fairness, high-utilization, small queue sizes and no observable packet drops. In addition, it is found to be scalable with respect to changing bandwidths, delays and number of users utilizing the network.

With the emergence of mission-critical applications, performance control mechanisms are considered of prime importance. Performance control can be carried out by robust congestion control approaches that aim to keep the network operational under varying network conditions. Swarm intelligence is successfully employed to combat congestion by mimicking the collective behavior of bird flocks. In this way, the emerging global behavior of minimum congestion is achieved collectively. A flock-based congestion control (Flock-CC) approach was proposed in the past.

            "Abstract": "The modeling of complex dynamic systems has always been a challenging research topic due to the fact that mathematical models cannot accurately describe nature. A real system is often nonlinear, with infinite dimensions, noise, and external disturbances, and characteristics that can vary with time. It is impossible to describe these dynamic characteristics with mathematical equations and achieve a high level of accuracy in the sense that for the same inputs the outputs of the model match those of the real system over the whole frequency spectrum. What is possible, however, and useful for all practical purposes is to achieve model/system output matching over the frequency range of interest, which is often the low-frequency range. In this case modeling is even more challenging as decisions have to be made as to which phenomena and dynamics are neglected and which ones are modeled. Modeling is therefore \u2026",

Real-time sensory data is expected to assist in addressing some of these challenges.

We believe that location would be the key element that will enable this bridging. Location will facilitate the filtering of large amounts of real-time sensory data, being generated to represent environmental conditions. In this paper, we developed a location-based, mobile application that interacts with Webenabled sensors that are deployed in the vicinity of the user, by means of online, global sensor directories.

The present work proposes a solution to the EM wave sensing problem using the intelligent and networked MS counterparts-the HyperSurfaces (HSFs), without requiring dedicated field sensors. An nano-network embedded within the HSF iterates over the possible MS configurations, finding the one that fully absorbs the impinging EM wave, hence maximizing the energy distribution within the HSF.

The proposed approach adopts a swarm intelligence paradigm inspired by the collective behavior of bird flocks having global self-* properties and emergent behavior achieved collectively without explicitly programming these properties into individual nodes. The proposed approach aims at being simple to implement at the individual node, involving minimal information exchange.The main idea is to \u2018guide\u2019packets (birds) to form flocks and flow towards the sink (global attractor), whilst trying to avoid congestion regions (obstacles). The direction of motion of a packet flock is influenced by repulsion and attraction forces between packets, as well as the field of view (FoV) and the artificial magnetic field in the direction of the artificial magnetic pole (sink). Two different models of the flock-based congestion control (Flock-CC) approach were proposed. Both models are presented in this report. The two models have some important differences. The first model, presented in [1],[2], and [3], is more complex and involves three tunable parameters. The second model, mimics more faithfully the bird flocking paradigm, as presented by Couzin at al.[4] and it is simple since it involves only one tunable parameter. Hence easier to tune and thereafter deploy. Even though is simpler, the second model maintains comparably good performance characteristics to the first model. The development of the second model passed through several stages over which different options for (a) repulsion and \u2026",

The phenomenon has been recently observed in the context of Vehicular Ad Hoc Netwoks [3] which constitute a subclass of MANETs with, however, special characteristics such as the confined network topology. It is thus important to verify the existence of such phase transition phenomena anlytically in the context of VANETs. In this technical report we first utilize a simple mathematical model of a vehicular network on a single lane road to derive a difference equation which can be used to find numerical values of the probability of all vehicles receiving the critical message as a function of the retransmission probability. The solution of this difference equation is shown to exhibit phase transition phenomena similar to the ones observed using simulations. We then extend our analysis to a two lane road and we derive a lower bound on the probabability of all vehicles receiving the message. It is worth noting that the analysis reveals the inherent existence of recursion in the analysis of probabilistic flooding schemes.",

It naturally applies in many applications in vehicular ad-hoc networks, where useful information needs to be made available to all vehicles within a confined geographical area for a specific time interval. A straightforward approach, is to have all vehicles within the hovering area exchange messages with each other. However, this method does not guarantee that all vehicles within the hovering area will receive the message due to potential partitioning of the network in areas with low traffic density and/or low market penetration rate. In this work, we address the problem by applying probabilistic flooding schemes outside the hovering area.

A significant issue in VANETs is the design of an effective broadcast scheme which can facilitate the fast and reliable dissemination of critical safety messages to neighbouring vehicles in case of an unexpected event, such as a traffic accident. Towards this goal, we propose a novel Speed Adaptive Probabilistic Flooding algorithm (SAPF) 1. Its decision to rebroadcast a message is based on a probability, evaluated using the speed of the vehicle. The algorithm enjoys a number of benefits relative to other approaches: it is simple to implement and does not introduce additional communication burden as it requires local information only, it does not rely on the existence of a positioning system which may not always be available and above all, mitigates the effect of the broadcast storm problem, typical when utilizing blind flooding. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms blind flooding, especially in cases of heavy congestion. The SAPF algorithm achieves high reachability and unlike blind flooding, it also maintains low latency as the density of vehicles in the road network increases.",

Nowadays, 50% of the population lives in urban areas, and forecasts point that by 2050 this number will reach 70%. Today, 64% of all travel made is within urban environments and the total amount of urban kilometers traveled is expected to triple by 2050. Thus, seeking novel solutions for urban mobility becomes paramount for 21st century society. In this work, we discuss the performance of vehicular networks. We consider the metric Delta Network. The Delta Network characterizes the connectivity of the vehicular network through the percentage of travel time in which vehicles are connected to roadside units. This article reviews the concept of the Delta Network and extends its study through the presentation of a general heuristic based on the definition of scores to identify the areas of the road network that should receive coverage. After defining the general heuristic, we show how small changes in the score computation can generate very distinct (and interesting) patterns of coverage, each one suited to a given scenario. In order to exemplify such behavior, we propose three deployment strategies based on simply changing the computation of scores. We compare the proposed strategies to the intuitive strategy of allocating communication units at the most popular zones of the road network. Experiments show that the strategies derived from the general heuristic provide higher coverage than the intuitive strategy when using the same number of communication devices. Moreover, the resulting pattern of coverage is very interesting, with roadside units deployed a \u2026",

If P-t-P transmission mode is selected for a cell, one Dedicated Channel (DCH) is established for each user within the cell that joined the MBMS service.

Designing effective congestion control strategies for computer networks is known to be hard because of the difficulty of obtaining realistic, cost effective, tractable analytical models. This renders the application of classical control system design methods, which rely on availability of these models, very hard, and possibly not cost effective. Computational Intelligence employing Fuzzy Logic Control methodology is reported to offer effective solutions for certain classes of control problems. It is particularly appealing in non-linear complex systems where satisfactory analytic models are costly or impractical to obtain, but where their behaviour is well understood and can be captured by linguistic models. Consequently, a number of researchers have looked at fuzzy logic in order to devise effective, robust congestion control techniques. In this paper, we discuss several control approaches currently in use, before we motivate the utility of Fuzzy Logic based control. Then, through a number of examples, we illustrate the power of the methodology by the successful application of fuzzy based congestion control in the two diverse networking technologies of ATM and TCP/IP.",

Most of the messages that vehicles exchange are characterized by a finite lifetime period, after which, their level of usefulness is greatly reduced. Thus, an important problem in VANETS is to find efficient ways to disseminate information on the target areas before this deadline expires. The problem of information dissemination has been extensively studied in the literature and a number of solutions have been proposed. However, no previous work has addressed the problem of calculating the probability to propagate information in a certain amount of time among vehicles on intersecting roads where no static infrastructure, such as repeaters, is used. In this paper, we derive a formula which gives a lower bound on this probability. We show that the propagation probability is strongly related to the traffic conditions of the road where the information is to be transmitted. We use the derived formula to estimate, via simulations, the minimal conditions required to ensure that information propagation occurs with high probability on intersections. We validate our analytical findings with simulation\u2019s results obtained using the VISSIM simulator.",

Whenever this condition is satisfied, a sudden traffic increase occurs which may lead the network into congestion. This is particularly undesirable because the data generated during this situation are of great importance, often critical, to the applications. We propose a novel algorithm which is able to control a congestion situation and which is efficient enough to safely transmit almost all the data, generated by the sensors due to an event, back to the sinks. The algorithm does that without throttling the source nodes\u2019 data rate. Throttling the data rate could prove fatal for critical networks, due to the fact that each data packet provides the network with updated information concerning the monitored event.",

The current chapter proposes a cooperative strategy to mitigate the interference and enhance the quality of service in dense wireless deployments by having neighboring APs agree to take turns (e.g., in round-robin fashion) to serve each other\u2019s clients.

            "Abstract": "Probabilistic flooding is commonly considered in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to alleviate the celebrated broadcast storm problem. Heuristics and simulations have so far proved to be an efficient way with which to design probabilistic information dissemination solutions with demonstrated effectiveness. Supplementing with mathematical analysis for both design and evaluation is expected to generalize the results, and increase the confidence in the proposed solutions. So far, this has been limited due to the difficulties associated with the underlying stochastic dependencies. In this paper, we introduce simple models of single and multiple lane roads to design effective probabilistic flooding schemes for VANETs. The proposed analytical framework offers a novel and generic tool which can cover any number of lanes, vehicle transmission range, and density. We derive difference equations whose solutions yield \u2026",

The new network architecture involves interactions among unsophisticated entities which may be characterized by constrained resources.

Biological processes found in nature exhibit desirable properties e.g. self-adaptability and robustness, thus providing a desirable basis for such computing environments. This study focuses on streaming applications in sensor networks and on how congestion can be prevented by regulating the rate of each traffic flow based on the Lotka-Volterra population model.

The control objective is to regulate the queue size at each link so that it tracks a reference queue size chosen by the designer. To achieve the latter, the protocol implements at each link a certainty equivalent proportional controller which utilizes estimates of the effective number of users utilizing the link. These estimates are generated online using a novel estimation algorithm which is based on online parameter identification techniques. The protocol utilizes an explicit multi-bit feedback scheme and does not require maintenance of per flow states within the network. Extensive simulations indicate that the protocol is able to guide the network to a stable equilibrium which is characterized by max-min fairness, high utilization, queue sizes close to the reference value and no observable packet drops. In addition, it is found to be scalable with respect to changing bandwidths, delays and number of users utilizing the network. The protocol also exhibits nice transient properties such as smooth responses with no oscillations and fast convergence. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

The control objective is to direct the incoming signal on the metasurface towards a single receiver. The signal strength is measured at the receiver and then sent to the observer-based estimator, which predicts the distance between the current location of the reflected beam and the desired location. The designed control algorithm uses the prediction to change the reflection angle by appropriately varying the metasurface parameters. The stability of the control algorithm is established by Lyapunov arguments and the employed observer is an extended Kalman filter.

The coexistence problems arise from having several primary and secondary networks of different technologies cohabiting the same licensed spectrum simultaneously. The self-coexistence problems arise from many secondary systems /users coexisting at the same place while using identical or different technologies. In particular, fair distribution of available spectrum becomes a serious issue. In this paper, we use a game theoretic approach to model the self-coexistence problem as a competitive game between secondary networks. We show that our game belongs to the class of congestion-averse games which are known to possess pure Nash equilibria. This leads us to a decentralized approach for spectrum sharing among systems with different PHY \u2026",

The Dense Deployme nt of Small Cell Base Stations (SBSs) will play a major role as they can be installed in a more targeted manner to relieve traffic in hot spot areas, increase coverage, and spectral efficiency.

In the scenario of unpredictable crowd movement, these static deployment of small cell can be inefficient with high CAPEX and OPEX.

            "Abstract": "A significant issue in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is the design of an effective broadcast scheme that can facilitate the fast and reliable dissemination of emergency warning messages in the vicinity of an unexpected event, such as a traffic accident. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to this problem, which we refer to as speed adaptive probabilistic flooding. The scheme employs probabilistic flooding to mitigate the effects of the broadcast storm problem, which is typical when using blind flooding, and its unique feature is that the rebroadcast probability is adaptively regulated based on the vehicle speed to account for varying traffic densities within the transportation network. The motivation behind this choice is the identification of the existence of phase transition phenomena in probabilistic flooding in VANETs, which dictate a critical probability being affected by the varying vehicle traffic density and are shown to be linearly related to the vehicle speed (a locally measurable quantity). The scheme is evaluated using simulations on different sections of the freeway system in the City of Los Angeles, CA, USA. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme fulfills its design objectives, as it achieves high reachability and low latency of message delivery with low overhead in a number of representative scenarios. The scheme is also shown to outperform existing solutions, including Global-Positioning-System-based, and exhibits robustness with respect to different road topologies and parameters such as the transmission range of vehicles and the number of hops. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.",

In such scenario, efficient multiparty delivery depends upon the grouping operation (creation of a set of users to receive a given session), which must be done based on several parameters. We propose sub-grouping of content-based service groups, so that the same service session can be delivered using different codings of the same content, to adapt to the current network, users, session and environment context.

The results on maximising the throughput obtained with GA-BAVP and CCOBAVP are in close agreement, however when considering fairness GA-BAVP outperforms CCO-BAVP, especially for more complex topologies, like the 7-node network, without abundant link capacity. Convergence of the two algorithms appears similar, with GA-BAVP outperforming CCO-BAVP in initial stages, and vice-versa for longer time scales. However as the problem complexity increases the solution time for the Genetic Algorithm does not increase as fast as the classical constrained optimisation algorithm. A hybrid scheme is also introduced, combining the benefits of both algorithms. It exhibited better overall convergence rate but the same solution as CCO-BAVP.",

The main objective of the TRAFFICNET 1 project is to design, analyze and evaluate a new generation Highway Traffic Management and Control System (HTMC) and examine its beneficial effects on the Cyprus Highway Network. The HTMC system comprises of a data acquisition unit and a roadway controller which act upon the highway network to form a closed loop highway control system. The roadway controller implements ramp metering and variable speed limit strategies which are capable of significantly reducing traffic congestion and contribute to improved safety. Ramp Metering and Variable Speed Limit algorithms which have been proposed in literature are based on certain second order macroscopic traffic flow models which are nonlinear in nature and thus lead to strategies which are complex and computationally intense. Recently, members of the TRAFFICNET consortium have proposed new ramp metering and variable speed algorithms which are computationally feasible and easy to implement. In this paper we present these algorithms and evaluate their performance on a carefully chosen section of the Cyprus Highway Network. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed roadway control strategy brings major improvements to the existing highway network by alleviating congestion, reducing travel times and improving road safety.",

An example of such a network is a converged communication network, a paradigm found in Fourth Generation Telecommunication Networks, where heterogeneous access technologies may coexist. Among other features, this new network model enables a user (or a set of users) to be served by any (one or many) of the multiple, available access networks. These access networks carry differing characteristics and capabilities encouraging the decoupling of carriage and content, ie, the \u2026",

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination.

The new user capabilities spawn a demand for  Always Best Connectivity  (ABC), i.e. that a user can always have the best possible connection regardless of place and time. This brings forth a new communication paradigm, which is user-centric, i.e. the user is no longer bound to only one access network but can  choose  the best available access network to satisfy a specific service request. The IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) is the technology promoted to enable this ubiquitous converged network.

Assuming a typical tree-based aggregation scenario, the waking window is defined as the time interval r during which S enables its transceiver in order to collect the results from its children. Minimizing the length of r enables S to conserve energy that can be used to prolong the longevity of the network and hence the quality of results. Our method is established on profiling recent data acquisition activity and on identifying the bottlenecks using an in-network execution of the Critical Path Method. We show through trace- driven experimentation with a real dataset that MicroPulse can reduce the energy cost of the waking window by three orders of magnitude.",

We consider the single bottleneck link topology and use a non-linear model for the queueing dynamics. A known algorithm is then extended to improve performance. Integral action is added to remove any steady state errors and the control signal is then normalized by the estimated number of flows. The main contribution of this work is the estimation algorithm that we propose, which is based on on-line parameter identification techniques and is shown analytically to converge to the correct number of flows exponentially fast. The algorithm does not require maintenance of per flow states and can thus form the basis for the development of an end-to-end congestion control protocol. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulations carried out on the Ns simulator. Good estimation of the number of sessions and good tracking of the reference queue size are observed. 1",

            "Abstract": "Traffic congestion has become unbearable in the urban areas of Cyprus. Particularly, Cypriot private car utilization over the past twenty years has risen to unprecedented levels while conversely, the usage of the only available means of public transport on the island-the Bus-has fallen dramatically. As a result, revolutionary transport policies are essential to turnaround the current traffic trends. For a long term solution to the problem, transport policies should aim to draw people back to public transportation. As revealed by recent surveys, the way to achieve this goal is to have a reliable and fast bus system with a high quality of service which can balance out the flexibility a private vehicle can offer. However, such a system should not have a detrimental effect on the road network in terms of congestion and travel times. The objective of this paper is to assess the current road traffic situation at a particular high-impact route in Nicosia, the capital city of Cyprus, and then develop and evaluate of a number of transportation network scenarios. The scenarios to be evaluated include the use of dedicated bus lanes and high occupancy vehicle lanes. The assessment is carried out via validated microscopic simulation models of the traffic network. As seen from the analysis of the results, a viable long term solution to enhancing the bus transport mode is drawn where significant improvements are achieved regarding a number of measures of effectiveness, such as travel time, delays and speed.",

            "Abstract": "Periodic broadcast scheduling typically considers a set of discrete data items, characterized by their popularity, size and scheduling cost. A classic goal is the definition of an infinite, periodic schedule that yields minimum mean client serving time and minimum mean scheduling cost at the same time. This task has been proven to be NP-Hard and more recent works have discarded the scheduling cost attribute, focusing only on the minimization of the mean client serving time. In the context of the present work the scheduling cost is reinstated. An analysis-based scheduling technique is presented, which can practically minimize the mean client serving time and the mean scheduling cost concurrently. Comparison with related approaches yields superior performance in all test cases.",

            "Abstract": "M-Health systems and services have seen significant growth over the past decade. Increasingly available bitrate through new wireless technologies linked with compression advances provided by current state-of-the-art H. 264 advanced video coding standard, have brought rapid growth to the development of mobile health (m-Health) healthcare systems and services. Advances in nanotechnologies, compact biosensors, wearable devices and clothing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing systems have broadened the applicability areas of such systems and services. A recent overview of the current status, highlighting future directions, while also covering incorporated wireless transmission technologies, can be found in (Kyriacou et al., 2007; Istepanian et al., 2006). Despite this momentum towards m-Health systems and especially e-Emergency systems, wireless channels remain error prone, while the absence of objective quality metrics (Wang & Bovik, 2009) limits the ability of providing medical video of adequate diagnostic quality at a required bitrate. Recently, new image and video quality metrics have been proposed, for evaluating the original and transmitted (or despeckled)(Loizou & Pattichis, 2008) video over a communication path, but these have not yet been applied to wireless transmission. The development of effective medical video streaming systems requires the implementation of error-resilient methods that are also diagnostically relevant. Although a plethora of studies has been published in video transmission, very few have focused on the difficulties associated with the wireless transmission of medical ultrasound video.

            "Abstract": "Recent approaches on the study of networks have exploded over almost all the sciences across the academic spectrum. Over the last few years, the analysis and modeling of networks as well as networked dynamical systems have attracted considerable interdisciplinary interest. These efforts were driven by the fact that systems as diverse as genetic networks or the Internet can be best described as complex networks. On the contrary, although the unprecedented evolution of technology, basic issues and fundamental principles related to the structural and evolutionary properties of networks still remain unaddressed and need to be unraveled since they affect the function of a network. Therefore, the characterization of the wiring diagram and the understanding on how an enormous network of interacting dynamical elements is able to behave collectively, given their individual non linear dynamics are of prime importance.In this study we explore simple models of complex networks from real communication networks perspective, focusing on their structural and evolutionary properties. The limitations and vulnerabilities of real communication networks drive the necessity to develop new theoretical frameworks to help explain the complex and unpredictable behaviors of those networks based on the aforementioned principles, and design alternative network methods and techniques which may be provably effective, robust and resilient to accidental failures and coordinated attacks.",

However, little is known about the traffic that this network will have to support as the target electromagnetic function or boundary conditions change. In this paper, we lay down the foundations of a methodology to characterize the workload of programmable metasurfaces and then employ it to analyze the case of beam steering HSFs. We observe that traffic is bursty and highly dependent on the position of the target. These results will enable the early-stage evaluation of intra-HSF networks \u2026",

Considering that in such a dense urban residential area, each unit has its own wireless access point (AP), deployed without any coordination with other such units, then a need arises for reducing interference and increasing overall Quality of Experience (QoE) of the clients involved. To do this, we propose that neighbouring APs i.e., APs that are physically close to each other form groups, where one member of the group serves the terminals of all group members in addition to its own terminals, while the other APs of the group can be silent or even turned off. The fact that participating units are deployed without any coordination makes the overall QoE vulnerable to the selfish behaviour of each unit. We propose a cooperative-neighbourhood graphical game model comprising of a network of selfishly-oriented nodes represented by a graph where the outgoing links of a certain node capture the improvement in utility that a neighbour's client may experience from a potential cooperation. We show and prove that using the proposed model provides motivation for APs to enter and remain in cooperative neighbourhoods, in which interference is decreased due to the voluntary cooperation of the neighbours.",

The scheme employs probabilistic flooding to mitigate the effects of the broadcast storm problem, which is typical when using blind flooding, and its unique feature is that the rebroadcast probability is adaptively regulated based on the vehicle speed to account for varying traffic densities within the transportation network. The motivation behind this choice is the identification of the existence of phase transition phenomena in probabilistic flooding in VANETs, which dictate a critical probability being affected by the varying vehicle traffic density and are \u2026",

Infrastructure research on communication and networking is essential for realizing wireless and mobile systems. Equally important, however, is the design and implementation of data management applications for these systems (e.g., wireless virtual teams) a task directly affected by the characteristics of the wireless medium, the limitations of mobile computing devices, and the resulting mobility of resources and computation.",

            "Abstract": "As currently specified by 3GPP, MBMS services can be provided in a cell either by point-to-point (PtP) or point-to-multipoint (PtM) transmission mode, but not both at the same time. With PtP transmission mode, one dedicated channel (DCH) is established for each MBMS user within the cell. With PtM transmission mode one forward access channel (FACH) is established, covering the whole cellpsilas area and commonly shared by all the MBMS users within. In this paper we describe the existing 3GPP MBMS service provision approach, highlight its deficiencies, and propose a new approach to address them. To achieve this we introduce the ldquodual transmission mode cellsrdquo in which PtP and PtM transmissions can coexist and where FACHpsilas coverage range can be dynamically adapted (shrink or expand) through time based on the MBMS userspsila location within the cell.

While many AQM mechanisms have recently been proposed, these require careful configuration of non-intuitive control parameters, and show weaknesses to detect and control congestion under dynamic traffic changes, and a slow response to regulate queues. The proposed fuzzy logic approach for congestion control allows the use of linguistic knowledge to capture the dynamics of nonlinear probability marking functions, uses multiple inputs to capture the (dynamic) state of the network more accurately, and can offer effective implementation. A simulation study over a wide range of traffic conditions shows that the FEM controller outperforms a number of representative AQM schemes in terms of queue fluctuations and delays, packet losses, and link utilization.",

In this context, the present work suggests a new development framework which aims at estimating the level of complexity a certain e-commerce system encompasses and driving the selection of a long or short software process in terms of time and effort. The proposed framework utilizes a special form of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to define and assess critical business and organizational factors within small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) whishing to go ecommerce. This set of factors is enriched with other critical issues belonging to the quality requirements of the system and to the application type of services it aspires to offer. The set of critical factors identified is used to estimate the average complexity level of the system using numerical values to describe the contribution of each factor to the overall complexity. The level of complexity estimated dictates the adoption of either a short or a long version of the well-known WebE process for analysing, designing and implementing the e-commerce system required by an SME.",

            "Abstract": "Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have re-cently attracted a lot of attention, as a tool to disseminate information among vehicles with the dual purpose of increasing road safety and comfort in driving. The majority of messages exchanged by vehicles are characterized by a finite lifetime period, after which, their level of usefulness is greatly reduced. Thus, an important problem in VANETs is to pursue efficient routing policies which can ensure information delivery in target areas, before this deadline expires. The routing problem has been studied extensively in the literature and a number of solutions have been proposed. However, no previous work has investigated the problem based on the probability to deliver messages to a specific area in a certain amount of time, in a setting where no static infrastructure is used. In this paper we study the problem using a graph theoretical approach. We model the road map and the traffic characteristics using a directed weighted graph which we refer to as the Road-Graph. We use the Road-Graph to calculate the probability of disseminating information along any given path, in a specific amount of time. So, for any two points on the Road-Graph we can find the path with the maximum probability of successful information delivery in the chosen time interval. This information is of great significance since it can be utilized by routing protocols to optimally route packets in the vehicular network. We validate our analytical findings by comparing them with data obtained using the VISSIM simulator. The simulation model that we consider represents a section of the Highway network in the Los Angeles area and is tuned \u2026",

This algorithm, although effective in terms of capacity and QoS, has some limitations concerning the way certain parameters vital for the efficient MBMS handover execution are estimated.
