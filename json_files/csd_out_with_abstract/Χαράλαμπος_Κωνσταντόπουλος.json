In particular, low and very low bit rate video coding schemes need sophisticated motion models which usually require a large number of arithmetic operations. In this paper we present a parallel algorithm for the most practical of these models. Specifically we implement the affine motion model on a hypercube\u2010based multiprocessor. This model covers the most usual kinds of motion and requires only a modest number of arithmetic operations. Also, the hypercube network can efficiently handle the non\u2010regular data flow resulting from the parallel implementation of this model. In addition, we assume that our multiprocessor is fine grained, in contrast to most programmable architectures used in video coding, where processors usually have large local memory.

This in turn requires fast notification of actors from Sensor Nodes (SNs) about events as well as effective coordination of actors for prompt event handling. In this paper, we introduce an on-line distributed protocol for event handling in a WSAN. Existing techniques usually select actors nearby the current event for handling it. However, this greedy approach may eventually lead to a slow response to events because it does not consider the spatial distribution that future events might have. In contrast, in order to cater for future events, the proposed solution probabilistically selects actors for event handling, allowing distant actors to be selected as well. This randomized approach guarantees fast average responsiveness to events, a balanced energy consumption among actors \u2026",

We also present a parallel algorithm for the corresponding LZ77 decoding algorithm. Although there exist PRAM algorithms for various dictionary compression methods, their rather irregular structure has discouraged their implementation on practical interconnection networks such as the mesh and hypercube.

Clustering of mobile nodes among separate domains has been proposed as an efficient approach to address those issues. In this work, we introduce an efficient distributed clustering algorithm that uses both location and energy metrics for cluster formation. Our proposed solution mainly addresses cluster stability, manageability and energy efficiency issues. Also, unlike existing active clustering methods, our algorithm relieves the network from the unnecessary burden of control messages broadcasting, especially for relatively static network topologies.

The design objective of our Jamming Avoidance Itinerary Design (JAID) algorithm is twofold: (a) to calculate near-optimal routes for MAs that incrementally fuse the data as they visit the nodes; (b) in the face of jamming attacks against the WSN, to modify the itineraries of the MAs to bypass the jammed area(s) while not disrupting the efficient data dissemination from working sensors. If the number of jammed nodes is small, JAID only modifies the pre-jamming scheduled itineraries to increase the algorithm\u2019s promptness.

For satisfying timely delivery of sensory data to the mobile sink, the mobile sink is forced to visit only an appropriate number of rendezvous nodes while the remaining nodes send their data through multi-hop communication toward the rendezvous nodes. The proposed technique achieves prolonged network lifetime by selecting energy rich paths for this multi-hop communication. Specifically, first the network is partitioned into a number of clusters and then the cluster heads of an appropriate number of energy rich clusters are selected as rendezvous nodes in such a way that (i) the rendezvous nodes are appropriately distributed across the network area to ensure energy efficient data gathering from the other sensor nodes to the rendezvous nodes and (ii) the length of the mobile sink trajectory \u2026",

In this paper, we deviate from the common approach for solving this problem, that is, finding first the shortest paths between successive nodes in the above sequence and then synthesizing the final solution from the solutions of these sub-problems. We propose a more direct approach and solve the problem by a label-setting approach which is able to early prune a lot of partial paths that cannot be part of the optimal solution. In addition, we study a different version of the main problem where it is only required that the solution path should pass through a set of specific nodes irrespectively of the particular order in which these nodes are included in the path. As a case study, we have applied the proposed techniques for solving the itinerary planning of a ship with respect to two conflicting criteria, in the area of the Aegean Sea, Greece. Moreover, the algorithm handles the case that the ship speed is not constant throughout the whole voyage. Specifically, it can be set at a different level each time the ship departs from an intermediate port in order to obtain low cost solutions for the itinerary planning. The experimental results confirm the high performance of the proposed algorithms.",

            "Abstract": "Clustering is a promising approach for building hierarchies and simplifying the routing process in mobile ad-hoc network environments. The main objective of clustering is to identify suitable node representatives, i.e. cluster heads (CHs), to store routing and topology information and maximize clusters stability. Traditional clustering algorithms suggest CH election exclusively based on node IDs or location information and involve frequent broadcasting of control packets, even when network topology remains unchanged. More recent works take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and optimize initial clustering. However, in many situations (e.g. in relatively static topologies) re-clustering procedure is hardly ever invoked; hence initially elected CHs soon reach battery exhaustion.

The main objective in clustering is to identify suitable node representatives, i.e. cluster heads (CHs) to store routing and topology information; CHs should be elected so as to maximize clusters stability, that is to prevent frequent cluster re-structuring. Since CHs are engaged on packet forwarding they are prone to rapidly drop their energy supplies, hence, another important objective of clustering is to prevent such node failures. Recently proposed clustering algorithms either suggest CH election based on node IDs (nodes with locally lowest ID value become CHs) or take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and optimize initial clustering. Yet, the former method is biased against nodes with low IDs (which are likely to serve as CHs for long periods and \u2026",

Since many applications require the solution of morphological problems in real time, researching time efficient algorithms for these two operations is crucial.  In this paper, efficient algorithms for the binary as well as the grey level dilation and erosion are presented and evaluated for an advanced associative processor. It is shown through simulation results that the above architecture is near optimal in the binary case and is also as efficient as the array processor with a 2D-mesh interconnection in the grey level case.

The monitoring is based on the recording of environmental parameters like temperature and light intensity as well as micro-level incidents which allows one to infer daily activities like moving, sitting, sleeping, usage of electrical appliances and plumbing components. The prototype is built upon inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware (eg, various sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, ZigBee-compatible wireless communication modules) and license-free software, thereby ensuring low system deployment costs. The network comprises nodes placed in a house\u2019s main rooms or mounted on furniture, one wearable node, one actuator node and a centralized processing element (coordinator). Upon detecting significant deviations from the ordinary activity patterns of individuals and/or sudden falls, the system issues automated alarms which may be forwarded to authorized caregivers via a variety of communication channels.

The proposed algorithm creates multi-hop clusters whose cluster heads (CHs) as well as cluster members near the CHs have high energy reserves. Specifically, the energy of the sensors in a cluster increases progressively as getting closer to the CH. As the nodes closer to the CH are most burdened with relaying of data from other cluster members, the higher levels of available energy at these nodes prolong the network lifetime eventually. After cluster formation, a MS periodically visits each CH and collects the data from cluster members already gathered at the CH. Simulation \u2026",

Moreover, the hypercube network can efficiently handle the non regular data flow of the HBMME algorithm. Our techniques nearly eliminate the occurrence of \u201cdifficult\u201d communication patterns, namely many-to-many personalized communication, by replacing them with simple shift operations. These operations have an efficient implementation on most of interconnection networks and thus our techniques can be adapted to other networks as well. With regard to the employed multiprocessor we make no specific assumption about the amount of local memory residing in each processor. Instead, we introduce a free parameter S and assume that each processor has O (S) local memory.

The proposed algorithm creates multi-hop clusters whose clusterheads (CHs) as well as all cluster members near the CHs have high energy reserves. As these are exactly the nodes most burdened with relaying of data from other cluster members, the higher levels of available energy at these nodes prolong the network lifetime eventually. After cluster creation, a MS periodically visits each CH and collects the data from cluster members already gathered at the CH.

The objectives to be minimized are the mean total risk and fuel cost incurred along the obtained route while considering the time-varying sea and weather conditions and also a constraint on the total passage time of the route. In addition, for achieving a high safety level the proposed approaches should return only solutions compliant with the guidelines of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Two different well-known genetic algorithms, namely SPEA2 and NSGA-II are applied to the ship routing problem and a comparative performance evaluation of the two algorithms is performed. The proposed approaches are tested on real data and compared with an exact algorithm which solves the same problem.",

            "Abstract": "Given a graph whose nodes and edges are associated with a profit, a visiting (or traversing) time and an admittance time window, the Mixed Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (MTOPTW) seeks for a specific number of walks spanning a subset of nodes and edges of the graph so as to maximize the overall collected profit. The visit of the included nodes and edges should take place within their respective time window and the overall duration of each walk should be below a certain threshold. In this paper we introduce the MTOPTW, which can be used for modeling a realistic variant of the Tourist Trip Design Problem where the objective is the derivation of near-optimal multiple-day itineraries for tourists visiting a destination which features several points of interest (POIs) and scenic routes. Since the MTOPTW is a NP-hard problem, we propose the first metaheuristic approaches to tackle it. The effectiveness of our algorithms is validated through a number of experiments on POI and scenic route sets compiled from the city of Athens (Greece). View Full-Text",

A popular clustering algorithm (LID) suggests CH election based on node IDs (nodes with locally lowest ID value become CHs). Although fast and simple, this method is biased against nodes with low IDs, which are likely to serve as CHs for long periods and are therefore prone to rapid battery exhaustion. Herein, we propose LIDAR, a novel clustering method which represents a major improvement over traditional LID algorithm: node IDs are periodically re-assigned so that nodes with low mobility rate and high energy capacity are assigned low ID values and, therefore, are likely to serve as CHs.

In the event that an attacker uses a rather powerful jamming source, disruptions of WSNs proper function are likely to occur. As a result, the use of countermeasures against jamming in WSN environments is of immense importance. The main contribution of this article is the discussion of various defence methods against jamming that would allow a WSN to survive and work properly in a hostile jamming environment.

The design objective of our Jamming Avoidance Itinerary Design (JAID) algorithm is twofold:(a) to calculate near-optimal routes for MAs that incrementally fuse the data as they visit the nodes;(b) in the face of jamming attacks against the WSN, to modify the itineraries of the MAs to avoid the jammed area (s) while not disrupting the efficient data dissemination from working sensors. If the number of jammed nodes is small, JAID only modifies the pre-jamming scheduled itineraries to increase the algorithm\u2019s promptness. Otherwise, JAID reconstructs the agent itineraries excluding the jammed area (s). Another important feature of JAID is the suppression of data taken from sensors when the associated readings do not change overtime. Data suppression also applies sensors\u2019 readings are identical to those of their neighboring sensors.

            "Abstract": "Clustering techniques have been proposed to construct hierarchies of nodes inside Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) thereby increasing their scalability and manageability and reducing the amount of maintained routing information. Herein, we introduce a distributed clustering algorithm that uses both location and energy metrics for cluster formation. Our proposed solution addresses cluster stability, manageability and energy efficiency issues. Unlike existing active clustering methods, our algorithm relieves the network from the unnecessary burden of control messages broadcasting, especially for relatively static and quasi-static network topologies. The efficiency, scalability and competence of our algorithm against alternative approaches have been demonstrated through simulation results.",

            "Abstract": " Partitioned Optimal Passive Stars network, POPS(d,g), is an optical interconnection network of N processors (N=dg) with g 2 optical passive star couplers. In this network, there are g groups of d processors each and the g 2 couplers are used for connecting each group with each of the groups, including itself. In this paper, we present a technique for optimally simulating a frequently arising hypercube communication pattern on this network for all combinations of values of d and g. Specifically, we show that one-hop movements on the hypercube along the same dimension can be simulated on the POPS(d,g) network in    slots for d\u2260g and in 2 slots for d=g. ",

            "Abstract": "The Time Dependent Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (TDTOPTW) can be used to model several real life problems. Among them, the route planning problem for tourists interested in visiting multiple points of interest (POIs) using public transport. The main objective of this problem is to select POIs that match tourist preferences, while taking into account a multitude of parameters and constraints and respecting the time available for sightseeing in a daily basis. TDTOPTW is NP-hard while almost the whole body of the related literature addresses the non time dependent version of the problem. The only TDTOPTW heuristic proposed so far is based on the assumption of periodic service schedules. Herein, we propose two efficient cluster-based heuristics for the TDTOPTW which yield high quality solutions, take into account time dependency in calculating travel times between POIs and make no \u2026",
