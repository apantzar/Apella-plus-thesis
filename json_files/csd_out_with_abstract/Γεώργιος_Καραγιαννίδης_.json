            "Abstract": "This paper presents a detailed sum rate investigation of Zero-Forcing (ZF) detectors over composite multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. To this end, we consider the generic K distribution (Rayleigh/gamma distribution) to model the composite fading fluctuations and also assume the general case of semi-correlated small-scale fading. Novel exact analytical expressions are derived for the achievable sum rate followed by asymptotic expressions in the low Signal to-Noise ratio (SNR) regime. In parallel, new, closed-form upper and lower bounds on the sum rate are derived that re main tight for all SNRs. The theoretical analysis is validated via a set of Monte-Carlo simulations.",

More specifically, we present an analytical expression for the exact symbol error probability (SEP) of multidimensional signal sets, which is then used to derive a tight closed-form lower bound of the SEP, named Multiple Sphere Lower Bound (MLSB). Simulations are used to compare the proposed bound with the performance of various lattice constellations. It is clearly demonstrated that the MSLB can be efficiently used in finite lattice constellations, with arbitrary structure, dimension and rank. Furthermore, it can be easily extended to the case of fading channels, where multidimensional signal sets are commonly used to combat fading degradation.",

However, due to their small size, a plethora of such nanodevices need to be used in practical applications, thus, creating a nanonetwork, which collects the information and communicates with out-of-body nodes. For these networks, several models have been proposed for the THz channel in the in-vivo scenario. Most of them are based on well-defined theories and physical laws, while some of them are based on experiments.

We consider practical cases where task characteristics and computational capability at the CAPs may be time-varying, thus, creating a dynamic offloading problem. To deal with this problem, we first formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP), and then introduce the state and action spaces. We further design a novel offloading strategy based on the deep Q network (DQN), where the users can dynamically fine-tune the offloading proportion in order to ensure the system performance measured by the latency and energy consumption. Simulation results are finally presented to verify the advantages of the proposed DQN-based offloading strategy over conventional ones.",

In this network, we consider that a passive eavesdropper exists to overhear the transmitted information, which entails exploiting the advantages of both direct and relay links for physical layer security enhancement. To fulfill this requirement, we investigate two criteria for user and relay selection and examine the achievable secrecy performance. Criterion I performs a joint user and relay selection, while Criterion II performs separate user and relay selections, with a lower implementation complexity. We derive a tight lower bound on the secrecy outage probability for Criterion I and an accurate analytical expression for the secrecy outage probability for Criterion II.

For this setting,a novel relay selection algorithm is proposed, named HyQoS, relying only on statistical CSIT and performing power adaptation. HyQoS solvesan optimization problem for selecting the optimal set of relays.

The aim of this formulation is to design a control policy that maximizes the transmitter throughput, while satisfying its power constraints as well.

            "Abstract": "The convergence of radar sensing and communication applications in the terahertz (THz) band has been envisioned as a promising technology, since it incorporates terabit-per-second (Tbps) data transmission and mm-level radar sensing in a spectrum- and cost-efficient manner, by sharing both the frequency and hardware resources. However, the joint THz radar and communication (JRC) system faces considerable challenges, due to the peculiarities of the THz channel and front ends. To this end, the waveform design for THz-JRC systems with ultra-broad bandwidth is investigated in this paper. Firstly, by considering THz-JRC systems based on the co-existence concept, where both functions operate in a time-domain duplex (TDD) manner, a novel multi-subband quasi-perfect (MS-QP) sequence, composed of multiple Zadoff-Chu (ZC) perfect subsequences on different subbands, is proposed for target sensing, which achieves accurate target ranging and velocity estimation, whilst only requiring cost-efficient low-rate analog-to-digital converters (A/Ds) for sequence detection. Furthermore, the root index of each ZC subsequence of the MS-QP sequence is designed to eliminate the influence of doppler shift on the THz radar sensing. Finally, a data-embedded MS-QP (DE-MS-QP) waveform is constructed through time-domain extension of the MS-QP sequence, generating null frequency points on each subband for data transmission. Unlike the THz-JRC system in TDD manner, the proposed DE-MS-QP waveform enables simultaneous interference-free sensing and communication, whilst inheriting all the merits from MS-QP sequences.

The performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication, however, severely suffers from turbulence-induced fading caused by atmospheric conditions. Multiple laser transmitters and/or receivers can be placed at both ends to mitigate the turbulence fading and exploit the advantages of spatial diversity. Spatial diversity is particularly crucial for strong turbulence channels in which single-input single-output (SISO) link performs extremely poor. Atmospheric-induced strong turbulence fading in outdoor FSO systems can be modeled as a multiplicative random process which follows the K distribution.

In contrast to the majority of works on CSI-assisted AF relays, in this paper, we assume that the estimated CSI is outdated, when the relay amplifies the transmitted signal. The RF link experiences Rayleigh fading, while the FSO link is under the influence of atmospheric turbulence, modeled by the Gamma-Gamma distribution.

Then, the use of power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for enhancing mmWave multicasting is also investigated. Furthermore, we study multicasting in two-tier mmWave heterogeneous networks, and propose a novel cooperative NOMA multicast scheme. Analytical expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio coverage probability, the average number of served users, and the sum multicast rate are derived, in order to assess the performance of these schemes.

The corresponding effects on the channel capacity with and without power adaptation are then analyzed. Closed-form expressions are derived and validated through comparisons with respective results from computer simulations. It is shown that the effects of fading nonlinearities are significantly larger than those of fading parameters such as the scattered-wave power ratio, and the correlation coefficient between the in-phase and quadrature components in each cluster of multipath components.",

In this paper, we propose a novel communication paradigm to satisfy the performance demands of future wireless networks: a hybrid Cellular/WLAN network architecture with wireless offloading. In contrast to the commonly adopted practice of WiFi offloading, where the WLAN APs have a wired backhaul (eg, Digital Subscriber Line), we propose a wireless offloading approach, where the WLAN APs will share their wireless cellular broadband connection with other users. These users will select their serving node, ie, the macro-cell eNodeB or a WLAN AP, based on a certain selection criterion. Thus a challenging research field is originated, where interfering effects and wireless resources limitations play a dominant role. Important performance metrics of the proposed hybrid scheme, including the bit error probability, the ergodic capacity and the average signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR), are theoretically studied and closed form expressions are derived for the single-user case with multiple interferers, for both identical and non-identical fading conditions. Also, based on the general multi-cellular hybrid WLAN/Cellular concept, we first propose a intercell interference minimization approach. Then we present a novel scheme for achieving frequency reuse equal to one within a single macro-cell, under specific performance criteria and constraints, that guarantee the overall cell\u2019s or the individual user\u2019s \u2026",

Specifically, it is assumed that the propagating signal suffers from the combined effects of atmospheric turbulence-induced fading, misalignment fading (i.e., pointing errors) and path-loss. Novel closed-form expressions for the statistics of the random attenuation of the propagation channel are derived and the bit-error rate (BER) performance is investigated for all the above fading effects. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the error performance of OW systems with the presence of atmospheric turbulence and/or misalignment. Moreover, nonlinear optimization is also considered to find the optimum beamwidth that achieves the minimum BER for a given signal-to-noise ratio value.",

The present work is devoted to the error rate analysis and energy-efficiency optimization of regenerative cooperative networks in the presence of multipath fading under spatial correlation. To this end, exact and asymptotic analytic expressions are firstly derived for the symbol-error-rate of ary quadrature amplitude and ary phase shift keying modulations assuming a dual-hop decode-and-forward relay system, spatially correlated Nakagami multipath fading and maximum ratio combining. The derived expressions are subsequently employed in quantifying the energy consumption of the considered system, incorporating both transmit energy and the energy consumed by the transceiver circuits, as well as in deriving the optimal power allocation formulation for minimizing energy consumption under certain quality-of-service requirements. A relatively harsh path-loss model, that also accounts for realistic device-to-device communications, is adopted in numerical evaluations and various useful insights are provided for the design of future low-energy wireless networks deployments. Indicatively, it is shown that depending on the degree of spatial correlation, severity of fading, transmission distance, relay location and power allocation strategy, target performance can be achieved with large overall energy reduction compared to direct transmission reference.",

What happens to the output power, however, if the CSI at the input is outdated? As an attempt to answer this question, we introduce a study of AF relaying under a novel perspective. This involves the use of the well-known peak-to-average-powerratio (PAPR) for capturing the negative effects of imperfect channel inversion at the relay. The imperfect channel inversion, caused by imperfect CSI at the relay, results in using the power amplifier in its non-linear region, which induces signal distortion.

Collisions are reduced and starvation of low-priority classes is prevented by a distributed admission control algorithm. The model performance is found analytically extending previous work on this matter. The results show that a better organization of resources is achieved through this scheme.

Then, a stochastic optimization problem is formulated, where intelligent decisions regarding the number of the packets admitted in the queue and the power levels used in every link, are taken by the hybrid transmitter in each slot. The objective of this formulation is to design a control policy that maximizes the transmitter throughput, while satisfying the power constraints as well.

Departing from cryptographic techniques, secrecy can be provided by exploiting the wireless channel characteristics; that is, some error-correcting codes besides reliability have been shown to achieve information-theoretic security. In this paper, we propose a polar-coding-based technique for the primitive relay wiretap channel and show that this technique is suitable to provide information-theoretic security. Specifically, we integrate at the relay an additional functionality, which allows it to smartly decide whether it will cooperate or not based on the decoding detector result. In the case of cooperation, the relay operates in a decode-and-forward mode and assists the communication by transmitting a complementary message to the destination in order to correctly decode the initial source\u2019s message. Otherwise, the communication is completed with direct transmission from source to the destination. Finally, we first prove that the proposed encoding scheme achieves weak secrecy, then, in order to overcome the obstacle of misaligned bits, we implement a double-chaining construction, which achieves strong secrecy.

In this paper, we study the rate at which a relay switching occurs in selective cooperative relaying applications in time-varying fading channels. In particular, we derive closed-form expressions for the relay switching rate (measured in Hz) for opportunistic relaying (OR) and distributed switch and stay combining (DSSC). Additionally, expressions for the average relay activation time for both of the considered schemes are also provided, reflecting the average time that a selected relay remains active until a switching occurs. Numerical results manifest that DSSC yields considerably lower relay \u2026",

When combined with relaying, FD systems are expected to dramatically increase the throughput of future wireless networks. However, the degrading effect of self-interference (SI) due to the simultaneous transmission and reception at the relay threatens their efficient rollout in real-world topologies. At the same time, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can further increase the spectral efficiency of the network. In this article, we present how buffering at the relays can be integrated with FD and NOMA in order to improve the performance of relay networks.

Thus, the need for synchronization of the relays\u2019 transmissions is avoided, while the slowly varying nature of the atmospheric channel is exploited. For the considered relay selection and all-active relaying schemes, novel closed-form expressions for the outage performance are derived, assuming the versatile Gamma\u2013Gamma channel model.

The problem is NP-hard and often arises in diverse applications such as signal processing, bioinformatics, communications and machine learning, to name a few. Since the existing optimal search strategies involve prohibitive complexities, they are hard to be adopted in large-scale problems. To address this issue, we propose a general hyper-accelerated tree search (HATS) algorithm by employing a deep neural network to estimate the optimal heuristic for the underlying simplified memory-bounded A* algorithm, and the proposed algorithm can be easily generalized with other heuristic search algorithms. Inspired by the temporal difference learning, we further propose a training strategy which enables the network to approach the optimal heuristic precisely and consistently, thus the proposed algorithm can reach nearly the optimal efficiency when the estimation error is small enough. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can reach almost the optimal maximum likelihood estimate performance in large-scale problems, with a very low complexity in both time and space.

In this context, an attractive solution to the current spectrum crunch issue is to exploit the visible light spectrum for the realization of high-speed commutation systems. However, this requires solutions to certain challenges relating to visible light communications (VLC), such as the stringent requirements of VLC-based intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD), which require signals to be real and unipolar. The present work proposes a novel power-domain multiplexing based optical asymmetric modulation (OAM) scheme for indoor VLC systems, which is particularly adapted to transmit high-order modulation signals using linear real and unipolar constellations that fit into the restrictions of IM/DD systems. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides improved system performance that outperforms alternative modulation schemes, at no extra complexity.",

Employing the time splitting protocol, the energy constrained source S first harvests energy through the radio-frequency signals sent by the PB and then uses this energy to transmit information to the destination D. Unlike several prior works, we assume that the energy transfer link is subjected to Rician fading, which is a real fading environment, due to relatively short range power transfer distance and the existence of a strong line of sight path. We present a comprehensive analysis of the achievable ergodic capacity in two scenarios, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at PB, namely, the absence of CSI and partial CSI.

In the push-then-deliver strategy, the NOMA principle is applied to push more content files to the content servers during a short time interval reserved for content pushing during on-peak hours and to provide more connectivity for content delivery, compared with the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) strategy. The push-and-deliver strategy is \u2026",

To this end, an analytical expression for the corre- sponding average detection probability is firstly derived and then this is extended to account for collaborative spectrum sensing. The complementary receiver operating characteristics (ROC) are analyzed for different conditions of the average signal-to- noise ratio (SNR), time-bandwidth product, multipath fading, shadowing and number of collaborating users. It is shown that the energy detection performance is strongly linked to the severity of the multipath fading and amount of shadowing, whereby even small variations in either of these physical phenomena significantly impact the detection probability. Also, the versatile modeling capability of the Fisher-Snedecor F distribution is verified in the context of energy detection based spectrum \u2026",

The branches that participate in the combining process are selected taking into account the quality of both the total combining output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the individual SNR of each branch. The proposed scheme achieves better adaptation to channel conditions compared to other competing schemes such as normalized threshold GSC (NT-GSC), minimum selection GSC (MS-GSC) or minimum estimation and combining GSC (MEC-GSC), with no further complexity. The A-GSC receiver compromises between the power consumption, hardware complexity and performance gain that each additional diversity branch induces, resulting in significant savings in power and computational resources.",

For example, high data rate, high capacity and minimum interference links for short-range communication for inter-building communication, computer-to-computer communication, or sensor networks. At the opposite extreme is a long-range link in the order of millions of kilometers in the new mission to Mars and other solar system planets. It is important to mention that optical wireless communication is one of the oldest methods that humanity has used for communication. In prehistoric times humans used fire and smoke to communicate; later in history, Roman optical heliographs and Sumerians signalling towers were the communication systems of these empires. An analogous technology was used by Napoleonic Signalling Towers and\" recently\" by the light photo-phone of Alexander Graham Bell back in the 1880s. Obviously, the data rate and quality of service delivered and transceiver technologies employed have improved greatly from those early optical wireless technologies. In its many applications, optical wireless communication links have already succeeded in becoming part of our everyday lives at our homes and offices. Optical wireless products are already well familiar, ranging from visible-light communication (VLC), TV remote control to IrDA ports that currently have a worldwide installed base of hundred of million of units with tens of percent annual growth.

This paper presents a class of novel algorithms for blind classification of SM and Alamouti STBC (AL-STBC) transmissions. Unlike the prior art, we show that signal classification can be performed using a single receive antenna by taking advantage of the space-time redundancy. The first proposed algorithm relies on the fourth-order moment as a discriminating feature and employs the likelihood ratio test for achieving maximum average probability of correct classification.

            "Abstract": "Multihop relaying technology is a promising solution for future cellular and ad hoc wireless communications systems in order to achieve broader coverage and to mitigate wireless channels impairment without the need to use high power at the transmitter. Recently, a new concept that is being actively studied in multihop-augmented networks is multiuser cooperative diversity, where several terminals form a kind of coalition to assist each other with the transmission of their messages. In general, cooperative relaying systems have a source node multicasting a message to a number of cooperative relays, which in turn resend a processed version to the intended destination node. The destination node combines the signal received from the relays, possibly also taking into account the source\u2019s original signal. Cooperative diversity exploits two fundamentals features of wireless medium: its broadcast nature and its ability to \u2026",

Unlike the majority of investigations that assume basic symmetric fading conditions, this analysis considers asymmetric generalized fading conditions, which are more realistic as they are encountered more often in practical wireless transmissions. To this end, it is assumed that the source-relay and source-destination links are subject to k -\u03bc multipath fading conditions, which can represent generalized line-of-sight communication scenarios; on the contrary, the relay-to-destination link is subject to \u03b7-\u03bc fading conditions that typically represent generalized non-line-of-sight communication scenarios. Novel analytic expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP) of the considered FD relaying system.

By treating the users and the MEC server as  leader  and  follower , respectively, a Stackelberg game is formulated. More specifically, the leader tends to minimize the total energy consumption for task offloading and local computing by optimizing the task assignment coefficients and transmit power. On the other side, the follower aims to minimize the total execution time by allocating different computational resources for processing the offloaded tasks. In order to solve the formulated problem, the Stackelberg equilibrium is considered. Based on the given insights, a closed-form solution of the follower level problem is obtained and included in the leader level one.

Hence, it is of vital importance to design an effective secure probabilistic caching strategy to ensure the security of content transmission. To this end, we first consider several cache-aided transmission modes of self-fetch, D2D-transmission, relay-transmission, and source-transmission. We then study the network secrecy performance by analyzing the expression of secure cache throughput and an analytical lower bound.

For both these variations, closed-form expressions for the outage probability are obtained, along with approximate expressions for the symbol error rate in the medium to high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. The diversity gain and coding gain of the above schemes are also explicitly derived. Numerical results manifest that the outage performance of AF relay selection is highly dependent on the level of correlation between the actual channel conditions and their corresponding (outdated) estimates.

Based on this framework, the end-to-end outage probability (OP) of CRNs is investigated for two different relaying schemes: i) in the absence of the direct link with decode-and-forward (DF) protocol and ii) in the presence of the direct link with incremental DF protocol. In particular, we derive both exact and asymptotic OP expressions for the considered CRNs. Our analysis reveals important insights into the impact of fading \u2026",

To overcome these limitations, a secure switch-and-stay combining (SSSC) protocol is proposed where only one out of the two relays is activated to assist the secure data transmission, and the secure relay switching occurs when the relay cannot support the secure communication any longer.

In this paper, we investigate mixed RF-VLC relaying systems especially suited for this type of applications that support mobility. In this system setup, the end-user, who is assumed to be on a vehicle that is in dynamic movement, is served by an indoor VLC system, while the outdoor data traffic is conveyed through multiple backhaul RF links. Furthermore, it is assumed that a single backhaul RF link is activated by the mobile relay and due to feedback delay, the RF link activation is based on outdated channel state information (CSI). The performance of this system is analyzed in terms of outage probability and bit error rate (BER), and novel closed form analytical expressions are provided.

CQEI is simple to evaluate, since it depends on the channel statistics, which vary much more slowly than the channel state itself, and thus can be obtained at the initialization state using a long training sequence and continuously improved during the whole communication period. As an application, we use CQEI to find the optimum number of branches in equal gain combining (EGC) receivers, operating over non-identical fading channels. Numerical and simulations results show that CQEI represents an efficient and easy to evaluate criterion to assess the performance of wireless systems.",

To this direction, the maintenance cost of IoT deployments has been identified as one of the main challenges, which is directly related to energy efficiency and autonomy of IoT solutions. In order to increase the energy sustainability of next-generation IoT, wireless power transfer (WPT) emerged as a promising technology; however, its effectiveness is hindered as the distance between the base station and the wireless powered IoT devices increases. To counter this effect, decentralized approaches based on the use of distributed densely deployed remote radio heads (RRHs) can be utilized to diminish the distance between the transmitting and the receiving nodes. A trade-off ensues from the use of RRHs as power beacons (PBs) or access points (APs) that enable either energy transfer during downlink or information reception during uplink, respectively. To balance this trade-off, in this work, the maximization of the ergodic rate in ultra-dense wireless powered networks is investigated. In more detail, three different protocols are introduced, optimized, and compared to each other: density splitting, time splitting, and hybrid time and density splitting, which are based on the optimization of the portion of the number of RRHs that are employed as PBs or APs at a specific time instance. Additionally, two different policies are taken into account regarding the PBs\u2019 power constraint. The formulated problems that \u2026",

Closed-form expressions for the average end-to-end rate and the outage probability, under the effect of residual self-interference and inter-user interference, are presented. The results show that the proposed two-timeslot two-way FD relaying scheme can achieve higher rate and better outage performance than the half-duplex one, when residual self-interference is below a certain level. Therefore, this relaying scheme presents a reasonable \u2026",

Compared to existing methods, the proposed one in this network permits a parallel computing architecture and is verified to be computationally very efficient.

To this end, we study the power allocation (PA) problem in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access system, when the served user equipment (UE) suffers from different levels of IQI. Additionally, we present a novel low-complexity solution with directly calculated PA policies, given the Lagrange multiplier, which mitigates the impact of IQI and achieves fairness in terms of capacity for the served UE, by maximizing the minimum achievable capacity of the UE.

            "Abstract": "Radio-frequency interference is one of the most important technical challenges which needs to be considered in the design, operation and maintenance of current and future mobile cellular networks. It is well recognized that the most important of all the interferences that needs to be considered by the system designers in cellular planning is co-channel interference (CCI). In this case, an important parameter as far as the system\u2019s QoS performance is concerned is the outage probability. The term \u2018outage\u2019is related to the criterion used for assessment of a satisfactory reception. Generally, there are two criteria that are taken into account by the designers of cellular systems. According to the first criterion,\u2018outage probability\u2019is defined as the probability that the undesired signal\u2019s power exceeds the corresponding desired received power by a protection factor-ratio, denoted as \u03b2. This is the so-called interference-limited criterion, which only concerns the co-channel interference, and not interference due to other sources (ie thermal noise). In the second criterion, a requirement of a minimum signal power, denoted as, is needed for satisfactory reception in addition to the demands of the first criterion. This criterion takes into account the existing thermal noise as an added source for unsatisfactory reception and the receiver\u2019s sensitivity threshold [74, 75]. Evaluation of the outage probability in mobile networks depends upon the various statistical models such as Lognormal, Rayleigh, Rice and Nakagami, which have been used to describe the mobile radio channel. cSlow or log-normal fading is a slow variation of the median signal from sector to sector, and it is a \u2026",

The very high data rates, low implementation cost and free from radio frequency (RF) interference property make them particularly attractive for the next generation of indoor networking. Furthermore, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a very promising candidate technique for the next generation of wireless networks, mainly due to its increased spectrum efficiency, compared to orthogonal access techniques. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time in existing literature, the practical indoor scenario of a hybrid VLC/RF network, where both VLC and RF subsystems perform NOMA. More specifically, we study the user grouping through the coalitional game theory, where each coalition is assigned to a specific access point, VLC or RF. Note that due to NOMA's particularities, optimal \u2026",

To tackle this issue, we propose the joint use of a maximum likelihood detector (MLD) and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), where MLD is used to produce an initial detection result and DCNN improves the detection by exploiting the local correlation to suppress the interference. Furthermore, the improved DCNN is enhanced by devising the loss function through the cross-entropy of the detection, which can help to suppress the interfering signals and simultaneously force the residual interference to approach the Gaussian \u2026",

Consequently, this paper considers the performance evaluation of precoded OFDM (P-OFDM) in the presence of CFO. The performance of the considered P-OFDM is evaluated in terms of the signal-to-interference plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and BER. Various channel models are considered and closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the exact SINR. The obtained analytical results, corroborated by simulation, show that P-OFDM is substantially more sensitive to CFO compared with conventional OFDM.

The analysis is not only limited to identically distributed interferers, but rather includes the case of interferers with distinct average powers. Following the coherent interference power calculation and by using a useful lower-bound for the distribution of the sum of Nakagami-m fading envelopes, novel closed-form upper-bounds for the outage and average symbol error probability for several modulation schemes are presented. Moreover, lower-bounds for the Shannon average spectral efficiency are derived in closedform. Numerical results demonstrate the effect of the number of the interferers, the number of the receiver branches, and the severity of the fading on the EGC performance. Computer simulations are also performed to verify the tightness and the correctness of the proposed mathematical analysis.",

It is shown that the incurred performance variations range from one to few orders of magnitude compared to the standard case of symmetric Rayleigh scenarios, which verifies the importance to account for fading conditions realistically.

Specifically, the system consists of m single-antenna sources, a relay node equipped with n\u2265 m receive antennas and a single photo-aperture transmitter, and one destination equipped with a single photo-detector. RF links are used for the simultaneous data transmission from multiple sources to the relay. The relay operates under the decode-and-forward protocol and utilizes the popular V-BLAST technique by successively decoding each user's transmitted stream. Two common norm-based orderings are adopted, i.e., the streams are decoded in an ascending or a descending order. After V-BLAST, the relay retransmits the decoded information to the destination via a point-to-point FSO link in m consecutive timeslots.

In this paper, we present an efficient closed-form approximation for the distribution of the sum of arbitrary correlated Nakagami-m envelopes with identical and integer fading parameters. The distribution becomes exact for maximal correlation, while the tightness of the proposed approximation is validated statistically by using the Chi-square and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests.

This technique not only mitigates the detrimental effects of IQI, but, through appropriate signal processing, also coordinates the self-interference terms produced by IQI in order to achieve second-order frequency diversity. However, these benefits come at the expense of a reduction in transmission rate. More specifically, IQSC is a simple transmit diversity scheme that improves the signal quality at the receiver by elementary signal processing operations across symmetric (mirror) pairs of subcarriers.

This type of communications is frequently characterized by line-of-sight (LoS) and dynamic propagation conditions.

In this paper, a new channel model is proposed, in which the effects of mobility and shadowing are simultaneously considered. In particular, the performance of a UAV-based communication system operating in a shadowed double-scattering channel is analyzed. The new channel model is generic, since it models various fading/shadowing conditions, while it is in terms of easy-to-evaluate mathematical functions.

Although the construction of parametric families originates from the work of Beaulieu and Damen, the authors' approach is based on the concept of 'inner' and 'outer' functions and for this reason a higher flexibility in the choice of the family members is achieved. The proposed pulses may decay slower than the original raised-cosine (RC) pulse outside the pulse interval, but exhibit a more pronounced decrease in the amplitudes of the two largest sidelobes and this accounts for their improved robustness to error probabilities.

To this end, in this second part we introduce and optimize a novel communication protocol for WFL networks, that is based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). More specifically, the Compute-then-Transmit NOMA (CT-NOMA) protocol is introduced, where users terminate concurrently the local model training and then simultaneously transmit the trained parameters to the central server. Moreover, two different detection schemes for the mitigation of inter-user interference in NOMA are considered and evaluated, which correspond to fixed and variable decoding order during the successive interference cancellation process. Furthermore, the computation and communication resources are jointly optimized for both considered schemes, with the aim to minimize the total delay during a WFL communication round. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of CT-NOMA in terms of delay reduction, compared to the considered benchmark that is based on time-division multiple access.",

Its effects become even more pronounced at higher carrier frequencies such as the millimeter-wave frequency bands being considered for 5G systems. In this paper, we quantify the effects of IQI on the performance of different modulation schemes under multipath fading channels. This is realized by developing a general framework for the symbol error rate (SER) analysis of coherent phase shift keying, noncoherent differential phase shift keying and noncoherent frequency shift keying under IQI effects. In this context, the moment generating function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is first derived for both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems suffering from transmitter (TX) IQI only, receiver (RX) IQI only and joint TX/RX IQI. Capitalizing on this, we derive analytic expressions for the SER of the different modulation schemes. These expressions are corroborated by comparisons with corresponding results from computer simulations and they provide insights into the dependence of IQI on the system parameters. We demonstrate that the effects of IQI differ considerably depending on the considered system as some cases of single-carrier transmission appear robust to IQI, whereas multi-carrier systems experiencing IQI at the RX require compensation in order to achieve a reliable communication link.",

Two unique characteristics make UAV-based FSO systems significantly different from conventional FSO systems with static transceivers. First, for UAV-based FSO systems, the incident laser beam is not always orthogonal to the receiver lens plane. Second, both position and orientation of the UAV fluctuate over time due to dynamic wind load, inherent random air fluctuations in the atmosphere around the UAV, and internal vibrations of the UAV. On the contrary, for conventional FSO systems, the laser beam is always perpendicular to the receiver lens plane and the relative movement of the transceivers is limited. In this paper, we develop a novel channel model for UAV-based FSO systems by quantifying the corresponding geometric and misalignment \u2026",

Nevertheless, the installation of BTSs with renewable energy, induces specific disadvantages such as the relatively higher costs and the high dependency on weather conditions. To this end, the deployment of hybrid BTSs and the optimal compromise between conventional and alternative energy sources is a very challenging problem with immense importance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid solar-wind-diesel/electricity grid system, which can efficiently feed the load of a BTS. In contrast to previous works, the seasonal effect on the BTS\u2019s electricity consumption is taken into account via considering (i) the radio transmitter and receiver operation strategy, based on the cells\u2019s traffic load, and (ii) the passive cooling. The main objective of the present work is the techno-economical optimization of the proposed hybrid system, via the development of a time-step simulation model, which takes into account the loss of load probability (LOLP) and levelized annual cost (LAC). Finally, considering the case-study of a BTS installed in the Greek island of Kea, it is shown that a combination of photo-voltaic, wind, diesel generators, batteries and electricity grid, for a grid-connected BTS, is the most cost-effective solution.",

IoT massive deployments will create the problem of optimal power allocation. The objective of the optimization problem is to obtain a feasible solution that minimizes the total power consumption of the WSN, when the error probability at the fusion center meets certain criteria. This work studies the optimization of a wireless sensor network (WNS) at higher dimensions by focusing to the power allocation of decentralized detection. More specifically, we apply and compare four algorithms designed to tackle Large scale global optimization (LGSO) problems. These are the memetic linear population size reduction and semi-parameter adaptation (MLSHADE-SPA), the contribution-based cooperative coevolution recursive differential grouping (CBCC-RDG3), the differential grouping with spectral clustering-differential evolution cooperative coevolution (DGSC-DECC), and the enhanced adaptive differential evolution (EADE). To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first time that LGSO algorithms are applied to the optimal power allocation problem in IoT networks. We evaluate the algorithms performance in several different cases by applying them in cases with 300, 600 and 800 dimensions.",

Thus, examining the effects of residual loop interference under peak interference power constraint at the primary users and maximum transmit power constraints at the SS and the SRs is a particularly challenging problem in frequency selective fading channels.

Although the construction of parametric families originates from the work of Beaulieu and Damen, the authors' approach is based on the concept of 'inner' and 'outer' functions and for this reason a higher flexibility in the choice of the family members is achieved. The proposed pulses may decay slower than the original raised-cosine (RC) pulse outside the pulse interval, but exhibit a more pronounced decrease in the amplitudes of the two largest sidelobes and this accounts for their improved robustness to error probabilities.

The main objective of this paper is to maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary system, while adhering to all individual primary users\u2019 secrecy rate constraints. In the case of active eavesdroppers and perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transceivers, the utility function of interest is nonconcave and the involved constraints are nonconvex, and thus, the optimal solutions are troublesome. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm to arrive at least to a local optimum of the original nonconvex problem. This algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker solution. Then, we extend the optimization approach to the case of passive eavesdroppers and imperfect CSI knowledge at the transceivers, where the constraints are transformed into a linear matrix inequality and convex constraints, in order to facilitate the optimal solution.",

A recent application of meta-surfaces is reconfigurable intelligent surfaces which are practically limited by the requirement for perfect knowledge of the user\u2019s position. For the case where the user\u2019s position cannot be obtained, we introduce randomly reconfigurable surfaces (RRSs) aiming to diffuse the incoming wave. A RRS is defined as a reconfigurable meta-surface that each of its elements induces a randomly selected time-variant phase shift on the reflected signal. To facilitate the performance analysis of a RRS-assisted system, first, we present novel closed-form expressions for the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, the moments, and the characteristic function of the distribution of the sum of double-Nakagami-m random vectors, whose amplitudes follow the double-Nakagami-m distribution, ie, the distribution of the product of two random variables following the Nakagami-m distribution, and phases follow the circular uniform distribution. We also consider a special case of this distribution, namely the distribution of the sum of Rayleigh-Nakagami-m random vectors. Then, we exploit these expressions to investigate the performance of the RRS-assisted composite channel, assuming that the two links undergo Nakagami-m fading and the equivalent phase follows the circular uniform distribution.

However, converting the traditional power grids to smart grids poses severe security challenges and makes their components and services prone to cyber attacks. To this end, advanced techniques are required to mitigate the impact of the potential attacks. In this paper, we investigate the use of honeypots, which are considered to mimic the common services of the smart grid and are able to detect unauthorized accesses, collect evidence, and help hide the real devices. More specifically, the interaction of an attacker and a defender is considered, who both optimize the number of attacks and the defending system configuration, ie, the number of real devices and honeypots, respectively, with the aim to maximize their individual payoffs. To solve this problem, game theoretic tools are used, considering an one-shot game and a repeated game with uncertainty about the payoff of the attacker, where the Nash Equilibrium (NE) and the Bayesian NE are derived, respectively.

During their access to the frequency spectrum licensed to the primary users, the secondary unlicensed users assist the primary system in fortifying security by sending a jamming noise to the eavesdroppers, while simultaneously protect themselves from eavesdropping. The main objective of this work is to maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary system, while adhering to all individual primary users' secrecy rate constraints. In the case of passive eavesdroppers and imperfect channel state information knowledge at the transceivers, the utility function of interest is nonconcave and involved constraints are nonconvex, and thus, the optimal solutions are troublesome. To address this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm to arrive at a local optimum of the considered problem. The proposed iterative algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution.",

Two dual-relay selection strategies are proposed for cooperative NOMA, namely, two-stage dual relay selection with fixed power allocation (DRS-FPA) and two-stage dual relay selection with dynamic power allocation (DRS-DPA). Furthermore, lower and upper bounds on the outage probability for the DRS-FPA scheme and the exact outage probability for the DRS-DPA scheme are obtained in closed-form, respectively.

Exact analytical expressions are obtained for the SER performance of thetas-QAM in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Nakagami-m fading channels, while highly accurate approximations for the BER are presented. The theoretical study aims at providing insight into the tradeoff between error performance and complexity of this parametric modulation scheme.

Considering a time-switching protocol, the power beacon first charges the source through wireless power transfer, and then acts as a friendly jammer to assist the source for secure communication. Depending on the available channel state information (CSI) at the power beacon, we propose several different jamming schemes for secrecy performance enhancement.

            "Abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) intend to improve significantly the performance of future wireless networks, by controlling the wireless propagation medium through elements that can shift the phase of the reflected signals. Although ideally the signals reflected from a RIS are added coherently at the receiver, this is very challenging in practice due to the requirement for perfect channel state information (CSI) at the RIS and phase control. To facilitate the performance analysis of more practical RIS-assisted systems, first, we present novel closed-form expressions for the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, the moments, and the characteristic function of the distribution of the sum of double-Nakagami-m random vectors, whose amplitudes follow the double-Nakagami-m distribution, i.e., the distribution of the product of two random variables following the Nakagami-m distribution, and phases are circular uniformly distributed. We also consider a special case of this distribution, namely the distribution of the sum of Rayleigh-Nakagami-m random vectors. Then, we exploit these expressions to investigate the performance of the RIS-assisted composite channel, assuming that the two links undergo Nakagami-m fading and the equivalent phase follows the uniform distribution, which corresponds to the case where CSI is not available at the RIS and leads to a lower bound of the performance of a system with CSI. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the average received signal-to-noise ratio, the ergodic capacity, the bit error probability, the amount of fading, and the channel quality estimation index are \u2026",

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of fading and diversity. Generalized Gamma can describe a great variety of small-scale fading and shadowing conditions by adopting different values for the two parameters \u03b2 and m.

Since the MEC network involves both communication and computation, we first define the outage probability by taking into account the joint impact of latency and energy consumption. From this new definition, we then employ receiver antenna selection (RAS) or maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver, and apply selection combining (SC) or switch-and-stay combining (SSC) protocol to choose a CAP to accomplish the computational task from the source. For both protocols along with the RAS and MRC, we further analyze the network performance by deriving new and easy-to-use analytical expressions for the outage probability \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Achieving the fifth-generation (5G) vision will introduce new technology innovations and substantial changes in delivering cutting-edge applications and services in current mobile and cellular networks. The Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) concept emerged as one of the most compelling architectures to meet the requirements of the 5G vision. In essence, C-RAN provides an advanced mobile network architecture which can leverage challenging features such as network resource slicing, statistical multiplexing, energy efficiency, and high capacity. The realization of C-RAN is achieved by innovative technologies such as the software-defined networking (SDN) and the network function virtualization (NFV). While SDN technology brings the separation of the control and data planes in the playground, supporting thus advanced traffic engineering techniques such as load balancing, the NFV concept offers high flexibility by allowing network resource sharing in a dynamic way. Although SDN and NFV have many advantages, a number of challenges have to be addressed before the commercial deployment of 5G implementation. In addition, C-RAN introduces a new layer in the mobile network, denoted as the fronthaul, which is adopted from the recent research efforts in the fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) paradigm. As the fronthaul defines a link between a baseband unit (BBU) and a remote radio unit (RRU), various technologies can be used for this purpose such as optical fibers and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) radios. In this way, several challenges are highlighted which depend on the technology used. In the light of the aforementioned remarks, this paper \u2026",

We adopt \\emph{partial offloading}, in which each user's task can be partitioned, while the formulated problem is quasi-convex.

Towards providing a solution to this problem, we introduce a variable-rate (VR) M-PSK modulation scheme, for communications over fading channels, in the absence of channel gain estimation at the receiver. The choice of the constellation size is based on the signal-plus-noise (S+N) sampling value rather than on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). It is analytically shown that S+N can serve as an attractive simpler criterion, alternative to S/N, for determining the modulation order in VR systems. In this way, low complexity transceivers can use VR transmissions in order to increase their spectral efficiency under an error performance constraint.

Towards this direction, in this paper we present a novel pathloss and scattering models for in-to-out-of OWC links. Specifically, we derive extract analytical expressions that accurately describe the absorption of the five main tissues' constituents, namely fat, water, melanin, oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood.

Next, by incorporating the impact of scattering in the aforementioned model we formulate the complete pathloss model. The developed theoretical framework is verified by means of comparisons between the estimated pathloss and experimental measurements from independent research works. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy of the theoretical framework in estimating the optical properties of any generic tissue based on its constitution.

In this paper, assuming slow Rayleigh fading, we derive exact expressions for the AOR and the AOD of three well-known cooperative diversity protocols: variable-gain amplify-and-forward, decode-and-forward, and selection decode-and-forward relaying \u2026",

The eavesdropping channels are correlated with the main channels, which affects the network security. To enhance the network security, one best relay is chosen to assist the secure transmission, which is however maybe outdated in time-varying channel environments. The impact of both channel correlation and outdated relay selection on the secrecy performance is studied by deriving the analytical expression of the secrecy outage probability (SOP). The asymptotic SOP is also provided with high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER). From the asymptotic SOP, we find that only the outdated degree of relay selection affects the network secrecy diversity order, but the channel correlation does not. Moreover, it is interesting to find that the channel correlation is beneficial to the transmission security in the high MER regime.",

In particular, we consider variable gain (a.k.a, CSI-assisted) AF relaying and derive expressions for the outage and the error probability for the case where the relay gain is adjusted based on outdated estimates of the source-relay channel, when operating over Nakagami-m fading. For the case of Rayleigh fading in the source-relay link, we show that the results can be extended to the versatile case of imperfect CSI, where the estimation error is caused either by additive white Gaussian noise or by quantization noise. The obtained expressions are functions of the correlation coefficient between the actual source-relay channel and its corresponding estimate. We also optimize the power allocation for minimization of the outage probability \u2026",

Constraints on cost and power consumption make it infeasible to equip each sensor node in the network with a global position system (GPS) unit, especially for large-scale WSNs. A promising method to localize unknown nodes is to use mobile anchor nodes (MANs), which are equipped with GPS units moving among unknown nodes and periodically broadcasting their current locations to help nearby unknown nodes with localization. A considerable body of research has addressed the mobile anchor node assisted localization (MANAL) problem.

Being a non-convex and intractable optimization problem, we resort to approximate it with a minorization-maximization algorithm (MMA), which is a widely used tool in statistics. In each step of the MMA, we solve a second-order cone program, such that the feasibility set in each step contains that of the previous one, and is always guaranteed to be a subset of the feasibility set of the original problem. It should be noted that the algorithm takes a few iterations to converge. Furthermore, we study the conditions under which the achievable rates maximization can be further simplified to a \u2026",

Focusing on the secondary communication process, a relay selection procedure is performed prior to the communication process, where the selected relay is the one maximising the instantaneous end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and, at the same time, satisfying the power restrictions imposed by the primary receivers. The secondary destination employs a selection combining strategy, selecting the best path (direct link or relaying link) with the highest instantaneous SNR. Two kinds of relaying protocols are considered: decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward. For the former, an exact closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) is derived, whereas for the latter an accurate approximation for the OP is obtained. Then, an asymptotic analysis is carried out and \u2026",

Thus, various delay-aware protocols have been developed, but without considering the transmission diversity. Moreover, most works adopt ideal assumptions, such as symmetric links, perfect channel state information (CSI), and error-free feedback channels. So, we propose a low-complexity (LoCo) link selection algorithm, herein called LoCo-Link. The proposed algorithm may experience delays during CSI updates, and hence, by using outdated CSI its performance may deteriorate. To alleviate this issue, we next propose a distributed version of LoCo-Link (d-LoCo-Link) dealing with outdated CSI. In both algorithms, the source performs broadcasting toward multiple relays; when the packets are transmitted by a relay to the destination, they are discarded from all other relays.

The evolving fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication systems is expected to cope with a thousand-fold increase in total mobile broadband data and a hundred-fold increase in connected devices. It will also be required to overcome various challenges affecting current cellular networks, and provide higher data rates, improved end-to-end performance and coverage, low latency, and low energy consumption at low cost per transmission [1]. These challenges are expected to be addressed in 5G wireless networks by adopting a multi-tier heterogeneous architecture, since the capacity of the current macrocellular network cannot be increased infinitely. Future mobile networks will comprise macrocells and small cells, relays, and device-to-device (D2D) links, while they will be accessed by a large number of smart and heterogeneous devices. This chapter discusses the management of interference in wireless networks of the 5G era. In the following, the goals of 5G networks and the interference management challenges they pose are first presented. Furthermore, the characteristics of future mobile networks which offer new tools for combating interference are also summarized. In this framework, coordinated multipoint techniques for both the uplink and the downlink are revisited, with special focus on the improvement of the cell-edge user experience. Finally \u2026",

The case study is the departures level of Athens International Airport, including up to three Access Points. The basic propagation mechanisms in this scenario are free space propagation with direct Line-of-Sight, reflection and multipath. Hence, a shadow fading based methodology for the calculation of excess path loss and attenuation over distance is not applicable in this case. For this purpose, an alternate method has been developed, featuring various models which have been employed and fit to the experimental data. Their fitting robustness has been compared in terms of Goodness-of-Fit metrics such as the R-Square and the Adjusted R-Square. Coefficients with 95 \u2026",

More specifically, the resource allocation and the operating mode of the system is optimized to maximize a weighted energy efficiency metric, taking into accounts the particularities of the hybrid network. The resulting optimization problem is efficiently tackled with the use of Dinkelbach's algorithm and difference of convex programming. Using this solution, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained to find the operation mode and alleviate the computational cost of the overall problem leading to a close solution to the optimal.

We focus on the practical communication scenario, where the main and eavesdropper's channels are correlated. In order to enhance the transmission security, transmit antenna selection is performed at the BS, and the best relay is chosen according to the full- or partial-relay selection criterion, which relies on the dual-hop relay channels or the second-hop relay channels, respectively. For these criteria, we study the impact of correlated fading on the network secrecy performance, by deriving an analytical approximation for the secrecy outage probability and an \u2026",

So far, differential detection for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks has been studied only for single Rayleigh channels.

In the considered N-NOMA scheme, superposition coding (SC) is employed to serve cell-edge users as well as users close to base stations (BSs) simultaneously, and distributed analog beamforming by the BSs to meet the cell-edge user's quality of service requirements. The combination of SC and distributed analog beamforming significantly complicates the expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the receiver, which makes the performance analysis particularly challenging. However, by using rational approximations, insightful analytical results are obtained in order to characterize the outage performance of the considered N-NOMA scheme. Computer simulation \u2026",

We investigate a dynamic user clustering problem from a fairness perspective. In order to solve this optimization problem, three sub-optimal algorithms, namely, top-down A, top-down B, and bottom up, are proposed to realize the different tradeoffs of complexity and throughput of the worst user. In addition, for each given user clustering case, we optimize the power allocation coefficients for the users in each cluster by adopting a bisection search-based algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can lower the complexity with an acceptable degradation on the throughput compared with the exhaustive search method. It is worth noting that the top-down B algorithm can achieve a good tradeoff between the complexity and the throughput among the three proposed algorithms.",

In this paper, we introduce the smart HPS that can facilitate energy consumption scheduling (ECS) via an intelligent connection to the power grid. In doing so, we first develop sensor control and communication systems with an embedded smart ECS unit for the HPS. Then, we propose a real-time energy management algorithm to reduce the operational cost of BTS, according to real-time pricing and estimating demand and supply.

However, the co-existence of VLC with the RF access points as well as the dependence of VLC to room illumination compel both technologies to work in parallel and thus, to form a hybrid heterogeneous VLC/RF network. This network offers the advantages of both technologies, namely increased capacity and ubiquitous coverage. Furthermore, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a very promising candidate technique for the next generation of wireless networks, mainly due to its increased spectrum efficiency compared to orthogonal access schemes. However, the optimal user grouping in NOMA is a combinatorial NP-complete problem, which calls for low complexity techniques. To this end, in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "THE DATA rate demands of wireless systems will con-tinue to grow for the foreseeable future. Since current technologies are not capable of supporting these demands, new and more efficient antenna configurations need to be devised. One of the most viable solutions is the deployment of Large-scale multiple antenna (LSMA) wireless systems. LSMA wireless systems with hundreds of low-power antennas, that may be colocated at a base station (BS) site, spread out on the face of a building, or distributed geographically, provide a plethora of advantages over conventional multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) and cooperative networks. In particular, these large-scale systems offer higher data rates, increased link reliability, and potential power savings, since the transmitted RF energy can be more sharply focused in space, while many random impairments (eg, thermal noise and intercell interference) can be averaged out. We note that these gains can be achieved by coherent, but simple, processing (eg, linear reception techniques in an uplink scenario). LSMA also entails a revolution in hardware. Expensive ultra-linear forty-Watt amplifiers are replaced by many cheap low-power devices whose combined action, only, has to meet stipulated tolerances. Likewise it is expected that lower resolution A/D and D/A converters can be used. Equally importantly, the analysis of large-scale systems can be carried out using tools from random matrix theory, which has attracted considerable research interest. For all these reasons, the area of LSMA systems has recently emerged at the forefront of wireless communication research.With the above vision, a Call \u2026",

Evaluation results show that heterogeneous networks always outperforms a homogeneous network in terms of power-delay characteristics.

In this paper, we assume a multiple-input multiple-output wiretap channel, where the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper are equipped with the same number of antennas. We introduce a protocol that exploits the properties of both physical and media access control layer security by employing polar coding and encryption techniques in a hybrid manner in order to guarantee secure transmission. A novel security technique is also proposed, where a cryptographic key is generated based on the information transmitted and renewed every transmission block without the need for a separate key exchange method.

            "Abstract": "Polar codes (PCs) have attracted significant attention in the last decade, especially after their adoption in the forthcoming 5G wireless networks. However, previous studies focused on coherent polar codes, which always rely on the strong assumption of available perfect channel state information. Instead, in this paper, we investigate the use of PCs in noncoherent systems. First, a binary differential phase shift keying (BDPSK) demodulator is concatenated with a polar decoder to form the noncoherent detector, where successive cancellation (SC) is applied. The simulation results demonstrate that the SC-based PCs for noncoherent detection have approximately a discrepancy of only 3 dB compared with the coherent counterpart in noncoherent channels. Furthermore, in order to further decrease this discrepancy, we replace the BDPSK demodulator with a soft-input soft-output (SISO) multiple symbol differential sphere \u2026",

More specifically, this is performed in terms of the high-order statistics (HOS) of the channel capacity over \u03b7-\u03bc fading channels. A generic analytic expression is derived for the corresponding nth statistical moment, which is subsequently employed for deducing exact closed-form expressions for the first four moments. Using these expressions, important statistical metrics, such as the amount of dispersion, amount of fading, skewness, and kurtosis, are derived in closed form and can be efficiently used in providing insights on the performance of dispersed CR systems. The obtained numerical results reveal interesting outcomes that could be useful for the channel selection, either for sharing or aggregation in heterogeneous networks, which is the core \u2026",

To this end, we propose a method which utilizes knowledge on both the instantaneous and average channel conditions in order to encompass this concept, by attributing a weight coefficient to each relay depending on its average channel state and then selecting the relay with the best instantaneous \"weighted\" channel conditions. We also provide a performance analysis of the proposed scheme that includes an analytical expression for the outage probability, together with a closed form one in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. Through the latter expression, the average symbol error probability (ASEP) for high SNRs is also derived. Numerical results demonstrate that, for small number of available relays or for high \u2026",

CQEI is simple to evaluate, since it depends on the channel statistics which vary much more slowly than the channel state itself, and thus can be obtained at the initialization state using a long training sequence and afterwards continuously improved during the whole communication period. Considering generalized fading channels (Nakagami-m, Nakagami-n, Nakagami-q) and a variety of modulations, we show that CQEI assesses the average error performance of a communication system more efficiently, compared to other long- term performance criteria such as the average signal to noise ratio (ASNR) and the amount of fading (AoF).

            "Abstract": "9.1 Introduction k While the era of the fifth-generation (5G) communication systems and beyond is rapidly approaching, future networks pose new challenges, displaying a group of diverse characteristics. These networks are expected to accommodate a vast number of wireless connected devices with increased throughput, which will below-cost, with extended lifetime, environmentally friendly, and with no need for hard-wiring. Furthermore, with the introduction of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), many objects will be connected to the internet, including devices such as smart meters, sensors, etc., which are remotely situated. These remote devices may not have access to energy resources, and they may also be situated at a great distance from the destination of their transmitted information [1]. In the light of the above considerations, energy harvesting (EH), as an emerging solution for prolonging the lifetime of the energy-constrained wireless devices, has gained significant research interest in recent years [1]. Conventional energy harvesting techniques which rely on external natural energy resources, such as wind or solar energy, may not be able to offer reliable and uninterrupted communication due to the intermittent nature of these resources. On the other hand, the abundance of radio frequency (RF) signals and its controllable nature render them a promising energy resource for powering communication devices [2]. Since RF signals are capable of transferring both information and energy, the concept of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has been proposed, where the receiving device can perform two functions, energy \u2026",

In the considered N-NOMA scheme, superposition coding (SC) is employed to serve cell-edge users as well as users close to base stations (BSs) simultaneously, and distributed analog beamforming by the BSs to meet the cell-edge user's quality of service (QoS) requirements. The combination of SC and distributed analog beamforming significantly complicates the expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the reveiver, which makes the performance analysis particularly challenging. However, by using rational approximations, insightful analytical results are obtained in order to characterize the outage performance of the considered N-NOMA scheme. Computer simulation results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed scheme as well as to demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical results.",

The derived expressions are corroborated with respective results from computer simulations and are subsequently employed in formulating a power optimization problem that enhances the system performance under total power constraints within the multi-relay cooperative system. Furthermore, it is shown that optimum power allocation provides substantial performance gains over equal power allocation, particularly, when the source-relay and relay-destination paths are highly unbalanced.",

Based on this, non-coherent detection of differentially modulated signals can be considered as an alternative method. The present paper investigates the effects of in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI), which are known to degrade the performance of wireless communication systems. Specifically, we evaluate the effects of IQI on the bit error rate (BER) performance of differential quadrature phase shift keying (dQPSK) for ideal receiver (RX) with transmitter (TX) IQI, ideal TX with RX IQI and joint TX/RX IQI. Explicit analytic expressions are derived for the BER of both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems suffering from IQI at the TX and/or RX. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulation as well as offered analytic results show that realistic TX/RX IQI values can degrade the \u2026",

Although both users can directly receive information from the AP, the performance of the far user is degraded compared to the near one due to the asymmetrical channel gains. Thus, the user cooperation strategy is proposed to improve the performance of the far user by using mixed VLC/RF relaying technique in parallel with the wireless optical direct link. To efficiently exploit the available heterogeneous links, the concept of cross-band selection combining (CBSC) is introduced, according to which the far user is continuously served by either the mixed VLC/RF or the direct VLC link.

More specifically, assuming that the users are able to harvest energy both from interference and desired signals, higher path loss reduces the downlink rate of the far user, while it also negatively affects its uplink rate, since less energy can be harvested during downlink. Furthermore, if the far user is located at the cell edge, its performance is more severely impaired by interference, despite the potential gain due to energy harvesting from interference signals. To this end, we fairly maximize the downlink/uplink users' rates, by utilizing corresponding priority weights.

However, due to the requirement of acquiring the full channel state information (CSI) of all links, ORS has increased the system's complexity and might be harmful to the network stability, especially for the large-scale networks. In this paper, we therefore proposed an alternative scheme, namely, secure switch-and-stay combining (SSSC) protocol for providing the best secure performance. In particular, a two-phase underlay cognitive relay network, where one out of two decode-and-forward (DF) is activated to assist the secure data transmission. The secure relay switching occurs when the relay cannot support the secure communication any longer.
