The (expected) latency on a link is determined by an arbitrary non-decreasing, non-constant and convex latency function \u03d5. In a Nash equilibrium, each user alone is minimizing her (Expected) Individual Cost, which is the (expected) latency on the link she chooses. To evaluate Nash equilibria, we formulate Social Cost as the sum of the users'(Expected) Individual Costs. The Price of Anarchy is the worst-case ratio of Social Cost for a Nash equilibrium over the least possible Social Cost. A Nash equilibrium is pure if each user deterministically chooses a single link; a Nash equilibrium is fully mixed if each user chooses each link with non-zero probability. We obtain: For the case of identical users, the Social Cost of any Nash equilibrium is no more than the Social Cost of the fully mixed Nash \u2026",

For counting problems in application domains which do not require linearizability but will run correctly if only sequential consistency is provided, the results of our investigation, and their potential payoffs, are threefold: First, we show that sequential consistency and linearizability cannot be distinguished by the timing conditions previously considered in the context of counting networks; thus, in contexts where these constraints apply, it is possible to rely on the stronger semantics of linearizability, which simplifies proofs and enhances compositionality. Second, we identify local timing conditions that support sequential consistency but not linearizability; thus, we suggest weaker, easily implementable timing conditions that are likely to be sufficient \u2026",

Each agent has an individual demand; demands are drawn according to some probability distribution. The cost paid by an agent for a resource she chooses is the total demand put on the resource divided by the number of agents who chose that same resource. So, resources charge costs in an equitable, fair way, while each resource makes no profit out of the agents.We call our model the Fair Pricing model. Its fair cost mechanism induces a non-cooperative game among the agents. To evaluate the Nash equilibria of this game, we introduce the Diffuse Price of Anarchy, as an extension of the Price of Anarchy that takes into account the probability distribution on the demands.

In contrast to games with expectation-optimizer players where mixed equilibria always exist (Nash 1950; Nash Ann. Math. 54, 286\u2013295, 1951), a mixed equilibrium for such games, called a V-equilibrium, may fail to exist, even though pure equilibria (if any) transfer over. What is the exact impact of such valuations on the existence, structure and complexity of mixed equilibria? We address this fundamental question in the context of expectation plus variance, a particular concave valuation denoted as RA, which stands for risk-averse; so, variance enters as a measure of risk and it is used as an additive adjustment to expectation.

In a Nash equilibrium, each user routes its traffic on links that minimize its expected latency cost.Our structural results provide substantial evidence for the Fully Mixed Nash Equilibrium Conjecture, which states that the worst Nash equilibrium is the fully mixed Nash equilibrium, where each user chooses each link with positive probability. Specifically, we prove that the Fully Mixed Nash Equilibrium Conjecture is valid for pure Nash equilibria and that under a certain condition, the social cost of any Nash equilibrium is within a factor of 6 + \u03b5, of that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A packet-switched network is stable if the number of packets in the network remains bounded at all times. A very natural question that arises in the context of stability properties of such networks is how the dynamical change of network link capacities precisely affects these properties.In this work, we embark on a systematic study of this question adopting the Adversarial Queueing Theory framework, where an adversary controls rates of packet injections and determines packet paths. In addition, the power of the adversary is enhanced to include manipulation of link capacities. However, in doing so, the adversary may use only two possible (integer) values, namely 1 and C> 1; moreover, the capacity changes are not abrupt: once a link capacity is set to a value, it maintains this value for a period of time proportional to the number of packets in the system at the time of setting the link capacity to the value. We call this the Adversarial, Quasi-Static Queueing Theory model. Within this model, we obtain a comprehensive collection of results in the form of instability bounds on injection rate of the adversary for various greedy protocols:",

We show that -hardness still holds under two significant restrictions in simultaneity: the game is win-lose (that is, all utilities are 0 or 1) and symmetric. To address the former restriction, we design win-lose gadgets and a win-lose reduction; to accomodate the latter restriction, we employ and analyze the classical  -symmetrization (Griesmer et al. in On symmetric bimatrix games, IBM research paper RC-959, IBM Corp., T. J. Watson Research Center, 1963) in the win-lose setting. Thus, symmetric win-lose bimatrix games are as complex as general bimatrix games with respect to such decision problems. As a byproduct of our techniques, we derive hardness \u2026",

Thus, the problem is equivalent to the correspondingly restricted problem of assigning n jobs to m parallel machines. In a pure Nash equilibrium, no user may improve its own individual cost (delay) by unilaterally switching to another link from its set of allowed links. As our main result, we introduce a polynomial time algorithm to compute from any given assignment a pure Nash equilibrium with non-increased makespan. The algorithm gradually changes a given assignment by pushing unsplittable user traffics through a network that is defined by the users and the links. Here, we use ideas from blocking flows. Furthermore, we use similar techniques as in the generic Preflow-Push algorithm to approximate a schedule with minimum makespan \u2026",

We obtain the following results: for certain families of graphs, mixed Nash equilibria can be computed in polynomially time. These families include, among others, regular graphs, graphs with perfect matchings and trees. The corresponding price of anarchy for any mixed Nash equilibria of the game is upper and lower bounded by a linear function of the number of vertices of the graph.

For each particular resource, the resource-specific delay function and the player-specific constant (for that resource) are composed by means of a group operation (such as addition or multiplication) into a player-specific latency function. We assume that the underlying group is a totally ordered abelian group. In this way, we obtain the class of weighted congestion games with player-specific constants; we observe that this class is contained in the new intuitive class of dominance weighted congestion games.",

In this model, processors have identities, which are neither necessarily all identical (as in the anonymous model) nor necessarily unique (as in the eponymous model). In a decision problem formalized as a relation, processors receive inputs and seek to reach outputs respecting the relation. We focus on the partially eponymous ring, and we shall consider the computation of circularly symmetric relations on it. We consider sets of rings where all rings in the set have the same multiset of identity multiplicities.\u2022 We distinguish between solvability and computability: in solvability, processors are required to always reach outputs respecting the relation; in computability, they must do so whenever this is possible, and must otherwise report impossibility.\u2013We present a topological \u2026",

Each agent has an individual demand; demands are drawn according to some probability distribution. The cost paid by an agent for a resource it chooses is the total demand put on the resource divided by the number of agents who chose that same resource. So, resources charge costs in an equitable, fair way, while each resource makes no profit out of the agents.  We call our model the Fair Pricing model. Its fair cost mechanism induces a non-cooperative game among the agents. To evaluate the Nash equilibria of this game, we introduce the Diffuse Price of Anarchy, as an extension of the Price of Anarchy that takes into account the probability distribution on the demands.

The objective of the defender is to place itself in such a way as to maximize the number of attackers caught, while each attacker aims not to be caught.

            "Abstract": "Transfering and delivering messages among different processing units is one of the most basic functionalities of a distributed communication network. This functionality is taken up by following some particular routing protocol, which decides, in a distributed fashion, which message to forward along which link of the network at each time step. This routing mechanism is invoked at every link of the network, and for each and every (discrete) time step, while it must ensure that all messages from all possible sources to all possible destinations are delivered in a timely fashion.A basic challenge encountered by any distributed routing protocol is to come up with some policy for prioritizing packets that find themselves queued up for traversing the same link simultaneously. This policy must provide certain QoS guarantees on how much time it takes a packet to travel from source to destination (including the time waiting in queues). In order for such a guarantee to be possible, the situation where packets end up waiting in queues for an indefinite amount of time needs to be excluded in the first place. Thus, a protocol is stable on a particular communication network if the number of packets in the network remains, at all times, bounded from above by some quantity independent of time (but possibly dependent on characteristics",

A truly extraordinary amount of research activity is now being observed at the intersection of these two fields.One may ask why, really, it is so interesting to consider this intersection? There are a plethora of reasons, and this has led to a plethora of subareas in this already large intersection. We shall only touch on some of them that we feel are the most prominent.\u2022 First, the algorithmic foundations of Game Theory are not yet developed. Game Theory has answered many questions of existence in a satisfactory way (in many occasions); however, algorithmic questions of actually finding game-theoretic objects with prescribed mathematical properties (for example, the best Nash equilibrium) have only recently started to undergo a systematic complexity-theoretic investigation. It is hoped that Algorithmic Game Theory will experience the same rapid development as Algorithmic Graph Theory or Algorithmic Geometry, to name two leading examples.\u2022 Second, there are many phenomena in Computer Science that involve the interaction of antagonistic entities with conflicting interests. Modeling these selfish entities using the concepts of Game Theory is natural and appropriate, and invites Theoretical Computer Science to take up the story and analyze the resulting models of selfish computation from its own point of view.",

A hotpotato routing algorithm is greedy if packets are advanced from their sources toward their destinations whenever possible. The dilation D is the longest distance a packet has to travel; the congestion C is the maximum number of packets that traverse any edge. The routing time of a routing-algorithm is the time for the last packet to reach its destination. A well known lower bound on the routing time is \u2126 (C+ D). When is it possible to design routing algorithms whose routing times match this lower bound? Here, we address this fundamental question within the context of hot-potato routing for the specific case of a tree with n nodes. In particular, we present two greedy, hot-potato routing algorithms: i. A deterministic algorithm, which has a routing time of O ((\u03b4\u00b7 C+ D) lg n), where \u03b4 is the maximum node degree; thus, for bounded degree trees, the routing time becomes O ((C+ D) lg n). ii. A randomized algorithm which has a routing time of O ((C+ D) lg2 n) with high probability, for any node degree. Randomization is used for adjusting packet priorities.Both algorithms are online and simple yet efficient. They are built upon the idea of using safe deflections, which are deflections whose net effect is to \u201crecycle\u201d edges from one path to another. These are the first known hot-potato routing algorithms (whether greedy or not) for trees whose routing time is within logarithmic factors of the \u2126 (C+ D) lower bound.",

A long-standing open problem has concerned the existence of a universal packet-switching algorithm with near-optimal performance guarantees for the class of bufferless networks where the buffer size for packets in transit is zero. We give a positive answer to this question. In particular, we give a universal bufferless algorithm which is within a polylogarithmic factor from optimal for arbitrary batch problems: , where  is the packet delivery time of our algorithm,  is the optimal delivery time, n is the size of the network, and N is the number of packets. At the heart of our result is a new deterministic technique for constructing a universal bufferless algorithm by \u2026",

In contrast to games with expectation-optimizer players where mixed equilibria always exist [15, 16], a mixed equilibrium for such games, called a V-equilibrium, may fail to exist, even though pure equilibria (if any) transfer over. What is the impact of such valuations on the existence, structure and complexity of mixed equilibria? We address this fundamental question for a particular concave valuation: expectation plus variance, denoted as RA, which stands for risk-averse; so, variance enters as a measure of risk and it is used as an additive adjustment to expectation. We obtain the following results about RA-equilibria:   A collection of general structural properties of RA \u2026A collection of general structural properties of RA \u2026",

We introduce a new measure of Social Cost, defined to be the expectation of the square of the maximum congestion on a link; we call it Quadratic Maximum Social Cost. A Nash equilibrium (NE) is a stable state where no user can improve her (expected) latency by switching her mixed strategy; a worst-case NE is one that maximizes Quadratic Maximum Social Cost.

The players play mixed strategies and their costs are evaluated by unimodal valuations. This broad class of valuations includes all concave, one-parameter functions $\\mathsf{F}: [0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with a unique maximum point. Our main result is an impossibility result stating that: If the maximum is obtained in $(0,1)$ and $\\mathsf{F}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\ne b$, then there exists a 2-players, 2-values game without $\\mathsf{F}$-equilibrium. The counterexample game used for the impossibility result belongs to a new class of very sparse 2-players, 2-values bimatrix games which we call normal games. In an attempt to investigate the remaining case $\\mathsf{F}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = b$, we show that: - Every normal, $n$-strategies game has an ${\\mathsf{F}}$-equilibrium when ${\\mathsf{F}}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = b$. We present a linear time algorithm for computing such an equilibrium. - For 2-players, 2-values games with 3 strategies we have that if $\\mathsf{F}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\le b$, then every 2-players, 2-values, 3-strategies game has an $\\mathsf{F}$-equilibrium; if $\\mathsf{F}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) > b$, then there exists a normal 2-players, 2-values, 3-strategies game without $\\mathsf{F}$-equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to provide an (almost complete) answer on whether there is, for a given concave function $\\mathsf{F}$, a counterexample game without $\\mathsf{F}$-equilibrium.",

In a Nash equilibrium, each user selfishly routes her traffic on those links that minimize her expected latency cost, given the network congestion caused by the other users. The social cost of a Nash equilibrium is the expectation, over all random choices of the users, of the maximum, over all links, latency through a link.

In our model, users share parallel links. A user strategy can be any probability distribution over the set of links. Each user tries to minimize its expected latency, where the latency on a link is described by an arbitrary non-decreasing, convex function. The social cost is defined as the sum of the users\u2019 expected latencies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that mixed Nash equilibria for routing games have been studied in combination with non-linear latency functions.As our main result, we show that for identical users the social cost of any Nash equilibrium is bounded by the social cost of the fully mixed Nash equilibrium.

As our main result, we introduce a polynomial time algorithm to compute from any given assignment a pure Nash equilibrium with non-increased makespan. The algorithm gradually changes a given assignment by pushing unsplittable user traffics through a network that is defined by the users and the links. Here, we use ideas from blocking flows. Furthermore, we use similar techniques as in the generic PREFLOWPUSH algorithm to approximate a schedule with minimum makespan, gaining an improved approximation factor of 2\u2014^ j-for identical links, where w\\is the largest user traffic. We extend this result to related links, gaining an approximation factor of 2. Our approximation algorithms run in polynomial time.

So, this problem is equivalent to the correspondingly restricted scheduling problem of assigning n jobs to m parallel machines. In a Nash equilibrium, no user may improve its own Individual Cost (latency) by unilaterally switching to another link from its set of allowed links.For identical links, we present, as our main result, a polynomial time algorithm to compute from any given assignment a Nash equilibrium with non-increased makespan. The algorithm gradually transforms the assignment by pushing the unsplittable user traffics through a flow network, which is constructed from the users and the links. The algorithm uses ideas from blocking flows.Furthermore, we use techniques simular to those in \u2026",

Our main result is a new deterministic technique that constructs a universal bufferless al-gorithm by emulating a universal buffered algorithm. The heart of the emulation is to replace packet buffering with packet circulation on regions of the network. The cost of the emulation on the routing time is proportional to the square of the node buffer size used by the buffered algorithm. We apply this emulation to a simple randomized buffered algo rithm to obtain a distributed, universal bufferless algorithm with routing time O ((C+ D). log (n+ N)), which is within poly-logarithmic factors from the optimal, where n is the size of the network and N is the number of packets. The bufferless competitive ratio is the ratio of the best achiev-able bufferless routing time, to the best achievable buffered routing time.",

The social cost of a Nash equilibrium is the expectation, over all random choices of the users, of the maximum, over all links, latency through a link.We embark on a systematic study of several algorithmic problems related to the computation of Nash equilibria for the selfish routing game we consider.

We show, by a reduction from vertex coloring, that direct routing in NP-complete, and that it is as hard to approximate as coloring. This result shows that buffering is necessary in order to tractably compute routing schedules. Further, we construct a hard routing problem for which any routing algorithm requires \u2126 (N (4\u2212 2\u2208)/3) total packet buffering to approximate an optimal routing schedule with approximation ratio O (N\u2208), for any 0\u2264 \u01eb< 1/2.We then study algorithms for efficient direct routing. We give a greedy algorithm for general direct routing problems with direct routing time that is worst case optimal. Finally, we consider many interesting routing problems on commonly used network topologies for which variants of the greedy algorithm achieve optimal or near optimal (within logarithmic factors) routing time.

            "Abstract": "Most of the existing and foreseen complex networks, such as the Internet, are operated and built by thousands of large and small entities (autonomous agents), which collaborate to process and deliver end-to-end flows originating from and terminating at any of them. The distributed nature of the Internet implies a lack of coordination among its users. Instead, each user attempts to obtain maximum performance according to his own parameters and objectives.Methods from game theory and mathematical economics have been proven to be a powerful modeling tool, which can be applied to understand, control, and efficiently design such dynamic, complex networks. Game theory provides a good starting point for computer scientists in their endeavor to understand selfish rational behavior in complex networks with many agents (players). Such scenarios are readily modeled using techniques from game theory, where players with potentially conflicting goals participate in a common setting with well-prescribed interactions.",

So, the defender captures system rationality. In a Nash equilibrium, no single player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from its randomized strategy. The Price of Defense is the worst-case ratio, over all Nash equilibria, of the optimal gain of the defender (which is \u03bd) over the gain of the defender at a Nash equilibrium. We present a comprehensive collection of trade-offs between the Price of Defense and the computational efficiency of Nash equilibria proved in [14, 15, 16].",

For the resulting simple class, we study the complexity of deciding the existence of a pure equilibrium, where no player could unilaterally improve her cost by switching to another link. We show that even for a single negative weight, this decision problem is strongly NP-complete when the number of links is part of the input; the problem is NP-complete already for two links.

This follows directly from the concavity of CVaR \u03b1 in the involved probabilities, which we establish.(2) The Crawford property: For every \u03b1, there is a 2-player game with no CVaR \u03b1-equilibrium.

As a measure of system protection, we adopt the Defense-Ratio (Mavronicolas et al., 2008)[20], which provides the expected (inverse) proportion of attackers caught by the defenders. In a Defense-Optimal Nash equilibrium, the Defense-Ratio matches a simple lower bound. We discover that the existence of Defense-Optimal Nash equilibria depends in a subtle way on how the number of defenders compares to two natural \u2026",

We assume a collection of n network users, each employing a mixed strategy which is a probability distribution over links, to control the shipping of its own assigned traffic. Given a capacity for each link specifying the rate at which the link processes traffic, the objective is to route traffic so that the maximum expected latency over all links is minimized. We consider both uniform and non-uniform link capacities.",

            "Abstract": "[Schaefer and Stefankovic, Theory of Computing Systems, 2015] provided an explicit formulation of EXISTS-R as the class capturing the complexity of deciding the Existential Theory of the Reals, and established that deciding, given a 3-player game, whether or not it has a Nash equilibrium with no probability exceeding a given rational is EXISTS-R-complete. Four more decision problems about Nash equilibria for 3-player games were very recently shown EXISTS-R-complete via a chain of individual, problem-specific reductions in [Garg et al., Proceedings of ICALP 2015]; determining more such EXISTS-R-complete problems was posed there as an open problem. In this work, we deliver an extensive catalog of EXISTS-R-complete decision problems about Nash equilibria in 3-player games, thus resolving completely the open problem from [Garg et al., Proceedings of ICALP 2015]. Towards this end, we present a single and very simple, unifying reduction from the EXISTS-R-complete decision problem from [Schaefer and Stefankovic, Theory of Computing Systems, 2015] to (almost) all the decision problems about Nash equilibria that were before shown NP-complete for 2-player games in [Bilo and Mavronicolas, Proceedings of SAGT 2012; Conitzer and Sandholm, Games and Economic Behavior, 2008; Gilboa and Zemel, Games and Economic Behavior, 1989]. Encompassed in the catalog are the four decision problems shown EXISTS-R-complete in [Garg et al., Proceedings of ICALP 2015].",
