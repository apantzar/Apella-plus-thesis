A middleware architecture is a prerequisite for sensor grids in order to bridge the two heterogeneous technologies and efficiently support aggregated grid services available to a large number of grid users. On the other hand, the energy conservation of the participating sensor nodes is an essential factor for QoS provisioning, thereby extending WSNs survivability and providing diversity to potential grid services. For the best of our knowledge, power awareness for middleware architectures for sensor grids has never been studied in the literature so far. The rationale of our work employs a scheduler which provides QoS to the grid users from an energy awareness perspective by interacting with an appropriate resource manager.

At the resource reservation level, we develop an efficient method to partition the available codes based on the offered traffic load of each class of calls and the size of the tree.

This paper proposes a system, aiming to classify e-commerce sites according their Web-content. This system can be implemented for automatic knowledge segmentation in a portal or in a search engine repository. The system performance reached 96% in the first test sets, after the learning phase.

            "Abstract": "The wide utilization of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is obstructed by the severely limited energy constraints of the individual sensor nodes. This is the reason why a large part of the research in WSNs focuses on the development of energy efficient routing protocols. In this paper, a new protocol called Equalized Cluster Head Election Routing Protocol (ECHERP), which pursues energy conservation through balanced clustering, is proposed. ECHERP models the network as a linear system and, using the Gaussian elimination algorithm, calculates the combinations of nodes that can be chosen as cluster heads in order to extend the network lifetime. The performance evaluation of ECHERP is carried out through simulation tests, which evince the effectiveness of this protocol in terms of network energy efficiency when compared against other well-known protocols.

Sensor networks are dense wireless networks consisting of groups of small, inexpensive nodes, which collect and disseminate critical data.

Considerable research has been focused at overcoming these deficiencies through low-energy consumption schemes. In this paper, we propose a Scheduling Scheme for Energy Efficiency in Wireless Sensor Networks. The basic concept of this scheme is to try to maximize the time each sensor node remains in SLEEP mode, and to minimize the time spent in IDLE mode, taking into account not only the consumed power, but also the end-to-end transmission delay.",

WMNs may be also used to improve the performance of multi-hop ad-hoc networks, Wireless local area networks (WLANs) and Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMANs). One of the factors that influence the performance of WMNs is the routing protocol that is used. Many routing protocols for WMNs can be found in the literature. However, not all these protocols are suitable for health communication systems. In this paper, based on the operational requirements of the health applications, we classify several routing protocols for wireless mesh networks and highlight their advantages and performance issues when they are used in healthcare.",

Location tracking is used to keep track of a Mobile Terminal (MT). The network retains the Registration Area (RA), where the MT last updated its location, so when an incoming call arrives for the MT, the network with the help of a location tracking strategy can find the area where the MT resides and then deliver the call. In this paper, we introduce a 2-level distributed database architecture combined with the Group Registration (GR) location tracking strategy to be used in 3G wireless networks. The GR strategy reduces the location management total cost, by updating the location of MTs in an RA with a single route response message to the HSS (Home Subscriber Server). More specifically, the IDs of the MTs newly moving into an RA are buffered and sent to the HSS for location updating in the route response \u2026",

This is because not only the technological advances have enabled the development of advanced sensor nodes with extremely low cost but the potential applications of such structures are ever growing too. WSNs differ from traditional wireless communication networks in several of their characteristics. One of them is power awareness, due to the fact that the batteries of sensor nodes have a restricted lifetime and are difficult to be replaced. Therefore, all protocols must be designed in such a way as to minimize energy consumption and preserve the longevity of the network. That is why, routing protocols in WSNs aim mainly to accomplish power conservation while in traditional networks they focus primarily on the quality of service (QoS). Recent advances in WSNs have led to many new protocols specifically designed \u2026",

Possible simultaneous transmissions may cause collisions, whenever transmitting nodes have a common destination node in their interference range. To avoid these collisions while minimizing the frame length, the NP-complete Broadcast Scheduling Problem (BSP) should be approximated. This is usually done by interpreting the BSP into a corresponding graph coloring problem. This paper proposes an algorithm that tries to approximate the BSP, using an interference vector. Additionally, the node ordering policies used for scheduling are evaluated in terms of frame length and execution time. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has smaller execution time than the ones using graph coloring, and decreasing degree ordering results to the best frame length.",

This article proposes a scheme which aims to both forecast imminent congestion and prevent its further diffusion in WSNs. The prediction of forthcoming congestion is based on the computation of a suitably built cost function, which considers a set of metrics related with the popularity of the alternate nodes and routing paths. The prevention of congestion diffusion is carried out through multi hop/path routing, by utilizing nodes and routes which are less probable to be congested.

TDMA appears as a promising solution for overcoming these issues, but the application of TDMA in ad-hoc networks leads to the known NP complete Broadcast Scheduling Problem (BSP).

Network access technologies such as Long-Term Evolution Advanced Pro with Full Dimensional Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (LTE-A Pro FD-MIMO) and LTE Vehicle to Everything (LTE-V2X) undertake the service of an increasing number of vehicular users, since each vehicle could serve multiple passenger with multiple services. Therefore, the design of efficient resource allocation schemes for 5G-VCC infrastructures is needed. This paper describes a network slicing scheme for 5G-VCC systems that aims to improve the performance of modern vehicular services. The QoS that each user perceives for his services as well as the energy consumption that each access network causes to user equipment are considered. Subsequently, the satisfactory grade of the user services is estimated by taking into consideration both the perceived QoS and the energy consumption. If the estimated satisfactory grade is above a predefined service threshold, then the necessary Resource Blocks (RBs) from the current Point of Access (PoA) are allocated to support the user\u2019s services. On the contrary, if the estimated satisfactory grade is lower than the aforementioned threshold, additional RBs from a Virtual Resource Pool (VRP) located at the Software Defined Network (SDN) controller are committed by the PoA in order to satisfy the required services.

Although the most efficient protocols for key establishment are based on symmetric key encryption, these protocols are unable to provide adequate security against attacks, such as node impersonation and fake generation attacks. For this reason, several hybrid key establishment protocols have been developed, making limited use of public key cryptography and more particularly of Elliptic Curve Cryptography. However, although these protocols seem to be efficient for sensor nodes, they reduce performance, especially in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a multilayer key establishment protocol for DSNs, which combines hybrid and symmetric key establishment techniques. The performance analysis shows a \u2026",

Sensor networks are dense wireless networks consisting of groups of small, inexpensive nodes, which collect and disseminate critical data. Thus, sensor nodes have various energy and computational constraints, due to their inexpensive nature and ad hoc method of deployment. Considerable research has been focused at overcoming these deficiencies through low-energy consumption schemes. Among, other factors, the route selection strategy may have an impact on the network lifetime. In this paper, we present a lifetime prolonging route selection strategy for wireless sensor networks, namely Low Cost Min-Max Energy Routing (LCMMER).

            "Abstract": "In a fifth generation (5G) vehicular network architecture, several point of access (PoA) types, including both road side units (RSUs) and aerial relay nodes (ARNs), can be leveraged to undertake the service of an increasing number of vehicular users. In such an architecture, the application of efficient resource allocation schemes is indispensable. In this direction, this paper describes a network slicing scheme for 5G vehicular networks that aims to optimize the performance of modern network services. The proposed architecture consists of ground RSUs and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as ARNs enabling the communication between ground vehicular nodes and providing additional communication resources. Both RSUs and ARNs implement the LTE vehicle-to-everything (LTE-V2X) technology, while the position of each ARN is optimized by applying a fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making (fuzzy MADM) technique. With regard to the proposed network architecture, each RSU maintains a local virtual resource pool (LVRP) which contains local RBs (LRBs) and shared RBs (SRBs), while an SDN controller maintains a virtual resource pool (VRP), where the SRBs of the RSUs are stored. In addition, each ARN maintains its own resource blocks (RBs). For users connected to the RSUs, if the remaining RBs of the current RSU can satisfy the predefined threshold value, the LRBs of the RSU are allocated to user services. On the contrary, if the remaining RBs of the current RSU cannot satisfy the threshold, extra RBs from the VRP are allocated to user services. Similarly, for users connected to ARNs, the satisfaction grade of each user service is \u2026",

Many schemes can be found in the literature, which have significant contributions in energy conservation. However, these schemes do not concentrate on reducing the end-to-end packet delay while at the same time retaining the energy-saving capability. Since a long delay can be harmful for either large or small wireless sensor networks, this paper proposes a TDMA-based scheduling scheme that balances energy-saving and end-to-end delay. This balance is achieved by an appropriate scheduling of the wakeup intervals, to allow data packets to be delayed by only one sleep interval for the end-to-end transmission from the sensors to the gateway. The proposed scheme achieves the reduction of the end-to-end delay caused by the sleep mode operation while at the same time it maximizes the energy savings.",

            "Abstract": "Although MPEG-Dynamic Adaptation Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH) eliminates data packet loss, based on the rate adaptation strategy adopted by the user and the network conditions, still playback interruptions may not be avoided. In this paper an algorithm for rate adaption in MPEG-DASH is proposed that employs fuzzy logic to estimate the resolution of the next video segment that each client should obtain from the server. In this way, the buffering time at each client is kept above a target buffering time and thus buffer overflows and unnecessary bit rate fluctuations are avoided. Simulation results showed that the proposed rate adaptation strategy has a beneficial effect on the quality each user perceives.",

Nodes communicate amongst each other using wireless radios and operate by following a peer\u2010to\u2010peer network model.

This line of action can be anticipated as a first step in the migration path towards 3G systems and has been adopted for two basic reasons: the first is that market demand for wireless data services is currently a small portion of the overall wireless service demand and the second is that the deployment of new technologies in large scale requires gross economical investments.

This work describes the software core of a system designed for fabric inspection on the basis of simple image\u2010processing operations as well as its efficiency on detection of usual textile defects.

An extension of TCP, the Tcpcrypt, is a promising technology that can be used on this field. Tcpcrypt is designed to provide end-to-end encryption in the transport layer with low overhead, rendering it a very promising solution in order to protect medical data that are often handled by devices with limited resources. In this paper Tcpcrypt performance is evaluated against TCP, in terms of additional overhead incurred in the total size of the transmitted data and the total number of CPU instructions that are executed. Moreover, a solution for reducing overhead through fine-grained packet handling is proposed.",

A modified SIFT algorithm (called ROI-SIFT), followed by RANSAC to identify outliers, is used to localize and match correspondence interest points, that will be used to compute affine transformations for the registration of a dermatological image with the respective follow-up examination image. Experimental evaluations of the registration method are reported for image pairs acquired during follow-up examinations. Finally, a short discussion of scheduled future work is proposed.",

Handoff failure will result in the forced termination of an ongoing call. From the user's point of view, the service of a handoff request is more important, as the forced termination of an ongoing call is more annoying than the blocking of new calls. Therefore, in order to support QoS to the users and to provide ubiquitous coverage, the handoff procedure ought to be further investigated. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the basic elements, the different types and phases of the handoff procedure. Moreover, particular interest has been given in the horizontal handoff execution phase by discussing and classifying the most recent handoff prioritization schemes into categories based on the concepts that these schemes adopt, e.g. channel reservation, handoff queueing \u2026",

However, although it eliminates data packet loss, depending on the rate adaptation strategy adopted by the user, as well as, the network conditions, there may be playback interruptions. In this paper a novel MPEG-DASH adaptation scheme, the FDASH, is proposed, which, by employing fuzzy logic to control the buffering time and the resolution achieves the following: a) distributes the best possible resolution of video segments, b) delivers undisrupted video playback as a result of buffer underflows at the client, c) avoids unnecessary changes of video resolution owing to frequent fluctuations of the available connection throughput.

TDMA has been increasingly used as a scheduling technique in ad-hoc networks. The current trend for QoS capable applications led to the deployment of numerous routing schemes that use TDMA. These schemes try to solve the problem of distributing the available slots among the wireless nodes and at the same time, to find paths within the network that fulfill some QoS related limitations, such as end-to-end delay. The exact way the slots are distributed among the transmitting nodes has an impact on the end-to-end delay and other performance parameters of the network, such as capacity. Therefore, the efficiency of the scheduling algorithms is closely related to the network topologies.

WSNs make it easier to monitor and control physical environments from remote locations and present many significant advantages over wired sensor networks for a variety of civilian and military applications [1, 2]. A WSN is usually randomly deployed in inaccessible terrains, disaster areas, or polluted environments, where battery replacement or recharge is difficult or even impossible to be performed. For this reason, network lifetime is of crucial importance to a WSN. To prolong network lifetime, there is a need for efficient power control mechanisms to reduce power consumption in sensor nodes and energy--efficient techniques should be employed at all layers of the network [3\u20135], which should take into account the following unique characteristics and application requirements of WSNs [1]:",

The security requirements for protecting data link and network layers are identified and the design criteria for creating secure ad hoc networks using several authentication protocols are analyzed.

Sensor nodes have various energy and computational constraints because of their inexpensive nature and ad hoc method of deployment. Considerable research has been focused at overcoming these deficiencies through more low-energy consumption schemes. Three basic schemes have been chosen to be studied in this paper. The motivation of the first scheme is twofold, limiting multi-user interference to increase single-hop throughput and reducing power consumption to prolong battery life. The second scheme focuses on energy-aware routing. The third scheme contributes to dynamically increase the lifetime of the sensor network.

A number of methods have been published regarding delay analysis of 802.11 networks, but little research has been carried out for the jitter analysis, even though jitter can be more important than delay for real time applications, like voice over IP, multimedia streaming, etc. In this paper we introduce a new analytical method for estimating the jitter caused by the distributed coordination function of the 802.11 MAC protocol. This model is also evaluated by a series of simulations.",

However, despite its merits, the standardization process of IMS networks is lagging behind, leaving harmonization issues of services provisioning, open.

This need is even greater in vehicular environments, in which the nodes are characterized by high mobility. In this paper, we study the basic protocols for mobility support in vehicular environments, such as Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Transient Binding for PMIPv6, and analyze the handover delay and their performance. Moreover, we present vehicular environment scenarios in which the current protocols fail to provide seamless handovers for the mobile nodes, due to long delays and large percentages of packet loss. Additionally, we propose an enhanced handover scheme for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), in which data follow the optimal path to the destination and is characterized by a smooth transition of the mobile node to the target access network.

The cost for network resources utilization, when provisioning such services, will play a prominent role in their commercial success, since the more spare resources that can be used, the more cheaply the services can be delivered to the end users. In the context of promoting the role of ad hoc networks as service platforms for high quality multimedia applications, this article first discusses and classifies a set of issues involved in quality of service (QoS) provisioning in ad hoc networks and then presents a congestion-free TDMA algorithm for end-to-end network resources assignment via an optimized mechanism that relies on capacity requests and grants.

Various adaptation algorithms using the MPEG DASH protocol have been proposed, aiming to adapt the media bit rate delivered at the client to the current network conditions.

In the first stage, the signals of one service group are detected, followed by the second stage including the corresponding detection of the remaining signals. An appropriate switching scheme based on specific transmission quality requirements is utilized prior to the detection so as to allocate the signals of a given service group to the suitable detection stage.

            "Abstract": "A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), distributed within an area of interest, is a network that contains many wirelessly interconnected devices, with sensing, communication, and processing abilities called sensor nodes. A WSN also comprises of at least one sink node, called base station, which has enhanced energy, computational, and communication resources [1]. Based on the combined use of its constituting elements, a WSN is capable of monitoring the conditions existing at extensive regions of interest [2, 3]. For this reason, the domain of WSNs is considered the basis for Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) and supports a continuously growing range of human activities [4\u201311]. On the other hand, the development of WSNs is obstructed due to both the restricted resources of sensor nodes in energy supply, memory and processing, and the inherent limitations of wireless communications, in terms of power, speed, and capacity of communication channels as well as resistance to interferences and intrusion detection and prevention to preserve data security. Particularly, the most important weakness of WSNs is the extremely restricted energy sufficiency of sensor nodes that reduces their operational time and thus shortens the overall network lifetime [12]. Consequently, the achievement of energy conservation is vital for WSNs to remain operational. This is why all possible causes of energy waste in sensor nodes must be eliminated. Given that, the procedure of wireless communication is by far the most energy consuming task of a sensor node, and numerous research works have been proposed in order to accomplish power \u2026",

The TDMA MAC layer, that mostly overcomes these issues, needs efficient scheduling in order to be employed in ad-hoc networks. At the same time, the current trend for QoS capable applications led to the development of numerous QoS routing schemes, that try to find paths within the network, that fulfill some QoS related limitations. TDMA scheduling schemes can be combined with QoS routing strategies for enhancing performance. However, the efficiency of the scheduling algorithms is closely related to the network topologies. In this paper, we study the problem of routing aware TDMA scheduling for ad-hoc networks, and the effect of the network topologies on it.",

The most important feature of a routing protocol, in order to be efficient for WSNs, is the energy consumption and the extension of the network's lifetime. During the recent years, many energy efficient routing protocols have been proposed for WSNs. In this paper, energy efficient routing protocols are classified into four main schemes: Network Structure, Communication Model, Topology Based and Reliable Routing. The routing protocols belonging to the first category can be further classified as flat or hierarchical. The routing protocols belonging to the second category can be further classified as Query-based or Coherent and non-coherent-based or Negotiation-based. The routing protocols belonging to the third category can be further classified as Location \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Wireless ATM is an emerging network technology that combines the capabilities of ATM with user mobility and undeterred access. Therefore, call admission control is a crucial function in mobile networks. It assists users to move and communicate freely beyond the limits of a specific wireless area, without losing their established connection and at the same time it decides whether an incoming call should-be admitted to network service. Different CAC schemes are proposed and serving users are classified into three categories according to their priority scheme. Our main scope is to design an efficient admission control providing users with the desired QoS. For that reason, a hybrid scheme between the handoff and new calls and the service priorities is proposed.",

Under EDCA, traffic is distinguished into four Access Categories (ACs) that have different priority levels, corresponding to Voice, Video, Best Effort and Background, respectively. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the EDCA in IEEE 802.11s WMNs by simulating pedestrian users moving at low speed for a variety of demanding multimedia applications, such as Real-Time Gaming, video, Voice over IP (VoIP), as well as, web browsing.

Traditional CSMA/CA based media access control does not work well in a multihop scenario, since transmitters are often out of reach of other users' sensing range. Therefore TDMA seems to be a more promising solution. Several algorithms may be found in the literature for scheduling TDMA transmissions for these networks. These algorithms try to determine the optimal scheduling, in order to increase the capacity and reduce the delay for a given network topology. In our previous work, a TDMA scheduling algorithm has been proposed that schedules the transmissions in a fair manner and takes into account the communication requirements of the active flows of the network.

Existing protocols based on symmetric cryptography are very efficient but they are weak against several node impersonation and insider attacks. On the other hand, asymmetric protocols are resilient to such attacks but unfortunately, they are not feasible for sensor networks, even in their most efficient versions (e.g. the elliptic curve (EC) Diffie\u2010Hellman family of key agreement protocols). In this paper, we present two pairwise key establishment protocols for sensor nodes in unattended distributed sensor networks (DSNs). The first protocol is hybrid and it combines asymmetric (elliptic curve (EC)) cryptography with symmetric key techniques. The second protocol is fully asymmetric. Furthermore, through simulations, we measure the efficiency of the proposed protocols in \u2026",

However, since the selection of an access network in such an environment depends on several parameters with different relative importance (such as the network and the application characteristics, the user preferences, the service cost), it is a difficult task to be achieved. In this paper, an effective access network selection algorithm for heterogeneous wireless networks is proposed that combines two Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Total Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method.

The IEEE 802.11 WLAN is the dominant solution for local area wireless networking, as it can provide low cost and easy to deploy high performance wireless connectivity. IEEE has defined two access methods for the 802.11 WLAN: DCF and PCF. Even though the DCF access mode can provide high throughput and low delay for a limited number of users, only the PCF access mode can deliver guaranteed quality of service when the number of users increases. The PCF access mode, as defined by IEEE, cannot operate efficiently when a number of access points with overlapping coverage areas communicate over the same channel. In this paper a new intra access point synchronization scheme is introduced, for allowing multiple access points to cooperate, providing guaranteed quality of service under the PCF operation.",

The extensive analysis of the numerical results shows that the GR strategy integrated with a 2-level distributed databases architecture in 3G networks can achieve a significant reduction of the total cost per call arrival, as well as, a reduction of the call delivery latency, compared to the corresponding costs of the distributed databases without the GR strategy and the GR strategy without distributed databases.",

This concern is not only focused how the interconnection between the various technologies will be achieved, but also how these demanding services will be offered in the consuming public. Charging should be in collaboration with the resource allocation and QoS together with the usage of an interconnection protocol and a database to store the information needed for the charging/pricing as well as the authentication and the authorization of the end user. Pricing/charging depends on two major factors: the resources availability and the technology and economy factors.

In a 5G architecture, an MN can use Massive Multiple Input Multipole Output (MMIMO) antennas to obtain access to increased telecommunication resources. In these environments the need to support service continuity of MNs is a key issue. Therefore, the design of efficient mobility management schemes for 5G infrastructures is needed. In this paper, a novel mobility management scheme for 5G systems is proposed. Whenever the perceived Quality of Service (QoS) becomes less than a predefined threshold, Vertical Handover (VHO) is initiated.

However, the fact that each node has to transmit not only its own traffic, but also traffic on behalf of other nodes, leads to unfairness among the communication rates of the nodes. Traditional Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) based media access control does not work satisfactory in a multihop scenario, since an intended target of a communication may be subject to mutual interference imposed by concurrent transmissions from nodes, which cannot directly sense each other, thus causing unfair throughput allocation. Although Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) seems to be a more promising solution, careful transmission scheduling is needed in order to achieve error-free communication and fairness.

However, the optimal route selection strategy is not always the same with respect to throughput and energy efficiency.

A high-level description helps the developer specify the fault tolerance strategies of the application as a sort of second application layer; this separates functional from fault tolerance aspects of an application, shortening the development cycle and improving maintainability. Integration of this functionality in real embedded applications validates this approach.",

            "Abstract": "Medical broadband applications have attracted increased attention in the recent years. Also, the tremendous growth of wireless technologies has introduced the potential of continuous healthcare monitoring for mobile patients. The bandwidth requirements and the real-time nature of medical applications introduce the need for quality of service (QoS) provisioning in wireless broadband medical networks. Therefore, the use of Differentiated Services in Telemedicine forms a grand challenge. DiffServ may support a number of e-health applications with different traffic requirements, providing at the same time QoS guarantees. Resource Allocation in DiffServ for e-health application is inherently different in many aspects including the offered services, traffic requirements, propagation's characteristics and network structure. This paper presents a novel DiffServ architecture for QoS provisioning in emergency Telemedicine.",

However, the ways to fully make use of these technologies are still being explored, as their potential have not been exploited yet. Underwater archaeological sites, semi (/or fully) submerged settlements, ancient ports and shipwrecks, unlike land sites, are not accessible to public due to their special (sub) marine environment and depth. In this paper, an innovative research idea of using Augmented Reality (AR) for maintaining the memory and the information of underwater archaeological sites, is presented. Although the \u201cartificial\u201d visual documentation cannot replace the authentic values of the underwater tangible heritage, the AR technology can contribute to the protection of the intangible properties and the conquered knowledge of the past of a place. This research work will focus, among other case studies, on the (semi) submerged fortifications and their contiguous contents of the acropolis of Halai in east Lokris, Greece. Hence, along with the climate change that may lead more antiquities covered by water during the following years, the advances in the communication field and the up-coming 5G and cloud technologies will make the idea fully applicable, contributing to the enhancement of the coastal and the underwater archaeological remains.",

Nevertheless, establishing trust in such a distributed environment is very difficult, since it is not straightforward for a node to determine if its peer nodes can be trusted. An additional concern in such an environment is with whether a peer node is merely relaying a message or if it is the originator of the message. In this paper, we propose an authentication approach for protecting nodes in mobile ad hoc networks. The security requirements for protecting data link and network layers are identified and the design criteria for creating secure ad hoc networks using several authentication protocols are analyzed. Protocols based on zero knowledge and challenge response techniques are presented and their performance is evaluated through analysis and simulation.",

Since a long time delay can be harmful for either large or small wireless sensor networks, a TDMA-based scheduling scheme has been proposed, that achieves the reduction of the end-toend delay caused by the sleep mode operation while at the same time it maximizes the energy savings. However, the performance of this system has not been studied with respect to the topology of the network, and taking into consideration node failures. In this paper, we evaluate the TDMA-based energy conservation scheme, and compare it to the S-MAC and the adaptive listening schemes, on various random topologies.

            "Abstract": "Virtual tours using drones enhance the experience the users perceive from a place with cultural interest. Drones equipped with 360o cameras perform real-time video streaming of the cultural sites. The user preferences about each monument type should be considered in order to decide the appropriate flying route for the drone. This article describes a scheme for supporting personalized real-time virtual tours at sites with cultural interest using drones. The user preferences are modeled using the MPEG-21 and the MPEG-7 standards, while Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies are used for metadata structure and semantics. The Metadata-Aware Analytic Network Process (MANP) algorithm is proposed in order to weigh the user preferences for each monument type. Subsequently, the Trapezoidal Fuzzy Topsis for Heritage Route Selection (TFT-HRS) algorithm ranks the candidate heritage routes. Finally, after \u2026",

A probabilistic approach is dedicated to solve the diagnosis problem, detecting malignancy among cases (instances) as derived from fine needle aspirate (FNA) tests, while the second architecture estimates the time interval that possibly contains the right endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) of the patient. The accuracy of the neural classifiers reaches nearly 98% for the diagnosis and 93% for the prognosis problem, while the prognostic recurrence predictions were evaluated using survival analysis through the Kaplan-Meier approximation method. Both architectures were compared with other similar approaches. The robustness and real-time response of the proposed classifiers were further tested over the \u2026",

In recent years, several architectures and models have been proposed in order to limit access to resources and ensure that data are available only to authorized users, programs or processes. These models in most cases are not dynamic and the permissions assigned to users are granted based on a static policy. A mechanism that will allow exception access to data, for example to medical information, in case of an emergency is needed. In current systems, emergency access techniques are not well defined and are used in an ad hoc manner on top of the access control mechanisms implemented without using parameters such as time, location or hierarchy of the actors involved in the system.

Sensor networks are wireless networks consisting of groups of small, inexpensive nodes, which collect and disseminate critical data. Also, sensor nodes have various energy and computational constraints due to their inexpensive nature and ad hoc method of deployment. Considerable research has been focused on overcoming these deficiencies through low-energy consumption schemes. Among other factors, the route selection strategy may have an impact on the sensors lifetime, and following on the network lifetime. In this paper, we study various route selection strategies that aim at prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. Also, a new route selection scheme is proposed, that increases further the network lifetime.

The whole work is mainly concentrated on the study, analysis and performance evaluation of the existing S-MAC protocol. We have concentrated on improving the power consumption of the S-MAC protocol, by using the OLSR routing protocol. The improvement of the S-MAC protocol can increase sensor nodes' lifetime and thus, network connectivity and survivability. The evaluation and test results show that the combination of S-MAC protocol with OLSR consumes less power compared to the rest of the schemes using the routing protocols AODV, DSR and DSDV.",

A novel approach to face detection is presented, which is based on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) specially trained for the identification of faces from skin areas within the image plane, which were previously located using fuzzy logic rules. The performance of the whole system was tested using 137 color image scenes with various illumination conditions containing human faces. The images were taken with a common digital camera, at a resolution of 1280/spl times/960 pixels. The PNN coupled with the fuzzy logic rules become the basis for developing a computer-based face detection system, whose overall identification performance was 85.2%. One limitation of \u2026",
