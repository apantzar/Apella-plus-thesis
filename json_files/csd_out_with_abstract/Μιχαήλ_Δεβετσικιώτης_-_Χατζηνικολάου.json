The proposed scheme can be implemented under various differentiated network frameworks, such as IntServ, DiffServ, and Traffic Engineering with MPLS. The new scheme adjusts the weights of the underlying packet scheduling algorithm, such as weighted round robin or weighted fair queueing, by utilizing the information contained in traffic measurements obtained over successive time windows. Extensive experimental evidence suggests that the proposed scheme exhibits an improved QoS performance for variable traffic loads over classical scheduling algorithms. In addition, the scheme proves robust to the choice of several of its key tuning parameters.",

The architecture and efficient operation of fast power charging stations is becoming a popular research topic both in academia and industry. In this paper, we introduce a candidate EV/PHEV fast power charging station mechanism, based on the combined power resource of current electrical grid and local renewable energy.

We study the optimization problem for band partitioning for high-speed multiservice networks. A two-step optimization approach is presented.

Hence, we believe it is crucial to obtain explicit mathematic models, that are effective in representing system behavior and a basis for performance optimization.

Despite the recent attention on wireless network design, little quantitative work has been done in order to combine purely technical design methods with explicit dependencies on the social or business connectivity and utility concerns. In this paper, we quantify the effect of the socio-technical context through the notion of effective distance, and then use this distance as a parameter in the user utility function. We explore the premise that efficient and targeted resource allocation can be achieved better if the network is aware of the effective distance and the expected quality at the receiver. We demonstrate this for the case of a 802.11e compliant WLAN, where users in the socio-technical context choose to communicate through VoIP. We determine a utility function for VoIP calls in the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "To sustain economic prosperity, global competitiveness, and quality of life, secure, reliable, and affordable energy resources are needed. Electrical energy systems are uniquely critical as they play a key facilitating role across various important industries such as water desalination and distribution, communication, Internet, and health care, and very few sectors would survive without a continuous supply of electricity [1]. In the electric power industry, a new set of challenges have arisen due to the proliferation of disruptive technologies such as renewable energy systems and electric vehicles, and more complex market operations leveraged by consumer participation through smart meters and information technologies. Moreover, growing environmental concerns are forcing utilities to lower peak diesel-fired electricity production. To that end, there is a pressing need to improve grid flexibility to ease system operations and decarbonize electricity sector [2]. Energy storage systems (ESS) have emerged as viable solutions to address the aforementioned issues by providing a \u201cbuffer\u201d zone between supply and demand.Electricity is a commodity that is delivered through power grids that connect bulk electricity suppliers to geographically dispersed customers, and several grid-related services must be simultaneously carried out by a wide range of technologies. In legacy power grids, supply and demand must match in real time, with tight control on the supply side, and traditionally in a demand-following fashion. Moreover, operational rules are set by off-line analyses and manual interventions are made after contingency events based on incomplete \u2026",

Controlling the sleep/awake of sensors is one simple way to reduce their energy consumption. However, this causes a network connectivity degradation by varying network connection topology. For this reason, we propose a simple and autonomous sensor sleep/awake method to achieve their balance. The size of clusters can be a metric to measure network connectivity in that a path exists among any cluster node. From percolation theory, we observe that a cluster size suffers a sharp transition based on edge connection patterns. This allows us to design a sensor sleep/awake algorithm which has an immense simplicity, but still requires global topology information. In many cases, sensors are not aware of the global \u2026",

In the network layer of intermediate nodes of such networks, a priority scheduler arbitrates the transmission between forwarding traffic and the node\u2019s own locally produced traffic. Meanwhile, a new QoS-aware Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) of 802.11 e provides differentiated access at the MAC layer. Therefore, how to control priority forwarding in a cross-layer fashion, namely, by combining scheduling at the network layer with EDCA differentiated access at the MAC layer in order to achieve the best channel utilization is an important design issue. Due to the numerous control variables potentially involved from both layers, analytical modeling is not feasible. Instead of using a simulation model to predict some points of the utilization response surface, we propose to utilize a metamodel (used more frequently in other disciplines such as operations research) in order to approximate the complete response surface by fitting regression analysis over a large amount of simulation results. The resulting metamodel allows us to establish and quantify the cross-layer effects through specific interaction items and can serve for the purpose of cross-layer optimization.",

While determining the QoS for end-to-end paths in a network under self-similar traffic models is difficult, end-to-end network performance analysis is still essential in providing QoS to networks such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. The Fast Importance Sampling based Traffic Engineering (FISTE) approach proposed in this article is a prediction-based approach that maps the ingress traffic levels of a network to the QoS of end-to-end path(s) in the network. Because FISTE is a hybrid of simulation analysis and closed-form analysis, it can treat a complex network as a black box. When we combined Simulated Annealing (SA) with FISTE, the resulting approach can provide a traffic engineering solution so that multiple end-to-end QoS requirements are satisfied while the \u2026",

Finally, we conduct simulations with HTTP traffic models to study the impact of different initial RTO values on the transfer delay of Web objects. The experiments show that average transfer delay can be impacted by as much 70% on bottleneck links with loss rates above 6%. Further, TCP flows with timer granularity below 100 ms or round trip times (RTT) below 250 ms can suffer similar performance degradation.

To optimize IS parameters in such an environment, we propose using Simulated Annealing (SA) to directly minimize the variance of IS estimators.

            "Abstract": "The proliferation of multiplay services is creating design dilemmas for service providers, related to where certain key networking functionality should be placed. For example, service providers need to know whether to distribute more network intelligence closer to the subscriber or cluster it in a central location. In view of this, we quantify the cost differences among service provider architectures, identified based on the functionality distribution (centralized vs. distributed, clustered vs. unclustered and single vs. multi edge). For this purpose, we formulate a modular mixed-integer programming model based on a set of close-to-real-case scenarios. Given the complexity of such problems, we propose methodologies that can reduce the number of locations. Our results indicate that distributing the IP intelligence and the video replication is preferable. Moreover, deploying edge systems with faster backplane has little benefit in \u2026",

All currently used public key algorithms would be deemed insecure in a post-quantum (PQ) setting. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a process to standardize quantum-resistant crypto algorithms, focusing primarily on their security guarantees. Since PQ algorithms present significant differences over classical ones, their overall evaluation should not be performed out-of-context. This work presents a detailed performance evaluation of the NIST signature algorithm candidates and investigates the imposed latency on TLS 1.3 connection establishment under realistic network conditions. In addition, we investigate their impact on TLS session throughput and analyze the trade-off between lengthy PQ signatures and computationally heavy PQ cryptographic operations. Our results demonstrate that the adoption of at least two PQ signature algorithms would be viable with little additional overhead over current signature algorithms. Also, we argue that many NIST PQ candidates can effectively be used for less timesensitive applications, and provide an in-depth discussion on the integration of PQ authentication in encrypted tunneling protocols, along with the related challenges, improvements, and alternatives. Finally, we propose and evaluate the combination of different PQ signature algorithms across the same certificate chain in TLS. Results show a reduction of the \u2026",

Each time when the battery is charged at high rates, it incurs a significant degradation cost that shortens the battery life. Furthermore, the differences between demand preferences, battery types, and charging technologies make the operation of the charging stations a complex problem. Even though some of these issues have been addressed in the literature, the charging station modeling with battery models and different customer preferences have been neglected. To that end, this paper proposes two queueing-based optimization frameworks.

To maintain the fairness to all users, it is assumed that each message in the buffer is transmitted independently, that is, a user has to release the reserved slot after finishing the transmission of the message even if it has other messages waiting in the buffer. It is straightforward to extend the analysis to R-ALOHA systems with infinite buffer capacity. The accuracy of the analysis is verified by simulation.",

The problem of bandwidth allocation is further intensified when the requested bandwidth exceeds the available unused bandwidth and so not all requests can be completely served. Connection preemption provides available and reliable services to high-priority connections when a network is heavily loaded and connection request arrival patterns are unknown, or when the network experiences link or node failures.

With the proliferation of Voice over IP (VoIP), entertainment video, triple play services and towards the evolution of the future Internet, an exorbitant demand for wireless broadband technologies has been created. However, little effort has been devoted to how users should be charged both from the economic interest of the provider but also from the way that a WiMAX network is designed. In this chapter we discuss the use of economics and pricing in the design of a WiMAX network. Our initial focus shall be on whether the investment of building a WiMAX network is profitable or not, using terms such as Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), Operational Expenditure (OPEX), Net Present Value (NPV) and identifying who shall pay for the extra charges. Another major issue is the role of pricing in Quality of Service (QoS), congestion control and provisioning of a network (DaSilva, 2000). This provides insight into why prices for network services are not only a marketing and strategic decision but also an engineering concern. Moreover, the users\u2019 preferences need to be captured as well as their sensitivity when changes tend to happen in the form of a utility function, so as to compose the network utility maximization problem or that equilibrium that will satisfy all of the entities in a multitopology scenario.In the following we also study ways to build WiMAX networks from an economic perspective and describe the role of pricing in bandwidth allocation.

The model is based on a pricing scheme for the offered services and also takes into consideration the quality of service requirements of each service class through a probabilistic delay-bound constraint. The proposed policy is dynamic in nature and relies on online measurements of the incoming traffic for adjusting the class allocations. We illustrate its performance and its robustness to various tuning parameters through an extensive simulation study that considers various simulation scenarios including experiments based on real network traces.",

Current protection schemes increasingly utilize cognitive methods to proactively modify their actions according to extreme power system changes. However, the effectiveness and robustness of these information-driven solutions rely entirely on the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of the data and control signals exchanged on the underlying relay communication networks. In this paper, we outline a scalable adaptive protection platform for distribution systems, and introduce a novel blockchain-based distributed network architecture to enhance data exchange security among the smart grid protection relays.

We consider two components of the smart grid; the power distribution network and the data communication network.

The algorithm is scalable for deployment in large networks since it requires only O(N) messages per network user per iteration, where N is the number of users. Moreover, it is guaranteed to converge, does not require revelation of private information from each user and all algorithm actions can be realized by programmable smart devices of the smart grid.",

The communication and power components of the grid should not be studied in isolation and we suggest a model where the communication delays are integrated in an electricity market pricing model such that the power demand affects the allocation of communication resources and vice versa. Power demand could be monitored and predicted via smart meters that would allow a dynamic pricing scheme.

In this paper, we introduce a game theoretic based decentralized control mechanism to alleviate negative impacts from the EV demand. The proposed mechanism takes into consideration the non-uniform spatial distribution of EVs that induces uneven power demand at each charging facility, and aims to:(i) avoid straining grid resources by offering price incentives so that customers accept being routed to less busy stations,(ii) maximize total revenue by serving more customers with the same amount of grid resources, and (iii) provide charging service \u2026",

Guaranteeing QoS to incoming requests means that users explicitly specify certain requirements such as throughput, loss or delay. It also means that the provider needs to be prepared to compensate for transient outages or overloads and re-allocate resources according to priorities. Dynamic bandwidth allocation can be used to assure that high priority requests can be always routed through relatively favorable paths within a differentiated services environment.

Previous work on such schemes has shown that window size calculations, based on utility-driven and game-theoretic objective functions, lead to better performance in overall throughput. We observe that packet losses are good indicators of network congestion. We utilize the trend in packet losses to propose a predictive utility-based scheme working under imperfect network information. In our work, we record the packet loss observed in the current and previous transmission slots to predict the expected packet loss for the next interval. We then use a simple utility-based scheme to calculate the best window size for the next interval that minimizes the packet loss and maximizes the net utility.",

Towards providing an energy efficient solution an UAV-supported multi-level architecture is employed where user equipments (UEs) are grouped together in clusters. Initially, the UEs choose their role (clusterhead (ch) or cluster member) in the network independently and in a distributed fashion, following the theory of Minority Games (MG), while subsequently the member UEs act as stochastic learning automata selecting a clusterhead to be associated with, based on reinforcement learning. Upon completion of the cluster formation, the UAV optimal positioning in an Euclidean 3D space is obtained by treating a maximization problem of the clusterhead's energy availability, being the UEs that play a critical role within the PSN.

Until now, the application possibility has been studied in Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs). In the research, `contacts' are important In the sense of supporting content delivery chances. For energy-saving, mobile devices can utilize a sleep/awake control in that their energy is constrained due to battery operations. This reminds us that the contact-based MANET research is not enough because the information delivery opportunities are limited to contacts among awake devices.

            "Abstract": "Range anxiety has been a big concern for electric vehicles (EVs) on the road. Moreover, it is inconvenient for EVs to spend a long time charging while driving on the highway. Wireless charging represent a potential breakthrough to alleviate the range anxiety and provides convenient service to EVs. Since the capacity for charging EVs on the highway is limited, it is crucial to control the EVs properly in order to avoid congestion and to provide good quality of service (QoS). On one hand, based on the physical motion of an EV, the velocity is a main factor for the EV's energy consumption while driving. The high velocity causes a larger energy consumption, which results in a longer charging duration. And each time an EV charges its battery, it incurs some battery degradation cost. On the another hand, the vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication on the highway is necessary to provide the communication among EVs \u2026",

To maintain the fairness to all users, it is assumed that each message in the buffer is transmitted independently that is, a user has to release the reserved slot after finishing the transmission of a message even if it has more messages waiting in the buffer.

Our motivation is to use these algorithms in the data plane of \u201cself-sizing\u201d frameworks, and make use of their output in taking control plane decisions either locally or globally, in an on-line fashion. Previously, no such comprehensive comparison of relevant methods has been carried out, especially from a combined accuracy versus implementation complexity point of view. Due to the dynamic characteristics of the algorithms, we encounter the choice of time resolution, ie, measurement time scale and window. After numerous simulations, we gain insight on the critical effect of these choices on the performance of the algorithms. We deduce that the time scale parameter itself can be determined dynamically so that measurement-based algorithms perform successfully independent from the varying traffic conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach over the static one.",

The basic requirements of a system that can provide the aforementioned services are energy efficiency, scalability, lower costs, wide reception range, high localization accuracy and availability. Different technologies such as WiFi, UWB, RFID have been leveraged to provide LBS and Proximity Based Services (PBS), however they do not meet the aforementioned requirements. Apple's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based iBeacon solution primarily intends to provide Proximity Based Services (PBS). However, it suffers from poor proximity detection accuracy due to its reliance on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) that is prone to multipath fading and drastic fluctuations in the indoor environment. Therefore, in this paper, we present our iBeacon based accurate proximity and indoor localization system. Our two algorithms Server-Side Running Average (SRA) and Server-Side Kalman Filter (SKF) improve the proximity detection accuracy of iBeacons by 29% and 32% respectively, when compared with Apple's current moving average based approach. We also present our novel cascaded Kalman Filter-Particle Filter (KFPF) algorithm for indoor localization. Our cascaded filter approach uses a Kalman Filter (KF) to reduce the RSSI fluctuation and then inputs the filtered RSSI values into a Particle Filter (PF) to improve the accuracy of indoor localization. Our experimental results, obtained through experiments in a space replicating real-world scenario, show that our cascaded filter approach outperforms the use of only \u2026",

It is a challenging issue to provide guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for network applications while still obtaining high network utilization.

Challenges in Service-Oriented Networking.(Under the direction of Dr. Michael Devetsikiotis and Dr. Yannis Viniotis).Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) are an emerging paradigm in IT which structures the allocation of computing resources such that they are aligned with core business processes. The core entity within an SOA is a service, which is a componentized module with standard interfaces that represents a reusable business function. An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) represents the backplane for the SOA, providing the structure for communication, integration, management, and interaction of the service components. Service-Oriented Networking (SON) is an emerging architecture in which the primary goal is to gain a greater overall efficiency in IT infrastructures by providing intelligent functionality in the network that was previously unavailable or impractical to implement. By enabling network devices to operate at the application layer, vast gains in overall performance and efficiency can be obtained with features such as hardware-based acceleration, offloading, and content based routing. The strategic physical positioning of this functionality in the network emphasizes the requirements of an SON-enabled device, which we refer to as a Network Service Intermediary (NSI), to be scalable and efficient. In this report, we discuss research trends in application-aware networks and investigate the historical progression of information technology infrastructures in order to motivate the need for SON and SOA.

            "Abstract": "Performance evaluation of the upcoming 802.11e QoS-aware enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) in WLANs has drawn extensive attention. The foundations for most of the studies are three major performance models in legacy distributed coordination function (DCF) analysis. In this paper, we first expose the common guiding principle behind these three seemingly different models. Subsequently, we propose a new unified performance model and analysis method to study the saturation throughput and delay performance of EDCA, under the assumption of a finite number of users and ideal channel conditions in a single-hop WLAN. This unified model is easy to understand and apply and helps increase the understanding of the existing performance analysis. In addition to its appealing simplicity, our unified model and analysis are validated well by simulation results. And ultimately, by means of the proposed \u2026",

While detailed planning and performance evaluation of such systems are crucial due to high cost and long life expectancy, most existing works assume a perfect communication environment. In this paper, we introduce a joint capacity model that takes into account both power and communication resources for WCH construction planning, and optimal day-to-day operation. The vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and grid power capacities, along with the EV\u2019s average service rate are formulated following technology requirements, EV speed-density characteristics, and the EV\u2019s energy needs and consumption. In addition, a two-dimension Markov chain-based model is designed to capture the WCH power and connectivity dynamics \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Charging station location decisions are a critical element in mainstream adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The consumer confidence in EVs can be boosted with the deployment of carefully-planned charging infrastructure that can fuel a fair number of trips. The charging station (CS) location problem is complex and differs considerably from the classical facility location literature, as the decision parameters are additionally linked to a relatively longer charging period, battery parameters, and available grid resources. In this study, we propose a three-layered system model of fast charging stations (FCSs). In the first layer, we solve the flow capturing location problem to identify the locations of the charging stations. In the second layer, we use a queuing model and introduce a resource allocation framework to optimally provision the limited grid resources. In the third layer, we consider the battery charging dynamics and develop a station policy to maximize the profit by setting maximum charging levels. The model is evaluated on the Arizona state highway system and North Dakota state network with a gravity data model, and on the City of Raleigh, North Carolina, using real traffic data. The results show that the proposed hierarchical model improves the system performance, as well as the quality of service (QoS), provided to the customers. The proposed model can efficiently assist city planners for CS location selection and system design. View Full-Text",

We use numerous evaluation criteria, including network, economic, and social efficiency, as well as their suitability in using pricing as a means for congestion control. Some of the schemes are based on best-effort networks, and are thus unable to provide the user with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Others build on networks with connection admission control functions and are thus able to provide individual QoS guarantees. We particularly investigate the relevant time frame over which pricing schemes are assumed to operate.

            "Abstract": "To facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and their plug-in hybrid (PHEVs) counterparts and to avoid straining the capacity of the power grid there is a strong need for developing a network of fast charging facilities and coordinate their service. Incorporation of EVs in the vehicle fleet would decrease green house gas emissions and overall dependency on fossil fuels. A key issue in charging EVs is that the corresponding time is fairly large, which can lead to very long delays. Hence, for the network of charging stations to provide good quality of service to customers, we first propose an admission control mechanism based on pricing for a single charging station. Subsequently, we develop a decentralized routing scheme of EV drivers, employing a game theoretic model. The latter entices drivers through price incentives to require charging from less busy stations, thus leading to a more efficient utilization of \u2026",

In this paper we shed light on the operation of distributed local Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes by decomposing them based on their logical functions and by studying them as a combination of a measurement module and a control module. We also exploit the presence of strong correlation in network traffic in order to formulate a generalized Predictive AQM (PAQM) scheme.

It suffers from poor proximity detection accuracy due to its reliance on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). To improve proximity detection accuracy of iBeacons, we present two algorithms that address the inherent flaws in iBeacon's current proximity detection approach.

We derive properties of the EEB which capture its behavior in the parameter space and we contrast these properties with the ones obtained for analytical effective bandwidths.

As a result, cloud vendors have lately increased, along with the estimated annual revenue they share. However, in the process of selecting a provider's cloud service over the competition, we observe a lack of universal common ground in terms of terminology, functionality of services and billing models. This is an important gap especially under the new reality of the industry where each cloud provider has moved towards his own service taxonomy, while the number of specialized services has grown exponentially. This work discusses cloud services offered by four dominant, in terms of their current market share, cloud vendors. We provide a taxonomy of their services and sub-services that designates major service families namely computing, storage, databases, analytics, data pipelines, machine learning, and networking. The aim of such clustering is to indicate similarities, common design approaches and functional differences of the offered services. The outcomes are essential both for individual researchers, and bigger enterprises in their attempt to identify the set of cloud services that will utterly meet their needs without compromises. While we acknowledge the fact that this is a dynamic industry, where new services arise constantly, and old ones experience important updates, this study paints a solid image of the current offerings and gives prominence to the directions that cloud service providers are following.",
