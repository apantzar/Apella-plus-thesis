The problem is stated as a hierarchical scheduling problem. Two different optimization algorithms, which are based on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), are defined. The proposed optimization algorithms are independent on the target architecture and can be adapted to take into account it. Experimental results obtained from the application of the proposed algorithms in various widely used DSP transformations, like Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), show that significant switching activity savings in data and address buses can be achieved, resulting in corresponding power savings. In addition, the differences between the two proposed methods are underlined, providing envisage for their suitable selection for implementation, in particular transformational algorithms and architectures.",

Our implementations are optimized in terms of throughput and memory requirements, in accordance with the specifications of each one of the three computation schedules and the lifting decomposition.

These transformations basically align the data production and consumption between the different procedures of the initial specification thus reducing the memory size requirements of the system's realizations especially those in the interfaces between different processors.

As a result, to facilitate the incorporation of the new standard in such designs, we present experimental and theoretical results for the data-related cache misses that occur during the DWT, since it has been shown that these comprise the main bottleneck in this type of application.

In these applications data transfer and storage consume a large part of the system energy. Exploiting data reuse can introduce significant power savings, but also introduces extra requirement for on-chip memory. To aid data reuse design exploration, we present a optimization approach to achieve a power-optimal design satisfying area constraints in a targeted reconfigurable platform. The data reuse exploration problem is mathematically formulated and shown to be equivalent to a Multiple-Choice Knapsack problem. The solution to this problem corresponds to the decision of which arrays to be introduced where in order to minimize power consumption for a fixed on-chip memory size. We also present an experimentally verified power model, capable of providing the relative power information between different data reuse options, resulting in a fast and efficient design space exploration. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach enables us to find the most power efficient design for each benchmark.",

The FPGA hardware has been developed in Handel-C and uses the Celoxica Floating Point Library functions to perform both double and single precision arithmetic. A set of translation and optimization steps have been applied to transform a sequential C description of the LINPACK benchmark, based on a monolithic memory model, into a parallel Handel-C description that utilizes the plurality of memory resources available on a realistic reconfigurable computing platform. These transformations allow high levels of parallelism to be exploited within a limited memory bandwidth. The experimental results show that the latest generation of FPGAs, programmed using Handel-C, can achieve a sustained double precision floating point performance up to 6.8 times greater than the microprocessor while operating at a clock frequency that is 30 times lower.",

Buffering frequently accessed data in on-chip memories can reduce off-chip memory accesses and open avenues for parallelization. However, the exploitation of both data reuse and parallelization is limited by the memory resources available on-chip. As a result, considering these two problems separately, e.g., first exploring data reuse and then exploring data-level parallelization, based on the data-reuse options determined in the first step, may not yield the performance-optimal designs for limited on-chip memory resources. We consider both problems at the same time, exposing the dependence between the two. We show that this combined problem can \u2026",

Specific aspects that are highlighted in this manuscript are: a) the in-nerworkings of the HercuLeS hardware compilation engine, b) manipulation of SSA (Static Single Assignment) form, c) automatic third-party IP integration, d) backend C code generation for compiled simulation, and e) an exemplary case of DSE.

Realisations of the wavelet transform according to the considered schedules have been developed. They are parameterised with respect to filter pair, image size and number of decomposition levels.

            "Abstract": "The ability to compile software into an efficient, synthesisable hardware description can dramatically reduce the design times for embedded systems that require the acceleration offered by hardware coprocessors. Most hardware compilers apply loop pipelining to increase the parallelism achieved, but pipelining is restricted to the only innermost level in a nested loop. Methods have been developed for software compilers that extend loop pipelining to levels above the innermost loop but they have yet to be extended for hardware.In this work we extend and adapt an existing outer loop pipelining approach known as Single Dimension Software Pipelining to generate schedules for FPGA hardware coprocessors. Each loop level in four test loops is pipelined and the resulting schedules are implemented in VHDL and targeted to an Altera Stratix II FPGA. The results show that the fastest solution for each loop occurs when pipelining is applied one or two levels above the innermost loop. Across the four test loops we achieve an acceleration over the innermost loop solution of between 1.15 and 7 times, with a mean speedup of 2.56 times. The results suggest that inclusion of outer loop pipelining in future hardware compilers may be worthwhile as it can allow significantly improved results to be achieved at the cost of a small increase in compile time.",

            "Abstract": "Current VLSI technology allows the design of sophisticated digital systems with escalated demands in performance and power/energy consumption. The annual increase of chip complexity is 58%, while human designers productivity increase is limited to 21% per annum (ITRS, 2011). The growing technology-productivity gap is probably the most important problem in the industrial development of innovative products. A dramatic increase in designer productivity is only possible through the adoption of methodologies/tools that raise the design abstraction level, ingeniously hiding low-level, time-consuming, error-prone details. New EDA methodologies aim to generate digital designs from high-level descriptions, a process called High-Level Synthesis (HLS)(Coussy & Morawiec, 2008) or else hardware compilation (Wirth, 1998). The input to this process is an algorithmic description (for example in C/C++/SystemC) generating synthesizable and verifiable Verilog/VHDL designs (IEEE, 2006; 2009).Our aim is to highlight aspects regarding the organization and design of the targeted hardware of such process. In this chapter, it is argued that a proper Model of Computation (MoC) for the targeted hardware is an adapted and extended form of the FSMD (Finite-State Machine with Datapath) model which is universal, well-defined and suitable for either data-or control-dominated applications. Several design examples will be presented throughout the chapter that illustrate our approach.",

In these applications, data transfer and storage consume a large proportion of the system energy.

To aid data-reuse design exploration early during the design cycle, the authors present an optimisation approach to achieve a power-optimal design satisfying an on-chip memory constraint in a targeted FPGA-based platform. The data-reuse exploration problem is mathematically formulated and shown to be equivalent to the multiple-choice knapsack problem. The solution to this problem for an application code corresponds to the decision of which array references are to be buffered on-chip and where loading reused data of the array references into on-chip memory happen in \u2026",

In this paper FPGAs are compared to a high end microprocessor with respect to sustained performance for a popular floating point CPU performance benchmark, namely LINPACK 1000. A set of translation and optimization steps have been applied to transform a sequential C description of the LINPACK benchmark, based on a monolithic memory model, into a parallel Handel-C description that utilizes the plurality of memory resources available on a realistic reconfigurable computing platform. The experimental results show that the latest generation of FPGAs, programmed using Handel-C, can achieve a sustained floating point performance up to 6 times greater than the microprocessor while operating at a clock \u2026",

However, one of the main obstacles to overcome when trying to accelerate an application on an FPGA is the bottleneck in off-chip communication, typically to large memories. Often it is known at compile-time that the same data item is accessed many times, and as a result can be loaded once from large off-chip RAM onto scarce on-chip RAM, alleviating this bottleneck. This paper addresses how to automatically derive an address mapping that reduces the size of the required on-chip memory for a given memory access pattern.

A lightweight typed assembly language, N-Address Code (NAC), is used as a designer-friendly representation of FSMDs, simplifying the adaptation of hardware synthesis with existing frontends.The quality (computation time, chip area) of the generated FSMDs has been evaluated on modern FPGAs. Our approach overcomes the C code limitations of four HLS tools while maintaining a good speed/area balance.",

            "Abstract": "Most hardware compilers apply loop pipelining to increase the parallelism achieved, but pipelining is restricted to the only innermost level in a nested loop. In this work we extend and adapt an existing outer loop pipelining approach known as single dimension software pipelining to generate schedules for field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) hardware coprocessors. Each loop level in nine test loops is pipelined and the resulting schedules are implemented in VHDL and targeted to an Altera Stratix II FPGA. The results show that the fastest solution for all but one of the loops occurs when pipelining is applied one to three levels above the innermost loop. Across the nine test loops we achieve an acceleration over the innermost loop solution of up to seven times, with a mean speedup of 3.2 times. The results suggest that inclusion of outer loop pipelining in future hardware compilers may be worthwhile as it can allow \u2026",

Analytical parameterized equations for the prediction of data-cache misses under general realistic assumptions are proposed.

In this paper, the row-column, the line-based and the block-based schedules for the 2D DWT computation are compared with respect to their execution time on a very long instruction word (VLIW) digital signal processor (DSP). Implementations of the wavelet transform according to the considered schedules have been developed. They are parameterized with respect to filter pair, image size, and number of decomposition levels. All implementations have been mapped on a VLIW DSP. Performance metrics for the implementations for a complete set of parameters have been obtained and compared. The experimental results show that each implementation performs better for different points of the parameter space",

Simple and efficient heuristics for the instruction-level scheduling and assignment steps are described. These steps are crucial sub-steps of the custom processor synthesis stage of the system level design meta-flow proposed in chapter 2. The proposed heuristics exploit the inherent independence of the sum-of-products computations to formulate the synthesis tasks using the concept of the Traveling Salesman\u2019s Problem. In this way the synthesis tasks can be solved very efficiently. Different partly static cost functions are proposed to drive the synthesis tasks.

These optimisation techniques hold for all algorithms, including sum-of-products computations between input data and coefficients, which is a very broad category of DSP algorithms. Power savings are obtained through the reduction of switching activity in both (input and coefficient) data and address buses of the hardware architecture implementing the algorithm. The reduction of switching activity is obtained by means of a shuffling of the sequence, in which the partial products required by the sum-of-products computations are executed. The optimisation problems are formulated as travelling salesman problem (TSP) instances, which is a well known NP-complete problem. The cost function that drives the optimisation process takes explicitly into consideration addressing-related issues \u2026",

Detailed implementation results (performance, code size, and FPGA resources utilization) are presented. The main goal of the design case presented is to provide insight into the design aspects of a complex system based on FPGAs. The results prove that an implementation based on microprocessors and FPGAs is adequate for the access point part of the system where the expected volumes are rather small.
