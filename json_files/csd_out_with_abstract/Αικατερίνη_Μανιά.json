The basic premise is that an individual's prior experience will influence how one perceives, comprehends and remembers information in a scene. 120 participants across two conditions of varying rendering quality of a space including varied ratios of objects' association to the scene context, are being exposed to the VE and complete an object-based memory recognition task. The results of this study could have significant implications while identifying areas of an interactive computer graphics scene that require varying quality of rendering.",

However, the degree to which an object will be consistent with a scene is likely to depend on whether the perception of the scene is itself consistent with our previous experience. Thus, for example, if a familiar scene is presented in an unfamiliar manner, the effect of object consistency on memory is likely to change. We wished to see whether this kind of effect can be used to investigate the degree to which a virtual environment (VE) is perceived as \u201cnormal\u201d, ie consistent with our usual experience of similar environments, or \u201cabnormal\u201d, ie markedly different from our previous experience.

The basic assumption is that an individual's prior experience will influence how he or she perceives, comprehends, and remembers new information in a scene. Schemas are knowledge structures; a scene could incorporate objects that fit into a specific context or schema (e.g., an academic's office) referred to as  consistent  objects. A scene could also include objects that are not related to the schema in place referred to as  inconsistent  objects.

Intuitively, the projected models can also be imported into a graphical user interface which provides trainees with advanced 3D transformation tools. These tools offer not only a mere visualization but an interactive understanding of the solid object and the underlying geometric transformations. Students often find it difficult to visualize a 3D model based on the standard views of the respective mechanical drawing.

The growing          number of VE training applications which target a high level of simulation fidelity, mainly for transfer of training in the real world, have made it crucial to examine the manner in which these particular          implementations and designs are evaluated. The methodology presented in this study focuses on real versus simulated virtual worlds, comparing participants' level of presence, task performance, and cognition          state employed to complete a memory task.

Such tangible interactions are based on the integration of a 3DOF orientation tracker and information sensors with a'Kromstaf'rapid prototype replica to provide tactile feedback. The multimodal interface allows the user to manipulate the object via physical gestures which, during evaluation, establish a profound level of virtual object presence and user satisfaction. If a user cannot manipulate the virtual object effectively many application specific tasks cannot be performed. This paper assesses the usability of the multimodal interface by comparing it with two input devices--the Magellan SpaceMouse, and a'black box', which contains the same electronics as the multimodal interface but without the tactile feedback offered by the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The use of different media from photography to virtual reality may provide a user with an extraordinary tool for appreciation and exploration of artistic heritage. This is especially important in case when direct perceptual experience is denied by distance to museums or prohibition of manipulating exhibits, and in case when a specific media may provide a user with extra functionalities. The use of a specific media such as virtual reality is very important in case of time-spatial work-of-art where the problem of functionalities presentation becomes much more demanding. The goal of the presented work is to contribute in assessing the role of different visualization technologies in work-of-art reproduction focusing on the use of virtual reality and stereoscopic viewing. Our main testing application reproduces a time-spatial work-of-art which contains multi-level mirror reflections and where gravity is also accounted for in the physical simulation. This application has been chosen because it inherently calls for user interaction, which challenges reproduction fidelity and real-time response. The resulting visual reproduction is analyzed for different display technologies and stereo viewing approaches. Results from sets of test trials ran on five different virtual reality systems, from 3D Laptop to Head Mounted Display and large Panorama, confirmed benefits of stereo viewing and emphasized few aspects which represent a base for further investigation as well as a guide when designing specific systems for telepresence related to virtual museum applications and interactive space installations.",

            "Abstract": "It is increasingly important to provide fidelity mecrics for rendered images and interactive virtual environments (VEs) targeting transfer of training in real-world task situations. Computational metrics which aim to predict the degree of fidelity of a rendered image can be based on psychophysical observations. For interactive simulations, psychophysical investigations can be carried out into the degree of similarity between the original and a synthetic simulation. Psychophysics comprises a collection of methods used to conduct non-invasive experiments on humans, the purpose of which is to study mappings between events in an environment and levels of sensory responses to those events. This tutorial will present the techniques and principles towards conducting psychophysical studies, for assessing image quality as well as fidelity of a VE simulation and how results from such studies contribute to VE system design as well as to computational image quality metrics. Methods based on experiments for measuring the perceptual equivalence between a real scene and a computer simulation of the same scene will be reported. These methods are presented through the study of human vision and include using photorealistic computer graphics to depict complex environments and works of art. In addition, physical and psychophysical fidelity issues in the assessment of virtual environments will be emphasised. Specifications for correct matching between the psychophysical characteristics of the displays and the human users\u2019 sensory and motor systems will he discussed as well as some examples of the consequences when systems fail to be physically well \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Successfully predicting visual attention can significantly improve many aspects of computer graphics: scene design, interactivity and rendering. Most previous attention models are mainly based on low-level image features, and fail to take into account high-level factors such as scene context, topology, or task. Low-level saliency has previously been combined with task maps, but only for predetermined tasks. Thus, the application of these methods to graphics (e.g., for selective rendering) has not achieved its full potential. In this article, we present the first automated high-level saliency predictor incorporating two hypotheses from perception and cognitive science that can be adapted to different tasks. The first states that a scene is comprised of objects expected to be found in a specific context as well objects out of context which are salient (scene schemata) while the other claims that viewer\u2019s attention is captured by \u2026",

This paper presents a real-time synthetic lighting system incorporating sophisticated global illumination algorithms aiming to induce similar subjective lighting impressions as in the real world. The lighting system proposed is designed to render an interactive VE on an fMRI display, enabling the conduct of formal neuroscientific experiments and investigating the effects of visual fidelity as well as varied lighting configurations on feelings of presence,\u2018reality\u2019and comfort. Ultimately, the goal is to use this system to explore the effect of lighting variations (daylight vs. forms of artificial light) on subjective impressions of a group of patients suffering from the \u2018depersonalization\u2019syndrome. The system was developed in close collaboration with the Brighton and Sussex Medical School in the UK. It was a challenge to develop an interactive lighting system to be utilized for fMRI experimentation due to infrastructural and technical demands. Such demands were based on acquiring user input when immersed in the constrained environment of an fMRI scanner while the system reacts to it in real-time. fMRI experiments usually employ simple display material, for example using photographs, video clips or simple computerized stimuli. Employing VEs in fMRI has the advantage that it is possible to involve participants in interactive animated environments which more realistically reflect social and emotional situations.",

That may lead to isolation, low self-esteem and even depression. Music is shown to significantly help children maintain focused attention as well as offer a timed structure around their actions, involving melody and tempo. Music can also aid the development of cognitive ability, self-confidence and promote limits and rules. Through music, children can learn how to control their impulsivity, learn to pause and wait for their turn and apply such social skills to their every-day life. This paper presents a multimodal 3D serious game named \u201cADDventurous Rhythmical Planet\u201d.

Instead of the traditional static images or text presented by mobile, location-aware tourist guides, the main focus is to seamlessly and transparently superimpose geo-located 3D reconstructions of historical buildings, in their past state, onto the real world, while users hold their consumer grade mobile phones walking on-site, without markers placed onto the buildings, offering a Mobile Augmented Reality experience. we feature three monuments; eg, the \u2018GialiTzamisi\u2019, an Ottoman mosque; part of the south side of a Byzantine Wall and the \u2018Saint Rocco\u2019Venetian chapel. Advances in mobile technology have brought AR to the public by utilizing the camera, GPS and inertial sensors present in modern smart phones. Technical challenges such as accurate registration of 3D and real world, in outdoors settings, have prevented AR becoming main stream. We tested commercial AR frameworks and built a mobile AR app which offers users, while visiting these monuments in the challenging outdoors environment, a virtual reconstruction displaying the monument in its past state superimposed onto the real world. Position tracking is based on the mobile phone\u2019s GPS and inertial sensors. The users explore interest areas and unlock historical information, earning points. By combining AR technologies with locationaware, gamified and social aspects, we enhance interaction with cultural heritage sites.",

User fixations are a fast and natural input method for VR/MR interaction. Previously, eye tracking in mobile VR suffered from low accuracy, long processing time, and the need for hardware add-ons such as anti-reflective lens coating and infrared emitters. We present an innovative mobile VR eye tracking methodology utilizing only the eye images from the front-facing (selfie) camera through the headset\u2019s lens, without any modifications. Our system first enhances the low-contrast, poorly lit eye images by applying a pipeline of customised low-level image enhancements suppressing obtrusive lens reflections. We then propose an iris region-of-interest detection algorithm that is run only once. This increases the iris tracking speed by reducing the iris \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The utility of Virtual Environment (VE) technologies for training systems is predicated upon the accuracy of the mental representation formed of the VE. It is therefore important to benchmark the use of these environments through the application of appropriate memory tests. In addition to measuring accuracy, a consideration for such tests is the quality of the memories being reported: Are these vivid memories where the person can mentally visualize the environment? Or are responses based on a strong feeling that happens to be correct? This chapter reviews what is currently known about these more subjective aspects of memories in respect to visualizations of immersive VEs. Current understanding about judgements of \u2018remembering\u2019and \u2018knowing\u2019will be summarised from the psychological literature. This will be related to recent attempts to measure these awareness states in VEs, and the consequences of these efforts. An information-processing approach is taken, interpreting the relationship between these experiences and potential in\ufb02uencing variables. As well as highlighting the importance of measuring the subjective component of memorial experience, a brief descriptive model is proposed to aid considerations of these issues in the design and implementation of such visualizations, and future research.",

Previous research shows that manipulating disparity can alleviate some of the discomfort caused by 3D stereo, but it is best to do this locally, around the object the user is gazing at. The main challenge is thus to develop a gaze predictor in the demanding context of real-time, heavily task-oriented applications such as games. Our key observation is that player actions are highly correlated with the present state of a game, encoded by game variables. Based on this, we train a classifier to learn these correlations using an eye-tracker which provides the ground-truth object being looked at. The classifier is used at runtime to predict object category - and thus gaze - during game play, based on the current state of game variables. We use this prediction to propose a dynamic disparity manipulation method, which \u2026",

Spatial memory tasks are often incorporated in benchmarking processes when assessing fidelity of a VE simulation, since spatial awareness is crucial for human performance efficiency of any task that entails awareness of space.

Realistic animations were applied to the rigged 3D human model of a dance partner using Inverse Kinematics (IK). The 3D dance partner is rigged based on custom skeletons using 3D geometrical bones and IK solvers. Motion capture data were applied to the rigged 3D model to create realistic dance animations.

The proposed methodology uses the color characteristics of river flow images and provides a high correlation factor with the suspended sediment measurements. In our opinion, the importance of the current work derives from the fact that it provides an alternative and effective way of estimating SS distribution rather as opposed to the conventional method that requires human presence, especially if we consider the difficulty of taking measurements of the river pollution during flush flood events when the sediment distribution is increased and is directly related to water quality.",

The proposed serious game trains users to write G-code and set up virtual machines for completing Milling and Turning tasks, contrary to previous work mainly focusing on machining simulations. G-code is a simple and usable low-level command set for manufacturing complex objects without prior knowledge of Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) systems. The proposed CNC machining serious game can be used as a standalone introductory training application before being involved with CNC manufacturing. It contains CNC machining and G-code tutorials explaining processes without the need for a book or the assistance from a trainer. The user can select to train in turning and milling machines. The system adapts \u2026",

            "Abstract": "It is increasingly important to provide fidelity metrics for rendered images and interactive virtual environments (VEs) targeting transfer of training in real-world task situations. Computational metrics which aim to predict the degree of fidelity of a rendered image can be based on psychophysical observations. For interactive simulations, psychophysical investigations can be carried out into the degree of similarity between the original and a synthetic simulation. Psychophysics comprises a collection of methods used to conduct non-invasive experiments on humans, the purpose of which is to study mappings between events in an environment and levels of sensory responses to those events. This tutorial will present the techniques and principles towards conducting psychophysical studies, for assessing image quality as well as fidelity of a VE simulation and how results from such studies contribute to VE system design as well as to computational image quality metrics. Methods based on experiments for measuring the perceptual equivalence between a real scene and a computer simulation of the same scene will be reported. These methods are presented through the study of human vision and include using photo-realistic computer graphics to depict complex environments and works of art. In addition, physical and psychophysical fidelity issues in the assessment of virtual environments will be emphasised. Specifications for correct matching between the psychophysical characteristics of the displays and the human users' sensory and motor systems will be discussed as well as some examples of the consequences when systems fail to be physically well \u2026",

It is a real challenge to create a one-person project taking responsibility for both the artistic and programming parts respectively.The Broken Dreams concept takes place in the middle-ages in a small city which is ruled by a vicious monarch. This ruler has deprived people of their dreams and forced them to sleep forever. The only person that is still unaffected by this eternal sleep is the main character of the game. His purpose is to try and wake up the residents of this town from their sleep. There is only one way to do that. By entering people\u201f s dreams and fighting with their nightmares.",

Even many of the recently crafted digital tools fail to address the necessity for a more holistic design approach which captures the virtual and the physical, the immaterial and the material. Handling of massive chunks of information and classification and assessment of diverse data are nowadays more crucial than ever before. We see a significant potential in combining the fields of composition in music and architecture through the use of information technology. Merging the two fields has the intense potential to release new, innovative tools for urban designers.

Recent attempts to implement the latter approach are either limited to found/not found scenarios or marking of uncertain areas without any justification to the choice of colour/hue degradation etc. As a result, there is no system to represent the uncertainty involved in visualising archaeological data. The archaeologist interprets a site based on a limited amount of material remains and uses comparative evidence from other sites, written references, as well as speculation in order to create a reconstruction.

The computer graphics simulation is based on photometry data acquired in the real-world space and is displayed mainly on Head Mounted Displays utilising either monocular or stereo imagery and interaction interfaces such as either the common mouse or head tracking. 105 participants across five conditions were exposed to the real and computer graphics environment and completed a spatial memory task. Participants across conditions were monitored (using software or hardware according to condition) in terms of their navigation patterns and idle time while horizontally rotating around their viewpoint, placed in the centre of the experimental room. An overall main effect was revealed. Relevant statistical analysis showed that the amount of idle time for the participants in the HMD stereo head tracked condition was significantly higher than those in the real-world (p< 0.01) condition.",

            "Abstract": "The Herculaneum Conservation Project (HCP) is a project of the Packard Humanities Institute in collaboration with the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Pompei and the British School at Rome. The ancient Roman city of Herculaneum (Italy), which was destroyed and buried along with Pompeii by the volcanic eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79, has a history of excavation dating back to the early eighteenth century. The project arose from a recognition of the risks to the survival of the unique and irreplaceable heritage to be found in Herculaneum. Its aim is both to support the Italian heritage agency in the protection and preservation of the site, and to extend scientific understanding and public interest and awareness. The most immediate task is to halt the widespread decay afflicting the entire site. The longer-term aim is to develop a conservation strategy which will ensure its survival, understanding and enhancement. The project aspires to learn lessons that will not only feed into the management of the site of Herculaneum, but that can enrich conservation working practices in Pompeii and elsewhere. In 2006 trials were launched to see how three-dimensional laser scanning could help the project, not only in terms of documentation, but also as a tool for monitoring decay and informing conservation decisions, and as a source of rich but accurate visual material to illustrate areas of the site currently closed for conservation works and thereby enhance the visitor experience. In collaboration with the University of North Carolina, the Suburban Baths were chosen for trial survey work with a 3rdTech Inc. DeltaSphere-3000 laser scanner. This Roman bathing \u2026",

Latency discrimination was compared with results from a previous study in which only simple geometrical objects, without radiosity rendering or a'real-world'setting, were used.

            "Abstract": "Predicting visual attention can significantly improve scene design, interactivity and rendering. For example, image synthesis can be accelerated by reducing computation on non-attended scene regions; attention can also be used to improve LOD. Most previous attention models are based on low-level image features, as it is computationally and conceptually challenging to take into account highlevel factors such as scene context, topology or task. As a result, they often fail to predict saccadic targets because scene semantics strongly affect the planning and execution of fixations. In this talk, we present the first automated high level saliency predictor that incorporates the schema [Bartlett 1932] and singleton [Theeuwes and Godijn 2002] hypotheses into the Differential-Weighting Model (DWM)[Eckstein 1998]. The scene schema effect states that a scene is comprised of objects expected to be found in a specific context \u2026",

In a foveated path tracer the number of rays fired can be decreased, and thus performance can be increased. For this study, due to current hardware limitations prohibiting real-time path-tracing for multiple samples-per-pixel, we pre-render image buffers and emulate foveated rendering as a post-process by selectively blending the pre-rendered content, driven by an eye tracker capturing eye motion. We then perform three experiments to estimate conservative thresholds of eccentricity boundaries for which image manipulations are imperceptible. Contrary to \u2026",

Physical modelling techniques are used to determine which of many different types of features are visible from a complete set of viewpoints. The power of this technique lies in its ability to detect and parameterise object features, regardless of object complexity. Raytracing is used to simulate the physical process by which object features are visible so that surface properties (eg specularity, transparency) as well as object boundaries can be used in the recognition process. Using this technique occluding and non-occluding edge based features are extracted using image processing techniques and then parameterised. Features caused by specularity are also extracted and qualitative descriptions for these are defined.<>",

This includes gamified components that motivate the user to traverse the suggested interest points, as well as technically challenging outdoors augmented reality (AR) visualization features. The main focus of the AR feature is to superimpose 3D models of historical buildings in their past state onto the real world, while users walk around the Venetian part of Chania\u2019s city, exploring historical information in the form of text and images. We examined and tested registration and tracking mechanisms based on commercial AR frameworks in the challenging outdoor, sunny environment of a Mediterranean town, addressing relevant technical challenges. Upon visiting one of three significant monuments, a 3D model displaying the monument in its past state is visualized onto the mobile phone\u2019s screen at the exact location of the real-world monument, while the user is exploring the area. A location-based experience was designed and integrated into the application, enveloping the 3D model with real-world information at the same time. The users are urged to explore interest areas and unlock historical information, while earning points following a gamified experience. By combining AR technologies with location-aware and gamified elements, we aim to promote the technologically enhanced public appreciation of cultural heritage sites and showcase the cultural depth of the city of Chania.

To demonstrate the distinction between task performance-based approaches and additional human evaluation of cognitive awareness states, a photorealistic VE was created. Resulting scenes displayed on a headmounted display (HMD) with or without head tracking and desktop monitor were then compared to the real-world task situation they represented, investigating spatial memory after exposure. Participants described how they completed their spatial recollections by selecting one of four choices of awareness states after retrieval in an initial test and a retention test a week after exposure to the environment. These reflected the level of visual mental imagery involved during retrieval, the familiarity of the recollection and also included guesses, even if informed. Experimental results revealed variations in the distribution of participants\u2019 awareness states across conditions while, in certain cases, task performance failed to reveal any. Experimental conditions that incorporated head tracking were not associated with visually induced recollections. Generally, simulation of task performance does not necessarily lead to simulation of the awareness states involved when completing a memory task.

The extent to which judgments of human memory recall, memory awareness states, and presence in the physical and VE are similar provides a fidelity \u2026",

Music is shown to significantly help children maintain focused attention as well as offer a timed structure around their actions, involving melody and tempo. The advantages of music are exploited in the game, using a tin drum. This drum is used by the player to produce rhythm and it is connected to the computer via a Makey Makey board. This board sends each drum knock as a mouse click signal to the computer. Using the drum, the player tries to reproduce a given beat, and subsequently synchronize with another player, so that they cooperatively produce an expected beat. This creates a connection between the real and the virtual world of the game. In order for the hero \u2026",

In order to economize on rendering computation, selective rendering guides high level of detail to specific regions of a synthetic scene and lower quality to the remaining scene, without compromising the level of information transmitted. Scene regions that have been rendered in low and high quality can be combined to form one complete scene. Such decisions are guided by predictive attention modeling, gaze or task-based information. We propose a novel selective rendering approach which is task and gaze-independent, simulating cognitive creation of spatial hypotheses. Scene objects are rendered in varying polygon quality according to how they are associated with the context (schema) of the scene \u2026",

This work investigates whether the proposed action-based measure is affected by factors such as material and inclination of the walking surface. Experimental studies were conducted in a real environment set-up and in its virtual simulation counterpart evaluating behavioural fidelity and user performance in ecologically-valid simulations. In the real environment, the measure slightly overestimated the inclined path whereas in the virtual environment it slightly underestimated the inclined path. The results imply that the proposed slant measure is modulated by motoric caution. Since the \u201creality\u201d of the synthetic environment was relatively high, performance results should have revealed the same degree of caution as in the real world, however, that was not the case.

In this respect, the research community is challenged to investigate the factors that make such technologies effective, productive and engaging. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of augmented reality in a simple cultural heritage game, by evaluating real-time feedback from users. The game has been implemented within the ARCO (Augmented Representation of Cultural Objects) system using its flexible AR scenario authoring tools and dynamic content composition and delivery technology. The game has been presented within an Augmented Reality Interface\u2014a specialized application enabling AR on a user\u2019s computer. The ARCO system, a result of the ARCO project, allows museums to create their own virtual museum exhibitions based around a collection of cultural objects. A typical virtual museum would be composed of exhibition spaces that present these digital objects to a user, for example, on a web page, on a mobile device or in a virtual environment. A virtual museum can present these digital objects in the form of an interactive AR game or quiz. Through the use of interviews and structured questionnaires, user feedback has been collected for evaluation to enable us to improve the game characteristics, but more importantly to understand whether AR based games are educationally useful, meaningful and appealing to users.

This would ultimately indicate which areas in a VE could be rendered in lower quality without affecting information uptake. We examine whether computationally more expensive scenes of greater visual fidelity affect memory performance after exposure to immersive VEs, or whether they are merely more aesthetically pleasing than their diminished visual quality counterparts.

In particular, special attention is paid to computer visualization technologies and 3D modelling, which have an outstanding importance in the explanation and communication of heritage to a broad audience of visitors. The variety of themes presented are of equal importance, such as the documentation of heritage, the foundation of preservation and specific technologies, such as mobile computing and 3D data capture and processing. During its life, VAST has shared its goals with EPOCH, the European Network of Excellence on ICT applications to Cultural Heritage (www. epoch-net. org), and naturally became the venue for hosting the reports of the Network\u2019s activity. Since 2004, EPOCH has become the primary supporter of VAST, which also hosts the Eurographics Workshop on Graphics and Cultural Heritage since 2003.

To achieve this, it proposes an implementation of the table formalism that has recently been proposed in the literature. The proposed implementation contains original features that were evaluated by experts in web-application development, students and experts in argumentation. The main feature of the proposed system is the ability to define a default preferred option in a given scenario, thus, allowing for other options to be used in further refinements of the scenario. We followed a user-centered development process using the think aloud protocol. We evaluated the usability of the system with the System Usability Scale, validating our hypothesis that even naive users can employ it to define their decision policies.",
